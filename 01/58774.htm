<h2>            My Forza Horizon 4 keeps crashing when i play in a convoy</h2>
                    <p>Help me!</p>
<p>My game keeps crashing 10-20 min after i join a convoy with my friend and it starts getting really frustrating cause i cannot finish races in this time.</p>
<p>I have made sure that it's not a ram issue as i always empty my standby ram with RAMMAP before playing, i have also increased the paging file to 20 gb, please help me with a fix!</p>
<p>Note: I have all the latest drivers so it should'nt be a driver issue.</p>

<p><span>Hi Albin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it must be for you when you are not able to play the game.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could be because of a background application or process causing the game to crash.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, you can try the troubleshooting steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run App Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can try the troubleshooting steps from the article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform a clean boot on the computer and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>NOTE:
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Performing a clean boot will start the computer with minimal set of drivers and programs, to determine whether a background program is causing the issue. Some of the Startup programs will not
 load after performing a clean boot on the computer. However, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after finishing the troubleshooting.</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To perform a clean boot on the computer, follow the steps from the article
<span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a></span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If performing a clean boot fixes the issue then, please refer to the section
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot
</span></strong>to check which program is causing the issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, we will be glad to help you further.</span></p>

<p>Hi Nikhar!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested your methods for a few days now and they don't seem to work, the troubleshooter doesn't give a clue to the issue and when i performed a clean boot it didn't work either cause it crashed 15 minutes into my Team Adventure session with my buddies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, i have no clue as to what the problem could be and it starts getting really frustrating not getting rewards for my efforts.</p>

<p>Hi Nikhar!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now moved the game to my SSD and it seemed to run better for a couple days until now when i experienced the issue twice in 15 minutes. I checked the log and there was nothing but a Office 2016 licens error from a couple hours and a reboot before the
 crashes. It may be worth mentioning that these crashes occurred right after the Fortune Island update was downloaded to my computer. (though i've not bought nor installed the expansion pack)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad for the support you're giving me in this issue and i hope you will be able solve this case for me.</p>

Hi. I desperately need help. I've bought my son a 'paper jamz pro' karaoke microphone, which should have the facility to edit the songs on it but the driver will not work on OS later than Win7. I've tried compatibility mode etc to no avail. I cannot access
 a machine using Win7 either. Is there any way I can use this driver on Win10?</p>

            Have you tried contacting the manufacturer of this microphone and asking them if it will work on Windows 10?&nbsp; Might be that it won't work, or you need a different driver that they can supply?

    <title>Wacom Pen issues on my Asus Vivotab Note 8 with both windows 8.1 and - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wacom Pen issues on my Asus Vivotab Note 8 with both windows 8.1 and 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought a Windows tablet Asus VivoTab Note 8, it was running windows 8.1 but I wanted to upgrade to windows 10.. and here comes the disaster.. my Wacom Pen (originally built for this tablet) no longer works ! Ok it's a driver issue of course, but I installed
 almost every version of wacom drivers ever existed! Some of them didn't work at all, but the other some worked good but for a short period and then it simply disappears !! My tablet properties no longer shows "Pen and touch support with 5 touch input" it simply
 removes the word "Pen" from the description !!</p>
<p>So I tried many and many solutions and none of them were efficient :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) windows updates : took too much time with no significant fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) driver pack solution 2017 : fixed the issue but not permanently</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) TousLesDrivers.com : same thing</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Asus original drivers : only for windows 8.1 and even in 8.1 I found the same issue when I rolled back to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) "clean install" vs "win10 upgrade assistant" : no fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) troubleshooting from control panel : it never fixed any issue - ever !</p>
<p>7) device manager disabling/re-enabling wacom device driver : no fixes</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) trying to update driver from device manager : I swear it never gave me an update for wacom nor for any other driver either !! I tried to update the bios firmware with a given updated file from my documents and it says it's already up to date !! - Microsoft,
 are you serious ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) I think the tablet's battery status have an impact on reading external devices correctly - am I right ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) the last thing I did was to force the wacom pen driver service to restart when any failure comes up with it once twice and forever ! This actually fixed my issue but I don't think this is the ideal solution because maybe it will be laggy when inking
 with the pen..</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last question, if I install Android instead of Windows on my tablet, will the stylus work on it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried these solutions on both windows 10 and windows 8.1 with the same results ! Knowing that both of them were originally licenced and not cracked. Any advices or help ? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello and thank you for your reply,</p>
<p>Actually I'm running windows 8.1 and I have already applied every single update available for both 8.1 and 10 !&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have another issue now concerning Microsoft account on the same tablet.. it says "sorry, we couldn't connect to Microsoft services right now. If this problem persists, search for 'network problems' on the Start screen".. of course I tried that with
 no point as usual.. no problem fixing through the troubleshooter.. I tried almost everything on the internet on this concern too. Is there some other way that I didn't try ?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Vista Driver for CRT monitor</h2>
                    I have installed Vista home premium on a computer which had Windows 2000. However it sees the monitor as a 640x480. I can't find Vista drivers at the IMB/Lenovo site. I have a IMB E74 6332 and a G78&nbsp;6627-OAS screen and looking for a driver for either.
 17" 1024x768 resolution. Is there a way I can get Vista to recognise this screen?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            You need drivers for your video card, not your monitor. The drivers for your video card would be in Lenovo's website for your specific model machine. If there are no drivers, then you should not have updated from Win2k to Vista. Revert the machine to the
 operating system for which it was designed. It is unlikely that a computer designed for Win2k will run Vista satisfactorily anyway.<br />

            Hi Estaban,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Assuming you bought an upgrade Pack on SP4,
<br />
<br />It entirely depends on what kind of license is Windows 10 Pro.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you bought 99USD Upgrade pack from Home, I am afraid it is not transferrable. 
<br />However, if you bought full 199$ license from the Store, it can be transferred to another computer.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick reply.&nbsp; The Surface Pro 4 came preinstalled with Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I did not purchase it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So What I have concluded is I will have to purchase the Windows 10 Pro (upgrade) for the new Surface Pro 6?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the registered (by serial number) ISO's for both Surfaces.&nbsp; Can these not be re-reinstalled on Pro's I mentioned?&nbsp; ISO from SP4 reinstalled on SP6 and SP6 ISO reinstalled on SP4?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I barely use the SP4 and was trying to save the $99.00 fee</p>

            It can come with Pro I think-I am exactly not sure, to be honest. In that case, as preinstalled licenses cannot be transferred, you would have to purchase Windows 10 Pro upgrade pack for SP6.

<p>Hello John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files being lost after an update may be caused by you're signed in with a temporary profile or the files are moved to Windows.old folder. We recommend that you follow the methods below to retrieve your files:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> See if you're signed in with a temporary profile</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> then <strong>Accounts</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Sync your settings</strong> on the left pane.</li><li>Check if you see a message at the top that states <strong>You are logged on with a temporary profile. Roaming options are currently unavailable</strong>, if yes; Restart your computer then sign in again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>We can't sign into your account. This problem can often be fixed by signing out of your account and then signing back in.</strong> can also be address by restarting your PC and signing in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should back up everything you worked on since upgrading to an external drive, or it'll be deleted when you sign out of the temporary account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the search box on the taskbar and search for your files. If you don’t see them and you’re not signed in with a temporary profile, use the troubleshooter to fix problems with Search. In the search box on the taskbar, type
<strong>indexing</strong>, and then select <strong>Indexing Options</strong>. Select the
<strong>Advanced Administrator</strong> icon button to view more options, then select the
<strong>Troubleshoot search and indexing</strong> link and follow the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>More things to try:</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some files might be hidden from view. In the search box, enter <strong>Show hidden files and folders</strong>. Under
<strong>Hidden files and folders</strong>, select <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>. Then try searching for your files again.</li><li>Look for all files of a certain type using the asterisk (*). For example, to search for all Word documents, search for *<strong>.doc</strong>. For music files, search for *<strong>.mp3</strong>.</li><li>When you upgraded to Windows 10, some of your files may have been moved. To check the location of files you find, press and hold (or right-click) the file and select
<strong>Open file location</strong>. Copy any files you want to move to a different location.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>Search for Windows.old folder</p>

<p>Oh my GOD what on earth is happening!!! On&nbsp; Saturday January 6, 2017 in the evening I was working on my&nbsp; computer and automated Windows 10 updates started with a warning that this may take a while and the computer might start several times please do not
 shut your computer. I decided to go to bed and let Windows do its own thing. On Sunday morning when I&nbsp; went to see it the updates completed, to my surprise my computer was cleaned out like new. All those document on my desktop were no longer there as well
 as the third part programs icons(Anaconda, python, Oracle Virtual Box, pictures, my lecture videos, you name it ) I panicked, I saw 6 Windows.old folders and looked in the and they were all empty.I could not believe Windows can do this . I started seeking
 for help on MS websites and&nbsp; on two occasions online assistants based in SE Asia remoted into my computer and they told me what I did not want to hear that there is no data on my computer!!!! I asked where did the updates take my data to and their answer was
 updates are not supposed to to delete data. The referred me to a local Microsoft Store to look at my computer and the store agent told me the same thing that the data was not on my computer and they do not do data recovery and I better contact a data recovery
 company called Seagate at my cost. I told my cowokers this they told me if I was using Linux that would not have happened. I have not used any operating System in my life but Windows. I asked the agent if each update type has no its (Reverse Type) to undo
 what it did and the answer was I have never heard that. MY Question is. Why does Microsoft push automated updates that wipe clients data and they cannot reverse what the updates have done? I am confused and&nbsp; cannot believe this. If there are GURUs there your
 help on this is required</p>

<p>Check using File Explorer for any user name folders that are similar to your usual sign-in name. Expand This PC and then expand C:, expand the Users folder and look in the individual folder names listed for common default folders. (Desktop, Documents etc.)</p>
<p>If you want to try it go to Settings &gt; Update and security select View installed update history and there should be an option to Roll back to the previous build. (if you have just updated)</p>
<p>Although this is after the event:</p>
<p>Always keep a second backup copy of important files.</p>
<p>Don't keep files on your desktop. Use the default folders Documents, Videos etc. and use shortcuts on the desktop to those file locations.</p>

            There is zero excuse for an autoupdate deleting everything on a computer. None.&nbsp; I had already backed up everything because I knew about the garbage that Microsoft always pulls...&nbsp; But I never would have thought they'd go this far.&nbsp; Inexcusable. If I tried
 to run the family business this way we would go bankrupt in a month.

<p>My machine ran an update last night while I was out, when I got home fired up the machine and it was almost reset to factory level, all documents, i music, photographs, videos have all been erased. I have tried using recovery software but they are nowhere
 to be found on the hard drive. I should NOT have to back up my files everyday due to the risk of Microsoft's arrogance to force updates which appear to be containing malicious capabilities.&nbsp; I am terrified to turn on my laptop as that contains a LOT of very
 sensitive design data, what if they have all been erased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft, what have you done, why did you allow this update to contain such capabilities, and what are you going to do to enable me to recover my files. This problem is most clearly of your making, you take my money, I use the service, you cannot allow
 your system to wreck peoples lives at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: The contents of the Windows.old file has also been erased, any more great advice you would like to share with us???</p>

<h2>            SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED &#40;NETwbw02.sys&#41; occasional BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently encountered a BSOD with the following error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED (NETwbw02.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One monitor showed the checking system dialoge that said something like "We are gathering information and then we will restart" or something like that. Once it reached 100%, the computer did not restart, forcing me to perform a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have kernal memory dump enabled, but I located my memory dump folder and I uploaded it to my OneDrive folder below.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I noticed several other minidump files in that folder, not just the one from today (03012015). I saw some related posts that mentioned it was due to sleep/hibernation issues, but did not find any useful fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me solve my problem and let me know if you need any more information.</p>

            <p>There are a couple of third party drivers referenced in these crashes, namely,
<strong>VBoxNetFlt&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>NETwbw02.sys,</strong> but there is a a conflict happening between AVAST and MBAM, that is likely the true cause of these crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please uninstall both AVAST and MBAM, and replace them by turning on Windows defender, then reinstall MBAM (free)&nbsp;as a backup, second opinion scanner, if you wish. Make sure MBAM is without the active monitoring portion of the program, so as to avoid any
 further conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;After taking the steps above, uninstall and reinstall V-BOX AND Intel® Wireless WiFi Link Driver - Intel® Wireless WiFi Link Adapter drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi there, thank you for the feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Method but it did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to Method 2, I bought the Laptop with Windows 8 per-installed, thus no DVD with software.&nbsp; I have contacted the distributor of the computer (Samsung) but the first response was to procure a new version of Windows 8.1 and as they put it, the
 Windows 8 Single Language that was installed, although Genuine is a "freebie" and therefore they cannot provide the DVD.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft as well and there response was also to buy a new license.&nbsp; I cannot fully utilse this issue as the update seems
 to be 'corrupt'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the Proxy setting was set to auto detect Proxy settings.&nbsp; I have turned it off and some of the patches did install.&nbsp; However, most of the patches do not install and the same issue occur, Trying to Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still doing trouble shooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

<h2>            Spinning blue circle and typing lag</h2>
                    I get a spinning blue circle and it becomes difficult to type, there is a time lag between typing and the letter appearing and sometimes I have to use more force than necessary to type a letter if the letter types at all. This usually happens when I am
 trying to post a comment on one of MSN's articles, so I'm assuming this problem and MSN are somehow connected. Anyone else experiencing this?

 am mostly online. I just stopped typing this and&nbsp;went to an MSN article to type a comment to see if it would happen &nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;am experiencing the lagging issue but the&nbsp;spinning circle is not there. Something else to consider but I'm not sure if this has anything
 to do with it but when I sign into another site such as ABC to post a comment this never happens but I sign in to that site using my email address but when posting on MSN I sign in using Facebook whether that is a factor I don't know.&nbsp;This has been happening
 ever since I began using Microsoft Edge, I don't remember having this issue when I was using IE.&nbsp; Thank you for responding.
</p>

            After some experimentation the spinning blue circle and the lag in typing seems to be exclusive to MSN related articles. I haven't experienced this issue on articles from other sources.

    <title>ARC Channel Support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> medflight team  say:</h3>
<h2>            ARC Channel Support</h2>
                    
<p>We have Panasonic 3D TV, Panasonic 7.1 Surround Sound system, and Xbox One Elite.</p>

<p>On our old Xbox 360 we had it connected to the HDMI1 (Game) on the TV and that allowed the sound to pass back thru the HDMI2 (the ARC channel) back down to the surround sound system and we had full stereo. With the XB1 doing this reduced the sound down to
 just old 2 channel and sounds much worse in games. I noticed people had asked about this same issue last year and was told that Xbox was aware of the issue and was working to bring the XB1 up to speed with the XB360.</p>
<p>So we was forced to have the XB1 connected to the HDMI2 input on the surround sound system, and the HDMI(ARC) out going up to the TV and this gives us full 7.1 digital surround sound but that is now how Panasonic recommends it be connected to minimize the
 possibility of any video lag in multiplayer games like CoD.</p>

<p>Since a tech here said they was aware of it last year (and now even had newer models of the XB1 like the Elite released) and was working on it, does anyone know if they have done that yet?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>We would like to go back to connecting it the way Panasonic recommends (it's a plasma screen rated for game playing) but don't want to mess around with moving the cables around back behind everything if we're only going to end up finding that they haven't
 fixed this issue yet.</p>

<p>The tv cable should actually be plugged into the ARC port in the back of the receiver. That's how I have it on mine and then my cable box is plugged into my xbox one's hdmi passthrough then my xbox one and ps4 each plugged into a hdmi port on the back of
 my receiver and it sounds great! Try the way I have mine to see if it corrects the problem</p>

<p>The TV cable is plugged into the ARC port on the back of the receiver now, that's what I described as how we have it now. But Panasonic said for maximum reduction in possible video lag caused by going thru the receiver before getting to the TV they say to
 plug game consoles direct to the TV on the HDMI port marked (Game). And we don't like our Satellite plugged into the Xbox because then you have to have the Xbox turned on in order to watch the TV which just burns extra energy for no reason.
</p>
<p>Unless they have fixed it recently the the Pass-through on the XB1 does not work when we tried it in the past and the XB1 had to be turned on in order to watch TV but that's silly to make you have to run your XB1 for hours and hours if all your doing is
 watching TV (and certainly don't like the XB1's TV feature when it's on anyway). Having to have the XB1 turned on is just burning energy and adding wear and tear to your XB1 to have it on when watching TV. We ONLY want to have to turn on the XB1 if we're actually
 playing games or doing something specific to the XB1.</p>

<p>Your totally correct that a family who is going to have a night of nothing but watching TV it is senseless and power-wasting to need to have the XB1 turned on to do that. In this modern save-the-planet society it's amazing they want you to have to leave
 something powered on burning energy when you don't need it. When it's been awhile since any new games they like have been released (or their just temporarily burned out on games) families sometimes go weeks without playing games or doing anything that requires
 the XB1 to actually be turned on, but they do still watch TV for hours each day. So why would you want to have to have the XB1 powered on just to do that? &nbsp;Your burning extra energy to power the XB1, your burning extra energy to run the house AC to cool that
 extra heat (small but it's there) that the XB1 generates when its on, and your putting un-needed wear and tear on the XB1 itself just by having it run all those hours when your not actually using it for anything. All just to get a TV signal to go through it.
 And who wants to have to deal with the extra steps of having to pull out an XB1 controller to snap to the TV mode each time you turn on your AV system just to watch TV.
</p>
<p>Unless they have patched it in a firmware update the XBox One does NOT have Passthrough. They advertise that it does but that's false. &nbsp;Been in electronics engineering, computers, and A/V systems my whole life and true HDMI passthrough is defined as something
 that allows a signal to passthrough it uninterrupted and unmodified even when the device (that it's passing through) is turned totally off so that if it has a failure, looses power, or is intentionally left off any signals can still passthrough it and on to
 other devices. When we first got our XB1 and it said it had passthrough I plugged it in that way and it did not work, I called XB1 tech support and they kept saying it has passthrough BUT the XB1 has to be turned totally ON and you have to snap to the TV window,
 it won't even work if the XB1 is off and you have it set to the quick-start mode. That is NOT passthrough, they apparently are choosing to call it whatever they want but they're false advertising and causing confusion with customers who don't know the true
 definition of how real passthrough works. </p>
<p>Now I have a Panasonic receiver for example that has a passthrough port, on it and in the menu you can set the unit to NO PASSTHROUGH meaning it never passes the signal through unless it's totally on (like the XB1 actually is) or to Passthrough but notes
 the receivers power settings must be set to the "quick on" setting. No it still wont passthrough when the receiver is totally off AND it's not set to the quick-on mode but it will still passthrough when it's off as long as the receiver is in quick on mode.
 It uses a little more power (like 2 watts) more if it's in quick on mode but much less than if you actually turn it totally on and you still don't have to have it turned on so for all practical purposes it's still a form of true passthrough, but the XB1 doesn't
 do this either (again, unless they have patched it via firmware update in the past couple of months).
</p>
<p>They really need to either quit falsely advertising that the XB1 has passthrough OR they need to update it so that it WILL pass the signal through even when the XB1 is turned off, it's OK if it has to be set to quick on mode for it to work, at least that
 would be acceptable and only add a couple of extra watts of energy usage.</p>

<p>Yes even CNN's weekly "New Tech" show called Microsoft out on the false advertising that the XB1 had "pass-through" when it didn't back when it came out. CNN didn't count it as being pass-through either since the unit has to be totally on for it to work.</p>
<p>We would love to hook ours up that way to save having to switch inputs on the Surround Sound receiver if the XB1 worked that way but the last time we tested it back last fall when we upgraded from our original XB1 500Gb to the XB1 Elite 1000Gb it still did
 not pass-through so we don't (and wont) have it hooked up that way until they fix that so it will pass-through the HDMI signal when the XB1 is off, or at least in low-power standby.

<p>That doesn't change our problem though which is the audio quality if we hook the XB1 direct to the GAME port on the TV.</p>
<p>Our Panasonic 60" 3D plasma TV says it's designed for gamers. The ports on the back are marked as follows;</p>
<p>HDMI-1</p>
<p>HDMI-2 (ARC) </p>
<p>HDMI-3 </p>
<p>HDMI-4 (GAME)</p>
<p>Oh, and I incorrectly said the game port was HDMI-1 in my original post, I forgot which was which. I knew it was at one end of the row.
</p>
<p>Anyway the TV manual says "Plug a gaming console into the HDMI-4 (GAME) port and select GAME CONSOLE as the input device type in the TV's menu that this TV is designed to switch off all extra processing singing the signal virtually direct to the screen,
 combined with a 240Hz signal rate this provides monitor-like speeds with only 12ms of video lag in a massive 60" 3D true-glass plazma screen for a truly immersive gaming experience.
</p>
<p>And it is! :D &nbsp;Games like COD rock on our TV!</p>
<p>The problem is the manual also says that if you are using a receiver that you should connect your game console direct to the TV's GAME port and an ARC certified cable from the TV's ARC port to the ARC port on a receiver. This allows the TV to pass the sound
 signal back to the receiver via the ARC channel. While going through a receiver first will NOT increase the TV's video lag, many receivers themselves will add anywhere from 2 to as much as 16 frames of input lag as they pass the video signal through them before
 the signal ever gets to the TV.</p>
<p>On our XBox 360S we was able to hook it up in the way Panasonic recommends and was getting Dolby 5.1 digital at the receiver (I don't think the XB360 could do 7.1) but on both of the XB1's we have had all that we end up with at the receiver is 2 channel
 stereo. Our girls friend brought over a Play Station 4 the other day and we tested it and was getting 7.1 Digital Surround Sound. So since the XB360 was working with Dolby 5.1 and the neighbors PS4 is working with Dolby 7.1 we know that the issue is with the
 Xbox One and not our system. So to get Dolby 7.1 from our Xbox One we have had to go from the XB1 to the Receiver and then from the Receiver to the TV, this gives us great 7.1 sound but now we're concerned that we're getting lag from the Receiver as mentioned
 in the TV's instructions. </p>
<p>Back in January an XB1 tech said they knew about the issue and was working on a fix, but have they fixed it yet? Our entertainment system is large and somewhat self-enclosed in a cabinet so I don't want to go to a lot of trouble to get back there to swap
 cables around only to find that they still have not fixed the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know if they have or not?</p>

<p>My setup for 5.1 and no lag: &nbsp;</p>
<p>XboxOne HDMI to "Game" port on receiver</p>
<p>From receiver "Video Out" (HDMI) to ARC on TV.</p>
<p>I had major lag until I went into the xbox audio settings, and unchecked "Allow 24Hz"....or whatever boxes, and set the Xbox to 5.1 with no compression.</p>
<p>On the receiver, I adjusted the sound delay a bit. I also run the receiver in PCM which gives me no audio compression, and a nice rich 5.1 sound.

<p>We have our audio set to "HDMI Audio 7.1 Uncompressed", our system is 7.1 and sounds great just worried about the lag caused by going through a receiver like the Panasonic manual recommended against because some receivers can add a few frames of lag. We
 also have Optical Audio OFF and the Bitstream Format is set grayed out. </p>
<p>The 24Hz is under Video settings not Audio settings and kinda surprised that would create lag in a multiplayer game, it shouldn't affect a game at all or at least that's what I would have thought.</p>

<p>Don't worry about any video lag. Any delay caused by going through the receiver would literally be in the 5 ms range. Alternatively, instead of using the ARC, you could use an optical audio cable from the TV to the receiver, or from the Xbox directly into
 the receiver. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My receiver is not HDCP 2.2 compliant, so to get HDR from my Xbox One S, I currently have the Xbox plugged into the HDMI port on the TV, and an optical cable running from my Xbox to my receiver.</p>

<p>5ms is a lot in many FPS multiplayer games like the CoD series. In fact 5ms would be a 20% increase over the normal lag rating our internet has so 20% seems like it would be noticeable.</p>
<p>Thanks, though we tried an optical cable but couldn't get 7.1 out of it, only 5.1 out of the Xbox One, unless they have patched that since then.</p>

<p>The only way to get sound out is hdmi or Spdif. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If your devices can't accept hdmi it's likely that it accepts Spdif. My system is over 10 years old and it works just fine using 5.1 DTS via Spdif.

            <p>Hello Jade_E, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your printer will be compatible with your Surface RT&nbsp;when HP develops and releases a RT driver for the&nbsp;HP Photosmart C4580.&nbsp;Let's hope it's soon. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried any of the other HP drivers when you install this printer on the Surface? Because these drivers are generic, one of the other HP drivers might work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find a driver that works, please let us know which driver it is. Thanks!</p>

<p>Removing and replacing the hard drive voids your warranty. It is probably do able but it would be tricky to do. The hard drive is internal and requires opening up the case to do so.</p>

<p>For the price of buying the newer console or voiding warranty you can buy any USB 3.0 external HDD up to 16tb. You could add 2-3 TB of storage for very little. $130 AUD will buy a 2TB external here.</p>

<p>I can see why people would prefer an internal option to external.</p>
<p>Space could be an issue, you've now got to find room for an extra device somewhere near your console, and an extra power socket if you choose to go the powered external route.</p>
<p>It could also be simple bull headedness. "Microsoft sold me an all in one device, why do I need stuff outside it."</p>

<p>There are plenty off large enough BUS powered drives that can sit on top of X1 or behind it with no problem. Also means no reinstalling of games digital or disc and mobility with your games if you choose to take then to another console. Even 1TB internal
 will eventually be not enough.</p>

<p>[quote user="WizardFlipper"]Hi I understand this year Sep,Oct,Nov ? there is new Xbox One coming out with&nbsp; 1TB Hard Drive for new Call Of Duty and Sunset Drive etc ?[/quote]You misunderstand.</p>
<p>The Sunset Overdrive white console includes a 500GB HDD and a digital copy of Sunset Overdrive. It does not include Kinect. It's priced at $399 USD.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty Advanced Warfare console includes a 1TB HDD and a digital copy of Advanced Warfare. It does not include Kinect. It's priced at $499 USD.</p>
<p>You can buy a USB 3.0 500GB 2.5" portable HDD for $50, or a 1TB model for $60-$70. Why would you spend $500 on a Kinect-less Xbox One kit just to get $50-$70 more in HDD space?</p>

<p>While it is madness (imho) that this console was released with only a 500gb drive, I think it is equally crazy to upgrade your current one for the 1 TB version. &nbsp;Certainly a person could find room to install an external drive now that the option exists.
 &nbsp;I think that option would make the most sense too and you can go well beyond 1 TB as well.</p>
<p>Forgive my spelling too, however, I am half asleep still! :)</p>

<p>You should have room on top of your Xbox for the vents to breath anyway, so put it on the side that has no vents, or at the back near the power, not to mention it's USB so is only limited by length of cable. The "can't find room" argument is pathetic.</p>
<p>I think its worth mentioning you can have multiple drives plugged in at the same time, and more with games on not plugged in, will be a huge bonus 5 years from now when you have movies, music and games on several external devices and not limited to one internal
 disk.</p>

<h2>            Writing Pad&#47;Virtual Keyboard Constantly Popping Up &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Surface Pro 3 that I just upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; My issue is that since the upgrade my Surface has my virtual keyboard (or writing pad) popping up constantly with each text field I select REGARDLESS of the fact I have my hard keyboard
 cover attached.&nbsp; Now as soon as I start typing on my hard keyboard the virtual keyboard disappears, but if I'm on a webpage with a lot of text field this I'm seeing this box pop up 20 times or more.&nbsp; This wasn't happening on Windows 8.&nbsp; How do I configure
 my Surface so that it knows when my keyboard is attached, thus disabling the virtual keyboard?&nbsp; I've looked through all the settings and simply can't find it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

</p><p>Sorry to hear that you are having trouble with the onscreen keyboard on Surface Pro 3 after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go through Cover troubleshooting <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-surface-keyboards?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a> to start.</p>
<p>Is this happening across all apps and browsers?</p>
<p>When did this first start?</p>
<p>Are you getting any error messages or codes?</p>
<p>Does a restart help, even temporarily?</p>

            <p>Hello John1F,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through your troubleshooting guide you sent, but the issue isn't with my type cover being detected as I can still use the cover.&nbsp;As soon as I type&nbsp;on my hard keyboard, the virtual one disappears, but it&nbsp;pops up again in the next field I select.&nbsp;
 Let&nbsp;me answers you questions in order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes this is happening in all apps and browsers, as well as the Windows Explorer and search fields.</p>
<p>This began happening as soon as I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I'm not getting any error messages or codes.</p>
<p>I've power down and restarted, but I can't clear the issue.&nbsp; I will say that sometimes, intermittently the problem disappears, then reappears again once I power up my surface.</p>

<p>Did you use Windows update to upgrade from fully updated Windows&nbsp;8.1 to Windows 10?&nbsp; Did you use a different method, such as a clean install?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Depending on how you "select" the next field I think that what you are describing&nbsp;may be&nbsp;normal and "by design".&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I can see the TK in Handwriting mode if I tap with a pen but see the TK in Standard keyboard mode if I&nbsp;tap with a finger.&nbsp; So, if you
 don't want to see any TK at all you may have to use your keyboard or mouse to set focus to the next input field.&nbsp; E.g. what happens if you use Tab instead of tap or click to get there?</p>

            <p>Hi Robert.</p>
<p>I have the same problem, using a Surface Pro 3 and Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Answering the questions you asked Wessley:</p>
<p>* This problem happens in browsers, but only in some fields. It also happens in Office and other apps.</p>
<p>* It only happens when clicking in a text field or area with the active stylus, not when using the cover touchpad, my finger or when tabbing to the field.</p>
<p>* I upgraded from Windows 8.1 using the Windows update upgrade option when the final release became available.</p>
<p>All updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the stylus to more accurately click on fields or buttons. When doing this to get into text fields, the on-screen keyboard pops up. Why!! I have the Surface keyboard cover connected (and being used to type with) and Windows 10 is not in tablet mode.
 I don't want the onscreen keyboard. The onscreen keyboard is much slower to type on (I touch type) and it obscures large portions of the screen, typically right next to the area I'm working in.</p>
<p>This didn't happen with Windows 8.1 installed. With 8.1, when the cover was folded back or disconnected, only then would the Surface switch to tablet mode and the onscreen keyboard appear for text fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't agree that this is 'by design', or it shouldn't be. If so, why did this change with Windows 10? It's really irritating. On some apps, a lot of the content is hidden and the apps often resize when the onscreen keyboard appears. There is no option
 to turn it off either.</p>
<p>I wouldn't connect an external keyboard if I wanted to use the onscreen keyboard. Please fix this.</p>
<p>Windows 10 looked pretty good early on, but this and a few other issues make me want to switch back to Windows 8.1 more.</p>
<p>

            <p>Note, I'm using a Surface Pro 3. The pen apparently differs from the Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I can't find your suggested minimise option. The keyboard isn't visible except for the TK button in the tooltray. When clicking in a text area though, the handwriting keyboard almost always appears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't a minimise option that I can find, only a close and a dock button. If I close the OSK / TK, it simply reappears next time I click somewhere in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Correct. Stylus is a generic name.</p>
<p>The Surface Pro 3 pen is an active capacitive pen or "digitiser" (/digitizer) allowing it pressure sensitivity, vs the passive capacitive pens used on other devices to replace the touch / no-touch finger equivalent.</p>

            <p>Thanks Robert. That helped. The keyboard I was trying to minimise was the Windows 10 keyboard in the tooltray area. OSK.exe keyboard allows you to minimise it, a good workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Microsoft fixes the issue. It was fine without this workaround in 8.1</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth not working after win update, no answer here thus far helpful.</h2>
                    First and foremost, Hi and please help.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After Windows update my bluetooth bttray icon is no longer visible on start bar. The bttray.exe is still running in processes.</div>
<div>I have,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Tried various restore points, to no avail.</div>
<div>2. Been through services.msc and made the settings Start and automatic, also to no avail.</div>
<div>3. Tried finding bluetooth drivers updates to reinstall over existing but will not get past a certain point when it tries to find my device.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is no trace of bluetooth existing in device manager or control panel to change any settings and none can be changed on the 'Hardware and Sound' right click menu option either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been trying to fix this for hours now and i'm about to explode. What annoys me the most is, After a Windows Update it has done this, and it's a bloody Microsoft Bluetooth mouse!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Need help, Thanks in advance.</div>

            <div>Hi Gerry,</div>
<div>The System Restore point(s) that I tried were previous to the Windows Update, but from the same date as I try to create restore points religiously before updating, installing, etc.</div>
<div>There were 3 restore points so I tried them all with no success. They all loaded fine, but the bttray icon never displayed again &nbsp;in my taskbar even though it was still running as a process. My mouse and all other BT devices stopped working also.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have not tried Safe mode, as the system boots fine, just no Bluetooth. Should I be trying something in safe mode first?</div>
<div><br />

            I right clicked the System folder in the Windows logs/event viewer and selected Save All Events As. I hope this is the complete file. Is this the correct way to do so?
<div><br />
<div>The system has always run Windows 7, it was only after an update yesterday through windows that the bluetooth stopped. The bluetooth mouse has been connected for 18 months previous without a hitch. I run cCleaner regularly, ADWCleaner has been run also,
 and I installed MalwareBytes and ran that also which showed nothing but a few registry problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded and installed Windows 7 upgrade advisor and ran that. The log file is on my Skydrive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The event viewer file is Sys2.evtx and the Win update advisor is WinUpgAdv</div>

<br />
<br />Another HP owner said they  fixed it by updating or re-installing the "Intel Intergrated Sensor" driver availiable from HP's website here <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>. Just go to the drivers download page for your model, download and install it.  If no newer driver, then in Device Manager locate the driver, right click to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />While at it I'd also update all other newer drivers from the HP Support Downloads webpage for your exact model or Serial Number on Sticker from PC.  
<br />
<br />Try also the fix for SDJL in this thread:
<br /><a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Re-keyboard-in-tablet-mode-Spectre/td-p/5693302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Right click on Start Menu does not work</h2>
                    <p>This right click issue appears ongoing and well known. My question is does Microsoft have the fix? I don't have the expertise to fix a problem with their software and when searching, I see the answer coming from everyone (exaggeration) else but them. I'm
 tired of looking.</p>

                    Can't seem to discover why windows 10 is randomly going into the multi workspace view of the desktop.&nbsp; Only ever one window in use. Anyone seen this behaviour and know what causes it?

<p>Hi SWinstanley <br />
<br />
On your Taskbar, click the button indicated in the image below, is that resulting screen the one that is randomly popping up?
<br />
<br />
If so: <br />
<br />
Open the Settings App <br />
<br />
Go to Privacy - Activity History <br />
<br />
Untick 'Let Windows collect my activities from this PC' <br />
<br />
Untick 'Let Windows sync my activities from this PC to the cloud' <br />
<br />
Turn off 'Show activities from accounts' <br />
<br />
Then click 'Clear' to wipe any data already collected <br />
<br />
That's It! </p>

    <title>Does the boxed copy of Windows 10 allow multiple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elite2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does the boxed copy of Windows 10 allow multiple installs&#47;activations&#63;</h2>
                    I bought the boxed copy of Windows 10, the full version on the USB stick, not OEM. I was wondering if I was allowed to install it on two different hard drives, I keep getting 2 different answers of just one computer, and the other being up to 3 computers.
 My Windows 10 that I got just isn't working properly on my old hard drive, no matter how many fixes I try, so I want to buy a brand new hard drive to start from scratch with it and I'd prefer not having to pay for Windows a second time.

<p>The answer is just one computer <strong><em>at any one time.&nbsp; </em></strong>I would be surprised if it does not say 1 PC on the box, somewhere.&nbsp; There is no problem under any circumstances if you replace the hard drive.</p>

Airplane mode </a>or is it turned on without your information?</li><li>Have you <span>tried uninstalling </span>and re-installing the wireless drivers?</li></ol>
<p>In case you do not know how to uninstall and re-install the drivers for the Wireless card, try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Go to device manager.</span></p>

<p><span>e.&nbsp;If you’re sure you want to delete the driver click <strong><span>OK.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you want the driver completely removed from the computer check “<strong><span>Delete the driver software for this device.”</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The <strong><span>Delete the driver software for this device</span></strong> option removes the package from the driver store.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can also first download the latest wireless card drivers from the <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manufacturer's website </a>and save it in the computer. Once you delete the driver you can restart the computer and install the drivers.</span></p>

<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the left pane, tap or click <strong>Wireless</strong>.</span></p>

<strong>Wireless devices</strong> are on.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, check the current connections: </span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Settings charm by swiping in from the right or pointing the mouse to the lower-right corner of the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Tap or click the networking icon, indicated by either a monitor with a network cable (for a wired connection) or a set of five stepped bars (for a wireless connection).</span></p>
