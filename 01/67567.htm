    <title>Is Realtek HD Audio card sending 5.1 surround through the optical - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is Realtek HD Audio card sending 5.1 surround through the optical output&#63;</h2>
                    I have a dell XPS 8500&nbsp;Desktop&nbsp;with Realtek HD Audio card. I have Logitech Z906 Surround Speakers connected optically, but when playing HD 5.1&nbsp;video from Netflix, the Logitech speaker controller does not auto-detect the DTS signal. Is there a way to look
 at the configuration of the optical output of the computer&nbsp;to see if it is set for DTS or&nbsp;Dolby Digital&nbsp;instead of stereo to the optical output? I can get surround from Netflix through my Blue Ray player to my home theater receiver using HDMI cabling, so I
 know the source IS in surround. Or does the video card in the XPS computer not decode 5.1 and send it to the audio card?

Hi, I am having this same issue.&nbsp; Have you figured this out?&nbsp; I have been thinking of either buying a 3rd party card or hooking up 3.5-to-RCA cables for each set of speaker (Fr, Rear, Ctr, Sub), but I would hate to do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Dell is sending a repair technician out this week to address this issue.&nbsp; So far, they are going to replace the video card and then try to get 5.1 from NetFlix to play through the speakers.&nbsp; We know that playing a DVD will send 5.1 through the optical
 output to the speakers, so the audio card is NOT the problem.&nbsp; I will let you know how this works out next week.<br />

<p>Hi SusanBarutt:</p>

</p><p>Please see the Lifewire article <em><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/using-touchscreen-surface-windows-tablet-3507000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make the Most of the Touchscreen on Surface or Windows 8.1 Tablet</a></em>.&nbsp; Tip #1 of that article to
 tap and hold (i.e., place your finger on the screen for a second or so; remove your finger and a right click action will be performed) might solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, please let us know your operating system and whether you still have an original Surface Pro or purchased a newer model like a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; One of your previous posts indicated you had upgraded your Surface Pro to Win 8.1 but your
 question was posted in the Windows Vista board.<br />

    <title>Windows 8 pro upgrade - question about reinstalling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> francis-b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 pro upgrade - question about reinstalling</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running Windows 8 (Standard Edition) - this was pre-installed on my computer, and as such the product key is stored on my BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be running Windows 8 Pro. However before I spend $200 I want to know exactly how the upgrade system works - the rest of the internet is very unclear on this. I have the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I purchase a Windows 8 Pro upgrade from the Microsoft Store (Search &gt;&gt; Add Features &gt;&gt; Buy Product Key Online), and then later I want to do a clean reinstall on Windows 8 pro, can I install Windows 8 Pro or do I have to install Windows 8 and then upgrade
 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I have to upgrade again can I use the "I already have a product key" option in "Add Features" and use the product key I purchased?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If I go out to a retailer and purchase Windows 8 Pro and do a clean install will it install to Windows 8 Pro or will I have to use "Add Features"? If I have to use "Add Features", will the product key that comes with my Windows 8 Pro that I purchased
 from the retailer work if I select "I already have a product key"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) If I want to upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro in what order do I have to upgrade? Is it Windows 8 &gt;&gt; Windows 8 Pro &gt;&gt; Windows 8.1 Pro OR Windows 8 &gt;&gt; Windows 8.1 &gt;&gt; Windows 8.1 Pro?<em> (Please do not link me to the FAQ section, I have been there and could
 not find the answer. If you are going to provide an answer from this section please rephrase it otherwise I will have to ask you to clarify.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Is there a way I can save the Windows 8.1/Windows 8.1 Pro upgrade files so that I don't have to download them again if I clean install my OS? If so, how do I do this.</p>

<li>You will have to install Windows 8 and upgrade to Pro again.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Yes you sure can. That code will work for you forever. Just keep it in a safe place (I keep all my product keys in OneNote, but you can also store them as text files on OneDrive or another safe place).<br />
<br />
</li><li>The product key from the full package will work there as well.<br />
<br />
</li><li>You cannot jump directly from Windows 8 &gt;&gt; Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; You'd have to either A) download the 8.1 update before typing the 8.1 Pro key, or B) get a Pro 8.0 key and use it, then upgrade to 8.1.<br />
<br />
</li><li>There's really no files actually.&nbsp; Every version of Windows has everything, all the code does is unlocks it for use.&nbsp; This is new beginning with Vista, which is why the "Add features to Windows" (formerly known as "AnyTime Upgrade" is there.<br />
<br />
But you could always take your computer, upgrade it/update it to 8.1 Pro as you have, then make a system image backup so you can always go right back to exactly that point without any hassle.&nbsp; Bonus, this backup can even include all your installed programs,
 settings, and personalization.</li></ol>

One reason companies use proxy servers is that doing so helps them save precious bandwidth. Proxy servers can compress traffic, cache files and web pages from the Internet, and even strip ads from websites before they reach your computer. This allows companies
 to save bandwidth, especially when they have hundreds or thousands of employees accessing mostly the same popular websites.&nbsp;Other benefits include improved security and privacy.</p>

            Hi Liz
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />A proxy  is an intermediary between your Windows 10 PC or device and the Internet. This server makes requests to websites, servers, and services on the Internet for you. 
<br />
<br />Its more necessary in an organization with large networks of computers. 
<br />
<br />For home use, there might be use cases, but not for a standalone computer.
<br />
<br />Are you getting an error message?
<br />

<h2>            Windows update ran into a problem.</h2>
                    Soon after the windows 10 update rolled around I decided to update my main windows 8.1 pro system to it. After numerous attempts at installing the update I keep getting the same error codes; WindowsUpdate_C1900204 OR WindowsUpdate_dt000. Thank you and
 I hope that we can find the answer to this annoying bug on my system.&nbsp;

            Try running disk cleanup, or manually delete temp files (all) then reboot, before trying again<br />
PS It isnt neccessary to update drivers unless something isnt working or a later driver gives added functionality, with drivers, if it aint broke, dont fix it.

<p>
</p><p>Sign into his account at account.microsoft.com/family if there is no other family members then he is an adult in his own family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign into his account on the xbox console go into settings and under the account tab go to family settings and go down to manage family members and it will tell you if there are any family members in the family there.</p>

<p>Hello Thicks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue concerning finding a way to create content restrictions on your child's account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you follow what Nestor suggested, the system allows you to create an account, and then add a child account to that so that an automatic family is created therefore allowing you access to content restrictions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the current account he has, it would be best to gain control of what email they use for that account and what the password is for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this out and let us know how this goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<h2>            OneDrive syncing desktop files, turned them into .lnk files that no longer work</h2>
                    <p>I have a client whom we set up OneDrive for on his old computer. We set it so his desktop files would sync to OneDrive. We then replaced his old computer with a new one. All of his old files appeared on his new desktop as expected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't until 3 months later it was discovered that these "files" are not actually files, they are shortcut .lnk links. Weirdly, the shortcut address is the file on the desktop itself, which is where the file is/was supposed to be. But these shortcuts
 cannot be opened, and say that the address they are pointing to is invalid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are .lnk shortcuts both on his physical computer and in OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck happened? Is there anything we can do to fix these files, or are the original files gone forever?</p>

<h2>            How can I stop windows re-positioning to other display after wakeup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have connected to my GeForce&nbsp; GTX 780 three displays:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. 3440x1440 monitor (Display Port) - main display</p>
<p>2. 2560x1080 monitor (DVI)</p>
<p>3. 1920x1080 TV (HDMI)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power &amp; Sleep settings Screen is set to turn screen off after 10 minutes.</p>
<p>After wake up all windows and apps are moved to the TV which is my third display.</p>
<p>It is really annoying to move everything back on my default screen especially if TV is located in other part of the room (I am using it mostly for watching movies)
</p>
<p>It seams that TV is waking up first and that's why all windows are moved on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have latest drivers for GeForce installed. I tried using Display Fusion but it didn't solve the issue. (There is a script for DF that saves opened windows position and than restores it but it requires using hot-key action, I would like to keep system as
 clean as possible without installing 3rd party products as Display Fusion)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent this re-positioning windows and apps after wake up using some software solution?</p>
<p>I am running Windows 10 Pro now but I had this problem also with Windows 7.<br />

</p><p>From the description, it appears that you have an issue with the settings of the displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said that you had this problem in Windows 7 too so, I still suggest you to download the drivers from the manufacturer's website and then try to install it in&nbsp;compatibility mode an check if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on&nbsp;<strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Click on the&nbsp;<strong>‘compatibility’</strong>&nbsp;tab and check the box&nbsp;<strong>"Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>” and select Windows 8.1 operating system from the drop down.</span></li><li>
<span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>‘Apply’</strong>&nbsp;and click&nbsp;<strong>‘OK’</strong>&nbsp;and run the file to install it.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Anil,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your quick response.<br />
I tried suggested procedure but without any luck.<br />
<br />
My driver was originally installed thru Nvidia Experience manager so I downloaded latest driver:<br />
(355.98-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql) and tried to install it manually.<br />
First of all there is no option for compatibility mode Windows 8.1 (only Windows 8)<br />
I have selected Windows 8 and started installation however NVIDIA Installer cannot continue;<br />
it says: This Nvidia graphics driver is not compatible with this version of Windows.</p>
<p>I have unchecked compatibility option and the driver installed properly - performing "clean installation".</p>
<p>Windows still re-positions after wake up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

            <p>I have a feeling that it may have a bit more to do with you running multiple monitors at different resolutions. If they were all 1080p it may cause less of an issue, but given it is a mix, I think Windows has a bit of a spastic attack trying to deal with
 it for some reason, at least it did with mine before I updated the other two monitors to 2560x1440 to try and avoid it. That removed most of the issues.<br />
<br />
The last time I tried to do that I had a fair few issues although I still experience the same annoyance of W10 shifting all of my open programs to the left hand display (also the primary display) after waking from an extended sleep period (10hrs+).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a registry hack, modifying the the 00 and 01 strings, specifically PrimSurfacex and another to modify the simulated resolutions, I can't quite remember the specifics but a quick search should take care of it.<br />

<p>I had a similar issue with the following setup:</p>
<p>Primary monitor: Philips BDM4350UC connected via DP</p>
<p>Secondary monitor: Philips BDM4065UC connected via HDMI</p>
<p>Nvidia 680 graphics card,</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>After sleep, even only after using Win+L and waiting a couple of minutes, all windows were moved to the primary screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution that works for me is to go into each monitors factory menu (Push menu button away from the power button when turning the power on), and disable "EDIO WP" and "AutoSource". Turn off monitors and shut down computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From other forums I have read that for other monitor brands the choice that does the trick can be to disable "Deep Sleep" or enable "Always On".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone finds this helpful! Took me a full day to sort out.</p>

            Bluetooth operates in the FM band at 2400MHz and higher to a certain point. &nbsp;This does not mean it can receive radio stations because it is a FM Radio Controller (frequency range is too high, plus you have no tuner).
<div><br />
<div>To learn more about Bluetooth, go here:&nbsp;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your old phone had an actual FM receiver which can use the same antenna in the phone. &nbsp;Electronically, it is possible though and you need a tuner for a lower frequency range of radio stations in the FM band.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your alternative is Internet Radio which is actually pretty good.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since you have a Pro, they do make TV/Radio tuner adapters for computers. &nbsp;The Windows Media Center is compatible with some of those units and you can look into WMC at Microsoft for more information and a compatibility list of supported devices. &nbsp;The adapter
 will plug into your USB port and work from there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WiFi also operates at a completely different band range as well. &nbsp;You can read more about both at the above web link.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do watch out for the adapters you get though! &nbsp;A lot of the TV/Radio tuner adapters on the market are JUNK! &nbsp;Most don't work. &nbsp;Check for a compatibility list before buying one.</div>

                    <p>No matter what I do, I cannot get WMP to play the songs in the order I list.&nbsp;&nbsp; it seems to be "shuffling" but there is no option to get the songs to play in order. I tried creating a playlist , and then moving&nbsp; it to Play, but after the first song it just
 moves several songs down and starts playing that. I am really frustrated by this as I want to crate a burn list in the order I desire.</p>

            &nbsp;
<p>Hi Nedraebs48,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your question to the answers.microsoft.com communities forum;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds as if you are experiencing an issue with corrupted files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I would start out doing is general troubleshooting for startup issues- although you are just starting Windows Media some of these steps should be included in your troubleshooting of this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the link for the troubleshooting steps<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Walk through all 7 but I am going to emphasize the last four steps listed for troubleshooting your issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please place the information found in the forum if you need further assistance in identifying what the cause might be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Step 4: Check for performance warnings</p>
<p>Frequently, Windows Vista can automatically detect any issues that are related to performance and can make recommendations about how to troubleshoot these problems. When this happens, a
 warning is displayed in Control Panel. To access these warnings, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
<br />
, right-click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Computer</span><span> and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Properties</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Experience Index</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Tools</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>In the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Tools</span><span> window, click the performance-related links to examine
 detailed information about the computer.</span> </li></ol>
<p>After you click the links in the
 continues to occur, go to the next troubleshooting step.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Back to the top</span></a></p>
<p>
Step 5: Start the computer in safe mode</p>
<p>When you start the computer in safe made, you can determine whether the cause of the startup-related performance issue is related to a background service or to a driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start in safe mode, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></li><li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
<br />
, click the arrow next to the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Lock</span><span> button, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Restart</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts.
<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span><span> You have to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you must try to restart your computer.
 To do this, wait until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shut down and restart your computer.
</span></li><li>
<span>On the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Boot Options</span><span> screen, use the arrow keys to select the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Safe Mode</span><span> option, and then press ENTER.
</span></li><li>
<span>Log on to your computer by using a user account that has administrator rights.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>If the problem continues after you start the computer in safe mode, the problem may occur for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>There is a problem with underpowered or faulty hardware.
</span></li><li>
<span>There is a problem with a driver that is installed.
</span></li><li>
<span>There is a problem with an operating system component.
</span></li></ul>
<p>If you can verify that the problem continues to occur when you start the computer in safe mode, go to step 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem does not occur when you start the computer in safe mode, go to step 6.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Back to the top</span></a></p>
<p>
Step 6: Perform clean-boot troubleshooting</p>
<p>If you verify that the performance issue does not occur in safe mode, start Windows Vista in a clean-boot environment to determine the programs or the services that are causing the issue.
 This process will systematically eliminate any of the third-party services or applications that are running on Windows Vista that could potentially be the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about how to perform clean-boot troubleshooting in Windows Vista, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>929135</span></a><span>&nbsp; How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista
</span></p>
<p>If the performance problem continues after you perform clean-boot troubleshooting, go to the next troubleshooting step.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950684#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Back to the top</span></a></p>
<p>
Step 7: Check the Reliability Monitor</p>
<p>When you troubleshoot a performance issue, it is important to determine whether the problem always occurred after you installed Windows Vista or if the problem began sometime after you
 installed Windows Vista. You must clarify this before you continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Windows Vista was performing acceptably after it was installed, and the startup performance problem only began to occur sometime after Windows Vista was performing acceptably, you can
 use the Reliability Monitor tool that is included with Windows Vista. This tool lets you examine the events that occurred around the time that the problem began so that you can determine any relationship between the event and the issue. To do this, you must
 first determine approximately when the issue began to occur. When you determine the approximate time, you can examine the events that occurred around that</p>
<p>time.</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
After reinstall OS you should install all driver as well<br />
Go to dell support website and install Webcam driver<br />
For CD need to update firmware.Check in BIOS whether DVD is detecting<br />

                    I got a Microsoft Tech to help me this morning set up my external hard drive to back up my computer. I run Windows 10. &nbsp; I just now noticed it says, back up and restore Winows 7.&nbsp; I don't want Windows 7.&nbsp; Surely this does not change my system back to that

            Hi Roy, Microsoft never changed the name to Windows 10 on that applet in the Control Panel. It will work on Windows 10 and will not revert your system

            <p>Nice to know that the support engineer does NO research before replying with ZERO useful info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Xbox One Fight stick from Mad Catz do not work on Windows..... Really?&nbsp; You can get them to work but the RT and LT buttons do not work.&nbsp; It might be because Windows expects them to be triggers and not buttons but that explanation
 CAN'T be correct because these sticks work perfectly fine on the Xbox One, which basically runs a version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't Microsoft fix their drivers for us loyal customers can get our peripherals to work on both systems.&nbsp; I would think this might be a problem with just Mad Catz but all Xbox One Fight Sticks are like this even though they are basically just controllers.&nbsp;
 These are licensed to be used but Microsoft does not care enough to get them to work on Windows 10 even though they want more people t play games on it, they even say we can play our Xbox One game son it.&nbsp; Maybe all games except our fighting games which the
 expensive controllers we bought they don't want to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been a year and we are still waiting.&nbsp; The pathetic thing in that an Xbox 360 fight still will work.&nbsp; Sigh... Microsoft....</p>

            <p>So still no word on the blog... also since we were told by a Microsoft representative that the drivers would be included in the Windows 10 Anniversary update and it didn't happen as of yet. Is there an ETA?? Any support at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why bring a game to pc, if you don't even support your own licensed products in that game. No just people buy stuff licensed by your competitors, PS4 sticks which DO work without any hassle, drivers from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, please show some support for your products, for once.</p>

            Hello Mr. Microsoft Engineer. I just purchased a 200 fightstick to use on my PC, I decided on the Atrox by Razer because I do plan on purchasing the Xbox One X and I figure this is a future proof purchase. Come to find out that years have gone by and Microsoft
 has not even bothered to add compatibility to major manufacturer peripherals that are Microsoft certified for us PC users. I simply cannot believe there is no update on this issue at all. Can you please let us know why is this being completely ignored? Why
 the 360 version was fully supported on PC and the Xbox One version isn't?<br />

                    <p>After upgrading my computer to windows 10 my screen stayed at a black screen for a while, I figured it was because my computer was still upgrading but that wasn't the case. I went ahead and restarted my computer and it showed the windows 10 logo for a while
 but then it turned black. I can't log in or even see a mouse cursor. At the dell screen it gives me F2 set up and F12 boot options. When I do F12 boot options it finds an error in hard drive. Please help I don't know what to do and I don't know much about
 computers I need to fix this problem asap<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e819cb6-74a4-4994-adb5-9987756b5d4c" /></p>

            &nbsp;If you upgrade to windows 10 and only get a black screen ... &nbsp;I had three computers with this issue and spent 5 hours on it including 1 hour with Microsoft. They accidently fixed it enough for me to figure out the real problem. Windows 10 was treating
 our single screen computers as if they had dual monitors - the black screen was the other monitor. So ultimately, we were eventually able to right click on the screen and bring up display settings and delete the extra (nonexistant monitor). Our dual monitor
 computer also had a similiar problem reading three screens instead of two and again we went into the display settings and deleted the "nonexistent monitor" &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;if you mouse is not showing on the black screen try scrolling right or left the length of a "monitor"

            <p>I took the plunge so I'm in the same state. The Windows 10 installation completed through to 100% and then it went through the upgrade to 100%, displayed the comforting page that I should expect a few reboots to complete the install and to "Sit back and
 relax". After the first reboot the PC came up with black screens on both my monitors and a cursor that will move between the two screens although they are in the reverse order to what they actually are. It sat like this for hours until I rebooted with great
 trepidation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can boot in any mode (safe, safe with networking.....) I just get the same black screen with cursor. I have disconnected all devices and reduced my monitors to 1&nbsp;using the VGA cable on my monitor. Nothing seems to help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea how to recover from Windows 10 other than to rebuild my PC back to Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

 just black. no cursor, nothing. So (foolishly or not) I restarted the computer using the power button. It now will restart, show the square windows10 logo and say please wait before blinking and then going to a blank/black screen where i have no response at
 all from any command. I have tried a second screen. I have managed to get in via safemode with networking but for some reason i cannot get connected to the net properly to run windows update and search for any available patches. Where can we find help for
 this?<br />

            <p>I noticed that my graphics card has a HDMI interface so as a last resort I borrowed a HDMI to VGA converter, plugged it into another screen and low and behold there was my Windows 10 configuration screens. So, Windows 10 will assume that all graphics card
 interfaces are being used and assume that the HDMI interface is the primary and only display on that one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OMG - I have wasted hours with this.&nbsp;Please check all display interfaces as it will be the one you&nbsp;will need if you don't see anything except a mouse cursor on a black screen.</p>

            <p>I have managed to get my computer running - sort of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 driver (sandybridge) seems corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installed TeamViewer on my machine and was able to login via that. Using device manager I was able to uninstall the driver that had a Code 43 error on it and then I downloaded the Intel driver as per the suggestions here: https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/53e9decd-0870-4a26-a6c1-a2e526de65b6/intel-hd-graphics-30002000-sandybridge-windows-10-graphics-driver-support-?forum=WinPreview2014Setup
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has not fully resolved my issue as I am still unable to use my second monitor (via VGA)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully there are enough Sandybridge users out there that Intel do a patch shortly.</p>

</p><blockquote>&nbsp;If you upgrade to windows 10 and only get a black screen ... &nbsp;I had three computers with this issue and spent 5 hours on it including 1 hour with Microsoft. They accidently fixed it enough for me to figure out the real problem.
 Windows 10 was treating our single screen computers as if they had dual monitors - the black screen was the other monitor. So ultimately, we were eventually able to right click on the screen and bring up display settings and delete the extra (nonexistant monitor).
 Our dual monitor computer also had a similiar problem reading three screens instead of two and again we went into the display settings and deleted the "nonexistent monitor" &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;if you mouse is not showing on the black screen try scrolling right or left the length of a "monitor"
</blockquote>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and started having problems right from the start. First, I had a blue screen but was eventually able to resolve that problem. Then, I noticed that the Weather app in the start screen had Washington, DC instead of my home town. I
 successfully changed that but it later reverted to the old ways and I was unable to change it or even get a settings option shown on the Weather app screen. That screen was only in view for about 2 seconds and then disappeared. Then, the worst occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had booted up my PC 2 days ago and I got the login screen within seconds but after I typed in my password, it typically took 20 - 30 minutes before Windows 10 would finally show my personal screen, or any screen at all. It was in this mode 2 days ago when
 we were going out and I decided to shut it down and leave before it finished. Now, here's the situation and it's in a vicious loop that I can't escape. Here's the sequence: It boots up and appears to complete POST and immediately goes to a black screen. I've
 let it sit there for as long as 2 hours with no apparent resolution or change. Whether I shut off my PC or press Ctrl-Alt-Delete, I get the same result, it boots and immediately goes to a black screen. I've tried to press F2 to go to my BIOS screen but it
 won't even let me do that. It just goes to a black screen and there's no other action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running Win 7x64 Pro and would happily welcome the opportunity to return to that old somewhat "reliable" OS. I seriously regret upgrading to Win 10 and I am sorry I did this. I have recommended it to some friends and co-workers but will retract my
 recommendations. I regret doing the upgrade. </p>

            Hi guys I also sat with the problem, "black screen" after updating my intel HD graphic driver, after playing around the following solved my problem. (1) plug a extended screen into your laptop, you will notice that you can now see your display on your
 extended screen (laptop still black screen) (2) Open your device manager, go to your DISPLAY Adapter, open, you will see Intel (R) HD Graphics ....right click then disable........close all then reboot from your extended screen. Unplug extended when laptop
 is off, your laptop should now reboot normally. Hope it works for you...
