    <title>What does Error Code 80240020 mean for Win10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What does Error Code 80240020 mean for Win10 update</h2>
                    <p>Firstly my computer is a simple straight forward Win7/64 bit...fully updated....no abnormal hardware or software and the Win10 compatibility tester says all is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win update reports it has failed 9 times today with E/C 80240020 trying to automatically install Win 10 (all automatic starts by windows update with no manual intervention). I spent an hour online with support to no avail...except they cleared the update
 history??? &nbsp;I cannot find a meaning for that E/C anywhere. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the update is "dormant" with no activity at all and the $Windows.BT directory is stuck at 140Mb with no download progress. Support were less than helpful in the end stating that the .BT dir has to be about 3gig (why tell me that when all this has been
 automatic so far I don't know). And why has it reported the installs have failed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway getting to the bottom of e/c 80240020 might be a clue.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the patient type....I did nothing to pre-empt/encourage/initiate the updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you leave something automated, as I did, and you get a heap of unexplained and unexpected errors you get concerned that something
<strong>is</strong> wrong....as I was. All I needed was support to tell me this or some form of notification that interim errors are expected and all would be fine. My concern was that, in the total silence surrounding the errors, something was indeed wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is NOT one of those occasions to blame impatience on the part of the users.</strong> It was merely seeking some clarification, in the void of silence, that there was NOT a problem. I was/am happy to wait as long as it takes....I was just bombarded
 with unexplained error messages, thats all, and needed to ensure that no REAL problem existed.</p>

            <p>Hey Oldbugga,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an expected error message if the upgrade requires customer user action. For example, the message may be present if one or more applications or disk utilities that need to be uninstalled before upgrading. PCs seeing this error message will get instructions
 on how to fix this when they perform the upgrade. &nbsp;We recommend waiting until your PC receives a notification to upgrade and then following the instructions provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this adds clarification that this is Not a problem. &nbsp;Windows 10 is worth the wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Charles</p>

            <p>Again thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;In this case there was no request for client action...the update just terminated and disappeared without notice other than appearing as failed in windows update. I can understand if it was something I had not done but that was not indicated in this case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway am happy to "wait it out" now that I am aware that in this case a failed update is not actually a failed update???? Intuitive??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be awful for the support staff at the moment. I wish them all well and trust they have patience too. I fear they will need it more than we clients.</p>

<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/3eyrre/fix_for_the_80240020_error_when_trying_to_install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/3eyrre/fix_for_the_80240020_error_when_trying_to_install/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What this error means is, your Windows 10 installation folder is unfinished and/or corrupted. Now, how do you fix that?</span><br />
<span>1. Go into "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>delete everything</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>in that folder.</span><br />
<span>2. Now, run the command prompt as an administrator. Type in "wuauclt.exe /updatenow".</span><br />
<span>3. Go to your Control Panel &gt; Windows Update and your Windows 10 should start re-downloading from scratch, hopefully without flaws this time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>See how it goes.</span></p>

            <p>I got the same error but will wait and see what happens. </p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ago I reinstalled W8 with all its updates, and then w8.1 with ALL its updates. I had W10 reserved.</p>
<p>This morning, I checked for the W10 update, it failed twice with the Code 80240020. No information or hints what is happening. It also appears that lots of users have this issue. I checked for solutions and found the same everywhere: delete the folder c:\Windows\SoftwareDistribition\Download,
 and then enter the command wuauclt.exe /updatenow.</p>
<p>Reaction: in same cases the download and installation worked, in others it does not. Why is this so????</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I read all the publications by MS etc., it was said that the download and installation shall go very smoothly. NOT FOE ME AND MANY OTHERS IT SEEMS. Has MS failed again its users? What is wrong in your business Mr. Nadella. Are you the same as Mr. Ballmer?
 Can MS not get it right first time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure it is not my PC or w8.1 because I did a clean installation not long ago to have my PC ready for W10!</p>

<h2>            Recover Deleted Mailbox on SBS2011</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A user has been deleted incorrectly from the SBS2011 Console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We re-created the user so we could re-connect a disconnected mailbox to his account, but he never showed up in disconnected mailboxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have rebooted the server, run Clean-Mailboxdatabase, but the user still does NOT show up in disconnected mailbox state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read on a forum that SBS2011 deletes the mailbox perminantly if deleted from the SBS2011 Console.. Is this correct ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way apart from a restore that a Deleted Mailbox can be recovered in SBS2011 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><span><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>-----------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong>What is this forum for?<br />
</strong><span>-------------------------<br />
</span>This forum exists to address questions and inquiries regarding Xbox One enforcement actions. If you have received an account suspension, forced Gamertag change, feature revocation, Xbox One console ban, or other enforcement action, and you are unsure
 why, please create a post and describe the situation in as much detail as possible.&nbsp;<strong><span>Please keep in mind that this forum exists to inquire about enforcement actions, and not to debate their validity or attempt an appeal</span>.&nbsp;</strong><strong><span><br />
-------------------------<br />
</span></strong><span><strong>Please note:</strong></span>&nbsp;The Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team does not address billing suspensions/cancellations. If you have experienced a billing issue, please contact Xbox Support.</p>
<p><span>-----------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Why can't I post?<br />
<span>-------------------------<br />
</span></strong></span>If your account has been suspended, you will need to&nbsp;use a different&nbsp;Xbox Live account&nbsp;in order to post in this forum and access other sections of Xbox.com. If you do not own a second account, you may create a new Xbox Live&nbsp;Free account.&nbsp;<strong>DO
 NOT</strong>&nbsp;create an account with a Gamertag that is offensive or derogatory in any way. Creating an account with an offensive Gamertag or using the new account to violate the Code of Conduct can result in additional enforcement actions.</p>
<p><span>-------------------------------</span></p>
<p><strong>Why isn't my post showing up?<br />
<span>-------------------------<br />
</span></strong>This is a moderated forum.&nbsp;This means that each post is subject to moderator action before being approved for public viewing. We understand that you are anxious to receive a reply, but when posting please keep the following in mind:</p>
<p><span>-------------------------</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Please refrain from making multiple posts regarding the same inquiry.</b>&nbsp;The Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team&nbsp;addresses each and every post, but it is not instantaneous. Due to the volume of inquiries that we receive it may take up to 24 hours before
 you receive a reply. We ask that you remain patient. If you don't see your post show up right away there is no need to keep submitting the question; you will be answered as quickly as possible.
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;--------------------------</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep your e-mail up-to-date!</b>&nbsp;When an enforcement action is taken, information is immediately sent to the&nbsp;Microsoft Account&nbsp;e-mail associated with your Gamertag. Similarly, many forum inquiries are responded to via e-mail rather than public post.
 This may be done for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the nature of the enforcement, respect for&nbsp;your privacy and protection of personal data, and to mitigate possible harassment. If you no longer have access to the email account associated
 with your Microsoft Account, you may not receive our replies and other correspondence from Microsoft. If you find yourself in this situation, we highly suggest updating your Microsoft Account so that you can receive our replies, along with other important
 updates and information. </li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;----------------------</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><b>Check your private messages!</b>&nbsp;In certain cases, forum inquiries may be responded to via forum private message. This may be done for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the nature of the enforcement, respect for&nbsp;your privacy and
 protection of personal data, and to mitigate possible harassment. If you receive a response via private message and still have questions,&nbsp;<span>please create a new thread</span>. To check your private messages, go&nbsp;</span>here<span>.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;----------------------------</span></p>
<p><b>I was suspended from just one&nbsp;game. Why?<br />
<span>-------------------------<br />
</span></b>Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement is responsible for service-wide enforcement of the Code of Conduct. We do not issue title-specific suspensions, and cannot provide additional details about such actions. If you have been suspended from a specific game,
 please contact the title's developer or publisher for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p><span>----------------------------</span></p>
<p><b>My account was compromised or outside my control when it was banned!<br />
<span>-------------------------<br />
</span></b>If you feel the&nbsp;actions that led to the enforcement action occurred while&nbsp;your account was compromised or not in your possession, you may open an ‘Unauthorized Access’ case by contacting your local Xbox Support number. While we work directly with
 Support during their investigation, please note that they will make all further contact with you regarding the details and results of their proceedings. We will be unable to assist you in this process.<br />
<span>&nbsp;----------------------------------</span><br />
Be aware that this process may lock your account for several days, during which time you will be unable to access Xbox Live.&nbsp;Additionally, until such time as the Unauthorized Access claim is substantiated, any account suspensions will stand as issued.&nbsp;They
 will contact us directly with their findings.<br />
<span>-------------------------<br />
</span><span><strong>Please note</strong>: A substantiated Unauthorized Access case does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;necessarily mean the enforcement action will be
</span><span>reversed or lifted. Suspensions are not&nbsp;necessarily issued immediately, and may have been issued for actions that occurred while the account was under control of the owner.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            IMPORTANT&#58; Xbox One &#47; Microsoft Store not working. &#40;Version 2.0&#41;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><strong>Wauw, I am a bit stumbled. U guys deleted my thread? While I was just stating facts. This is absurd. Are u keeping it on the 'down-low' or something what the heck is this $#%*...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear fellow gamers,<br />
<br />
The past 5 days now Xbox seems to have a ('mayor') problem with the Microsoft Store. What started as a little outage for a few players that weren't able to purchase downloadable content, is turning out into something desperate for a fix. I am reading this all
 over the web but not in a combined effort to let them know what is up.<br />
<br />
As soon as u need to update a game or app&nbsp;(even when the content is free). U will not be able to download it from the Microsoft Store. Therefore your game wil not start and u are not able to play the game u so love to play (which at first is 'okay' but after
 5 days it's getting quite annoying..).<br />
<br />
Error-code log: 0x80270300 &amp; 0x80072f8f<br />
<br />
The error-codes mentioned are related for them turning of the switch at their end (I would think). Unfortunately because they are looking into this problem for a few players they maybe are unaware that they are affecting thousands and perhaps millions of players.<br />
<br />
@xboxsupport please look into the possibilties to not affect other players while u are fixing a problem for a select group, why not troubleshoot the problem in those single cases and isolate instead of turning off Microsoft Store for simple standard and free
 updates.<br />
<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks Stuart for your reply, and yes me and many others are aware of that service alert for 5 days now. And no not really I think, atleast I dont think they are aware of what they are affecting. If this is a known issue since 22/06. The last few days even
 free content as a simple needed game update are not downloadable. Which before those 5 days there was no problem. And if there was a known problem since 22/06 for purchasing content for a select few, why is this affecting the whole Xbox-community now?<br />
<br />
If I am talking about do they know what they are affecting? Game developers might sew because they are missing revenue because of these outages and players are getting triggerhappy about maybe switching consoles. Also think about new releases that are set and
 are falling in a window of outages, this will never end good. They desperately need to isolate these known issues and leave the Microsoft Store running. U can not turn of the heart where the data comes from, do u guys understand that?<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove your profiles and then after they have been removed, power cycle your console by holding the power button on your console for a full 10 seconds.</p>
<p><br />
Wait a minute then turn it back on. Then re-add your profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link below explains how to remove and add profiles.</p>

<p>I do agree, if these outages occurred since 22/06 there is basically a lot of damage to the service,&nbsp;and&nbsp;if I recall&nbsp;I think we payed good money for a service like this&nbsp;to work properly. We are talking about millions of dollars here. But last time I posted
 something about we should collectively sue them for these missed days of a working service and they took down my thread, but for real there should be some kind of compensation through Gold or Gamepass-services. And I think they just not like harsh words for
 serious flaws which u seriously&nbsp;can not have for so long.. It's more so upsetting that mainly we are just left in the dark and are patiently asked to wait it out. Which is just not cool.. Informing your players should be top priority and at every level they
 should know what is up, and&nbsp;I see too many different answers from moderators/ xbox support(s)&nbsp;on the same issues. I really hope u guys inventarise the Gold and Microsoft Store issues and let the players that can be helped actually recieve the correct information.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Razer synapse and steam isn&#39;t working</h2>
                    Ever since the update to build 1803 I haven't been able to get steam open correctly and install games to even play games. Also origin app I can't even install without crashing, and razer synapse won't open up without getting a error message of mscorlib.dll.
 I've reinstalled windows to previous versions but for some reason it doesn't work still. This is a custom build and I've never had a problem with it until April 2018. So it's really frustrating going months with a 3,000$ computer and can't even get to use
 it. Is there anyone else that is having a problem with it also?&nbsp;

</p><p>I installed recently the update from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I installed the update, afterwards my laptop was running very slow, having black screen errors or black outs after some time. In this situation nothing helped but reiniciating the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 10 to 15 times of reiniciating the laptop, windows asked to rearranged (I do not remember the specific name) in orde to improve the performance of my laptop. It even asked if I waned to delete all my personal files, which I declined. So windows starte
 to reinstall windows 10 and it cleared all my laptop. </p>
<p>It erased All my softwares, except for 2 softwares related to music editing, including my original Microsoft Office 2010 !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to request Microsoft the way to get my office back without getting charged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advice on this topic either technical or administrative in order to get in touch with Microsoft.</p>

            <p>I am having a very similar problem. I udated to windows 10&nbsp; via the free trial, but it messed up my wifi adaptor, so when I finally got that fixed and had decided to revert back to windows 8 I had missed the 1 month deadline by a few days. The only option
 to get my laptop to function better was to update the system. I opted to keep all my files as well, which seemed to be intact, except&nbsp;today I needed to use my Mircrosoft Office, which I paid for and have had prior to upgrading to windows 10. I updated the
 windows 10 on Sunday Night, and&nbsp;now Tuesday morning I realize&nbsp;it is now missing and I can only open my documents in WordPad!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading to Windows 10 has turned out to be a complete disaster. With terrible wifi, and&nbsp;all of my Microsoft Office Programs all gone,&nbsp;I can't use my PC for work or fun. I'm lucky to have wifi as we speak!</p>

            Your programs (Software) aren't personal files, which only means user data, so I'm afraid the Windows re-installation did do exactly what you opted to do. Just reinstall your software and you'll be back to normal. The plus side is that you'll have a much
 cleaner systems after the clean install; and you've got to look for the positives at this stage;)

            <p>Hello Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to answer all your questions, but my concern is realy, how am I going to get my Windows Office back, if the cd's aren't available for me right now??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answers:</p>
<p>1) I reserved Windows 10 through my Windows icon on the task bar.</p>
<p>An then installed as the instructions told.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I am not sure if I get to use "<span>media creation tool"</span></p>
<p><span>3) I basicaly erased all my softwares: Matlab, CATIA V5, Skype, Mozilla Firefox, Adobe Acrobat, etc</span></p>
<p><span>4) Yes all files are on my laptop.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope you can improve the service and by the way help me to get microsoft office back.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you in advance,</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the joke, but some softwares are not that easy to be installed. If you know what Matlab or Catia are (supposung you are an Engineer) you would know this software are probably the most expensive ones you can possible fine.

<p>But well you are right at least at one thing, the laptop runs very smoothly. </p>

            hi I have a similar problem, I have a windows surface 7 and it gave me the option to upgrade to windows 10, once I upgraded I went to use my Microsoft office word program and it wasn't there. I just bought this and to be completely honest I don't know
 how to check to see if it is anywhere else.

<h2>            Can&#39;t open certain folders&#47;apps in Windows 10</h2>
                    The upgrade on my desktop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 went ok, but now I cannot get into at least two apps.&nbsp; When I try to access the clock, it appears for a flash of a second, then disappears.&nbsp; When I try to open my photos folder, it opens for about
 one second and it too disappears.&nbsp; I have tried opening an individual photo but it too disappears after one second or so.&nbsp; There may be other apps on my computer that are affected in this way, but these are the only two I have found so far.&nbsp; Any ideas on what
 may be wrong and how to fix it?

            I tried the recommendations but I still had the problem. &nbsp;The issue with the photos seems to have resolved itself, however, when I try to access the clock feature in apps, the clock flashes on the screen for a moment then disappears. &nbsp;The other three features:
 the alarm, stop watch and timer all work as they are supposed to.

            In addition to the clock, today I discovered that when I tried to import some photos from my camera, the screen that allows you to pick how you want the download to happen appeared for a second and it disappeared as did the others already mentioned. &nbsp;The
 photos issues reappeared today as well.

<h3> ditimmins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pictures will only save as PNG, used to save in their own formats but it changed. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I used to ba able to save pictures from the internet by R-click, and the box would come up with the picture's title or code in the save box and the format, usually JPRG, PNG or GIF. Something changed about 6 weeks ago and now every picture comes through
 as Untitled PNG. This means I have to save everything in Paint then convert to JPEG (with loss of quality, resizing problems, etc) and of course&nbsp;I can't save GIFs at all with Paint.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to be able to manipulate, resize etc for my work and it's a major problem. I think I must have accidentally clicked something to change the format but I don't know what. I'm too nervous to follow the instructions given on an advice page about pictures
 coming through as Bitmaps as that's not the same thing, and I'm terrified of losing all my picture libraries as that's my work. I'm rather hoping someone will say, "Oh, you just need to click on..." I'm getting desperate, even my computer technician can't
 help as he says he's not familiar with the picture libraries on my package - I'm on Windows 7 Home Premium and IE 9.</p>

    <title>Getting BSOD on Windows 10 very often - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niclasaarestrup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting BSOD on Windows 10 very often</h2>
                    <p>So I am getting the dreaded BSOD on my quite new computer all the time. It can be when trying to import 360 videos, when exiting a newer game or using an office program (word, excel etc).
</p>
<p>I have done tests on my RAM, which found no errors. I have also run the sfc check which also didn't find any errors. I have had a look at the minidump file but that didn't really help me at all (maybe I just can't get my head around all the info in it).
 I have updated all drivers and Windows is also updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware is:</p>
<p>MSI B350M Pro Gaming MoBo</p>
<p>AMD Ryzen 5 1500X CPU</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX 1050 GPU</p>
<p>8 GB RAM, DDR4 2666.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone would have a look at the Windows dump file it's here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ak_sOAI4s8ook6AKDpDLEB5D-rfTfQ</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated since I really seem to just be banging my head against a wall at this point and on the brink of just throwing the whole thing out the window and digging out my Mac again.</p>

<p>Okay. Here's the System log generated using that method (was generated on a system with the locale set to DA-dk though): https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ak_sOAI4s8ook6AmXrDdguDdP7mReg</p>

</p><p>There would seem to have been one log generated when the system crashed during reboot. A SrtTrail but all seems well within that, except for a single line with an error mentioned (the log is in Danish so have tried translating the words);</p>

<p>Used DDU to uninstall, downloaded latest drivers from NVidia, installed and worked and BOOM got the BSOD again :'-(</p>
<p>It did look like Windows had installed some drivers before the NVidia drivers had finished downloading, as the desktop had changed from a resolution that distorted my background image and back to the normal resolution though. Could that be the issue and
 if so how can I avoid Windows doing that?</p>

            No real help in Dump files. I am pretty sure it is a hardware error.
<br />As you said you did a memory test, which tool did you use?
<br />Windows Memory diagnostic or memtest86?

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Wi-Fi no longer connects after November update</h2>
                    After installing the November update to Windows 10, my Surface Pro 3 can longer connect via Wi-Fi. It sees the networks and the settings page says "Connected, secured" but there is no connectivity, via Edge or any other application. Airplane mode is off,
 Wi-Fi is on, and I've reset the wireless modem. I've never had a problem like this before and I needed to post this from another computer. Need to know how to restore my SP3.

    <title>Wireless N Adapter not connecting in N Mode to BT Home Hub 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dualcoresteve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless N Adapter not connecting in N Mode to BT Home Hub 4</h2>
                    
<p>I've just purchased a dual-band Wireless N Adapter to connect to my new BT Home Hub 4 router (also dual-band). I just cant seem to connect in&nbsp;"n" mode.</p>
<p>I can connect in&nbsp;"g" mode using 2.4Ghz but it will only connect in A mode when I switch my router to only use 5Ghz.</p>
<p>The security protocol on the router for 5Ghz is set to "WPA2 Only" and is also set to use&nbsp;n mode only.</p>
<p>The security protocol on the router for 2.4Ghz is set to "WPA or WPA 2" and is also set to use b/g/n mode.</p>
<p>No matter what combination I try, I can only connect in&nbsp;g mode on 2.4Ghz and only on&nbsp;a mode using 5Ghz (even though the router is set to only use n mode on 5Ghz, weird!)</p>
<p>Am I missing something? Can somebody assist in trying to connect using N mode please?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Greetings DualCore!</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the external wireless N adapter?<br /><br />To me it seems that both band and in 802.11n mode,&nbsp;are&nbsp;trying to operate but not "simultaneously". Note!&nbsp;Some&nbsp;dual-band&nbsp;models&nbsp;can only do one at a time. Whenever you enable 5 Ghz on such a device it will&nbsp;limit the 2,4 Ghz band to 802.11g only.<br /><br />Make sure 5 Ghz band is disabled.<br /><br />Post back and let us know how that goes and we'll take it from there.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response. It's a brand new router and I'm fairly certain that 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz can operate at the same time on this one as I have some other devices connecting to it in the 5Ghz band.</p>
<p>I will try it tonight when I get home and report back tomorrow.</p>
<p>Can I just ask, what speed would you expect to connect at using N on 2.4Ghz? I assumed you would need to connect with N on 5Ghz to get 130mbps but I'm not sure what to expect when connecting with N on 2.4Ghz?</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

            <p>dear kumar,</p>
<p>you are, as should be expected with Microsoft, wrong. at the bottom right corner of the screen is the time and date. you may think that I am being an ****, but the point is, it is not where you say it is, and I cannot find it anywhere on the screen. if
 you are not good at giving explanations then pictures of what you are inadequately trying to describe are worth a thousand words. or, Microsoft could write a decent manual.</p>

    <title>System hangs with black screen while gaming&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System hangs with black screen while gaming&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I recently clean installed windows 10 on to an SSD in my existing computer. Up until now I have had no problems whatsoever with my pc but as of this install I can only play a game for around half an hour before the screen goes black, sound hangs and the
 computer becomes completely unresponsive. I can't get any key combination to have an effect and have to force reboot at the power button. As I don't get the luxury of a BSOD the only way I could get a dmp file was when I eventually tried driver verifier and
 forced a crash that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Memory diagnostic says everything is fine</p>
<p>Chkdsk on both my gaming HDD and the SSD where my windows installation comes up 100% fine</p>
<p>Graphics card temperature is steady</p>
<p>Reliability monitor shows a hardware error but no more information.</p>
<p>I have saved the dmp from the crash I got through driver verifier if that's worth anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can help me!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>restoring file history from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david wolnie  say:</h3>
<h2>            restoring file history from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10</h2>
                    I did a clean install of Windows 10 from 8.1. &nbsp;I did a file history backup just prior to the install. &nbsp;Now, Windows 10 does not "see" my external drive when I go to file restore. &nbsp;I can access the files on the external drive, and do a copy and paste to
 the new destinations, but the restore has multiple copies on the same files with a UTC time stamp on each. &nbsp;I don't have as many files as most people, but it's real tedious to update each one and remove this additional info. Is there any other way I can get
 my new OS to recognize the 8.1 restore and have the files in place without the time stamp? Thanks for any help.

<p>
</p><p>I have been using the same Microsoft account for years in the US.&nbsp; However, I moved to Germany a few years ago and created an account so I can pay for my products with Euros.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is logged in with my old US account, and Xbox (Beta) is logged in with this German account. Is that causing an issue or is it something else?</p>

    <title>problem bluetooth mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katarina35  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem bluetooth mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to connect a bluetooth notebook 5000 mouse (v1.0) to windows 10.</p>
<p>After trying many times, checked all updates, drivers and so on, the mouse is detected and installed (I see bluetooth notebook mouse 5000 in the devices) but.... nothing works.</p>
<p>The mouse is not responding. To be completely correct it has worked correctly for a few minutes but... no more when I restarted the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that when I click on this device the status changes continuously between "paired" and "device setup in progress" (but even when paired the mouse is not responding).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already installed and removed the mouse many times and restarted my computer but it doesn't affect the situation any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any&nbsp; idea of what I could do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>
<p />

<p>Katarina,</p>

</p><p>I think the first thing you need to check is that the mouse battery is properly charged because the symptoms you describe could be caused by a mouse with a weak battery [or a poor connection of the battery inside the mouse].</p>
