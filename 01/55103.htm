            I contacted Netflix support about this error code, and they say to contact Microsoft because Microsoft owns and developed the app. &nbsp;Last time I checked, there is no "free" support from Microsoft. &nbsp;Also, Netflix support's suggestion is just to use a web
 browser. &nbsp;Let's hope Microsoft fixes their mistake quickly.

<p>Hi, people,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I've found the solution. If you've tried to install the Netflix app, but you get the aforementioned error code, the trouble is that Windows is unable to identify the installation, not that it is unable to install the app. In other words, the installation
 has been successful despite the error message. To see this, open the command prompt and type</p>
<p>
</p><p>explorer shell:AppsFolder</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will open the folder where Windows universal apps are saved. Now just look for the Netflix app, double click it and that's it! Fill in your login info and the it will be working again. You can also right click the app icon in the apps folder and create
 a shortcut for it if you are still having trouble finding the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, after all that, Windows Store will still only give you the option of installing the app, not of starting it.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now appears in my apps and is succesfully pinned to task bar.</p>
<p>Thanks anderslopesam.</p>

            <p>I tried all the suggestions I could find on the Internet. &nbsp;I even cleared the update cache, reset the update processes, verified all the system files on the computer, but it will still not work. &nbsp;On my computer, I can watch in the C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
 folder and see the install files get copied into a newly created folder as the download process in the Store progresses. &nbsp;Before the installation process installs the files, the downloaded files are deleted. &nbsp;It looks like to me that when they replaced the
 app in the Store, the copy they installed has the "delete files" command in the wrong place in the coding of the installation app. &nbsp;Other apps in the Store install just fine. &nbsp;So, I know there is nothing wrong with my OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I contacted NetFlix again and talked to 2nd level support. &nbsp;They are aware of the issue and said they are working hard to resolve the issue. &nbsp;They asked me to call back again today if I am still having trouble with it. &nbsp;Supposedly the "fix" is supposed
 to be in place by today.</p>

    <title>Contacts online not syncing in to people app. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flapjack 55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contacts online not syncing in to people app.</h2>
                    <p>On behalf of an end user, I configured the Windows 10 mail app (because the far superior Windows Live Mail app has been retired by Microsoft).&nbsp; I exported his Windows Live Mail in to a CSV.&nbsp; I created a Microsoft account using his existing email address
 *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and when I tried, it told me that an account existed that had used the email address (Skype maybe?), would you like to be reminded its username, so I said yes, and the screen said I would be emailed a code.&nbsp; I waited 10 minutes, didn't get
 the code.&nbsp; So I created the account anyway, not applying for a new email address, but using the existing address *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and then I uploaded his csv and it is showing online, but not syncing down to his People app.&nbsp; At one point, it asked me if I
 was using a personal or work account, I chose personal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assitance greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi, thank for the pointers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method One.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I have tried signing in to the People App using the same Microsoft account.&nbsp; I know the advice you give has to start off with the have-you-tried-turning-it-off-and-on-again approach, but don't insult our intelligence.&nbsp; You can assume that
 I have tried doing the thing I want to do.&nbsp; Refer to the post title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for method 2,&nbsp; the computer is not signed in to a Microsoft account, but a local account, and I have created a Microsoft account
<em>only for the purpose </em><em>of importing the csv file and </em><em>synchronising contacts</em>.&nbsp; Therefore, only the People app is signed in to Microsoft.&nbsp; The Mail app receives his emails, ISP provided, non-microsoft POP account.&nbsp; That email address
 is used for his Microsoft account login, it is not linked to Office365 nor is it an outlook.com or hotmail email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That email address had been used in the past as a secondary address to another MS account; we don't know its login, or what service it was associated with.&nbsp; In instances like these, it is almost always a forgotten Skype account, in my experience.&nbsp; We did
 not sign in with that, but created a new Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite this, to the best of my knowledge, the People app is still not synchronising.&nbsp; I'll check with the end user to see if it has spontaneously started syncing tomorrow.</p>

<p>There may an issue with either the monitor or the HDMI cable that is why you're experiencing the issue. Just to clarify, how did you re-install the graphics driver of your computer. We recommend that you isolate the issue by either using the monitor on another
 device or using a different HDMI cable for us to know if there is an issue with the monitor or the HDMI cable.</p>

<p>I have not had a chance to try the cable with another computer. &nbsp;The hdmi cable had to be special ordered and it has been working fine for two years and since it has not been moved I don’t see it going bad at the exact time of the latest major Windows update.
 &nbsp;The monitor says “no signial” so that much is working. &nbsp;As for the re-installing of the driver, that was done by our computer service man and I don’t know what he did exactly. &nbsp;He said he thought intel was working on a patch, but I don’t know where he got
 that info.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Since the latest update I have not been able to find the section in the control panel that used to allow you to select “clone” or “extend”. &nbsp;I normally use the clone feature daily for people who are sitting across the desk from me.</p>

<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the error message you get on downloading the apps from Windows Store after disconnecting the external drive?</span></p>

<h2>            Gamertag change - Payment options</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone</p>

<p>I tried to change my Gamertag. But when I proceeded to the payment site, I was only offered to pay via credit card. There is only one problem: I don't have one. Isn't it possible to pay with PayPal or my Microsoft credit? My account is linked with my PayPal-account
 an I still have 15$ on my Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to contact the XBOX-support via chat, but the required fields "Name" and "Surname" were greyed out, and I wasn't able to fill them in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, how can I change my Gamertag without a credit card?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you trying to change your Gamertag using the Xbox App on Windows 10, or going threw Xbox.com? Depending on which one you're using, could you try to go threw Xbox.com and change your Gamertag:
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/changegamertag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.xbox.com/.../changegamertag</a> (Please make sure you login with the same Microsoft Account). If you try to change it threw the Xbox App on Windows 10, please go to your Profile&gt;Customize
 Profile&gt;Click the edit button next to your Gamertag. </p>
<p>You can use PayPal and should be able to use your Microsoft Account credit towards the purchase. If you still run in-to trouble with changing your Gamertag, please contact Xbox Support here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a> (You may need to open the site in a in-private tab to fix the issue you were having before).

<p>Hello Alliance United</p>
<p>1. I tried to change my Gamertag via the XBOX-App. But it redirects me to the browser-site, which you also have linked in your answer. There, I am still unable to select PayPal or my Microsoft credits as paying option.</p>
<p>2. I opened your "contact us" link in an incognito-window. But the fields "Name" and "Surname" remain greyed out.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the troubleshooting steps suggested by <strong>Shishira D</strong> on
<strong>April 24, 2010</strong> in the following link.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: - Editing registry values incorrectly may cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of
 these settings are at your own risk. So I suggest you to take a backup of registry before editing.</div>

            <p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>Tja now have 305 items in the rebuild Search Index. If I try to make DIR *.* /s I get about 90000 files in my user folder, so why can Windows Disktop Search not see them?</p>
<p>So the tip you gave me has&nbsp;really no&nbsp;effect on the Search result.</p>
<p>Can you direct me to a Windows 7 update who fix the problems with Window Desktop Search, thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><strong>Registry disclaimer<br />
Important: </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a>
<br />
</p>
<p>Let’s try these steps and check.<br />
</p>
<p>1. Locate the “Block Senders” key. It should be here…</p>
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER </li><li>Identities/{<em>big long number</em>}
</li><li>Software </li><li>Microsoft </li><li>Outlook Express/<em>version</em>
</li><li>Block Senders</li></ul>

<p>2. All of your old entries are probably there under Mail or Criteria. Scroll down to the last few entries since these are the most likely culprits, right click and
<strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Restart the computer and check.</p>
<p>4. Open Outlook Express and see if your blocked sender list is back. If not, then go back to the registry then right-click “Blocked Senders” and
<strong>Delete</strong> then close the registry.</p>
<p>5. Restart the computer and check.</p>

            <p>If Umesh's suggestion doesn't help, make sure you don't have some anti-spyware that prevents registry changes.&nbsp; And also check for antivirus interference (see
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a>).&nbsp; You can also go to File | Identities and set up a new Identity and then see if the block senders list works in the new Identity.&nbsp; If so, you can use File | Import | Messages to
 get them from the older Identity.</p>

<h2>            My windows 8 is randomly logging off on its own, bug&#63;</h2>
                    This is really frustrating. It's happened twice now, in the past 24 hours. I'm just doing my work, and suddenly the screen goes black for 2 seconds, flashing black, then goes to the 'metro' screen saver screen, where you start when you first boot the computer
 on. so it appears that it is logging off. I log back on, and a FEW of my open programs (skype, dropbox, few others) are still there, but most of my programs (wordpad, browser) simply terminated and I have to start them again, restore chrome session, lose work
 that I didn't save in WordPad, ETC.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 8 Pro here.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help, it would be good to get to the bottom of this. 99% sure it's no virus, I'm careful and an experienced computer user and have MSE monitoring things so it can't be a virus.</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities. From your problem description I understand that you’re computer is
 turning off automatically. Please correct me if I have misunderstood.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best
 to resolve it.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen while working on any particular application?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would set your computer in clean boot state to check if there are any third party application/programs that is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform clean boot:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:
</span></b><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option<b> Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click<b> ‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window</b>under<b> startup tab,
</b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>f) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </span></b><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat
 step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b> Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<b> Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6:
</span></b><span>Resolve the problem.<b><br />
</b></span><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the
 problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to
 boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please perform these recommended steps and post back if you are still experiencing the issue.</span></p>

<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The problem with it is that it's really random. It's only happened twice so far, but I'm a very advanced user and I just can't think of what app or process would deliberately log out of windows without me having commanded
 it - apart from malware which I'm sure I don't have.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>I've simply been installing all my usual windows 7 apps in setting the computer up and to be honest, the recently-installed program that is likely to be causing the problem here? It's a big one called windows 8. :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hence this topic. I wanted to see if others are having this issue as the OS is only at RTM stage (even if there was that big update the other day).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate it but it's impossible to effectively test those troubleshooting steps because it's not a predictable repeatable event that happens. I'd likely be waiting for hours and nothing happens.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just hope it doesn't occur again and if it does, I'll have to come back here again. In the meantime I'll just stay subscribed to this topic and be glad to hear any ideas or further thoughts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do like windows 8 - I just hope whatever the problem is it'll be solved.</div>

            <div>It just happened again, in front of my eyes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But this time (and it must have been the same reason as those first two times), I have a clear idea of why it happened. My CPU/RAM was getting overloaded. (not CPU
<i>overheated</i> - it was mostly RAM that was getting filled up) - i think a program started hanging (a browser, IE i think) and then suddenly the screen started going a bit beserk with windows flashing and distorting and trying to regain themselves, before
 the screen going to a blank black for a few seconds - all looking kind of like when the video driver crashes and it then goes black, before defaulting to a basic windows built-in vga driver or whatever.</div>
<div><br />
<div>BUT THEN IT ALSO DECIDES IT WANTS TO LOG OFF YOUR WINDOWS SESSION, LOSING YOUR WORK IN THE PROCESS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do NOT like this behaviour in Windows 8. What a stupid design - it sounds like the design of a tablet, not a workstation. Hmm, wonder why. If Win7 got overloaded, it'd just keep hanging/being frozen until you DO something about it. I want to be able
 to do my something about it. I want to be able to go to the task manager, force kill things and SAVE, MY WORK.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And if it's bad enough to have to turn the computer right off, I want to have that OPTION. Because usually it ISN'T that bad, I'm used to it and it's what I want, I expect overloading and me dealing with it to HAPPEN on my hardcore workstation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there some documentation on this and information on how to disable this behaviour? What is it, might it be somewhere in the Group Policy area?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is AWFUL and if I'm right about my theory of this being a tablet-oriented design choice, then I hope enough people appeal to microsoft to make them stop compromising their desktop product and I really hope this is able to be disabled because I might
 just be forced to go to the mac desktop OS after all these years if I keep losing my work like this.</div>

<div><br />
<div>I had the same, starting a video which took a while. Screen went black. Boom logoff from windows and all applications were killed automatically (yes really killed, not nicely ended). What a worthless OS. I need stability, not these kind of jokes!</div>

<div><br />
<div>The problem hasn't happened to me for AGES but it DID happen yet again, right in front of my eyes, screen went blank then metro start screen restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><span>I think it only hasn't happened for ages, because it's been a while since I've done truly memory intensive tasks. But I WILL later down the track, so I hope the problem's gone away in some windows update or something!</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><span>It seemed to be when the memory or something gets overloaded. It looks to me to be a shocking tablet/mobile-oriented design choice: 'memory gets too choked / 'apps' don't perform so well? EASY - metro will reset itself for

Yeps this sounds exactly like what is happening. Some kind of hesitation in the system: Windows thinks:&nbsp;Hey let's kill all and logout.&nbsp;Although I have 32 GB of RAM. I only had about 18 GB in use. So I was certainly not out of RAM. No idea what happened, but
 this is not the first time I experience it either. It's really horrible :(

<h2>            Windows 10 font rendering - please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone can help me out, i have a 32" 1440p monitor &amp; Windows 10 and the text looks awful, not the crisp sharp experience i was expecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK so symptom</p>
<p>
</p><p>text rendered badly on Windows 10 all Microsoft applications&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 10 Mail</li><li>Outlook 2016</li><li>Excel 2016</li><li>Word 2016</li><li>OneNote</li></ul>
<p>Google Chrome all is good.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows scaling is 100% should be fine on this size of monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed this issue on my previous monitor a HP 24" 1080p, the issue is exaggerated on the 1440p</p>
<p>
</p><p>My work laptop which is similar spec, but runs Windows 7 &amp; Office 2010 and does not have these issues, so I assuming until someone tells me otherwise that the issue is Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the scaling, no real effect and I want to use 100%, increasing this makes the problem worse</li><li>Set the apps in compatibility, and ticked the Disable display scaling on High DPI settings</li></ul>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing and installing drivers, turning off Graphics acceleration, font smoothing.</p>
<p>all of which i have done one change at a time, checking the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>none of which has had much of an effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just followed your instructions, removed the latest graphics driver, downloaded it again and reinstalled it and the problem remains.</p>
<p>I have installed it in compatibility mode, still the problem is apparent</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reiterate that the issue is not apparent in Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading a number of posts, it seems that there is no resolution for this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating, I have good quality up to date hardware and software and windows 10 seems not to like High Resolution 1440p, even windows fonts on menus and navigation look nasty, not crisp and clear at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to roll back to Windows 7 and Office 2010?</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Changing hard drives caused all kinds of problems</h2>
                    <p>I've been running Windows 8.1 pro for the last few years. Everything has been working fine, but I needed more hard drive space. My files were split between an SSD (the OS) and a HDD (other files). So, I bought a larger SSD and HDD. I copied all files over
 to the new HDD with cut/paste, and I used the supplier samsung disk cloner to copy my OS to the new SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From then on, I got a bunch of random reboots and BSODs. Windows 8 pro would boot up, but sometimes it would hang immediately and break. Other times it would work for several hours, and then I would come to the PC later to discover that it had once again
 BSOD'ed. I was getting lots of errors like these:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; kernel_data_inpage_error (rdyboost.sys)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which I heard can be the case with corrupted files in the file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I decided to reset the PC to an original state. I downloaded and burned a windows 8 pro boot CD via
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media?Ocid=1.%20Owned%20NA%20(Reactive)_Social_TWITTER_WindowsSupport_20150510_178968763&amp;linkId=14129379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this guide</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to "refresh" the PC, and it didn't work, saying that it couldn't complete the refresh. Then, I attempted to just "reset" the PC back to its original state. This hung on 1%, then once again went back to the screen saying it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I try to boot into the computer, it says that there is no operating system recognized. I made sure to keep the correct boot order for my hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody provide any advice? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<li><span>Are you getting any error message\ error code&nbsp;on the screen? If yes provide us the complete error message\ error code.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>As I mentioned in the original post, I was often getting a "</span></span>kernel_data_inpage_error (rdyboost.sys)" error. However, it would not complete logging the error, and I could never find a minidump of the error

</p><p><strong>Method 1: Perform Automatic Repair using installation Media.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As I mentioned in the original post, I have already done this. I created an 8.1 recovery disk via the link I shared above. I then booted into
 this disk and tried "refreshing" the PC, and when this didn't work, I also tried "resetting" the PC. This also did not work, and also caused the computer to be unable to boot up at all.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I believe that I solved this issue by downloading an ISO of the windows 10 preview and then installing it fresh. I also switched the BIOS settings to be using AHCI instead of IDE for my hard

    <title>Surface Pro 3 display brightness does not change despite slider moves - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 display brightness does not change despite slider moves</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I have a problem with my recently acquired Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; The display brightness is locked to 100% and does not change despite the slider moves, the keyboard shortcut works in windows 10. Inactivated&nbsp;auto-brightness feature as well with no success.&nbsp;
 I have tried updating Intel HD graphics driver, same with the most recent drivers. Installed a couple of previous drivers, restarted, the issue stayed the same. I have tried to install window 8.1 - brightness 100%, does not change. Even tried linux&nbsp;Ubuntu
 17.10. Even there the brightness slider seemingly works, but no change in actual brightness.</p>
<p>Given that I have tried multiple display drivers and operating systems is it possible that this is a hardware fault? (Also the SD card reader does not work, but that was how it was sold. I don`t think that could be related).</p>
<p>Please tell if you have any idea to solve this.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've done multiple troubleshooting steps to no avail, we need to rule out the software issue on your Surface Pro 3. This can be done by doing a reimage (reimage will wipe out your personal files). See here:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download
 a recovery image for your Surface.</a>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>If reimage will not resolve the issue, then this behavior can be attributed to a hardware problem. If you're in the US, you can&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4023527/surface-how-to-get-service-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">request

<h2>            Stuck on Moderate NAT. Tried everything. &#40;at least I think&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just bought an Xbox One a few days ago and also had internet put in here at my new house.</p>
<p>I have BT Infinity 2 - 72 Down / 17 Up and a BT Home Hub 5 router/modem (not entirely sure which one but there's only 1)</p>
<p>So basically, I've tried everything to my knowledge but can't get off Moderate NAT.</p>
<p>I've tried - Port fowarding, DMZ, turning off firewall (temporarily), and UPnP all in different combinations. I also have a static IP on my XB1.</p>
<p>I can't seem to get off Moderate, I haven't even had a glimpse of an Open NAT. Could anyone help me out? Sorry if I laid out my post poorly it's my first post and I did my best :)</p>

<p>Are you sure that you port forwarded correctly? The Xbox One needs the ports 53, 80, 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500 to be port forwarded. &nbsp;Port forward all of these ports and then reset your Xbox One to see if your NAT opens.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem. </p>
<p>Trying those items in combinations probably won't work. That's what I've found, anyway.</p>
<p>The DMZ, by itself, should work. </p>
<p>So should port forwarding, if you forwarded all of the ports listed by bluejellybean0.</p>
<p>UPnP doesn't work properly on all hardware, I'd try that last.</p>
<p>Also, do a multi-player test after making changes, when it's done, hold down both triggers and both shoulder buttons. After a minute or two, this will tell you exactly what kind of NAT you have. You're trying for a Cone NAT.</p>

<p>@ blueJELLYbean0 - Double checked and I 100% have forwarded the correct ports.</p>
<p>@ R00K008 - Done the cone NAT thing and it opened my NAT on the dashboard but not CoD: Ghosts.</p>
<p>@ the king ayman - Tried DMZ already and it didn't work either.</p>
<p>Appreciate all the help by the way. Is that everything I can possibly try? Am I stuck with a moderate NAT forever haha?

<p>If you try to work with a DMZ and get the message "you are not behind a cone nat" then everything is fine as this is telling you "NAT open". If you still have only moderate NAT on CoD even if you have got an open NAT it may also be a temporarily game problem.
 Please understand that the displayed NAT on CoD and the One are two different statuses and that CoD may cause problems because it's its own special kind of network. So first check what's up with NAT on your Xbox. Suggestion is definitively the use of DMZ.
</p>
<p>Please have also in mind that you can only use DMZ or portforwarding. Not both at the same time, this will cause issues.
</p>
<p>If you still are on a moderate NAT on your Xbox (not on CoD!) even though you use DMZ, then it may also be an issue with your provider. So you should also consider to ask there if they maybe block any ports or protocols or if you are on ip sharing.

<p>Okay, so I think I've the issue (at least temporarily). I think the reason why the cone NAT thing wasn't working is because Ghosts was always in my disc drive. So I took it out and then done that and it seemed to work. Thanks everyone for the help, I really
 appreciate it :D</p>

<p>The BT homehub 5 is trash. I had one then binned it.</p>
<p>Its UPnP is not fully compatible with xbox one(or ps4 so dont blame xbox).</p>
<p>It particularly struggles with activision games that use demonware port mapping.</p>
<p>COD ghosts and probably Destiny. I say this because destiny beta used demonware to open port 1200 on my tp link router.</p>
<p>So if you ever plan on getting destiny you may have problems with that as well unless you forward the required port which in the beta was port 1200.

<h2>            Move emails from Outlook Express &#40;in XP&#41; to Windows 10.</h2>
                    I want to move my emails (and folders) from Outlook Express (in XP) to Windows 10. Hopefully the Win 10 Mail app will do this, or do I need to buy an email program? I can export from OE, but how to import to Mail?

<p>Thanks for the reply, but I'm confused. By MS Outlook, do you mean the full blown Outlook from MS Office, installed on to both computers??&nbsp; That can't be right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>i assume MS Outlook is something I have to buy (two of?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't I import Outlook Express emails into Windows 10 Mail?</p>

            Yes, full-blown MS Outlook on both computer - and I'm afraid it IS right.
<br />
<br />Yes, you must purchase MS Outlook (or Office 365 for the Win10 computer).
<br />
<br />No, you cannot import Outlook Express data into Win10's Mail app.
<br />
<br />You couldn't import OE data into Windows Mail (Vista) or into Windows Live Mail (WinXP &amp; Vista).
<br />
<br />Nice, huh?

<p>Thanks for the clarification PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For years, people would dump on Microsoft, but I thought they were just complainers. Then I upgraded this (new at the time) computer to Win 8.0 and was appalled at how blatantly desktop users were ignored.&nbsp; It was made doubly bad when the outcry by desktop
 users resulted in only an almost insignificant change in 8.1. I was so disgusted I put this computer in the closet for years and continued with my older XP computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then I heard that Win 10 was ok, so I hauled this computer out of the closet and made the upgrade from 8.1.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems ok.&nbsp; But meanwhile I had heard that Outlook Express was abandoned, but I never had the time to sort it out, so I stayed with my XP.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>XP is now too old, I have to upgrade. This computer with Win 10 is still too new to scrap (it has an i7 processor).&nbsp; I guess I'll have to research other email options for use on this Win 10 computer - any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS ignored desktop users (with 8.0 and 8.1), and then they ignored long time home email users (by scrapping OE).&nbsp; I'll be the first to complain now when MS is mentioned.&nbsp; I don't know what they are thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply<br />

            I feel your pain, believe me. (Microsoft abandoned OE when Vista was still in beta!) I stuck with WinXP until it started to look like no more Win7 computers would be available (didn't want Win8).

<p>Hi PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it is inappropriate to mention others software, but I did find a solution to my question above - it is called OE Classic.&nbsp; I paid the $25 for the PRO version after a coupla days playing with the free version.&nbsp; It is remarkably similar to
 Outlook Express. Most importantly, it imported my emails within their folders. Also it imported my address book and email account details.&nbsp; It&nbsp; could not import message rules. Maybe that will help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The joy in finding that email program soon vanished when I tried to use Skype.&nbsp; It insisted&nbsp; on using my MS sign-in (so all my contact and settings were lost. Got that resolved, then tried to move my music in to Windows Media Player.&nbsp; That worked ok, but
 I had to spend hours rebuilding my playlists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe there are reasons I am not seeing, but it seems MS intentionally makes moving to a newer OS difficult by needlessly changing things.&nbsp; Aren't there people in each software development team whose goal is to make MS software upgrades seamless?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a different subject, I have to search for this thread via my member name.&nbsp; Where do find my question listed (sequentially) with others questions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; how do i turn OFF the built-in webcam in aspire 5600u</h2>
                    I have seen this question but not for a Win 10 set-up, and I have not seen an answer works for me.&nbsp; I have an Acer Aspire all in one, Model 5600U, with a built in web-cam that appears in Device Manager as a USB2.0 camera.&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem is: the&nbsp;daingedcamera
 is always "on" though I did nothing to activate it. That is, it's "on" light always comes on -- uninvited -- during Start-up, and I can't seem to turn it&nbsp;off. Any&nbsp;App I&nbsp;open (Crystal Eye, Win 10 Camera) that might turn it off says "not me&nbsp; someone else is
 using the camera" - or words to that effect. &nbsp;I thought skype might be activating the camera on start up so I disabled skype at start up. No help. Then I uninstalled skype. No help.&nbsp; I uninstalled the camera using device manager. But Win 10 found it again,
 and turned it on. So helpful, Win 10. Device manager says the Camera is "functioning properly, which should be good news if it is true, but I wish&nbsp;the camera&nbsp;would NOT FUNC

<p>Of course I tried this, and I should have said so in my original post. Both windows and and Acer's driver update &nbsp;monitor say I am all caught up. The camera won't turn off.</p>

 Task manager doesn't indicate any application. And I can't turn the camera off. That is, I can't turn it off without disabling it. Back to square one. Help!</p>

            That's a nice canned response. However, Microsoft is the manufacturer in my case. And the camera works fine, as does the mic built into it. Cortana can hear me. I have a Live! Cam Chat HD (VF0700) and it is working fine, But something is keeping the light
 on, and it looks like Microsoft, because its a fresh install, with nothing installed yet.&nbsp;
