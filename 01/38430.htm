<h2>            change default CPI front in Epson dot-matrix print out  while code page ACP&#61; 1256</h2>
                    <p>I'm printing from UNIX system to the windows LPR printer which have Arabic character
</p>
<p>( # lp -d <em>printername</em> <em>filename&nbsp; )</em></p>
<p>but once changed code page ACP 1256 in the registry (to print Arabic character) the size for font became big in the print out
</p>
<p>and shows CPI is lower than character if code page is 1252</p>
<p>so how can i change the font size , and type and CPI -at least- if code page is 1256</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Surface Book Shift Key</h2>
                    <p>Holding down the Shift Key doesn't&nbsp;register more than one other input.&nbsp; For example, Shift Key + Up Arrow + Left Arrow doesn't register.</p>
<p>

<br />
• Is this the first time you have encountered it? <br />
• Can you provided the game that have this kind of issue?<br />
• Were there any errors when you press those keys aside from not registering? <br />
• Have you tried reconfiguring the keys on the game settings itself?<br />
• What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? <br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your reply.

<h2>            Xbox Live Enforcement should removed&#47;improved</h2>
                    <p>Xbox Live enforcement seems to be very lazy, as I have seen, they banned my friend when I reported him saying "gay". Gay's definition&nbsp;</p><p>1. jovial or happy, good-spirited&nbsp;<br />2. a homosexual male or female&nbsp;<br />3. often used to describe something stupid or unfortunate. originating from homophobia. quite preferable among many teenage males in order to buff up their "masculinity"<br />1. "We'll have a gay old time."&nbsp;<br />2. "You DO know he's gay. Notice his homoerotic pornography collection."&nbsp;<br />3. "Man, these seats are gay. I can't even see what's going on!"</p><p>It could mean any one of those 3. Yet you didn't ask the defendant? You just impeded his freedom of speech(illegal)? What if he was trying to convey a political message? You wouldn't know. You didn't ask. How many cases would have to be reviewed by an actual person is sad, when I have seen a person get reported, then 1-2 minutes later he was banned. There is no way that is a person.&nbsp; It

            <p>So you reported your friend for saying gay and now you're complaining because enforcement did their job. The technical definition of many words doesn't always reflect the implication in a comment. Trying to be smart and posting the "official definition" isn't going to buy leeway. It's well known that the word can be used in a very inflammatory way despite its less offensive definitions. The fact that you were the one who reported it means you already know that. In fact, you reporting it also bears weight. It's sending a message that YOU found it offensive, otherwise it would've... should've... gone unreported.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I have a few people on my favorites list just so I get a notification when they come online, for several reasons... doesn't mean they're anything more than someone I've met on XBL and it certainly doesn't mean any one of them doesn't have the ability to say something offensive or CoC breaking. That's no criteria to base a reported enforcement action on, nor should

            Hi JC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> 1) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which browser are you using to access IMVU website?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are using Internet Explorer, then what is the version?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming that you are unable to open IMVU web page and IMVU software is uninstalled
 from your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to download IMVU from the following link and check if you are
 able to install the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.imvu.com/signup/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imvu.com/signup/download/</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>You may place the computer in clean boot state and check if you are able to install
 the software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>Place the computer in clean boot </span></p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall
 and re-install the program.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:<br />

<strong>Note</strong>: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>

<p>Did it ever work - even at first?&nbsp; If so the drivers may have been replaced by a Microsoft Update and that may be why it no longer works.&nbsp; Check the drivers and see if there is an option to rollback the drivers to a prior version (which may be the one that
 came with the system when it worked).&nbsp; If so, try the rollback and see if that resolves the problem.&nbsp; Make sure it not only reads blu ray disks but can read and burn regular CDs and DVDs as it should.&nbsp; It if doesn't you can always just re-install the drivers
 by undoing the rollback and restoring the drivers that were there before you started this effort and again confirm that it still works except for reading blu ray disks.</p>
<p>I don't see the point in HP relasing a blu ray drive that has no drivers available for it - I've actually never heard of this happening with any manufacturer or device installed on the computers they sell.&nbsp; Somebody at HP dropped the ball big time on this
 one.&nbsp; Perhaps HP will give you a free exchange for another blu ray drive they may have available for your computer that actually has drivers for it and that actually works since the one they sold you doesn't - it can't hurt to ask.&nbsp; Check out the options first
 so you can ask for one that is of at least equal quality and either the same price or perhaps a bit more expensive - they may still be willing because of the problem they know exists.&nbsp; I assume it's still under warranty so that shouldn't be an issue.&nbsp; It's
 an option to consider - but the decision is yours.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Problems w&#47;Connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> killakong1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller Problems w&#47;Connection</h2>
                    
<p>So I have this reoccurring problem with my xbox one controller where it has trouble connecting to my console or it will randomly lose connection while I'm playing. The white light on the xbox button will keep blinking and every time I try to turn the controller
 off and back on it does the same thing. I then proceed to either turn my console off or hard reset the whole thing and most of the time the controller still has problems connecting. Even when I manage to connect it and everything runs smoothly after a while
 the connection loss will happen again...This problem of mine started ever since I bought myself the turtle beach XO one, so I don't know if this headset relates to the constant connection loss. I even updated my standard controller and most recently I got
 the xbox elite controller which shows the same problem. If anyone can help me with this headache it will be greatly appreciated, if not xbox support team needs to patch this up or something.</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Thanks for the support message.</p>
<p>Please make sure you don't have anything in between or close to your console that might be interfering with the controllers wireless signal such as metallic objects, dividers, glass or wood sliding doors on an entertainment center (doors on an entertainment
 center should ALWAYS be open while the console is on) Cordless phones, routers, and/or Microwave ovens.</p>
<p>You might also want to try leaving the turtle beach headset unplugged for a while to see if it stops doing that when the headset is unplugged. &nbsp;Check out this support article:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-disconnects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox

<h2>            need to &#40;un&#41;encrypt a usb flash drive</h2>
                    somehow a flash drive that i use to transfer files from tablet to the drive has a write protection on it and i cant even format or access folders.&nbsp; all the folders names are replaced with random letters, symbols. apps on my tablet have access to external
 devices that can essentially read and even replace files at their own free will, which needs to be stopped. luckily, all the files on the usb arent important, but all i want to do is format it. and yes, ive already ran CMD prompt without success. still searching
 for ways to decrypt it. last resort, discard it

<p>Hi Malcolm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For clarification regarding formatting your USB flash drive, when you say "I've already ran CMD prompt", did you run it under safe mode? If not, we suggest that you follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Shutdown your PC</span>.</li><li><span>Insert your USB Memory Stick into your laptop or Computer.</span></li><li><span>Turn on laptop, and then immediately start pressing <strong>F8</strong></span><span>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Safe Mode with Command Prompt</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After loading files, if your USB Memory Stick drive letter is G (for example), then write as:<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32&gt;G:, and press <strong>Enter</strong></span>.<br />
<span>G:\&gt;format G:, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</span><br />
</li><li><span>Press <strong>Y</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong></span>.</li><li><span>Now a full format will start which remove write protection from USB Memory Stick.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
We look forward to your response.<br />
</span></p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by "invading my privacy"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Frequent Places only show the folders and files&nbsp;that you have opened in File Explorer. Each user account will only show the frequent places for that specific account. No other account can see the frequent places for your user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Frequent Places are associated with the Taskbar Jump Lists for apps that are pinned to the Taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can right click the Taskbar and select Properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the Jump Lists Tab and remove the check marks from the 2 options you see there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will disable the Frequent Places list in File Explorer and the Jump Lists on the Taskbar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, the error that you get "sqldmo.dll" might not installed by default with SQL Server 2005. There are Backward Compatibility Components that you can select during the original install of SQL Server 2005 which is also connected to
 the latest error that you get now. We suggest that you post this in <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Technet forum</a></strong> for better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you have any other concern.</p>

<p>Are there any words communicated with the error number or does it just say error 0x800703f9?<br />

<br />
Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it does,
 restart&nbsp; it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems.<br />
<br />
Have you tried running it out of the Windows environment?&nbsp; If you have an install DVD that you can boot to (or a Startup Repair option via the F8 Safe Mode screen), try launching System Restore from the options provided when you go down the Startup Repair path.<br />

            Hi Mikaelangel, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            <p>Hello Nourelyan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the issue specific to a particular game or with every other&nbsp;audio application?&nbsp;</li><li>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the complete and exact error message that you get?</li></ol>
<p>I understand that the sound is not&nbsp;played in games but while playing movies. In that case, you may check with the audio and volume options in the game and check if the sound is muted. In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker
 effects that are collectively known as enhancements. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, you might need to update your audio driver. Refer to the following methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>To disable speaker audio enhancements.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
a. Open Sound by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>
Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>. In the search box, type sound, and then click
<strong>Sound</strong>.<br />
b. On the <strong>Playback</strong> tab, click <strong>Speakers</strong>, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
c. Click the <strong>Enhancements</strong> tab, and then select the <strong>Disable all enhancements
</strong>check box. </p>
<div><br />
If you do not see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.</div>
<p>If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you are experiencing, this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated.<br />
If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you are experiencing, check to see if an updated driver is available for your computer from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Perform the following steps and check if that helps.<br />
a. Click the <strong>Start</strong> Button, type "MMSYS.CPL" (without quotation marks) in the Start Search box and press Enter.<br />
b. On <strong>Playback</strong> tab, click the <strong>Speaker</strong> which is used currently and click
<strong>Properties</strong> button.<br />
c. Switch to <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, uncheck the "<strong>Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device</strong>" option.<br />
d. If the <strong>Enhancements</strong> tab is available, click it. Check 'Disable all sound effects".<br />
e. In <strong>Setting</strong> section, Select <strong>None</strong>.<br />
f. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<h2>            XP &#40;end of life&#41; ALTERNATIVE PLS</h2>
                    <p>Hi There, Happy New Year!</p>
<p>I know I've left it a bit late, but can anyone talk me thru acquiring Windows7 to replace my old&nbsp;XP OS?</p>
<p>Can I just download and install Windows7? - I've backed up all my workfiles.</p>
<p>I'm fond of XP, but increasingly fearful of the big bad web now it is not supported.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>1. If the license is OEM, then it is tied to the original hardware. If it is retail, the license can be transferred however 2.</p>
<p>2. XP is already at end of life. New hardware will have no system drivers for Windows XP, Windows XP is also no longer patched and is insecure. Windows 7 has reached end of retail sales so even an XP retail license is not going to be much use for you. It
 is very hard to find a retail upgrade license. Windows 8.1 is full and cheaper than Windows 7 so is a better alternative. However in reality both Windows 7 and 8.1 will be eligible for a free upgrade to Windows 10 in Late Summer. Windows 7 and 8.1 will effectively
 have limited support once most of the userbase has migrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would advise installation of Windows 10 Technical Preview. Use Windows 10 Technical Preview until Windows 10 RTM is out. There may be a free upgrade for Windows 10 TP testers however at the very least there will be a discount:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Windows XP license is retail and you need it for compatibility issues you should look into virtualisation:</p>

</p><p>On what source are you basing your statement that TP testers will get a free or discounted upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only offer that Microsoft have announced is that licensed Windows 7 PCs will get a free upgrade.&nbsp; Andre da Costa has noted this fact in several posts in this forum.</p>

<p>
</p><p>11.&nbsp; If your XP was pre-installed by the manufacturer then its licence cannot be transferred to a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1.2&nbsp; If your XP is a retail copy then you can install that on the new computer using your original installation media &amp; XP Product Key [note that retail XP installation media cannot be replaced so if you have lost it you have effectively lost your licence].</em></p>

<p>Philip,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On what source are you basing your statement that TP testers will get a free or discounted upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only offer that Microsoft have announced is that licensed Windows 7 PCs will get a free upgrade.&nbsp; Andre da Costa has noted this fact in several posts in this forum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Its implied there will be an upgrade path from Windows 10 TP to Windows 10 RTM...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Moreover so far there is "no solution" for those have upgraded from Windows 7 OEM to Windows 10 TP and lost their recovery partition and do not have reinstallation media. These users are technically eligible. I have asked several times for information on
 this:</p>
<p><a href="https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/suggestions/7236772-windows-7-oem-to-windows-10-retail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/suggestions/7236772-windows-7-oem-to-windows-10-retail</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also mention that pirates will be updated:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31940716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-31940716</a>
</p>
<p>Although other articles state the free upgrade will have limited functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this information <em>indicates</em> that Windows 10 TP users will get either a discount or hopefully a free upgrade...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will likely not be able to get pirates to pay for the full price of a Windows license at current prices so hopefully it will be cheap enough so that they buy it and don't resort to simply pirating Windows 10. Microsoft are hence unlikely to make
 it cheap for pirates and not for Windows 10 TP users many who have eligible OEM licenses which cannot be reinstalled who are Windows Enthusiasts like myself and are the ones who will write guides and&nbsp;reviews leaving&nbsp;positive or negative feedback. Microsoft
 seem to want to keep these enthusiasts on their side, they lost a lot of them with Windows 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will be a lot of problems with the Windows 7 OEM license, lack of Digital River .isos and finally faded COAs if they don't make the upgrade from the TP either&nbsp;free or alternatively&nbsp;cheap enough to justify buying without having to call Microsoft to
 fight for a free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I don't count out the chance that Microsoft&nbsp;will do something that's not sensible... They have proved with Windows 8 they are capable of doing that... It does seem that they want
<em>Windows 10</em> <em>to be </em>a <em>success</em> though and Windows 10 has a lot more momentum behind it than Windows 8 will ever have.</p>

<p><strong><span>I have a Netbook with 1gb of ram and a Intel Atom processor N450 1.66GHz, 512KB L2 Cache. It has Windows 7 Starter on it my
 question is if I upgrade it to Windows 7 Home. Would I see a decrease in system performance and run slower? I read Windows 7 Starter was made for netbook because it runs better then any other version of Windows 7 for netbook.But is that really a fact and would
 I really see my system run slow and a decrease in the speed and performance?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Windows 7 Starter does not include:<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Aero Glass, meaning you can only use the Windows Basic or other opaque themes. It also means you do not get Taskbar Previews or Aero Peek.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Personalization features for changing desktop backgrounds, window colors, or sound schemes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The ability to switch between users without having to log off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * 64 bit version <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Multi-monitor support. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * DVD playback. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Windows Media Center for watching recorded TV or other media.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Remote Media Streaming for streaming your music, videos, and recorded TV from your home computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Domain support for business customers. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * XP Mode for those that want the ability to run older Windows XP programs on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Yes&nbsp;installing win7 Home would probably lead to a decrease in performance, Personally I wouldnt install win7 on less than 2gb of memory</p>

<h3> misha38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7&#58; No Start button or Taskbar when computer starts up</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Original title:&nbsp;Black screen and taskbar and start button on startup</strong></p>
<p>On startup I got a black screen with no taskbar or start button. Just the pointer and the dial-up box was visible. (I have a dial-up connection and sometimes when I start up the dial-up box shows up on its own right after the desktop appears).
 I couldn't access the start menu. I'm not sure at what point it went black because I walked away after I turned on the computer. I pressed the power button. When I did I got the light blue screen that said it was shutting down and it shut&nbsp;down&nbsp;normally.&nbsp;When
 I restarted I had no problem and it hasn't done it since.</p>
<p>I hadn't made any changes&nbsp;to the&nbsp;computer except change the desktop wallpaper a few times for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Can someone tell me what is wrong with my computer so I can fix it so this or something worse doesn't happen?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hello misha38,</p>
<p>After re-reading through the thread, this sounds more like a hardware/driver issue. Have you tried updating your video driver from your computer manufacturers website? Please visit your computer manufacturer's website to locate and install the correct driver.</p>
