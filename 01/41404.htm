<h2>            Bought Full Version of Game, Yet it Behaves like A Trial Version...</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;had the free trial/ demo of Titanfall 2. A few days later I&nbsp;bought the game itself and installed it without a problem occurring. Playing the game was no issue either, however on May 30th, 2017, whenever I&nbsp;went to play the game a message came up for me to either "Continue playing the trial", or "See game in store for purchase". I've already bought the game though. I've tried &nbsp;turning the console off and on, signing in and out of the account, as well as trying to sign in with a different account but nothing has worked so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The version I&nbsp;purchased was the "Deluxe"&nbsp;edition, and it is a hard copy of the game NOT&nbsp;a digital download/ code version.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; It now works. I&nbsp;solved the issue by removing and reinserting the disc of the game. However, a message still comes up to "Play Trial"&nbsp;or "See in store". Once I&nbsp;get past that screen, the game behaves like a normally, registered version.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

<p>I am trying to download Red Dead Redemption from the marketplace.</p>
<p>The game costs 2,240 points.</p>
<p>I purchased 2,000 points thru the console using my credit card without any issues but when i tried purchasing an additional 500 points i got the error code

<p>I tried purchasing the 500 points thru my PC (http://marketplace.xbox.com) but i got the following error:-</p>
<p><strong>This action cannot be performed at this time. Please try again later. For more information, go to http://www.xbox.com/support</strong></p>

<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Please try the following:</p>
<p>- Check your billing address</p>
<p>- Contact your bank or financial institution</p>
<p>The Xbox LIVE purchase might have failed because:</p>
<p>•The credit card has not been activated.</p>
<p>•The credit card was declined due to insufficient funds.</p>
<p>•The credit card is not authorized for online purchases or automatic billing.</p>
<p>•The credit card company is blocking the transaction.</p>
<p>Contact your credit card company or bank and make sure that the card that you’re using was activated, that it has available funds, and that the transaction is not being blocked for some reason.</p>
<p>Solution 3: Try your purchase again later</p>
<p>The Xbox LIVE purchase might be blocked because: •Too many recent purchase attempts were declined.</p>
<p>•The Xbox LIVE account or the payment option is being used from a suspicious location.</p>
<p>•The payment option you provided may have a violation for non-payment that’s preventing it from being used for new purchases.</p>
<p>Wait and try the transaction again in 24 to 48 hours. If lots of purchase failures occur, this can prevent transactions from being processed until no purchase attempts have been made for a while (usually 24 to 48 hours).</p>
<p>Solution 4: Remove your card and try again</p>
<p>If you’re trying to purchase a new Xbox LIVE subscription&nbsp;and the payment option has a billing decline violation against it and can’t be used. If you have an unpaid balance for a previous subscription on the payment option you are trying to use, use a different
 credit card for the purchase.</p>
<p>Solution 5: Use a prepaid Microsoft Points or membership card if available</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can purchase a prepaid Microsoft Points card from a retail location and use it to make purchases. Note that not all purchases support Microsoft Points or prepaid options. Before purchasing Microsoft Points or a prepaid card, make sure
 that purchase option is available for the item you want to purchase.</p>
<p>Note: If you are sure that there's a problem with your payment instrument after checking the details with your bank and waiting for 48 hours , then you should call Xbox Phone Support , may be there's any Kind of lock on your account.</p>
<p>for more Info you can check the following : <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/purchase-xbox-live-content#35538b6ae5474f999f967f184914a9e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The credit card is activated</p>
<p>The credit card has sufficient funds</p>
<p>The credit card is authorized for online purchases or automatic billing</p>
<p>The credit card company has not blocked the transaction</p>
<p>My second attempt at purchase was declined, so i wouldn't call it too many attempts</p>
<p>I have already tried deleting my cc info and adding it again, still I was not able to buy the points</p>
<p>Prepaid membership points is not available in the area that I live in</p>
<p>The link you provided does not provide any solution to error 80153018</p>
<p>The error description that I receive when trying to purchase is:-</p>
<p>cant retrieve information from xbox live. please try again later status code 80153018</p>
<p>Could you please provide the xbox phone support number?</p>

<p>That is because there is not a solution to 80153018 what it means is "This is a Marketplace Error. &nbsp;Delete any corrupted or partially downloaded content, Marketplace Data and Rights database. Clear cache twice. Test Xbox Live connection, if fails Reset Network
 Factory settings on console. Reboot and run connection test again. If connected, recover gamertag. After gamertag downloads, attempt purchase again. (in Account Management on the console)." &nbsp;Obviously it is not your credit card not being activated since you
 just purchased 2000 points right before. </p>
<p>Honestly out of all the times I have seen this usually it is an error on the Microsoft side and you try again in 24 hours and it works fine. When most people call support with this problem it gets them no where. But I will leave you a link to all of the
 support numbers and I wish you the best. Please keep us updated</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p><p><br /></p><p>For tracking the May Xbox Quest,&nbsp;the appropriate teams are looking into the Games with Gold download portion not reflecting appropriately. This should not interfere with&nbsp;receiving rewards for the May Quest (rewards&nbsp;will&nbsp;go out till the end of June).&nbsp;For April, there was not a guaranteed reward for that month and instead everyone received extra entries to win the Gold Xbox&nbsp;One X console.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope this helps clear up any confusion!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 menu and window elements not responding to clicks. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 menu and window elements not responding to clicks.</h2>
                    <p>To whomever may assist,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just updated from 8.1 to 10 using the Microsoft Media Creator found here : http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 . Upon updating I have found that several elements of the desktop, start menu and cortana windows fail to respond
 to left-click. They do respond to using the tab key to cycle through to each element and then activate them with the "Enter" key. Having done much googling, I have found many similiar problems but each solution presented has failed to fire. I have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Updated drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Updated windows (through the Update and Repair section of Settings)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Restarted several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- used powershell with : sfc /scannow</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I have tried to use powershell with DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth , but the executed function seems to stall at 20%.&nbsp;I will leave it running overnight to see if 6 hrs of working time makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked. As such, I turn to you, the greater internets, for help and guidance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That problem in tabulated full;</p>
<p>Start Menu:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Any buttons/ live tiles / clickable elements (do not respond to right or left click) but do highlight when I hover over them.</p>
<p>To be honest, the Start Menu only sometimes opens when clicked anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Does respond to right-click, so at least there's that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana window: </p>
<p>&nbsp;- Opens to a left click, opens toolbar menu when right-clicked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;- Once window is open, no clickable elements (search bar, page tabs on side, microphone button) will activate when clicked on. They are all highlighted (when appropriate) on mouse hover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- If tab and arrow keys are used, will respond to the return key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Apps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Windows Apps such as "Settings" or "Repair and Update" allow me to move the overall windows, close them with the top-right corner etc but not to click on anything within the windows.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Using tab and arrow keys will allow you to use Windows Apps windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other buttons on the task bar, such as the wifi selection pop-up thing, will not allow me to click on anything within the window - when it even lets me bring up the window itself!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really hope we can work something out. Even with all the above, I'm really noticing the improvement on speed that Windows 10 offers and I'd hate to lose it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Your humble supplicant.</p>

            <p>I wound up running into a similar issue with my PC that was made apparent after my computer seemed to randomly clip off and restart into a "Windows Update" screen and then a serious crash of a favored video game that left text entry points filled with "8"'s.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After some headaches attempting to use the various command prompt and update-based repair options to no avail, I wound up using a fresh download of the Windows ISO and running the Upgrade again.&nbsp; It appears to have repaired the various issues I've been having

<h2>            Data channel in Edge browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Could someone help me with the following - is Data Channel supported by Edge browser? I can't find this option with Edge while with all other browsers it is ok. I want to secure browser to browser connection to ensure data transfer (chat) between two different
 edge browsers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if someone provides me with the answer or contact details of the development team that has information or solution for this case.</p>

<p>Solved it. &nbsp;Use a Western Digital 2TB hard drive. &nbsp;The 360 seems to recognise and format this. &nbsp;Looks like I'll have to use the Seagate for backing up the PS4.</p>

<p>I bought a Seagate expansion 2tb usb3 drive and I have same issues. It doesn't want to format on the 360. When I format to Fat32 on the PC, it works. When I replug that hard drive on the 360, it shows up in the storage section with the appropriate amount
 of free space. However, if I download or transfer any game to it and try to run it, the game refuses to launch. I do think that the 360 does need to format the hard drive in its own special format, perhaps FATX. However, when you format with that type of Seagate
 drive, it doesn't work.</p>

<p>No the xbox formats it to FAT32 and stores the xbox files in a hidden folder. Means you can also use it on pc and other devices as well.</p>

<p>Great! I was so happy to know that I can use my Seagate 2tb.... now I can't! Does anyone know anything about formatting partitions into your hard drive? I use my hard drive for other storage so I partitioned one into NTFS for my personal use and one in FAT32
 for the xboxv 360, but the xbox doesn't tell me the difference in the partition it will format. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I dont know if you can use partitions. The xbox will format the whole drive to fat32 and you can still use the drive with your pc because the xbox files are in a hidden content folder. only problem is fat32 only allows files up to 4GB in size which means
 you couldnt put files on it if over that size. &nbsp;</p>
<p>main problem is getting the seagate to work with xbox in the first place</p>

<p>I was able to use partitions before the change but my Xbox would only recognize one partition so I formatted the first 32GB partition of my old WD 120GB HDD as FAT32 and used it for my Xbox and formatted the rest as NTFS and just used it to backup whatever.
 Haven't tried it since they upped the cap though because there's no reason to since I can now use the whole drive.</p>
<p>Smokey:</p>
<p>It's most likely getting held up on your NTFS partition. I've had no trouble using personally formatted FAT32 devices since the change and actually got it to use NTFS without asking to reformat (DO NOT use NTFS. If your Xbox accepts it then it will be able
 to use it for storage but it will render the drive unreadable in Windows. It can be reformatted but anything you had on it will be lost.)</p>
<p>Which partition are you formatting as FAT32? I found in the past that it will only recognize the first partition.</p>
<p>This all sounds more like a problem with Seagate though (just one of many reasons why I only buy Western Digital). It may be something Microsoft is able to work out or it may just be a fundamental problem on Seagate's end. It's probably best to avoid Seagate
 for the time being.</p>

<p>Well I have at least 500-800GB used in my NTFS partition, and I don't have anything big enough to do some trial and error. Both the NTFS and the FAT32 Are both set as primary. I can set the NTFS as logical but I'm still leery about formatting it without
 being able to know exactly which one I am formatting. </p>
<p>I had a 320gb seagate in the past and I made multiple partitions of FAT32 and had a NTFS on it as well and whatever was set to primary was the drive that the xbox read. But I no longer have that drive and the constant having to go and change one from logical
 to primary and visa versa was a pain.</p>

<p>Using a 2TB Western Digital Passport Ultra with no issues formatting to be used as storage. &nbsp;However, I did notice one caveat about this System update with regard to the newly allowed large USB storage: These devices cannot be formatted as "System Storage"
 which means they cannot hold "System Updates", smaller (system cache) title updates, etc. &nbsp;Basically, these larger USB storage devices cannot be used without a 360 Hard Drive, the 4GB Internal Storage, or some other 32GB USB device to act as the "System Storage".
 &nbsp;So using a 2TB USB Drive instead of a 360 Hard Drive isn't going to work too well.</p>
<p>I guess they are limited to simply holding the game files and saves, which is great of course, but I was hoping that they would be able to act as "System Storage" as well, similar to the way the 32GB Flash Drives can.</p>

                    When trying to burn a CD, and having a blank CD-R in the DVD drive, I get "Windows can't read the disc in Drive D". I have tried other discs and DVDs but it seems Windows does not recognise a blank disc. I have another DVD drive and the same is true here

            I had the same problem in Windows 7 32-bit (suspect this would fix in Vista as well). After trying everything else under the sun went into Services (Search for programs and files, type "Services") and looked up "Shell Hardware Detection". Found that it
 was disabled (not sure how it got that way). Right clicked on it to get Properties. Changed Startup type to "Automatic", hit Apply and OK. Problem resolved without even having to reboot!<br />

<p>Hello, I was playing Halo: Reach the other day and I tried to get the Clip It. Share It. Challenge (Upload a clip to your file share) and was unable to do so. The message that showed up for me was that The Creator of this file (me) was banned from XBL. After
 a quick panic and then wondering what I could have been banned for, I decided to check it out and hit Matchmaking. It worked without a hitch, so I obviously am NOT banned from Live. Yet I still cannot upload a file to my file share. Can anyone provide help
 for me as to what the problem is and how I can fix it?</p>

<p>I am having the same issue, tried calling Xbox support and they also said to go to the forums; thing is bungie is no longer looking after support so it's up to 343 studios, I've tried posting on bungie.net forums and halo waypoint forums and the only responses
 are from other people having this problem. Does anyone know of a way to get in contact with actual game support, why is this so hard to find? Here's a link to some forums:</p>

<p>Bungie won't give you an answer, 343 won't give you an answer, and microsoft won't give you an answer, they all just blame eachother and nothing is getting resolved. The only way to bypass this is to change your gamertag and MS won't cover the cost. Such
 crap support.</p>

<p>No, I checked with 343, and they said that this was a problem with Microsoft as I am still able to join Reach's Matchmaking and earn credits, and because the message said I was banned from XBL and not from Reach.</p>

<p>Yeah I have the same issue and Microsoft said it's not on their end and the circle of crap continues. The guy below your original post said to try the bungie forums well bungie won't do anything they're done with Halo, 343 told you it's MS, and MS says it's
 bungie. This is very frustrating, I think MS should give us vouchers to change our gamertags so we can atleast try to avoid the problem or they should use the same profanity filter, why is the game using a different one than microsoft uses? Makes no sense
 to me.</p>

<p>So as expected I got a BS response from MS, don't expect to have anything ready for the competition unless you change your gamertag. They didn't read the email and thought I issues with matchmaking then gave me a link to bungie support. Here's the emails:</p>
<p>My Original Email:</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have recently run into problems in Halo Reach uploading videos to my fileshare I get the message:</p>
<p>The creator of this file is not allowed on xbox live</p>
<p>I am still able to play online and all that and have been playing Halo Reach since it came out and uploading videos with no problems, but about 2-3 days ago this started happening. I called your support line and was told to check the bungie forums, there
 are tons of people with the same problem, but Bungie isn't in charge of the Halo franchise anymore, 343 studios is. When contacted, 343 studios said it's an issue with Microsoft's filter. My friend had the same issue and it was resolved by changing his gamertag,
 thing is I'll gladly change my gamertag but I'm not paying for it since this is related to your filter, so please either find the issue with your filter or please send me some sort of voucher to change my gamertag, I don't think I should be blocked out from
 a game feature for a game I paid for on a service I'm paying for. Here are a few links to forums relating to this issue:</p>

<p>These are from a very quick search, please look into this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>The response:</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Online Support for XBOX. My name is Nica and I'll be glad to help you today.</p>
<p>I understand that you have issues playing Halo Reach online. I do apologize for the inconvenience that this has brought you.</p>
<p>If you have lost privileges in a specific game (earning credits or matchmaking bans in Reach, banned from matchmaking/rank reset performed by Treyarch in Black Ops), you will need to contact the developer in question for assistance. The Policy Enforcement
 Team does not have the ability to restore lost rank, nor can we remove matchmaking bans or restore the ability to earn credits again.</p>
<p>Please note that the Policy Enforcement Team cannot guarantee any response or result from the developer should you inquire with them. We are providing links that may assist in finding more information, as we are unable to effect any change over game-specific
 suspensions.</p>
<p>Please refer to this link for more information.</p>

<p>If you need to reply to this e-mail, please reply 'with history' (include any previous e-mail) or reference to Service Request Number &nbsp;1160608458 so we can expedite our service to you.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Xbox.com. Should you have future questions or concerns on Xbox products or services, feel free to revisit our website as we are continually adding information to enhance our service.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>My response:</p>
<p>Do you guys even read the emails? I provided all the info in the email below, I CAN play matchmaking I CAN"T upload videos. You are all pointing fingers at eachother Bungie says they are not responsible for halo anymore (understandably) 343 studios is but
 they say the issue is related to you guys MS, and you guys say its 343. I provided links to multiple forum posts about this issue in my original email, if you want check em out, there's lots of people having this problem and nothing's being done about it.
 I didn't pay $80 for the game and pay $60 a year for missing features and to be jerked around.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>And now we play the waiting game...</p>

<p>I propose we mass e-mail them by the hour/day/whatever b/c this is seriously ridiculous. I use the ever living out of my File Share an have Bungie Pro. As El Penetardo mentioned, I did not pay $60 for a game, $60 for a yearly XBL subscription and $8 a year
 for specifically File Share options.</p>
<p>Not to mention - WHY NOW?! I've been playing Reach since day one doing NOTHING different than I have except playing the game and enjoying myself and they pull this *** now?? Are they trying to **** off gamers to the point where a bunch finally say to hell
 with it and pull the PS3 Hack Scheme? B/c honestly, if it happened, I'd be pissed on my end but be happy these finger pointers finally get their comeuppance.

    <title>False Ban - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acasualpker  say:</h3>
<h2>            False Ban</h2>
                    <p>I was playing Fortnite Battle Royale with my buddy and we were both in a party chat. We started playing "Squad" mode which is a game mode where players can choose to join a team with 3 other players making a 4 man team. While experiencing our gameplay, we invited two other squad members into our xbox live party chat. One of the teamates "Lopsidedspade05" performed a "team-kill" (when a player kills their own team-mate)&nbsp;on my buddy who was also in the party chat, because Lopsidedspade05 did not recieve the weapon he wanted. After that happened, i then proceeded to team-kill lopsidedspade05. After Lopsidedspade05 called me a "baby", i called him a "baby" in retaliation,&nbsp;and my friend kicked him out of the party chat because we dont accept team killing, aka, "Unsupporting behavior/gameplay" in our group. Everything was fine and well until 15 minutes later i recieved a ban, limiting my communication with my friends, as i was unable to hear my friends, or talk to them in the curren

            <p>Support does not handle enforcement issues, so they would not be able to give you any information. The enforcement team do investigate complaints before they issue suspensions, so your suspension may not have been for that interaction but for something that took place weeks before. It may have just been a coincidence that you received it around that time.&nbsp;</p><p>No one here can say whether or not you or he deserved a ban as none of us were actually there. If he did say something that violated the code of conduct, then he will most likely receive one.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Minecraft Bedrock Edition World didn&#39;t Sync properly and now I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whicker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Bedrock Edition World didn&#39;t Sync properly and now I can&#39;t access the world.</h2>
                    <p>So I've been dealing with an issue with the Minecraft Bedrock Edition where sometimes when starting up, the world I've been building on with friends doesn't appear. The only solution I could find for this issue was to remove my account from my xbox and bring
 it back. This is what I've had to do multiple times this week. Tonight though, it didn't work right and now I got a syncing error or something where it said it didn't sync properly and to try on another xbox. (I don't have more than one xbox.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying again with various things like uninstalling/reinstalling and all that again, I got the world to appear, but clicking on it now just crashes the game dropping me back at the dashboard without so much as an error. This is honestly really depressing
 and these kinds of issues with cloud saves and all that just makes me want to avoid games with them all together considering I've never had this kind of issue on the other Minecraft versions. Doing it all again has just brought me back up one step to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Failed to Sync World Data</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The world is not fully synced or has been corrupted. Try playing the world on a console where it's in a good state and try migrating it again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there some way I can get this fixed so I can just come home and spend a few hours having fun?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Whicker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this frustrating issue with your Minecraft world data. I'd be happy to try and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would start off with clearing your console's cache and giving the power supply a reset. This is called a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle.</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait&nbsp;5 minutes.</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button&nbsp;on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, then your console may need to have a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a>. This will restore the operating system and remove any potential corruption in the console. Make sure you know you account login information as you will need to re-download the accounts onto the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try that out and let us know the results!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One drastically slows down my wifi</h2>
                    
<p>Hope this goes in this forum, I didn't see a general networking forum.</p>
<p><br />
I use a Netgear N+ router and Turbo Roadrunner internet.&nbsp; I use a wired connection to my console; It's fast and I usually experience minimal lag in-game or when using any other apps on my console.</p>
<p><br />
I've noticed that once I cut my Xbox One on my Xbox 360 (in the bedroom), desktop computer (same room), and iPad (anywhere) experienced brutally slow wifi speeds.&nbsp; Netflix (on my 360) rebuffers every 10 seconds and my iPad will often time out when I'm trying
 to surf the internet.&nbsp; However, once I cut my Xbox One off everything returns to normal.</p>

<p>Is it normal for the Xbox One to have such a drain on my wifi speed?</p>

    <title>missing settings for Bluetooth windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mvandiermen  say:</h3>
<h2>            missing settings for Bluetooth windows 8</h2>
                    if I type in 'bluetooth' in to search i find: "add a bluetooth device" and "bluetooth settings"&nbsp;<br />
I do not see "<span>Turn wireless communication on or off"&nbsp;</span><br />
and in&nbsp;<span>PC Settings screen" there is no wireless tab (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.logitech.com/assets/46450/10/windows-8-start-screen.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.logitech.com/assets/46450/10/windows-8-start-screen.jpg</a>).&nbsp;</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
if bluetooth adapter is /!\ (frozen for unknown reason, windows does not give error, just hides the link to bluetooth settings link in smartscreen).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Bluetooth 2.0 adapters&nbsp;($2 chinese ebay adapters)&nbsp;don't work in windows 8, even if device is recognised and installed. &nbsp;My bluetooth devices are working now after buying new 3.0 adapter (even though my device is 2.0)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows 8 help says:<br />
"If your PC can connect to wireless devices, check that Bluetooth is turned on. Open PC settings by swiping in from the right-hand edge of the screen and tapping&nbsp;<span>Search</span>&nbsp;(or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the top-right corner of the screen,
 moving the mouse pointer down, then clicking&nbsp;<span>Search</span>). Enter&nbsp;<span>Bluetooth</span>&nbsp;in the search box, tap or click&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>, then tap or click&nbsp;<span>Turn wireless communication on or off</span>. Under&nbsp;<span>Wireless devices</span>,
 tap or click the Bluetooth control to turn it on. "<br />
<br />
<span>When Bluetooth does not work on windows (any version), there is no message saying why.. nothing to say bluetooth is functioning or not. like clicking connect to network but not showing is any network hardware is connected.&nbsp;</span>

            <div>i love windows and microsoft but i have never liked windows bluetooth management for the reason above.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>at least in winodws 8 now I know how to diagnose if there is a problem; I search for 'bluetooth' in smartscreen and if 'change bluetooth settings' does not show, I know windows bluetooth management has stopped working / is disfunctional or bluetooth adapter
 is not connected, and I need to troubleshoot before it will work. &nbsp;Pity most people would give up before figuring that out.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>click a button to "add Bluetooth" device, it searches for over one minute, does not find anything, may as well put it in the rubbish... but could have been prevented if the same function that enables &nbsp;'change bluetooth settings' in the smart screen was
 reversed to say no adapter or adapter problem during bluetooth device search.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>if you can not find 'change bluetooth settings' in the smart screen, then bluetooth won't work!, good things to do are; &nbsp;</div>
<div>restart computer, go to Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Devices and Printers: look for a warning or timer over the bluetooth adapter icon, click on adapter icon and click troubleshoot. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Another time I had a problem with 'bluesoleil' program (not compatible with windows 8) this program also disables windows 8 from finding bluetooth devices (needs uninstall), messes up "device manager" driver (check device manager driver).</div>
<div>if you manage to find 'change bluetooth settings' then you can open it and change "allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer" and see if that helps (this should not be required).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Even if there is a bluetooth device in the the 'devices and printers' list this seems to mean nothing, driver can be installed but somehow windows ignores the adapter all together, and becuase it is not working 'change bluetooth settings' are not accessible.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes cheap hardware will not be reliable even if it works at all.<br />
<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
Turn OFF the Bluetooth device.<br />
<br />
On Computer Charms Bar -&gt; Settings -&gt; Change PC Settings -&gt; Devices<br />
<br />
HOLD the Power Button on the device for 8+ seconds until the BLUE light starts to flash.<br />
<br />
Device has entered pairing mode - on computer click "Search for Devices"<br />
<br />

BluetoothView is a small utility that runs in the background, and monitor the activity of
<br />
Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following
<br />
information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, First
<br />
Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. BluetoothView can also notify you when a
<br />
new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a
<br />
small beep sound. - FREE<br />

<br />
BluetoothCL is a small console application that dumps all current detected bluetooth devices<br />
into the standard output. For each Bluetooth device, the following information is displayed:
<br />
MAC Address, Name, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, and optionally the company
<br />
name of the device (if external file of MAC addresses - oui.txt is provided) - FREE<br />

<br />
BluetoothLogView is a small utility that monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around
<br />
you,&nbsp; and displays a log of Bluetooth devices on the main window. Every time that a new
<br />
Bluetooth device arrives to your area and when the device leaves your area, a new log line
<br />
is added with the following information: Device Name, Device Address, Event Time, Event
<br />
Type ('Device Arrival' or 'Device Left'), Device Type, and the company that created the device.
<br />
BluetoothLogView also allows you to specify a description for every device (according to its<br />
&nbsp;MAC address) that will appear under the 'Description' column. - FREE<br />

            <p>your reply is assuming that the external blue tooth devices is the one failing. The problem reported here is that the Blutooth settings options is not showing up. There blutooth antenna/or device in MY Computer is not working. As if I had no internal blutooth
 antena installed.</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot this???</p>

            Well I actually think it is a hardware issue so I would contact the manufacturer of the<br />
computer and the device.<br />
<br />
You can't fix hardware with software.<br />

<p>Hi, I guess after updating your OS &nbsp;disabled your Bluetooth for unknown reason (not really sure though).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, first you have to identify if your bluetooth device manager is working or "enabled"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Administrative Tools&gt;Computer Management&gt;System Tools&gt;Device Manager</p>
<p>then right-click &nbsp;Bluetooth at the right pane then enable it. This works to me I hope &nbsp;it helps you.</p>

<p>Go to Windows C: Drive&gt;SWSetup&gt;Drivers&gt;RaWiFi&gt;Run the setup.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you’re using mobile broadband on your Surface, your mobile operator may ask you for the IMEI and SIM ICCID numbers from your SIM card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IMEI is the International Mobile Equipment Identity. It’s a unique number used to identify your Surface. This number can be helpful if your Surface is ever lost or stolen as mobile operators may be able to block it from accessing their network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SIM ICCID is a unique number that identifies your specific SIM card. </p>
<p>To find these numbers:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap
<strong>Settings</strong>. <br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and click
<strong>Settings</strong>.)</span></li><li><span>Tap or click <strong>Change PC settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Tap or click

<p>It's a waiting game for a lot of us. If you did redeem the key through your Xbox, give it some more time. If you did not redeem the key, but you wrote it down, make sure you redeem it ASAP. Even if you do redeem it, the update will take awhile to get pushed
 to your console.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>It doesn't matter how slow your connection is, it just means that the update will take longer to download... As well as streaming and/or downloading anything....</p>
<p>And that was not a related question by the way.</p>

<p>Well the product key is a series of numbers that needs to be entered somehow, so you enter it just as you would any xboxlive code in the section on your home guide button that says redeem code...you would know this when you got your product key as it gives
 you step by step instructions with pictures and everything on how to do it. But i guess you were in too much of a hurry...well, now you know, and knowing is half the battle. &gt;cue music&lt;</p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer not working properly</h2>
                    <p><em>---Original Title: Windows Photo Viewer---</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Windows 10 to my PC 15 days ago. I put Windows Photo Viewer as the default program. It turns out that this program opens already waging, "not responding". Then, I have to shut it down immediately.</p>
<p>What can be done about it. I like this program a lot and I want it to be my default program.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot and waiting for a solution as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Hi Thais,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: </p>
<p>1. Are&nbsp;you unable to&nbsp;open&nbsp;a particular file with Windows Photo Viewer? &nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;What&nbsp;do you refer by "program opens already waging, "not responding". "? Please briefly explain and also mention any error message you receive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;the issue is that you are unable to open a photo with Windows Photo viewer then try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the video and select <strong>Open with...</strong>.&nbsp;if "Open With..." option expands then select
<strong>Choose Another App</strong> otherwise move to the next step.</p>
<p>2. A new window will open, under <strong>Other Options</strong> search for <strong>
More Apps</strong>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Search and select&nbsp;<strong>Windows Photo Gallery</strong>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Check </strong>the box for <strong>Always use this app to open .&lt;</strong>file_type<strong>&gt; files</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Any further information would be helpful. </p>
<p>

According to your answer, there is no solution. I have to choose another program/app default to open my photos. I wish I could use the Windows Photo Viewer, which is the program that I like the most.&nbsp;</div>

Is it a problem and issue from WIndows 10, which I installed in July 25, 2016? Should I return to Windows 8.1 for this program to work? Or there is no relation to that?</div>

<h2>            prnntfy.dll error problem.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a new DELL Vostro 220, running Windows 7, 32-bit. &nbsp;I am trying to print Supper-B (13x19) and/or Tabloid (11x17) on an HP Officejet Pro K8600 printer. &nbsp;The printer works fine with anything that is Letter (8-1/2 x 11), but when I try to print to a larger
 format, it still only prints out to Letter size.</p>
<p>I spent 3 hours on the phone with HP Support last week, and they sent me a new printer. &nbsp;I installed the new printer, and still had the same problem. &nbsp; I spent another 2 hours tonight with HP Support - thinking (insisting!) it is a problem with their printer
 driver. &nbsp;They feel it is not a problem with their driver - but something wrong with Windows 7.</p>
<p>During some print tests, - in particular, while trying to delete/cancel a print job from the print cue - I started getting a message saying that "prnntfy.DLL is not working properly". &nbsp;I now suspect my problem has something to do with this Windows .DLL.</p>
<p>Can anybody help?</p>
<p>Thanks, Brian.</p>

<p>...some additional info. &nbsp;I now know the problem IS with Windows 7 - and most likely prnntfy.dll. &nbsp;I installed the HP printer driver on an old laptop with Windows 2000 - and everything works fine from that machine/OS....</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the printer troubleshooter and check if that can fix your issue.</p>
<p>Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>Also perform SFC scan on your computer.</p>
<p>System File Checker (sfc) scan will make Windows replace corrupt or missing system files on your computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Steps to perform sfc scan:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see the following on-screen messages:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Verification % complete.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:<br />
…&nbsp; found no integrity violations<br />
…&nbsp; found corruption but repaired it<br />
…&nbsp; found corruption that it could not repair<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Umesh and Allan</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick feedback and suggestions. &nbsp;I ran the SRC - and it reported the following:</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.</p>
<p>Details are included in the CBS.log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. &nbsp;For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I viewed the contents of the file - but cannot make sense of it myself (I don't know this stuff!). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allan - I found the prnntfy.dll file and in my system it shows it as 172 kb and the date stamp of 13/07/2009 10:46 PM &nbsp;(4-1/2 hrs. younger than the one you listed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do do now?</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<p>I'll set my time zone back to Pacific now.</p>
<p>I assume you are using the print driver that is included in Windows 7.&nbsp; You are not the only one with the large format printing as Letter issue.&nbsp; It's not just your machine.</p>

<p>Yes, Newfoundland time to be exact. &nbsp;I was assuming the time stamp was the time of compilation of the file.</p>
<p>I checked the link you sent - so it DOES seem to be a problem with the HP driver for Windows 7. &nbsp;Is this correct from your standpoint? &nbsp;Or might Microsoft have a solution?</p>
<p>(After 5 hours on the phone with HP - I'm a bit surprised they didn't seem to know about that thread!!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What about the errors that couldn't be fixed by the SRC scan?....</p>

<p>HP had a very similar issue with the CP 1700 were the definitions for the paper constraints in the printer description file did not allow Tabloid printing in Vista unless you modified the GPD file for the printer.&nbsp; Bob Headrick is going to know any current
 solutions for the HP devices.&nbsp; He hangs out here and in the HP forums.&nbsp; I did take a look at the GPD file for this printer included in Windows 7 but nothing jumped out at me.&nbsp; Even the InvalidConfigurations in the file pointed to Poster settings using small
 paper sizes.</p>
<p>Let me know of Bob can point you to a solution.&nbsp; If not I'll ask the HP driver developer who works in Redmond to ask around but he's not going to contact the support group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not suprised with HP support, I'm sure not all the support team reads the forum posts.&nbsp; The Redmond based HP developer fixed about 20 broken HP GPD files that shipped in Vista (all the same duplex orientation bug) which&nbsp; Bob and I distributed around
 the world for over 2&nbsp;years after Vista was released.&nbsp; HP finally released the fixes to Windows Update.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure Bob&nbsp;hands out the text based editted files that fix the issue even today.&nbsp; HP support never had a mechanism to replace just the one file.&nbsp;
 I don't totally blame HP for that since we at MS do not have a solutions for vendors to implement a one file change without jumping through a bunch of hoops.</p>
<p>I'm still concerned with the prnntfy.dll error you are receiving.</p>

            Thanks for the info Alan...sorry to sound like a 'customer' - but what does a guy do when he's stuck with a product that won't work properly - and we don't know if its a HP or a MS problem? &nbsp;It's really such a simple issue - we've been building printer
 drivers for 25 years now!! &nbsp;Why the hassle?

<p>Add a post on HP.com.&nbsp; I sent Bob a piece of mail.&nbsp; From my experience, this is an issue with the definitions in the GPD for the device.&nbsp; Compare the settings from the working GPD in Windows 2000.&nbsp; You can locate the gpd file in the print drivers directory
 \windows\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\3.&nbsp; It's a text based file, use Notepad to view the contents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not recommend incorporating any changes between the file but you could save the Windows 7 version with a different name, then copy the 2000 version to Windows 7 using the name of the file the driver needs in Windows 7.&nbsp; There is a BUD file that uses
 the same filename as the gpd version that would need to be deleted on Windows 7, then reboot the machine.&nbsp; The first time the print driver is invoked, it will create a new BUD file.</p>
<p>OR&nbsp;create a Custom Form that approachs the Super B size.&nbsp; You can use the Super B size to create the custom form.&nbsp; This may even work since the print driver will no longer be printing to Super B but to&nbsp; MYFORM instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a command prompt type</p>
<p>printui /s&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assume you are using the driver that HP included in Windows 7.&nbsp; If not please correct me.</p>

<p>I tried the doing the MYFORM thing, but it didn't make any difference.</p>
<p>With the .gpd file - the version I have in Windows 2000 looks identical (in data/time/size) as the Windows 7 version. &nbsp;I copied it over anyway - but am having trouble with the .BUD file.</p>
<p>There are two sets of files relating to the K8600 in that directory. &nbsp;One is names (prefixed) "hph86003" (the same name as in Windows 2000), and the other is "hpk8600t" (no equivalent in the W2000 dir.). &nbsp;There is a hpk8600t.BUD file, but no BUD file for
 hph86003. &nbsp;I tried deleting the hpk8600t.BUD file, but Windows will not allow me - (saying Access denied).</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>

<p>Disk defragmentation is the process of consolidating fragmented data on a volume (such as a hard disk or a storage device) so it will work more efficiently. However, you cannot perform disk defragmentation on SSD.</p>
