<h2>            Windows 7 Driver for SCSI&#92;CdRom HL-DT-STDVDRRW_GSA-H30L</h2>
                    I have a H-P Pavillion, it came with a LightScribe drive. &nbsp;And Windows Vista OS, after HD failure I did a clean install of Windows 7Pro. &nbsp;Everything ran fine, until last week.
<div>Here's what I think happened, we have several computers, laptops, and tablets on a home network. &nbsp;And somehow my wife's Windows 8 computer, corrupted my Windows 7 system.</div>
<div>I have re-installed Windows 7 Pro and the disk worked fine on the CD, but no DVD. &nbsp;I checked the Hardware IDs for the drive: 1)SCSI\CDRom HL-DT-STDVDRRW_GSAH30L_s856 &nbsp; 2)SCSI\CDRom HL-DT-STDVDRRW_GSAH30L_ &nbsp;3)SCSI\CDRom HL-DT-ST &nbsp;4)SCSI\HL-DT-STDVDRRW_GSAH30L_s
 &nbsp; 5)\HL-DT-STVDDRRW_GSAH30Ls &nbsp;6)Gen CDRom and the Compatible IDs : SCSI\CDRom &nbsp;2) SCSI\RAW.</div>
<div>And now the driver is cdrom.sys. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>The H-P driver update is sp41134, but it only works on vista and will not install in compatibility mode.</div>
<div>So I'm asking for help? or a new driver. &nbsp;Before I take it to the next level, opening the box and ripping out the drive&nbsp;</div>

            It's hard to see how "somehow my wife's Windows 8 computer, corrupted my Windows 7 system."<br />
You say you did a "clean install of Windows 7Pro. &nbsp;Everything ran fine, until last week."&nbsp; For how long?<br />
<br />
I suspect a hardware failure.&nbsp; Optical drives use 2 lasers and it is possible for one to fail allowing only CD or DVD use.&nbsp; CDROM.SYS is typically shown as the driver for DVD drives (It is for both of mine (along with another related driver).&nbsp; In my experience,
 light scribe drives typically use the standard Windows driver with additional software from the manufacturer for the light scribe function.&nbsp; Since it worked initially with your Windows 7 reinstall, it seems unlike to require the HP driver for basic functionality.<br />
<br />
There is also a registry problem that sometimes may be involved. It wouldn't hurt to run the MS Fixit here, though I think it's a long shot.<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/cd_dvd_drive_problems<br />
<br />
(As a tech I would probably test the drive in another computer to positively identify whether there is a hardware failure, but I realize this may not be practical for you.)<br />

    <title>Speakers missing from Device Manager - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Speakers missing from Device Manager - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using PS4 Remote, I had problems with my sound card not recognising my speakers - it would default to the speaker on the PS4 Controller, and I was unable to use the 3.5mm jack output. I uninstalled PS4 Remote, but this did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I then took are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted the Speakers from Device Manager in the hope that a re-boot would re-install them, but this did not work. I don't know how to get them back on Device Manager. This is what Device Manager looks like now:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f56ab91-aac6-4c95-81c6-085897811d20?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f56ab91-aac6-4c95-81c6-085897811d20?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then attempted to use the NVIDIA Digital Audio by using the HDMI output, using a HDMI adaptor I bought which converts sound into a 3.5mm jack. It worked ONCE, the first time I did it, and has not worked since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what my Playback devices look like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/117b44e9-2809-4bf3-95d6-0f49ccb20755?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/117b44e9-2809-4bf3-95d6-0f49ccb20755?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see - no disabled speakers to enable, and I can't enable the NVIDIA output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice with what to do would be hugely appreciated. I have already done a Win10 Re-set and that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks loads if you can help!<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that there are conflicts with the drivers that is causing the system to detect it.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already been through those steps, but it hasn't resolved anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue revolves around the fact that I deleted the 'speakers' icon from Device Manager, and can't recover it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. We suggest that you do a system restore of your device. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/e6bbddb0-9db4-4d88-9063-42c52c79a96e/create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>create
 a restore point manually</strong></a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;button, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>control panel<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong>then choose&nbsp;it from the list of results.</li><li>Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check, go to the <strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for <strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select
<strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Configure System Restore</strong> &gt; <strong>Configure</strong> and make sure
<strong>Turn on system protection </strong>is selected.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, one of the steps I took was to use recovery and do a Windows re-set, so there are no restore points prior to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there are two issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When trying to sort out my sound after using PS4 Remote, which changed the PS4 Controller to default play-back device, I deleted 'speakers' from Device Manager which I am now unable to re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) PS4 Remote seems to have been the cause of the issue. I have just re-installed it using the USB Controller receiver and hey presto, the controller is again recognised as the default playback device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Playback devices now looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbaed24f-dc82-49a2-9a74-e882d1cd57ce?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dbaed24f-dc82-49a2-9a74-e882d1cd57ce?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather re-set the system without PS4 Remote, but it is currently the only way I can get sound from the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any threads on Sony forums about this issue, so no idea what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of taking the desktop to the PC repair shop in town and seeing what they think!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help so far.</p>

            Hi LieslMae, that is caused by a Keyboard language issue, the solution depends on the version of Windows you are running . . . 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button and just type winver then hit Enter 
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, note the version (1709, 1803 . .. etc.) of Windows 10 you are running 
<br />
<br />
<br />1. 
<br />If that version is not version 1803: 
<br />
<br />Open the Control Panel - Language 
<br />
<br />Click Options on the right hand side of your current language 
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />In options if the appropriate language does not appear, click 'Add input Method' 
<br />
<br />Add the appropriate language if necessary 
<br />Move the appropriate language to the top, if necessary 
<br />
<br />Make that the default language 
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT - delete any language(s) not required 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It! 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />2. 
<br />If that version is 1803: 
<br />
<br />Hi , there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10. Microsoft are aware of this issue and hopefully are working on a patch . . . 
<br />
<br />For the moment, please try this workaround to set your preferred input language: 
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter 
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-GB 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Then run this command to set the order of installed input languages 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC

What you're experiencing is NORMAL.&nbsp; Defender is not really designed to run in the background.&nbsp; (However it's 'software explorer' feature is extremely useful).&nbsp; If receiving this prompt is bothersome, simply 'disable' it from running at startup.&nbsp; CCleaner and
 Glary Utilities both have user-friendly 'start-up menu'&nbsp;editors&nbsp;if you're unsure how to disable a start-up&nbsp;program from within Windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you need to uninstall and re-install Windows Defender, I'd recommend going to the
<strong>Windows Defender Download Details</strong> page.&nbsp; I suspect you can simply 'run' the newly downloaded program and it will overwrite any existing Windows Defender files.&nbsp;&nbsp; After you re-install, be sure to go to the
<strong>Updated Definitions</strong> page and download the most current Defender definitions.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Good Luck <br />

<h2>            &#58;&#40; Your PC ran into a problem - Win10 Reinstall</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my PC running windows 10 displayed the message <strong>:( your PC ran into a problem&nbsp;</strong>and requested a restart in order to fix the problem but unfortunately it got stuck in a loop:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>RESTART--&gt; PREPARING AUTOMATIC REPAIR --&gt; DIAGNOSING YOUR PC --&gt; RESTART --&gt; PREPARING AUTOMATIC REPAIR --&gt;&nbsp;DIAGNOSING YOUR PC --&gt; RESTART ..........</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I decided to go for the advanced options hoping to solve the problem, but unfortunately this was not the case as each option generated an error as detailed below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-Continue to Windows 10</strong>: this option would just take me back to the AUTOMATIC REPAIR loop</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Troubleshoot section I tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>-Reset PC</strong> (both options,&nbsp;keep my files and remove everything yielded the same result): There was&nbsp;a problem resetting your pc. no changes were made
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Advaced options, <strong>System Restore</strong>: Indicated there were no restore points available, which was quite surprising since I have used this tool several times in the past&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;I expected some restore points being available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Advanced options <strong>System Image</strong>: It directed me to an image dating back to 2012, which I immediately discarded as a viable option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>Startup Repair:</strong> says that it could not repair the pc</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried the <strong>CMD</strong>&nbsp; to run an sfc/scannnow but it wouldn't run as it said that there&nbsp;was a system repair pending, which in turn&nbsp;was stuck in a loop as described above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-<strong>Startup Settings:</strong> again sends me back to the windows repair loop upon restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>- <strong>Go back to previous build</strong>: We rain into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having tried all the available options and due to&nbsp;my need to carry on with&nbsp;work on the PC as soon as possible, I decided to format the hard drive and reinstall windows 7 (the version from which I upgraded to win 10 a couple of weeks ago).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has been successfully installed and updated but I can't find a way to reinstall Windows 10 again, I downloaded the media creation tool to download the software but&nbsp;when attempting to upgrade this pc it asks me for a product key which I cant find
 anywhere on my MS account and&nbsp;Windows update won't show any available updates for Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to My Devices in my MS account I can see that my PC is added to the list of devices but can't really do much else from there, not sure whether removing it from the list would allow me to reinstall Win 10 elsewhere (this same pc actually but well...)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping someone out there could share the right knowledge that could help me get back to Win 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>In advanced, thank you very much for all the help and advice you can provide</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see you didn't read the post in full &nbsp;since you were suggesting something that had already been tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Windows 7 has been successfully installed and updated but I can't find a way to reinstall Windows 10 again,

<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, after a few days of working with windows 7 the system finally offered to upgrade again to win 10 so we could say that the problem &nbsp;"resolved" itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am pretty upset with Microsoft. After that many years, window is still not a stable product. I had Windows 10 installed when I purchased my Samsung laptop. Recently, it showed ":( Your PC ran into problem" and reboot unpredictably from time to time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked on the web and found this link and other links. They told me to do SFC /scannow. I did and it did not show problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Microsoft help directly. The virtual agent pointed me to this link again which did not help. I saw some tools on the web claimed that it can automatically fix the problem. I am not sure if these tool will bring virus and don't want to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son had a Macbook air for 5 years. Never had any problem like this. Why is Microsoft not able to (i) improve robustness of product (ii) There are many reports of this problems on the web. Why can't Microsoft provide an official guideline or tool to fix
 the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be honest, if user has to use command mode to fix registry, etc for issues, then I think windows will not have future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give me a solution?</p>

    <title>List-view for Explorer Folders containing vast empty space between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mailer_  say:</h3>
<h2>            List-view for Explorer Folders containing vast empty space between rows past Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>I am having a pretty considerable problem with my folder-viewing since the "Feature Update" of this December. (Installed it at 12/07/2017).</p>
<p>For some reason, after having updated my OS, the folder-view known as "List" has been dramatically changed and doesn't even look close to how it used to look before I updated. Now, for whatever god-awful reason, excuse my frustration, every division between
 rows has been dramatically widened, which results in a vast empty space between every row. This defeats the purpose of the List-view almost completely because I solely used it for the reason that it was compact and that I did not have any issues finding folders
 in a mish-mash of text.</p>
<p>Refer to the following exhibits for further clarification of what I am talking about:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63f65779-f687-4979-bbbc-224b7429a67d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63f65779-f687-4979-bbbc-224b7429a67d" /></a></p>
<p>This view...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...now looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e10aabec-75b2-4db2-9795-e804dee4b533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e10aabec-75b2-4db2-9795-e804dee4b533" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I have not accidentally added a row of spaces after any of the file-names. This is genuinely how I was greeted to my folder when I opened it in the appropriate view for the first time. You may also notice that the box, in which you may click to access
 a file, even reaches out as far as to cover these empty spaces, for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any new configuration which I haven't been informed of, which let's me revert this very annoying effect within my folders, or is this just an intended feature that some bulb-head thought would be clever and would help users find their files?</p>
<p>I am not against reverting to an old update for the time being, but if there is ANY solution to this that let's me stay secure with my operating system, then I would be very grateful to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading - Best wishes, Mailer.<br />

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Mine looks similar, but there is some adjustment allowed when you click on it with mouse and then zoom with mouse wheel or + or - keys.  But if your problem is the extra space between rows I still have that.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If there's no change then it must be intentional, for what reason I can't fathom.  There are way too many changes being made for no real good reason and it is annoying consumers greatly.  MVP's will continue to advocate to calm this down.  
<br />
<br />The best tutorial on customizing of the many I found is Shawn's here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/34119-change-folder-view-layout-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/34119-chang...</a>.  He may have extra suggestions if you ask in the tutorial comments.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello, Greg. Thank you for your kind answer and supposed agreement on the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, because none of the suggestions made has yielded any improvements to my folder-layout, I may only assume that this change is here to stay with the new update, unless it were to magically be reverted in the future due to a major outcry of users.</p>
<p>However, until then, because of the business which I desire to use this operating system for, thus putting "folder-views" as one of the greatest of priorities for continued "Windows Explorer"-pleasure, I am going to have to revert my Windows Update until
 further notice of a change, or alternatively, if any other viable and great suggestions, that could solve the problem, should be brought up at this question, or the alternative tutorial which was suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for offering your help, however. I am very grateful, despite the negative outcome of this update, from my perspective. I may give this issue another night cycle to brew before eventually reverting back, using the Windows Update Agent.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IT SHOULD BE NOTED HOWEVER:</strong> That this issue seems to not be exclusive only to the List-view as I repeatedly notice, through multiple UIs of the Windows Explorer, that many icons are stretched to the right, so as to make their boxes unusually,
 but also unnecessarily wide to the right-hand side. the same UI-change has essentially happened upon the "This-PC"-window as well as any generic folder, which may help troubleshoot the issue, or further acknowledge the fact that many changes have been made
 recently, despite never been asked for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards. - Mailer</p>

<p>Oh dear, oh dear. As if I wasn't in a dire situation enough, it now seems that I am also unable to open the Windows menu, using the button in the bottom-left of my desktop. Pressing it down yields absolutely nothing, yet right clicking it does.
</p>
<p>The one time I was aiming to shut down the computer by doing this, I soon realized something else was completely wrong, as when shutting down the computer the other way apparently just kicked me back to the desktop ten seconds after the "gray spinning progression
 window of shutting down" appeared.</p>
<p>Am I not allowed to shut down my operating system anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at loss for words given my situation after this update. I may very well not last a night more of this, thus I am going to bail on this update for the time being.</p>
<p>My genuine concern cannot be expressed here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Most of my other Windows features, resting on the toolbar, does not seem to be responding either at this time. I am hoping that everything is disputedly okay with my operating system.</p>

<br />Easiest is to press Ctrl Alt Del keys to get blue screen, mouse or Tab to the Power icon in the bottom right corner, hold the Shift key while you Restart from there.  
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot Options, Then Advanced Troubleshoot, then More options to get to Go Back to old Version.

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Hi, Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I booted up my operating system the following day to find that nothing would happen past entering my credentials. The screen showed black and nothing, besides the cursor, was appearing at all. Thankfully, through some miracle I was
 actually able to access the CTRL+ALT+DEL menu and repeat the steps as suggested above to go back to a previous build of Windows.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">However, my glare of hope was quickly diminished when I was greeted with an error message upon prompting a Windows revert, as it claimed that there was some kind of error rendering it impossible to restore back to an older version.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">As such, I am currently restoring my operating system through a tedious process which is slowly progressing at around 47% at the time of writing.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">While I am somewhat thankful that this seems to be a purely OS-driven problem, this whole update-process has essentially been Microsoft giving me the middle-finger, with everything seeming to be okay when in reality this was not
 the case. I really hope that this turn of events won't repeat themselves the moment I end up having to update my OS again in the near future, but considering what has happened as a result of previous events, I am going to be extremely sceptical about any future
 updates that gets released to the public.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Naturally, this could all be some kind of coincidence, as I have no way of telling what actually caused this pile-up of problems, especially considering that my computer had been running perfectly fine up until this point when I
 had just finished updating to the "Feature update".</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Whether or not the initial question I had listed on this thread is solved at this stage or not remains to be seen, hillariously, but if anything else happens that I feel should be notified regarding the restoration of my life's work,
 practically, I'll be informing the community about it, either here or in another thread.</p>

<p><strong>HUGE UPDATE ON THE SITUATION, I AM DOING O.K.:&nbsp;</strong>Against my own personal belief, it seems that about 99% of all my files are still in the system where they should be, which is a major mood-swinger in itself. This only further raises my confusion
 as to why Microsoft printed an HTML document to my desktop which strictly suggested that almost every single one of my apps had been removed from the system when they are still there. The only thing that broke was some of the file-paths specified within them,
 which is manageable and can be fixed.</p>
<p>Despite this strange miss-match of information, it seems that some other very specific files were however not so lucky, such as Java and Google Chrome (which was my preferred browser), as well as my Antivirus system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am going to have to question Microsoft's attempts at getting me to use their shoddy software like Microsoft Edge, and "Cortana", both of which, among a lot of other included freeware tools, have miraculously appeared from the dead again. Because despite
 their honorable attempts of trying to shut down my OS with their latest update, I am not going to be using their products any more than I initially planned to, believe it or not, though I doubt this was their intention to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum it all up, I am essentially back where I started with some minor tweaks waiting to be re-done, as always, which makes me sort of relieved in a way, though not forgetting the rollercoaster of events that have been played out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I should be more or less fine from hereon out, despite probably making the whole scenario out to be worse than it actually turned out to be, not to mention that I do have a bright idea for getting the folder-view back as I please it, but regardless
 I am obviously still open to any suggestions if anybody has an idea if it's possible to customize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I sincerely apologize if I have made this issue stretch a lot further than it should have from the beginning, but it feels good to finally be back on track, more or less, for which I have people, such as Greg, to sincerely thank for all the help.</em></p>

            Sounds better.   
<br />
<br />May I ask what antivirus you use?  Those of us who help in forums and see the most cases realize that almost any 3rd party antivirus can cause problems, and some like MacAfee or Norton are the worst thing you can install to Windows.  So the fact the Upgrade choked so badly on the antivirus that it removed it is instructive.  I'd suggest leaving it out and using built-in Defender for best protection.  
<br />
<br />Have you done a Clean Install yet?  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues.  For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I run <strong>ESET NOD32</strong> as my Antivirus and it's been very cooperative alongside Windows Defender which is why I am not very concerned about it. It is possible that the antivirus did butcher the update package, hence why so many problems occurred.
 With this in mind, I may choose to resort to solely Windows Defender when asking the OS to update itself upon shutting down next time, as you suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am perfectly aware of these rogue antivirus software, as you describe them, hence I avoid them at all costs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am not aware of a case where a sophisticated antivirus (a safe antivirus by which I mean) scans a Windows Update package and manipulates it so as to break it. I personally thought this couldn't happen because of Microsoft certificates and such
 but I could be proven wrong here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, after essentially restoring my OS, and PC, to it's initial status, the preferred status that is, I noticed that the list of "Apps and Features", which Windows tends to base itself on when offering un-installation and repair of some
 programs is extremely short. It doesn't include any of the programs that still exist on my D: Drive, which in this case is just the rest of my data that I don't want to keep around next to the Primary, Boot, and Page File Partition C:</p>
<p>This leads me to the assumption that my OS *thinks* that these programs are in-fact gone, or were removed when it reset itself, yet they somehow managed to stick around and now it blatantly ignores them even though they still exist. Even a third-party software,
 such as CCleaner doesn't seem to know that they exist either which is extremely peculiar, which only leaves me more confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What further proves my point is that once I do add another program to my D: drive, being the few that were actually removed, the OS does recognize them as normal, yet it doesn't find the others that are already there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I suppose if I want to uninstall something, I will just have to do it manually from it's directory from now on, which is not really an issue for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider it a weird behavior on the OS's part if you will, but this is not the only peculiar, and somewhat humorous thing that Windows 10 has done for me in the past:</p>

<p>Finally, this is my presentation of the "DIY"-solution to the question which I initially asked:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8f2aa5b-c8b7-48fc-9608-f9b2c3250e7b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8f2aa5b-c8b7-48fc-9608-f9b2c3250e7b" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Essentially, every row is now it's own window, which, while it does the job decently, it's not nearly as convenient and flashy as the "list"-view used to be before the recent update. Of course, I am not required to contain every folder in a sequence of one-another,
 but this is only for organization's sake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution is obviously not going to hold forever, thus if anybody does find a alternative suggestion, I would be greatly interested. But for now, this will have to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, if there is a software that let's me connect these multiple windows together in a neat fashion, while also being free, that would be of equal interest to me if anybody has any suggestions.</p>

                    <p>I'm using Windows Movie Maker and I have a video I would like to include in it, but when I try to put a copy of it from my computer in the movie, it plays slower than normal. The
 only way to get it to play normally is to use the original from a memory card. However, if I take the memory card out of my computer, even if I put re-insert it before I open up the movie again, the video doesn't work. It has a yellow triangle with an exclamation
 point inside, like it does when a file is missing, but when I click on it, Windows Movie Maker asks if I want to fix it not find it. But when I click "fix," then click on the video, even from the same location on the memory card, nothing changes. I have even
 tried deleting it from the movie, then adding the same file again, but it still says it needs to be fixed. Once this has happened and I exit out of Windows Movie Maker, and then later try to open the movie, I get a message that reads: "Sorry, Movie Maker can't
 open this project file. The file might not be compatible with Windows Live Movie Maker or be corrupted. Please select a different file," and I can't open the project again, even to fix the problem. Is there any way to open it again? I do not want to lose this
 movie.</p>

    <title>Frequently disconnecting from xbox live after system update. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Frequently disconnecting from xbox live after system update.</h2>
                    Since the system update released on November 12th, the console has been disconnecting from xbox live extremely frequently. I am 99% certain that it is the update that has caused this, as this issue was not happening prior to the update, and a friend has
 also been having these same issues after the update.

<p>My Xbox One is driving me crazy since I updated it a week ago. Connecting to the internet takes ages everyday and I restart the Xbox and my router x times till it somehow works. I say somehow because it looks as if my connection was from 1998. As it seems
 I am not the only one. What went wrong with the Windows 10 basement? I am very upset :-( :-(</p>

<h2>            No response to contact requests.  Cannot connect with individuals whom I know are on line and they cannot connect with me.</h2>
                    In recent weeks I have sent contact requests to five individuals. None of them were received. I was eventually able to connect with four of the five. While communicating by telephone I tried to connect with the fifth individual today. When I try to connect
 with her it rings once and I get a Call - No answer warning. When she tries to call me, she gets the same. While talking by phone she contacted her daughter via Skype and had a brief chat with her. In the past, my contact requests went through and I generally
 had no problem in connecting with folks. Windows 7 64 bit - IE 11.0.9600.1872 Update 11.0.45.&nbsp; Skype 7.40.0.103

            Hi RameeshaN,
<br />
<br />The first thing I notice is the Feedback hub is using 29.7% of your Processor?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Background Apps
<br />
<br />Turn off all non-essential apps form running in the background of Windows 10 - especially the Feedback hub . . .
<br />
<br />Close the Settings App
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hir Enter to open the Services App
<br />
<br />Scroll down to find 'Superfetch'
<br />
<br />Double click that, if it is started, stop it and set its Startup type to Disabled
<br />
<br />Restart your PC       
        </p>

<h2>            KB940520 not accessible for BITS fix, which will hopefully be a Host Process fix.</h2>
                    <p>Host process stopped error on Windows Vista SP2.&nbsp; Trying to use recommended BITS repair KB940520 but it is not accessible.&nbsp; I click on the download, I get a validation request.&nbsp; I run the validation (it works), then the CONTINUE button kicks me to a generic
 Microsoft product page.&nbsp; When I navigate from this page to the KB940520 download, I get a validation request....and so it goes, round &amp; round.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine is Toshiba Satellite laptop.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, I suddenly got an error message that the copy of Windows was not genuine, which was quite a surprise as I am the original owner of this laptop.&nbsp; This issue was resolved with a phone call to an automated
 system which gave me a 16 (or maybe more) digit code to enter.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;You'll need to contact the manufacturer of the PC to get the driver.&nbsp; If it's a desktop, you can always buy an inexpensive sound card if you can't get the driver you need.&nbsp; If it's a laptop, you've just about got to get a Windows 7 compatible driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

<h3> cravonmantis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t recognize resolution more than 640x480</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Pro, I have an Nvidia GTX 980 Video card and a pair of Dell U2414 monitors. All of my BIOS and graphics card drivers are up to date. The monitors are being read as Generic PnP Monitors which is the recommended setting by Microsoft
 and Dell. I am using, or trying to use, Display Port inputs on the monitors from the video card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will not let me set the resolution to anything above 640x480. </p>
<p>Here's what I get in the resolution dialog. (note this is even the case in the NVidia control panel)</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ef097c7-8454-4697-b13a-c2b58c77ac9c" /></p>
<p>It worked for a while after install, then it went into this screwed up mode and won't recover. I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating Graphics card drivers</li><li>Updating monitor drivers and even using the Dell U2414 specific drivers</li><li>Using the on board video</li><li>Reinstalling Windows 10 completely clean. (note immediately after install it worked fine, then after a few minutes it freaked out and went back to being locked in to 640x480)</li><li>Uninstalling the various components in the chain from Device manager and letting them be rediscovered and the drivers reinstalled.
</li><li>Switching form Display Port 1.2 and back to Display Port 1 on the monitors</li><li>Unplugging absolutely everything else, including other hard drivers and all USB peripherals.
</li><li>Reinstalling all motherboard drivers including chipset, RAM, and disk controllers etc.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that worked is switching to HDMI but there is only one HDMI port on the video card and I have two monitors.&nbsp; Besides, this is just stupid seeing as how this was all working just fine in Windows 8.1 and the first time I installed Windows 10,
 it worked fine for a couple hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think that Windows 10 can't cope with display ports.&nbsp; Since I can't believe that's the case, can anyone tell me if they've seen this or how to fix it?
</p>
<p>

            <p>I came across a post on the Dell forums that solved it. (<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/4997/t/19644071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/4997/t/19644071</a> )</p>
<p>There is some kind of saved setting problem in the Dell 2414 series monitors.&nbsp; If you run in to this problem here is the fix:</p>
<p><strong>Unplug the monitor for about a minute, enough for all of the capacitors and any static to discharge from the monitor. Then, plug it back in. It will come back with full resolution capability.

options from the list. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Next to run the Troubleshooter. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right-click on the&nbsp;setup file&nbsp;of the driver installation package and click on "Properties".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box "Run this program in compatibility mode for” and select previous Operating System from the drop down.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</span></p>

<h2>            MS PDF Reader App bug - it doesn&#39;t support nTrig stylus eraser</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Vaio Duo 11, a Windows 8 tablet, and the eraser button on my stylus causes the Reader app to show an eraser icon, however the stylus won't actually erase, it'll just add more marks to the page.&nbsp; I've tried other nTrig styli to no avail, also
 I've confirmed the problem with other Vaio Duo users, I've confirmed that the nTrig eraser does work in other apps (like OneNote), and finally I've confirmed that the Reader app does support the eraser function if you are using a Wacom stylus on a tablet with
 Wacom hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this buggy implementation and support of the nTrig eraser, and if not, is there a way that I can more directly contact the team that works on the Reader app so as to inform them of this bug?&nbsp; In its current state the reader app is
 useless to all nTrig users who wish to annotate PDFs.</p>

            I hate when I post questions and don't get a courteously quick response.&nbsp; I will hook you up friend.&nbsp; I believe the only way to erase is to close without saving and start again.&nbsp; The app itself doesn't support undo or erasing.&nbsp; Measure twice and cut once
 as they say.

            The app does support erasing when using a Wacom stylus.&nbsp; It SHOULD support the eraser when using an N-Trig stylus, as you actually get an eraser icon when pushing the eraser button on the stylus, however, the implementation is buggy as trying to erase
 simply adds more markings.

            Yay! MS completely ignores a legitimate and most likely very easily&nbsp;fixed&nbsp;bug... I guess even giving a response is beyond worthwhile huh?. &nbsp;GOD I can't wait for Apple to come out with a version of OS X that supports touch, the MS&nbsp;software&nbsp;engineers who
 work on Windows these days are so incompetent these days&nbsp;its&nbsp;laughable.

            I just purchased the Sony Duo 13 and the erase function does not work in the reader app even though the erase icon shows.&nbsp; Like others on this thread, it just adds more ink. Works fine in OneNote though. One of the main reason I purchased the Duo was to
 annotate pdfs in tablet mode. This is a major flaw. Wish I had seen this thread earlier!

            <p>Hi RadiAnt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft has still neither to respond nor fix this very simple bug.&nbsp; In the meantime, I suggest that you do as I did and move away from the MS PDF Reader app.&nbsp; Try "Drawboard PDF" from the app store, it doesn't render as well and once in
 a blue moon it corrupts file saves (so keep backups), but its inking capabilities and eraser support far surpass MS's solution.</p>

            I too am having this issue with my Asus Taichi. &nbsp;I push the button to erase, the eraser appears, but it just keeps drawing lines. &nbsp;Very frustrating, as this was one of the main reasons I purchased this device.
<div><br />
<div>I've given Drawboard PDF a try, but every time I save the PDF document, I can no longer open it up in Windows Reader. &nbsp;It concerns me that it is corrupting the save file every time.</div>

<div>Surely Microsoft will fix this serious bug?</div>

            Microsoft has FINALLY fixed, this issue with the latest release of the Reader App. It is still very disappointing that Ms never actually responded to any of the multiple threads on this issue over the entire year that users have had to deal with stylus
 issues in its PDF app.

<h2>            Loads of BSOD on start up and low fps in CPU games</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been getting this for a long time now and I am starting to get frustrated (god knows why it's taken me so long to do something about it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am continuously getting Blue Screen when I start up my PC. When it disappears for restart, it sometimes restarts the PC, other times it comply shuts down and I have to press the button again. The error message is different each time</p>
<p>
</p><p>BAD POOL CALLER</p>
<p>IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are others too but I haven't got pics of the others to reference too but plenty different error reasons appear. I also checked up on my event viewer and have over 4000 Error and Critical messages since the start of Aug alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why I mentioned FPS in the title is because when I am playing CPU intensive games (ArmA, Cities Skylines) people with the same setup are getting more FPS than me. So with this Blue Screen and lower FPS i am thinking it's either a CPU or a Memory
 issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ran the Memory &amp; Intel Diagnostic tools and both are all good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not very good when it comes to these things so I anyone has any tips or needs to see any files, let me know.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>DVD player app for Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc43_tx  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD player app for Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>My external DVD drive works perfectly, but I have had tremendous difficulty playing a simple DVD on my surface pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a reliable, working, cheap, effective DVD player app for a Surface Pro 3? Every app in the Windows store for playing DVD's appears to be junk, and even the VLC download did not work on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's curious that Windows made it this difficult to watch a DVD on one of its most competitive products. Hope Windows 10 addresses this issue.</p>

            I don't think Surface is a perfect choice for playing DVD disc. Though it is considered as the best combination of desktop and tablet, it is not the same as desktop because of limits on configuration. My suggestion is to backup DVD movie on your computer
 hard drive, and then transfer movies to play on Surface Pro 3.

<p>Well even though Rockstar pretty much told us that there would not be anymore DLC (<span><span><a href="http://lggaming.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/no-more-dlc-planned-for-l-a-noire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>
 ), it turns out that there might just be.</span></span></p>
<p><span>In an exclusive interview with Kotaku Rockstar stated that "The game isn't complete yet", hinting at more DLC. I'm curious to see whats planned, especially after all that troubles between Rockstar and Team Bondi.
</span></p>

<p><span><span>I can't wait for more, I enjoyed the game, although I found the DLC to be a bit short for my liking</span></span></p>

<p>Yeah I'm assuming they mean DLC, as I don't think they'd be making another game. And I remember Team Bondi saying that they had to cut a lot of stuff from the final game, so maybe thats what they are releasing?

<h2>            Raid drives missing after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    My two RAID drives are missing after upgrading to windows 10. They are connected to a Silicon Image Sil 3512 SATALink Controller. Everything in Device manager is good with exception of the two&nbsp;missing SATA drives. Plus I ran Seatools and it doesn't recognize
 any drives at all. All three are Seagates.

            I think they did read it right. &nbsp;The answer is, it won't work. &nbsp;They pay top dollar to college grads that don't really know what they are doing. &nbsp;I've been building computers since 1999, and the issue isn't in the bios or driver firmware, it's that Windows
 10 is not backwards compatible to certain 'older' hardware, which is a problem with the developer, not us. &nbsp; And by 'older', my motherboard is only 5 years old, P6T58X-D, with no newer firmware available. &nbsp;Windows 7 really is a better OS, being compatible
 with pretty much anything out there.&nbsp;

            Windows 10 installs won't work with RAID drives. &nbsp;My BIOS is fully updated, and sees the drives with no problem. &nbsp;I have spent all day with different RAID setups with older HDD's and new SSD's. &nbsp;I have tried clean Windows 10 installs with 1 drive and it
 installs no problem, but will not see the others once it's up and running. &nbsp;I start from scratch again but put the Windows 7 disc in instead, and it sees the RAID drive and installs, no problem. &nbsp;I cannot upgrade to Windows 10 because of some glitch/issue
 in the software. &nbsp;It will also not see it when I try to upgrade from a running Windows 7 OS to Windows 10, because again, it says no drives detected.&nbsp;
