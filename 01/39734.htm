<h2>            High CPU and memory usage on Windows 10 with Microsoft Edge.</h2>
                    <p>Old title: High CPU and memory usage</p>
<p>I am on windows 10 and have a Compaq Presario model CQ62. I frequently have extremely high CPU and memory usage and Microsoft EDge seems to be the culprit using 4-500 MB and 40-50+ % of my CPU. How can I lower this.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Tom,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand your concern in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It depends on the content you're trying to browse using Microsoft Edge. Do check browsing the same content on other Browser to see if the issue persist. Moreover, high CPU or Memory usage
 will occur when some corrupted driver’s malfunctions on background. Perform a Clean Boot to confirm the same.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur
 when you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press
<strong><span>Windows Key,</span></strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the search box, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the
<strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Close Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer. Once you reboot your PC experience&nbsp;if any difference in performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now it indicates that some other services are causing the issues. I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time which are disabled before, reboot and
 then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one by one, till you find the one which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for
<strong><span>Startup's </span></strong>too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer the&nbsp;below article on&nbsp;"<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Perform Clean Boot</a>". As the&nbsp;article

            <p>hi Tom you are not alone with this issue I to have found edge using high cpu usage so used another browser to compare I ran Pale Moon&nbsp;http://www.palemoon.org/ 32bit browser with the same amount of tabs running as the edge and the cpu usage was only 7% compared
 to the edge using 25% cpu&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Process Explorer to determine what is using processing power its a Microsoft tool
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/processexplorer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <div>Tom,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you can do anything about it other than stop using Edge and use IE or some other browser. What Yashwanth is trying to say in his response is that he's a Microsoft employee and therefore can't badmouth the fact that Edge uses a ridiculously
 large amount of memory. It's not your fault but rather how Edge was developed/coded.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I like using Edge (typing this response in Edge) but in order to do so, you need to have the hardware to support it because it is probably the most hungry web browser out there even though it was supposed to be an improvement to IE. It works
 fine on my PC because I'm running a fairly new and high end intel processor with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. But if those are not your specs or close to it, then yeah Edge is going to be difficult to use even with just a few tabs open.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, unless you have a virus, which you shouldn't since you have a good antivirus I'm assuming :), or you have a very poorly designed app running in your PC, in which case Yashwanth's solution will help track it down, your hardware simply can't
 handle it. Like you said, task manager is showing that Edge is the culprit; in that case Edge is the culprit and you may want to use a different browser such as IE. Just because you have Windows 10 doesn't mean it will solve all your PC problems unfortunately
 :(. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot to help reassure you that you're not the only one feeling it: (notice how edge has 4 instances pretty much at the top when sorted by memory usage, totaling well past half a gig with only 3 tabs open including this one; my work pc is running
 IE with a bunch of hungry work web apps and it's still under 200MB)</p>

            If you&nbsp;REALLY want to drive it over the Edge (so to speak), just go to CNN.com.&nbsp; The fan goes 24/7, with nothing else running.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp; CPU and memory usage gradually increase for no reason.&nbsp; Methinks the problem is the edge browser, not anyone's computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I have been searching about the same topic. Not sure what is different but while Edge has always been hungry, whatever updates occurred recently to the browser have made things worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can tell, the issue is whatever they may have done to the javascript engine.&nbsp; HTML video heavy or javascript heavy websites or ads can spin the CPU to over 80%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this thread get a lot more complaints so that Microsoft finally listens and addresses the issue.</p>

            <p>Yeah slickdeals makes it go crazy too. Even on my normal system (this one), which is pretty powerful, it lags quite a bit while setting up the website. Luckily system is powerful enough to pretty much handle everything else so sticking with it since it is
 fast and clean when it works well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Downside is that you definitely have to close the browser more often or RAM will definitely build up to the point that my SSD is constantly popping with small writes&nbsp;from the enlarged paging file.

<h2>            Windows reset failed</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>My computer was having an error 0xc0150004, while searching through things I thought it would be best to just reset my computer altogether.
</p>
<p>I tried while the computer was still on to try the fresh start option in Windows Defender and first time an error saying windows was unable to reset my computer and no changes were made. Later on I tried again and the process went through all the way til
 the error that was unable to reset my computer popped again and I got into a restart loop where I tried every repair option and nothing would work.
</p>
<p>I went into UEFI bios to put everything to default and almost thought I have lost windows when Missing Operating System message was showing, turns out that was because I turned off Raid while putting bios into default, after reversing that I am back in the
 restart loop again.</p>
<p>OS is Windows 10.</p>

<p>It has been my experience that he Reset function in Windows is sketchy at best, your best option is to clean install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you download the latest Windows Installation Media, your system will be more stable and require fewer updates to catch up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media
 for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>If you have problems booting from the Installation Media, go into your BIOS and make the following changes:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Insert the Bootable Media</span></li><li><span>Disable Secure Boot</span></li><li><span>Enable Legacy Boot</span></li><li><span>If Available enable CSM</span></li><li><span>If Required enable USB Boot</span></li><li><span>Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order</span></li><li><span>Save BIOS changes and restart your System</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong>during the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do
 not remove the installation media at this point</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC&nbsp;<strong>during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key</strong>&nbsp;and select the option&nbsp;<strong>'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC'</strong>, and activation
 will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Servers</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Hotspot Limitation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shad0w lag x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Hotspot Limitation</h2>
                    TLDR; Is there anyway to bypass the 8 device limitation?<br />
<br />
I am an IT professional and recently upgraded to a DOCSIS 3.1 modem in my home. This has put my expensive DOCSIS 3.0 Nighthawk modem+router combo out of commission. I noticed I have the ability to host a Hotspot which completely eliminated the need to purchase
 another expensive wireless router / AP&nbsp; except for one huge issue: It only supports up to 8 devices.<br />
<br />
My machine has a built in AC1900 Triband WIFI card and I was hitting over 16+ wireless clients in a hosted network configuration; however, this has become a messy process which was replaced by Windows 10 Hotspot feature, but the 8 device limitation is throwing
 a wrench in my home wireless environment. Would anyone be so kind as to point me in the direction of a REG key or GPO policy that can bypass this arbitrary limit?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
By design, Windows 10 allows you to connect up to 8 devices in a Hotspot connection. It is a Windows added feature. On the other hand, an Access Point&nbsp; is designed to cater more than 8 devices to connect to the internet.

    <title>How Xbox Handles Fraudulent Charges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lazydude501  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Xbox Handles Fraudulent Charges</h2>
                    <p>What I am about to tell you has taken Six months, and the capital "S" in six, is intentional to add emphasis to this comically frustrating endeavor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all started October 12th, 2018, when I noticed a charge on a deactivated credit card for an xbox purchase. I made a determination that this was unusual and proceeded to investigate the other payment methods tied to my xbox account. Much to my expectation
 the same charge was attempted on my PayPal account, only that time it went through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blood pressure now slightly elevated I immediately filed a fraud claim with PayPal, as well as with Xbox. An investigation was started and to my surprise both parties denied my request, blaming the reason on the other, or on the legitimacy of the claim,
 I was informed to rectify the issue with PayPal first, and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say I am no longer a member with PayPal, they have lost my business for good, a separate story I'll save for another post. I proceeded to call Xbox support for the following 6 months, speaking to representative after representative, supervisor
 after supervisor, all at first informing me that the situation would be resolved, or that they would "escalate the problem".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 12+ "reported to our refund department statements" later and we are now in to the new year, and my patience has all but worn out. At this point I decide that enough has been enough and I will start pressing the issue even harder with these non-English
 reps. I was now being met with hostility, some demanding sensitive information like my bank statements to be emailed to&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed: Inappropriate]</strong> knows where, one even telling me that I was a liar and that "the IP was made from my house."
 Ignoring this total&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Remove: Profanity]</strong> I pressed forward to with this final rep, asking for his supervisor one last time. I am put on a silent hold, after he seemingly laughed at me. 20 minutes go by and I have heard NOTHING. Finally
 I gave up, probably what he was waiting for, hung up and came here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The date is 25 Feb. 19, Xbox now is calling me a liar, and I have no justice for this issue and nowhere to go but here. I have been loyal to xbox for 7+ years, this is how they have treated me, and I wonder, are they worth our support as customers anymore?
 I know what my answer is.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e289b06c-117b-4429-befa-d3ed8c47b2f9" title="LaZyDuDe501">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for&nbsp;reaching out to&nbsp;Xbox forums support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you've been trying to receive a refund for a&nbsp;fraudulent charge that took place back in October 2019.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for all that you've been through dealing with this issue. I can imagine how frustrating this must be for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, we here in the forums department do not have the tools to provide refunds or look into Microsoft&nbsp;account
</p>
<p>
</p><p>purchase histories.&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself as a customer, have sent (emailed)&nbsp;in screen shots of my bank statements to verify charges when
</p>
<p>
</p><p>disputing a&nbsp;transaction. &nbsp;If that is what the Xbox Live support agent is requesting to help get your issue resolved,&nbsp;I'd recommend emailing
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the screenshot.&nbsp; The only step we can suggest is again referring you&nbsp;to the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Refund Webform </a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>and if the refund request gets denied, reply to the denial email and explain your situation in detail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, always remember that you can give feedback and let your voice be heard by visiting

<p>I am sorry to hear about the frustration that you have been going through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you have to understand is this when it comes to purchases like this (fraudulent) All that MS can see is the purchase that was made on the account itself. They do not know if you did it may have given your account information to someone else and
 they did it or what may have happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL fraudulent charges would actually need to be handled by your financial institution that the purchase was made through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give you another example. Say someone got ahold of your credit card and went into any retail store and made purchases with it you would not be going to the retailer and asking for a refund they would tell you that you have to contact your financial
 institution.</p>

            Hi there, i am so sorry for the experience you have had trying to get a refund due to fraud i understand your case has taken awhile to be sorted the only reason for this would be is a investigation on microsoft side and they would look at evidence from
 all different sources to determine if this was an actual fraudulent case or was buyer mistake etc,<br />
<br />
It may have also taken some time to respond to you for many other factors and it could also be that the bank or financial institution was not forthcoming at the beginning with the request from microsoft many different factors could have happened here and i
 can only apologise that this happened in the first place.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I also understand how upsetting and stressful this situation has been for you and it looks like the case is still ongoing looking at your notes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft takes fraud very seriously but communication can break down at times because maybe one party involved had issued wrong information to xbox or microsoft at the initial request, I would advise that you submit any evidence you have in form of a PDF file
 to xbox fraud department so they can look into the issue further and properly with the correct information and so on.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I can only imagine how you must feel regarding this situation, paypal should have also done an investigated their end as well but i am not sure they did a complete investigation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this information helps, All the best.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards&nbsp;<br />
Alec&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One UPnP vs Port forwarding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luketcthatsme37  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One UPnP vs Port forwarding</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so 90% of the time I have an open NAT and it's fine but sometimes I get a strict NAT and I don't think UPnP works properly. I have got the NETGEAR R7000 Nighthawk. Would it help if I had the Xbox One ports enabled in port forwarding along with UPnP being
 enabled?</p>

<p>Yes it does help</p>
<p>I don't suggest download anything but use this to know what ports to forward.</p>

<p>I see ppl doing that I don't know why you would do that. </p>
<p>There are some great pieces of info on that site as well as the Xbox support site.
</p>
<p>I've forwarded ports and had no issues unless it was an ISP problem or software update from Xbox</p>

<p>DO NOT enable UPnP and forward ports. It will cause conflicts.</p>
<p>If you have multiple consoles on the same network and are trying to connect to Call of Duty AW,</p>
<p>You need to open additional ports to get an Open NAT.</p>
<p>Disable UPnP and open 3075 along with the other necessary ports for 1 additional console. If you have 2 additional consoles, open 3075 and 3076. UDP</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The reason that the option is grayed out could be because some graphics cards don’t support changing the primary monitor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may contact the graphics card manufacturer to get more details about the same.</span></p>

            No. They are supplied to the major OEMs only, and can only be placed on systems which have been properly passed as being Windows 7 compatible. That is the theory anyway..

<h2>            How to get Windows Live Calendar reminder&#63;</h2>
                    I have upgraded to W7 and installed windows live mail and windows live mail calaendar. My previous windows calendar had pop-up reminders and worked great. Windows mail doesn't have pop-ups and seens to only send mail to windows live mail (which I don't
 use and don't intend on using).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get a pop up reminder?<br />
<br />
Can the live calendar appointments&nbsp;be imported into Works calendar?

                    Hi, I have a skype subscription to ring unlimited mobiles and landlines in Europe. I am going to Australia, and want to ring Europe from there...will this work, or should I pay for a different subscription? It only says about&nbsp;the destination&nbsp;of the&nbsp;&nbsp;call,
 I find any info on a change of where you are calling FROM - Please help

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can still utilize your calling subscription to Europe even if you are in Australia. No need to purchase another or new subscription. As long as the country you're calling is covered by your subscription, then no worries
 if you are in any part of the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps!<br />

    <title>cannot remove or end cpx.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nighttrainstephen  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot remove or end cpx.exe</h2>
                    <p>cpx.exe Google Embedded Application or Process- Original Title</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I keep getting a file; cpx in Program Files (x86).&nbsp; In it is a program; cpx.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm running a program (Windows 10) I start losing focus to "something" that I can't find active.&nbsp; I open Task Manager and find five entries;&nbsp; Google Embedded Application.&nbsp; I begin right clicking and selecting "end process".&nbsp; Some won't end.&nbsp; Eventually
 one will end all of them.&nbsp; I then find the folder and delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down my computer every night, rather than let it run.&nbsp; I reboot and sometimes that folder is back.&nbsp; Sometimes it isn't.&nbsp; So far it has managed to reappear every time, eventually.&nbsp; I wish to get rid of this once and for all.&nbsp; Doing Google searches
 (ironic, eh?) I find a lot of people posting questions, and complaints about this.&nbsp; All the sites either offer that you buy their software and they'll fix it for you, or just give generic information.&nbsp; Some even are tutorials on how to use this to create Google-related
 apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use any Google applications other than the search engine.&nbsp; I don't have an account with them, either.&nbsp; So, it can't (supposedly) be anything I picked up from them.&nbsp; However, it is said to be bundled with benign software as an ad function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone through Programs and Features and deleted anything I don't need on my machine.&nbsp; I have no add-ons on any browser, except for AdBlock which is on&nbsp; Firefox (the only browser I use), and I only use "new private window" when I launch that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked in my registry every place these "informational" sites say this is supposed to be registered.&nbsp; Nothing there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've examined my start-up functions.&nbsp; I keep these trim and only one program apart from Windows 10's lineup loads on start-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it's in the registry somewhere.&nbsp; I am convinced it was introduced via some innocuous software (even though I fastidiously take the checks out of the bundled software included habitually in installers these days.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major annoyance and persistent problem.&nbsp; I have no idea what the computer is doing when this cpx.exe is running.&nbsp; I would like to get rid of it once and for all, and see more people are aware of its existence with an eye toward saying something
 to Google about having something to do with putting unwanted programs that can take control of a PC on people's computers without their knowledge, and therefore without a doubt with no permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to provide the&nbsp;assistance required to help resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>cpx.exe </strong>is what is commonly referred to as a PUP - potentially unwanted program. PUP's&nbsp; often come hidden in other software that is downloaded from the internet. They can be a problem for several reasons - Adware, spyware, and they can drain
 resources. For eg - cpu cycles and system RAM, but are generally only a nuisance and do no real damage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For starters, I suggest that you uninstall your Chrome browser and delete all the files related to it and cpx.exe. Once done reboot the system and check if&nbsp;you&nbsp;still see the cpx.exe running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist, I suggest that you run a full system scan&nbsp;via Microsoft Safety Scanner and&nbsp;if you are able to find any viruses or malware infection in your PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Yes, I am aware it is among what is commonly referred to as a PUP.&nbsp; Most of the sites that pretend to have information on this are quick to mention that.&nbsp; However, someone seeking help with this problem already knows this.&nbsp; Yes, if there were no effect (stealing
 focus)...cpu cycles...RAM....no one would be seeking help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of discussion, I did the Microsoft Safety Scan and it found no virus or malware.</p>
<p>I don't use Chrome.&nbsp; Chrome is a Google product and in the original post I said I don't use Google products.&nbsp; SO, of course I have no Chrome to uninstall and no folders related to it to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate what seems to be a generic, one-size-fits-all response.&nbsp; But, it wasn't helpful.&nbsp; If people who know something about this problem would be so kind as to respond I'd be most appreciative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Since the response I received from Microsoft itself was a generic response found on any website on any Google search with no technical knowledge of any note, I decided to pursue this on my own and naturally the solution was one of those obvious things
 right in front of you - forest for the trees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click Start, select Run, type in "regedit" (no quotation marks).&nbsp; Highlight "Computer" at the top.&nbsp; Edit/Find... type in "cpx" (no quotation marks).&nbsp; Put a check in the box "Match whole string only".&nbsp; Delete each key that refers to cpx.exe in Program
 Files (x86).&nbsp; Mousing over the key the search highlights and reading the tool tip that appears will tell you this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what I did.&nbsp; Now, I'll see if this thing reappears.</p>
<p>I'll get back to this thread with the result as soon as I get it.</p>

</p><p><strong>My response:&nbsp; </strong>My question was answered with a question and some generic, commonly known information.&nbsp; It certainly was not a helpful response and in no way led to any solution of the stated problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus far I have been monitoring my clear references to cpx.exe solution.&nbsp; However, twice since I posted that this has shown itself again.&nbsp; Yet, a search of the registry for any key turns up nothing now.&nbsp; It has been about three days since the last instance
 of cpx.exe showing itself.&nbsp; I intend to see if I can go a week without seeing it, then coming back here and relaying that result...or the other result if it keeps reappearing.</p>

            <p>I know it's been a while.&nbsp; Since my last post here, running my computer every day all day but for the sleepy time downtime, I've had three return instances of cpx.exe&nbsp;&nbsp; The way I identify it is I'll lose the internet connection to a program I'm running.&nbsp;
 I look in the Task Manager and find five entries;&nbsp; Google Embedded Application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have further found not only has the cpx folder reappeared in Program Files (x86), a copy of it appears in C:\Users\user name\AppData\Local\
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means something on my machine is writing these folders when I reboot after downtime.&nbsp; The "Google Embedded Application" name appearing in Task Manager, whenever cpx.exe is active and messing with my computer in the background, is a cause of great suspicion.&nbsp;
 Why so little information is available about this in a search adds to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What information I have found is this cpx.exe is used by developers to create applications which interface with products or services provided by Google, presumably obtainable when registering with Google and accepting activation of said products.&nbsp; I have
 never registered with Google and I have never used any Google product aside from the web search.&nbsp; As Google is the premier web search engine on the internet, using it seems inescapable as a practical matter...so being able to trust them not to put things on
 your computer would seem a significant issue.&nbsp; I also found cpx.exe contacts other websites or IPs as soon as it activates.&nbsp; Some sources give it a 68% chance of being malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for the purposes of this thread, I have done nothing but remove software applications from my drive in an effort to stop the reappearance of this unwanted file and all its contents including cpx.exe.&nbsp; Yet, it still appears.&nbsp; As I had no such problem
 with Windows 7, I'm assuming it has something to do with Windows 10 and....Google's name is right there in the Task Manager.&nbsp; You saw the generic response here that Microsoft offered....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can say at this point is, I've&nbsp; learned how to detect cpx's presence and where to disable it, then locate it and delete it.&nbsp; I cannot say I learned any more than that, and I'm nowhere near finding out how it gets onto my machine, and how to stop
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those interested in fact - As my signature says, I have a great deal of experience in dealing with PCs.&nbsp; I do not surf the web.&nbsp; I do not download software.&nbsp; What little I do have on my drive is software all would consider acceptable, above board and
 industry standard-acceptable.&nbsp; No Chrome.&nbsp; No Google Apps.&nbsp; No bit torrent, sketchy software from dubious sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone with Microsoft knows what this is and isn't saying.&nbsp; Sorry I couldn't do more.&nbsp; Good luck if you have this same problem.&nbsp; Try to take the time to add any information about it you might find.&nbsp; You know-it-alls with your generic one-size-fits-all cliche
 responses need not bother.&nbsp; We've heard them a thousand times.&nbsp; And, no offense, if you're in India working at some place doing "service" for Microsoft, don't bother answering this thread.&nbsp; We know you have nothing to offer.</p>

            <p>I had an experience with cpx, only there were 2 cpx folders and 2 template folders in quick access. When removed, they were blank. On reboot, the folders reappeared and on deletion, become &nbsp;image garden, then template or cpx, and then back to cpx and template
 successively. Image garden is related to Canon printers, but the folders appeared during a Microsoft Windows 10 update. still looking for a complete answer. I suspect you are correct and someone at Microsoft knows what these files are and wishes to keep it
 a secret. They most likely have existed all along, but during an update, they were brought into view by accident. now MS will ignore them until they can put them back under cover and call it a fix.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Interesting.&nbsp; I did some research and found it has something to do with applications written intended to be in conjunction with Google.&nbsp; I don't want any google stuff on my machine, so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do is if it appears, and it has off and on (mysteriously of course), is do a Find in Regedit.&nbsp; "cpx".&nbsp;&nbsp; That helps.&nbsp; I've found a cpx folder hiding in the likes of
<em>Local Disk </em><em>C:\ Users\ (Your Username)\ AppData\ Local\&nbsp; </em>and <em>
\Roving\&nbsp; </em>as well.&nbsp; However, I've never found its source or an inoculation for it.&nbsp; It makes me distrustful as it seems to be a nexus where these people are cooperating with each other behind our backs...and of course, on our computers.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t re-activate windows 10 after motherboard change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t re-activate windows 10 after motherboard change</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my motherboard, since I needed to add a couple components that my previous one didn't support, mainly a better CPU cooler. Existing MOBO wouldn't support the bracket needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had my Microsoft account linked. I'm getting notifications that I need to reactive windows 10, and currently a genuine copy isn't running. I understand the product key is linked to the old MOBO. I don't plan to re-use that, its pretty much useless to
 me, so won't be running windows on 2 PCs with 1 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The auto-troubleshoot isn't working when I click "I changed my hardware". I called HP and they said there is nothing they can do. I called Microsoft, they had me do Run &gt; SLUI 4, and then provide my installation ID and then said "Sorry but we cannot recover
 your product key". Nobody is able to help. I have a genuine copy that I purchased via pre-installed on my PC. They are saying my only option is to re-purchase a product key. Seems crazy to have to buy it twice for the same computer. Any help here?</p>

            Hello ,
<br />
<br />Iam afraid if your license was pre-installed on your PC You can not use the license on another computer. OEM licenses are integrated in the equipment if it stop working and die, the license will do the same.
<br />
<br />There is not too much to do, just can suggest you to contact Microsoft support (they have the info of the product key)
<br />
<br />Also contact Microsoft Support for activation 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a> (click on talk to a person)

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Depending on the type of Windows 10 license you have installed, you might be able to transfer it to a new computer if needed. Over the years, Microsoft has distributed its desktop operating system through different market channels. New computers will often come preinstalled with an OEM license. There are many other channels Microsoft distributes Windows in, these include Retail, Volume License, Academic, and subgroups such as Upgrade licenses. Check these links, I hope it helps.

            Hi, <br />
unfortunately preinstalled version cannot be used after motherboard replacement. You need to buy a new license or return old motherboard.

<p>Thanks all. That is what I figured, there really was no hope. I was actually able to even get the key from my registry, but it doesnt work when re-entering, because it truly is tied to only working on that previous motherboard. That is what HP told me, their
 OEM keys are branded and only work on their hardware. Kind of sucks to hear "you have to repurchase it" when I already purchased it and now its being essentially thrown away.</p>

<div>I have the same problem, except I am working of windows 10 that got upgraded from win7. If I roll back to win7 (I still have the win 7 product key) will I then be able to re-upgrade to win10? I'm guessing from the above answers it'll be a no, but it's
 worth a shot! :-)</div>

<p>
</p><p>Different issue you have there, but I know that one. It was a free one time upgrade. If you wipe it (reset, back to win7), any future upgrade to windows 10 would require paying for it.&nbsp; Found that while searching for my issue earlier.</p>

<h2>            Background Tones After Installing Infinity Slots Game And Unable To Uninstall The Game.</h2>
                    <p>let me start by saying I am a novice when it comes to internet games.&nbsp; I thought I installed Infinity Slots through Microsoft.&nbsp; I see an icon on the list of recently added apps and also under the list of alphabetical apps.&nbsp; Since I downloaded the app I constantly
 here the tones in the background which sounds like something being downloaded.&nbsp; I cannot find the source of the sounds - no new downloads that I can find.&nbsp; I have tried to uninstall the Infinity Slots at both the recently added apps and the alphabetical listing
 of apps but it does not uninstall.&nbsp; The noise is driving me crazy - I like to listen to music when I am at the computer so I don't want to mute the volume to stop the noise.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP</p>

Uninstalling The Game From Built-in Administrator User Account</span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the <strong>

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: A 'Clean Boot' starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. Your computer may

<div>Hi William,</div>
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div><br />
As per the query, it seems like you are unable to open WPS files as you get an error message prompting “<b>The remote procedure call failed</b>”.</div>
<div>I would like to ask some questions on this issue to help you in a better way:</div>
<div>1) Were you able to open Word document files earlier on the computer?</div>
<div>2) Are you able to open Word files from any other location besides the Library folder on the computer?<br />
3) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<p>4) Were you using Microsoft Works word processor on the computer running Windows 7 earlier to open WPS files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were using Microsoft Works word processor, I would suggest you to reinstall Microsoft Works word processor&nbsp; on the computer with Windows 8 and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Please feel free to contact us if there any issue related to Windows and we would be glad to help you.<br />

    <title>WiFi function removed in Surface Pro 2 after installation of Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waterheaven  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi function removed in Surface Pro 2 after installation of Windows 10</h2>
                    The WiFi function of the Marvell wireless device in my Surface Pro 2&nbsp;has just gone, after the restart of the newly&nbsp;updated Windows 10. It looks like a dramatic joke for me, because from now on I can do nothing with my Surface (no wired connection available),
 not even getting further upgrades.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;check it, Microsoft! And I believe&nbsp;I am not the only one involved.&nbsp;So disappointing!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not actually heard of this issue, nor do I know much about this area but I'll have a guess as to how to fix it. Some of these may sound ridiculous but bear with me...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Turn Wifi On and Off</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>In the bottom right hand corner of your screen, there will be a notification icon that looks like a speech bubble. It will look like one of the following:
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be133214-ce12-43ed-9d3f-cf5bb7cf2f39" />or
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3389ef7c-931b-4e8f-8205-62fd0452e310" />.</li><li>When you click it, it will open the all new 'Action Centre'. At the bottom there will be some square buttons. If there are only four, click expand.</li><li>Now click the Wifi one to toggle Wifi. If it is grey, it is off, if it is another colour (your accent colour), then it is on.</li><li>Give it a minute or two, and see if it works.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: Restart your system</strong></p>
<p>I assume you have already tried this but if not, see if it works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the windows button or the key on your keyboard.</li><li>Press 'Power'.</li><li>Press 'Restart'.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 3: Update your driver</strong></p>
<p>This is slightly more complex but might work.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right Click on the Wifi button in the bottom right hand corner of your screen. It will look like this:
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/162c24b5-deeb-4f7a-a8bd-27837f836771" /></li><li>Press 'Open Network and Sharing Centre'</li><li>When it opens, press 'Change adapter settings' in the top left hand corner of the window.</li><li>When it opens, find the one that says 'Wifi'. Now look at the name of the third row down on the 'Wifi' one. This is the name of your Wifi Adapter.</li><li>Search (using Cortana) for <strong>'</strong>Device Manager'.</li><li>Press it when it appears. It will look like this:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/553ecb5e-df40-477c-aca3-cdada2f729a0" /></li><li>Expand 'Network Adapters'.</li><li>Find the one that matches the name of your Wifi adapter.</li><li>Right click it and press 'Update Driver Software'.</li><li>Press 'Search automatically for updated driver software'.</li><li>If it says there are no updates, do not worry. If there are updates, install them and try to connect again (after retrying method 1 &amp;2)
<p>Let me know if these methods worked or not!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this helped!</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. The solution provided doesn't work, because the wireless adapter has disappeared after installing Window 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No wifi icon in task bar.</p>
<p>No wifi icon in action centre.</p>
<p>No wifi adapter in Network Adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to work fine in Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>OK, I am afraid there isn't a lot you can do at the moment. I would suggest buying a USB wireless adapter in order to connect for now. Microsoft are rumored to be releasing a bug fixing/performance enhancing update in September so if you can find a way of
 getting on the internet then when you install that, it <em>should </em>fix the issue. Until then, there is not a lot you can do. Whatever you do, you will need internet at some point so you will need to buy a wireless adapter.<br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

            <p>I have this problem on my Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; WiFi connections show in the network settings panel and I can connect to several different WiFi access points but when I go to a browser it says that there is no connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking about uninstalling the WiFi adapter with the idea that the OS can discover it again and re-add it, perhaps correctly this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Even though symptons may not be 100% identical, they do seem to match fairly much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some has fixed it by changing the Marvell adapters settings to Auto (or to 5Ghz and back to Auto).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me uninstalling Norton Internet Security fixed the problem.</p>

<h2>            Suddenly cannot double tap xbox button and hit X to record clips</h2>
                    
<p>Just like the title...suddenly while streaming, I cannot double tap the xbox button on the controller and hit X to record a clip.&nbsp; The option doesn't show up.&nbsp; It shows up when the xbox one is connected to the Tv only, but not while streaming.&nbsp; This uses
 to work until I did the latest xbox one update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the update, my game DVR broke in a different way.&nbsp; I lost all my clips since updating to windows 10, as well as I couldn't record new clips.&nbsp; The option to press X DID show up, but hitting it did nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Anyone else experience this?</p>
