<h2>            Spotlight has no pictures</h2>
                    <p>Spotlight got stuck on the same three pictures over and over and over. I tried some of the troubleshooting steps elsewhere in this forum, and now I have no pictures at all, just a black screen with the date and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sfc finds no problems, nor does dism, nor does System Maintenance troubleshooter.

/online /cleanup-image /scanhealth (I think that was the sequence of switches). No problems reported. I ran the&nbsp; System Maintenance troubleshooter. No problems reported.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I manually added some pictures. They are not appearing on spotlight but now I finally get a different spotlight picture from what I had before. Previously, there was a cave overlooking the ocean, a field of purple flowers and
 some colored lanterns over and over and over. Now there's an ocean view out an airplane. We'll see if it ever changes.</span><br />

            <p>Just taking a&nbsp;clue from your last sentence... have you discovered that you can check your lock screen from your username in the Start Menu? (by r-click on your name)&nbsp;It ain't obvious - took me a while to spot it (and if you have more than one account you
 can switch user here too - where mine says 'Music') - thought it worth mentioning here as others may not have picked this up.</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is, however, a third party app -- Amazing Lock Screen -- that is able to do the same thing that Spotlight is supposed to do (of course, without the possibility for advertising). Seems funny that one guy coding alone can do something that all of Redmond's

<h2>            What does the recipient of my Skype US number see when I call them&#63;</h2>
                    I live in Ecuador but am thinking of getting a US number. Can the people I call tell I am calling from another country? If they call me do they realize it is a Skype number they are calling? Also, can they send a text to my Skype number?

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/371c8209-9209-4db7-99a8-99454c8a15c0" title="polarfly">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The number/name that will show when you call will depend on your <strong>Caller ID</strong>. Say if you set your
<strong>caller ID </strong>to none or empty, whenever you call any mobiles or landlines, it will only show
<strong>"Unknown Number" </strong>or<strong> "Restricted Number".&nbsp; </strong>You can set however your<strong> Caller ID</strong> with your
<strong>Mobile Number or a Skype Number</strong>. In most countries, using your mobile number as your
<strong>caller ID</strong> is available. On the other hand,&nbsp;below are the only countries that support using your Skype number as your
<strong>caller ID</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>USA</p>
<p>UK</p>
<p>Chile</p>
<p>Denmark</p>
<p>Estonia</p>
<p>Poland</p>
<p>Sweden</p>
<p>Switzerland</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you mentioned, you are from Ecuador,&nbsp;you can purchase a&nbsp;US Skype Number and set that up&nbsp;as your Caller ID in order for your contacts to see the number whenever you call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to set your own Caller ID by these steps which is included on this FAQ:

<h3> supermad  say:</h3>
<h2>            wsock32.dll Missing From Computer &#40;Although I Can See it&#41;</h2>
                    Recently my computer has been giving me the error message "The program can't start because WSOCK32.dll is missing form your computer" for many of my programs like Firefox and Outlook and it is also not allowing me to access the internet on any browser
 such as Chrome or IE. At first I went to C:\Windows\System32 to see if the .dll file is really missing and it is not. I have tried multiple virus scans from both Norton and Microsoft Security Essentials and no virus has been found. I suspect that it is in
 fact a virus that is doing this but I cannot find it or certain that it is something else. I have also tried sfc /scannow to repair corrupt files in the command prompt with no luck. I would manually replace the .dll file from a win 7 installation disc but
 I do not have one so I am wondering what I can do from here.

            In my case, it was another browser that was interfering with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; The solution was to reset Internet Explorer back to its default settings. To do this, click"Start", click "Run" and type"inetcpl.cpl" in the box, then hit "Enter".&nbsp; Click
 on the "Advanced" tab, then click the "Reset Internet Explorer settings". Click "Reset" to confirm the operation. Click "Close" once the resetting process has finished.&nbsp; Uncheck the "Enable third party browser extensions in the Browsing box.&nbsp; Click "Apply",
 then click "OK".&nbsp; This came from Microsoft support, and it worked for me.

            Hi Phạm, both your Mini-dumps indicate GDBehave2.sys as the root cause of your system crashes
<br />
<br />That virtual driver is associated with G Data Security Software or G Data Internet Security
<br />
<br />You should uninstall that and see if the issue is resolved then look for an updates version of that software on their website . .

<p>
</p><p>I saved all my pictures to OneDrive, and now the photos app sorted them to show me people (I think it is a well known feature). But I have a few people I don´t want to be listed there, so there is the "remove tag" feature. But it does not work. A few seconds
 after I removed the tag, they are back. I could delete the photos, but I don´t want to.</p>

<h2>            How to uninstall creator&#39;s update</h2>
                    <p>I've been having FPS drops issues since the CU in my videogames. I've researched it and it seems to be related to the update reactivating the gameDVR without even asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The XBox app crashes when I try to access the settings and editing the registry keys myself doesn't seem to solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I get my fully featured gaming pc back?</p>

<br />
<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Next </strong>to move on or you can choose <strong>Cancel</strong>.<br />
<br />
When you go back, you will lose the settings changes or the apps you may have installed after you upgraded to the current build. Note down your password or login credentials as you will be required to enter them after the process is completed.<br />

            OK, Creator Update SNOOZE option got by me because my main system had to be left on 24/7 for the last week. Came home last night to find none of my USB devices were working (found all the device drivers were missing, apparently deleted during the "update"),
 other programs would not function (dll's missing and other problems) and one of my 4TB SATA drives had been formatted so there was NO data recoverable on it. I've spent all day recovering and restoring all the data and drivers. Finally have my system back
 to running (thank goodness for Acronis backup!, not a plug for them other than the thing WORKED and saved me from this Creator Updates MESS). Ok, now that I have my system back, I am already being nagged that the Creator Update is here telling me to Restart,
 Schedule a time, or Snooze. There is NO WAY I ever want to allow this Creator Update to again invade my system. Is there any way beside trashing Windows and going to Linux or even the drastic step of switching to Mac to avoid any future

<p>it doesnt roll back, i think windows are virus, it injects some kind of software that can not be uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after win10 creators update, it was so buggy, it froze my pc nearly every after few mouse clickings on a quick launch. all damn settings&nbsp; are jigsaw puzzles that are worse than win10,&nbsp; at 1st i couldnt find restore points,&nbsp; update creators deleted all. then
 when i was about to format my HDD's i found tiny little words &lt;more options or advanced options&gt;&nbsp; at the bottom of screeen, i got my win10 back..&nbsp; BUT update didnt uninstall all, and it injected with win10 update privacy setting that can not be uninstalled
 no matter what, this thing installs the win update assitant every time i&nbsp; turn&nbsp; on a pc and then it starts to automatically download the win10 creators again.</p>
<p>there is no fricking way out of this one. no other options to leave the update,&nbsp; there are only 2 things there "settings" or "continue to update".</p>

                    <p>Hey guys, I got Asus laptop with Windows 7. And few months ago I noticed a problem, Laptop started turning off without reasons ( Black screen appears, I still can hear noise for 3-7 seconds, and then it's off ). Now it does more and more often. It turns
 off &nbsp;after 10,30 minutes of working. Rarely handle 1-2 hours. It can't be turned on easily as well, it takes about 3-5 attempts, sometimes it just reboots or Blue screen appears:</p>
<p>STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}</p>
<p>The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status</p>
<p>of 0x00000000 ( 0xc0000001 0x00010658).</p>
<p>The system has been shut down.</p>

            <p>All those dump errors relate to pc memory (ram/virtual),if ram is ok,&amp; all ram cards are compatable</p>
<p>with each other,then edit virtual.To do so,R.click my computer/properties/advanced/virtual memory/</p>
<p>change button.With C:&nbsp; highlited,set to "let system manage" click set 2X,close out,restart pc.</p>
<p>Also,newer pcs can extend virtual memory by adding a USB flash card,get one with 20 GB or so,get</p>
<p>USB 3.0 technology.Once installed,in cmd type: diskmgmt.msc&nbsp; in msc,L.click on the drive,go to actions/</p>
<p>all,set "make active" close,reopen virtual memory settings,set as page file like before,exit,restart pc.</p>
<p>From here,move audio/video/photos to new HD,youre OS will get alot of performance from a 30-40</p>

            <p>This sounds like a hardware problem to me.&nbsp; That's what I would check first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heat:&nbsp; blow out the fan.&nbsp; How old is this laptop?&nbsp; My next concern would be the thermal paste between the processor and the heat synch.&nbsp; Are you using this laptop on a HARD surface?&nbsp; If you are using it on a cloth, that cloth is blocking the air input to
 the cooling system</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be an overheating problem and that&nbsp;is normally the main reason for your problem.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If it was a Hardware problem, it would tend not to restart.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is possible to have a hairline crack in the Motherboard, etc, which only becomes obvious once it heats up</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the vents for dust, hair, etc&nbsp;and do not use a Laptop when it is resting&nbsp;on material surfaces: bedspreads, blankets,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, as it is a Laptop, take it to a local and reliable Computer Repair Shop and get them to open it up and clean the dust from inside it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an interesting discussion about the varied reasons for your problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://pc-trickandsolution.blogspot.com.au/2011/07/fix-laptop-overheating-shutdown-problem.html</span></a></p>
<p>N.B&gt; However 9 out of 10 cases of overheating are caused by an airflow blockage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Review safe operating temperatures:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"What should be the temperature of my computer processor?"</p>

    <title>Problems with Windows 10 waking up after sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidowen5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Windows 10 waking up after sleep</h2>
                    <p>Since the last Windows update I've had lots of problems with the PC waking up after sleep:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, sometimes Windows doesn't reopen after sleep. The PC wakes up but Windows hangs and I don't get my login screen. Sometimes it just takes a long time, other times I have to restart the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, usually Windows forgets that my E drive is there and I have to run the hardware troubleshooter for it to find it again. (C is my M.2 drive with Windows, E is my main programs drive.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have various problems with other apps and services not starting up after sleep (keyboard, Steam and all sorts of others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix the problems? And why has the update made Windows so much worse??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

<p>Hi Yasir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this hasn't fixed the problem. I'm on a PC not a laptop so the only relevant part was changing 'sleep' to 'hibernate'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I woke up the PC after trying this I got the same bugs: it forgot my E drive was there and I had to run the hardware troubleshooter to find the drive again. I also had to open the Microsoft Keyboard app to get it to remember the extra functions
 for my keyboard (eg programmable keys). Windows did wake up OK, but that was only from one attempt so I'll see whether that problem has been fixed in due course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>

<p>Update: this has made no difference at all. On the last attempt to wake from sleep the PC seemed to turn on but the monitors just stayed blank. I had to restart...then Windows froze on start up and I had to turn it off at the power supply.</p>

<h2>            Network Printer Disappears from Devices and Printers frequently</h2>
                    I bought a new HP computer in February that came with Windows 7 64 bit.&nbsp; I installed my network printer (HP Officejet 7310 All-In-One) and all worked well.&nbsp; About once a week the printer just disappears from the Devices and Printers display.&nbsp; When I reboot
 it comes back and works fine.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this issue?

<h2>            Strange error recently popping up</h2>
                    Hi, yesterday i had a error pop up when i had started up my computer and it would say "Explorer.exe System Warning - Unknown hard error" and would have the option to select OK. &nbsp;So when i do nothing happens at all other then my screen flashing for a second
 then it would be like it had been a normal startup. &nbsp;It doesn't always pop up when i start my computer. &nbsp;I've tried a few different things to attempt to fix it such as the SFC.exe in command prompt and tried different registry scanners to see if something
 was wrong there but the problem still persists.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone had any experience with this type of error and if so please let me know any fix's that you have.</div>

            Hi, thank you for the suggestions. &nbsp;So far i haven't had anything pop up today when i start up so i'm going to hold off for now from the Safe mode method until it pops up again (if it does). &nbsp;But i will run the Microsoft safety Scanner to see if it finds
 and fixes anything. &nbsp;I'll post the results once i'm finished scanning.

 find what might be causing it, but for now as it isn't really causing a problem today i don't feel like messing with it if its not doing it at the moment.

            Sadly it just popped up again today after not popping for little more then a week. &nbsp;Still not really sure what causes it but it doesn't seem to do anything major when it pops up and i close out of it. &nbsp;All it does is reload the task bar and desktop and
 runs perfectly fine afterwards.

=======================================================<br />
<br />
More troubleshooting if needed :<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems), their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
Update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers</strong> (all of those can have a definite impact on boot speed and performance).<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings
<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and <br />
Start Screen.<br />
<br />
Check&nbsp;Startup Programs.<br />
<br />
Right Click in the lower&nbsp;left hand corner - Task Manager<br />
Or WinKEY + X - Task Manager<br />
Or Right Click the Taskbar - Task Manager<br />
<br />
Check the StartUp tab.<br />

comes with Windows Defender which in Windows 8 is a full antivirus based on MSE.<br />

remnants. In most cases Windows Defender will automagically reload.<br />

            Hi, sorry to drag this thread back up but its been around a month now since the Explorer.exe error had popped up last and sure enough it ended up popping up again.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I think i'm just gonna ignore it at this point because it never seems to bother anything other then restarting my Explorer.exe when i hit OK and it always seems to just disappear and reappear whenever it wants. It only popups on starting up so restarting
 Explorer.exe isn't really a big deal cause it doesn't interfere with anything</div>
<div><br />
<div>But if anyone has any information on what is causing it i'll be happy to try whatever suggestions you give me.</div>

<h2>            Bring Nintendo 64 games to XBLA. So simple...but is it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We all know it, We all want it...007 Goldeneye, Mario Golf, Mario 64, Yoshi's Island, Mario Party etc. etc.<br />
<br />
The questions is, when will Nintendo realise they could be making allot of outsource cash from 64 games through XBLA?</p>
<p>From what i'v seen, the Wii does not utilize this very well, the Wii dashboard shows gaming channels and things like that, but the community is very low in gamers.</p>
<p>It may be the Wii channels arn't user friendly enough (or maybe it's cause of the Wii itself lol).</p>
<p>Either way we miss our 64 games, and would like something done about besides ridiculous remakes like Goldeneye with Daniel Craig...EEEEWWWWW LOL.</p>

<p>Aside from Banjo Kazooie and Tooie, we will NEVER EVER get a Nintendo 64 exclusive game. Nintendo would never allow it. Besides, why go through all the trouble of setting up a deal with Microsoft so they can sell N64 games on XBLA and get only 30% of the
 profit when they can just release them on The Wii Marketplace and make 100% of the profit.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Plus, more people own a Wii so Wii Marketplace is more money than XBLA.</p>

<p>Most N64 games were developed in house by Nintendo or by a third party developer &nbsp;for Nintendo. &nbsp;This limits the number of games possible for release on the arcade, and there is the issue about polishing the games up. &nbsp;You do bring up a good point about
 Goldeneye though. &nbsp;It was technically developed by Rare but I'm not sure about the more complex issues regarding who actually would have the say to bring it to the Arcade. &nbsp;My advice to you is to go pickup a 3ds or look around for a 64 at a pawn shop or online.</p>

<p>Oh boy where do I start....</p>
<p>For one, why in the world would Nintendo allow it's RIVAL and BUSINESS COMPETITOR the chance to profit off of ITS creations?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Two, the Wii has nearly twice as many users as the 360 does.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Third, Wii's Virtual Console does this plenty well actually, also as older games like N64 are easily downloadable and so people play them through their Wii's without actually purchasing them again off Virtual Console</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Fourth, if this actually ever did happen Nintendo would be lose money as Microsoft would share in their profits. This is why you don't see Master Chief on a Ps3, Sly Cooper on a Wii and Mario on a 360, it's horrible business and a huge slap in the face from
 core fans who support you for what only you can bring to the table.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            High idle temp and NVIDIA driver crashing after Cumulative Update &#40;May 10, 2016&#41;</h2>
                    Hi dear community,<br />
<br />
After the latest May 10th Cumulative Update for Windows 10, I've started to experiencing problem with the GPU and NVIDIA driver.<br />
<br />
When I leave the PC for a couple of minutes, the GPU temperature is going up to 50+ temperature. Then, when I resume to work on PC (move with the mouse), the NVIDIA driver crashes and then temperature is getting back at normal at 40-38 temp.<br />
<br />
I've cleaned up the PC from dust and the problem still exist. I've tried to reinstall the drivers (via clean install option) and didn't helped. I didn't experienced this problem before updating Windows 10 to the latest cumulative update.<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm talking about pretty old GPU, KFA2 GTS 250 1GB running with the latest legacy driver.<br />
<br />
So, it's software problem or hardware problem?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with heating of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Most notebook computers have vents located around the case to allow air to flow through the case. If these vents become clogged, or if heat-generating parts become covered with dust, the fan cannot cool the components properly, because
 the laptop is hot and overheating becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Lint and dust accumulation prevents air from flowing around the cooling fan blades and causes the fan to work harder and the laptop to get hot. If there is dust in the vents, you should clean the laptop by blowing out the dust from around the fan and heat
 shield. This prevents dust from accumulating. </p>
<div>It is <strong>not</strong> necessary to open the notebook (laptop) to clean out the dust with the canned, compressed air</div>
<p>

<p>I've checked and rechecked my connection, rebooted my router, and it's still not working. My Xbox connects to my network just fine, but refuses to connect to Xbox Live. My account isn't scheduled to run out until beginning of June, so I know it's not that.
 And the weirdest part is, I've looked up the error code (8015190A) using this site's error code lookup feature, and it tells me that there are no results. My xbox has been doing this for more than a day now. What gives?</p>

<p>Mine hasn't been working for three days now. I cannot download my profile and consequently cannot play my downloaded games, access. my saves, or access Netflix (yet more money down the drain). What the hell is going on? I pay for all of these services that
 you guys are failing to deliver. This $300 machine is going to sit and collect dust while while it sucks money from my bank account.

<p>Thanks, Microsoft. </p>

<p>It's been three days for me also. I try to log into my profile and after maybe 5 seconds a small box pops up at the bottom of the screen saying "Disconnecting from xbox Live." Then the error message comes on that says, "Can't connect to xbox live. Would
 you like to check your connection? If you do you will loose progress on your game.... Lower on the screen there's the number 8015190A. Connection works fine. Silver accounts work fine. My gold account on my xbox one works fine.

<p>1. Changed my password.</p>
<p>2. Setup Two or Double Verification and then turned it back off.</p>
<p>Then it started working.﻿</p>

<p>Do not do any of the witchcraft above, it is all BS. I serched for the right answer and found it, DO NOT delete your account or any other sourcery. Read this
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/9/t/1756470.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1756470.aspx</a></p>
<p>And it will tell you the easy and correct way to fix it. After 3 hours of trying all this other BS it was a simple password change on your live account, follow the steps in the link above, literally a 5 min fix or a little less!!!!! Do not fall for the other
 magic tricks that get you in a bigger bind!!!!</p>

<p><span>If the message is pointing to a different drive letter that doesn’t exist, then I would suggest you to perform an online virus scan as your first
 troubleshooting step.</span></p>

<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1: Perform an online virus scan</span></span></em></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you copy files to a CD-R or CD-RW disk by using the CD/DVD recording support that is built into Windows 7, the files are first copied

            <p>Re: No. 1: No,&nbsp;I do not think there is anyway of setting a 'retroactive' date for system restore.</p>
<p>Re: No. 2: Not sure about being able to schedule creating restore points. However, restore points are automatically created at given point. For example when you install&nbsp;software or updates.&nbsp; You can check your restore points easily by downloading&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CCleaner</a> &nbsp;Click on tools&gt;system restore. You can delete any restore point but the last one.</p>

            If you want/need to do 1 &amp; 2 your best bet is to use a third party backup/restore option like Acronis True Image Home.&nbsp; That can do both.

<p>Hey mate, using a console from a different region is going to cause issues (and you will nto be able to create a US account to play with US players). For best results, you'll want to use an account, console, and games from your current region.</p>

<h2>            Unable to use static IP after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I had a static IP in Windows 8.1 but after updating to v10 it was reset to use DHCP.&nbsp; I tried to reset it to the static value I want but it said there was a conflict with another adapter card even though I only have one card in the computer.&nbsp; It seems Windows
 10 has called the card 'Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller#2' and it states the conflict is with a card it calls 'Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using another spare IP outside the DHCP range but although it let me set the IP I got no internet access after doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get the computer working with the original settings using the IP I had originally ?</p>

            <p>The trouble shooter is no help - it just says that the problem is that DHCP is disabled but we knew that anyway and it is an odd message that seems to imply that it will not work if DHCP is not used.&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>What I do not understand is that although Windows says there is no network connection I can ping the router and other fixed IP devices (a printer + NAS + PVR) so it is clearly connected to the local network but has no internet connection despite the router
 saying it is connected and wireless devices can browse the internet.</p>
<p>

            Still not working, but the trouble shooter message has changed.&nbsp; It now says it does not know why it is not working whereas before it said the problem was that DHCP was turned off.&nbsp; Windows 10 seems to update itself every day.

            Was it the KB3081436 update (I think it was from the 12th)? My issues started with that update. I uninstalled the update, didn't have any issues for hours. Got up the next day, it automatically reinstalled and the issues started again.

            My problems started from when I updated W8.1 to W10.&nbsp; I do not have the update you mention but that maybe because the updated files were included in the install file which I downloaded on 10th August.&nbsp; Certainly the affected dll's on my machine have the
 correct version numbers shown in the update info.

            <p>Lorne50,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think I am going to be of much assistance on this item. I don't use a static IP for my laptop, but I switched&nbsp;it&nbsp;to a static IP once I reserved the IP in the router. Once I entered all the appropriate information in Windows 10, everything worked
 as expected and I could access the internet. Just to see what would happen, I left out the "default gateway" and I could look at the rest of the internal network, but I could not access the internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, it looks like Windows 10 can use a static IP, but it is not clear what might be happening in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            I managed to eventually get mine working when I discovered that one of my other wireless devices wasn't working and was doing the same thing. I factory reset the modem and started from scratch there and eventually things worked. It was very strange though
 as all my other devices worked, both wired and wireless and it was only these two things which didn't, one which was wired and one which was wireless. Finally up and running though.

            Tech called Mike Johnson from Windows Servicing in Nevada! at 1-360-637-4743, with very deep. Indian accent, calls at 12:00 and stubbornly asks me to open my computer so he can fix a windows infection. Telling him I use Mac's, he insists my PC has caused
 problems. I told him to put his supervisor on the line, and he said he would when I open my PC up to where he needs to fix the problem. These guys are without morals, even told me it was free. Told him good bye, but not in a Canadian way!

<p>you are correct in saying that, I do not know how they can look in a mirror, but then again I suppose to them the money they earn makes up for that. I just hope people do not fall for it and keep hanging up.</p>
<p>In Canada the fraud squad already knows about it and once in awhile it is in the papers but it should be on the news more often as elderly people often get into a panic and fall for it.</p>

            <p>The maker of Windows 7 is called MICROSOFT, not Windows 7, so even if Microsoft did cold call,
<strong>which incidentally the DO NOT</strong>, they would introduce themselves as Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Tech Support is a subset of&nbsp;<strong>iYogi </strong>which is a remote technical support&nbsp;company based in Guragon, India.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They use a service provided by Pac-West Telecomm Inc of Washington State, USA which provides Windows 7 Tech Support with a telephone number in USA which automatically connects to a VoIP back at W7TS&nbsp;HQ&nbsp;in India.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far in the above text, there is nothing illegal happening. Cold calling is also not illegal and neither is stretching the truth about a product. Sales people in stores do it every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you contact iYogi, they will tell you that none of their personnel use hard sell tactics or try to mislead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting the gist of why this type of scam is so hard to stop yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that any of us can do is to make family friends and associates aware of what is happening..

<p>
</p><p>There is NOTHING illegal here so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The operative then talks the person into giving access to the computer by blinding them with essentially lies about the entries in Event Viewer, and then proceeds to cure the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even at this point, it is very difficult to prove that there WASN'T anything wrong and that the operative was making it all up.. And remember that the operative was invited in, under pressure albeit..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not just sick elderly people who are affected either. A perfectly fit middle aged guy in my apartment block, on receiving the FBI virus&nbsp;splash screen demanding money, called the local police and asked them which form of payment they would prefer..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do the research, people, and if you know of others&nbsp;who could be vulnerable, pay a visit and educate them.. PROPERLY. If it is explained to vulnerable computer users how these scams are done, they understand much better than be told that it was a nasty man

<p>I do not see anything funny in a 86 year old women getting a phone call like this , getting into a panic and allowing these people to access her computer and have her life savings taken along with her credit card being maxed out by these people.</p>
<p>You are also correct in saying it is not alway's &nbsp;the elderly, a 47 year old man had $360000 stolen from his bank account after allowing these people remote access, these cases are just a few the police mentioned on the TV and in the newspapers along with
 the better business bureau.</p>
<p>As for me I never keep any banking info on my PC have nothing on it that I would want to hide but I still would not allow anyone remote access to my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if nothing illegal was going on then why would the police and the fraud squad be investigating them.</p>
<p>As for I Yogi I have seen it advertised on my PC but would never use them or even Microsoft themselves,</p>
<p>not that Microsoft would steal anything but because they are too expensive, I prefer to purchase service packs from my computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being in my 70s myself I do not appreciate being woke up at 4am and called several times a day by these people, I am just grateful that I still have my faculties and did not allow these people access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Telling people to hang up is not as you say, "a nasty man from India" and the police will catch him soon,</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>You are also correct in saying it is not alway's &nbsp;the elderly, a 47 year old man had $360000 stolen from his bank account after allowing these people remote access, these cases are just a few the police mentioned on the TV and in the newspapers along
 with the better business bureau.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the part where the trouble starts. I won't even let my ISP get remote access to this computer. It's like giving a stranger the keys to your car or house. You just don't do it..
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As for me I never keep any banking info on my PC have nothing on it that I would want to hide but I still would not allow anyone remote access to my PC.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The caller doesn't&nbsp;need banking info on a PC if he is given&nbsp;credit card details..
</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Also if nothing illegal was going on then why would the police and the fraud squad be investigating them.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>They look for anything illegal going down in THEIR jurisdiction. If nothing is found, the investigation ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>As for I Yogi I have seen it advertised on my PC but would never use them or even Microsoft themselves,</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody with any sense should use them, but many are looking for somebody to connect remote and fix all of the problems..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>not that Microsoft would steal anything but because they are too expensive, I prefer to purchase service packs from my computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best place to get advice is here. We are free.. Manufacturer service packs are legalized scams in my opinion..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>Being in my 70s myself I do not appreciate being woke up at 4am and called several times a day by these people, I am just grateful that I still have my faculties and did not allow these people access.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in the decade approaching 70 and I don't like being woken up in the middle of the night either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Telling people to hang up is not as you say, "a nasty man from India" </em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is NOT what I said at all.. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>and the police will catch him soon,</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Only if he moves to a country or jurisdiction that is prepared and willing to take action..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is insulting on your part whether you meant it to be or not, but I do not appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Who cares how it is done, the fact is that it is being done </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Except that very little to nothing can be done because the caller is not in your country and your country has no power beyond its own borders.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>and there is nothing wrong in just telling people to hang up.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>That is all that CAN be done, other than get the phone company to block the offending calls, and for that, they need a number..

            <p>I tried to block them from calling but as no number shows up on my caller ID my phone carrier cannot
</p>
<p>block the calls, if a number showed up then perhaps I could block them but after answering the calls as I do I do not get many calls anymore.</p>
<p>As for purchasing service packs from my&nbsp;computer manufacturer I agree it is a legal scam but for me not being tech savvy especially with windows 8 it is far cheaper than taking my PC into a repair shop.</p>
<p>As for this site many of the people are great but one or two always spoil it by being rude to others who do not know as much about computers as they do, I ran into that and swore I would never go on this site again, it was so full of people fighting with
 each other and insulting each other that no one got to learn anything.</p>
<p>Also I never put my credit card online or purchase anything online, I do not even have a cell phone, nor do I wish to, computers and cell phones only teach the younger generation how not to communicate with others on a face to face basis, although my kids
 and grandkids would disagree with me.</p>
<p>For me the only thing a computer is good for is sending email and writing letters and paying my bills.</p>
<p>I have too many hobbies and do too much volunteer work to spend more than 1 hour a day on it.</p>
<p>Take care and have a great day.</p>
