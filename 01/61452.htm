            Hi HandyWijaya33
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi HandyWijaya33 
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Handy,
<br />Looks like an issue with the memory. Is the device under warranty?
<br />
<br />I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memtest86-test-ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/14201-memte...</a>
<br />If you have a DDR4 RAM, use MemTest86 rather than MemTest86+
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />When the test completes post back the Image(You can use your phone's camera).

<h2>            Skype for Ipad</h2>
                    As of the last 2 weeks I have been having trouble with Skype for Ipad. I am running on iOS 12.0.1 and on the update from October 24, 2018. When I have the Skype app running in the background does not glitch at all but as soon as I open the app up it freezes
 and then it says "connection lost" and then catches back up. It does this multiple times during the call. I have deleted and redownloaded the app and even restarted my ipad but it still is giving me problems&nbsp;

    <title>How do I make my 64 bit Windows 7 use 64 bit Java as default &#40;not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I make my 64 bit Windows 7 use 64 bit Java as default &#40;not in browser&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 x64. I installed the Java 7 x64 JDK which also installed the x64 JRE. I use a 32 bit browser however so I also downloaded and installed the Java 7 JRE x86. My question is how can I make Windows use the 64 bit version of Java by default
 for programs not in the browser, and how can I check this? I also noticed that the javac command is not recognised in command prompt so it seems that the 32 bit java installation may have removed the 64 bit installation. Any help is greatly appreciated!<br />

            <p>Hi, Matt223,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open command prompt with administrator privileges</p>
<p>Type:&nbsp; <strong>java -version</strong></p>
<p>Press Enter</p>
<p>You'll see &nbsp;64-bit if installed/default, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control Panel &gt; Right click on Java icon</p>
<p>Click About button</p>
<p>You will see 64-bit next to version</p>
<p>If not, it is 32-Bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe if you open taskmanager you'll see *32 next to 32-Bit applications that are running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>64-bit Windows operating systems (which may be Windows 7, Vista or XP) come with a 32-bit Internet Explorer (IE) browser as the standard (default) for viewing web pages. These operating systems also include a 64-bit Internet Explorer browser, however using
 it is optional and it must be explicitly selected to view web pages. Note that because some web content may not work properly in a 64-bit browser, we recommend using the default 32-bit browser and downloading 32-bit Java.<br />

    <title>Reinstalling windows 8 after hard drive failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dakmor83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling windows 8 after hard drive failure</h2>
                    Let's say I bought a laptop with Windows 8 preinstalled (I'm considering buying Lenovo Yoga 13)
<div>and then one of the following things happen:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- my hard drive dies</div>
<div>- I want to repartition the hard drive and format it</div>
<div>- I want to buy a new hard drive and replace the existing one</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The question: what is the sure way to reinstall the OEM Windows 8 that comes with laptop on a clean&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>(no restore partition) hard drive?</b></div>
<div>The assumption here is that I start with a working "factory default" laptop.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Some background:</div>
<div>I read some of the topics on these forums and my current understanding is that the activation key for OEM Windows 8 is stored somewhere in BIOS/UEFI and can be pulled out by windows installed. I'm fine with that. Where do I get the install media
 in this case? In Microsoft store I've been told (by a technician) that I essentially would need to buy an OEM Windows 8. I certainly hope that gentleman I was&nbsp;talking to just doesn't know his stuff. My understanding is that by purchasing the windows laptop
 I'm also purchasing the licence for this particular OEM Windows installed on it (tied to hardware and all).</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After looking around a bit, I can't find any details about a Recovery device at all either. Only something concerning a "Recovery Image".
</p>
<p>The problem is that if your hard drive is a replacement or reformatted, it would seem to me that the image would be useless as the software required to load it would be gone.</p>
<p>Unless the "Image" would contain the software required to load it, and that is doubtful...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sooooo, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest picking up Acronis TrueImage, preferably the Plus Pack version, or something similar...</p>
<p>I have tried a number of Imaging programs, including some of the free ones, and Acronis seems to be about the best (and fastest).
</p>
<p>There are a few programs that can detect that they have been reloaded from an image, and require reinstallation... That hardly ever seems to happen with Acronis images for some reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can frequently find it on sale cheap, and sometimes free after rebate if you want to wait.....</p>
<p>It compresses the Image it creates, and takes up a lot less space as a result...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 128GB SSD loaded with programs that take up about 60GB... Acronis compresses the image to about 20GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will reload the Image onto ANY HDD\SSD that is large enough... 60GB for instance.</p>
<p>You can Image the entire drive or individual partitions... In your case I would recommend both as soon as you get the computer. Just to cover all of the bases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only draw back to this is that you will need an external HDD or Flash of sufficient capacity...</p>
<p>I make new OS Images everytime I make a major time consuming change or update. In the event of a problem, 15 minutes to make a new image is nothing compared to having to start over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have about 10 images of Win 8 since I installed it taking up about 180GB...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My understanding is that the Acronis installation CD is also bootable... which is when you want to use it anyway. I can't confirm this at the moment as my bootable&nbsp;CD&nbsp;was burned by the installed version of Acronis and I can't find the original disk to test
 it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Ttanks for that, I see the error . . 
<br />
<br />Open the Registry Editor again, it should still be on the same page
<br />
<br />In the right pane, double click Desktop (indicated below)
<br />
<br />Paste this into its data value and click OK
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%\Desktop
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and restart your PC
<br />
<br />That's It, your Desktop will not be the one under 'This PC' and not the OneDrive Desktop . ..<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad7a6f5d-a670-40a0-94fb-1a6dc7451f47?upload=true" />

<h2>            Asus transformer T100HAN touchscreen not working</h2>
                    My Asus transformer pad's touchscreen has stopped working ever since I reinstalled windows and when I checked the device manager, I saw that there was a problem with a I2C HID device which showed error 10 in device status&nbsp;(device not&nbsp; connected). I have
 already tried troubleshooting which reinstalls the drivers. Is there any other possible solution or is this a hardware issue?

<h2>            Xbox One Chatpad</h2>
                    So I wrote a post prior to this and it doesn't seem to exist anymore.. Anywho, my problem is that I use the Xbox One chatpad and I tend to use the Mute button frequently.. However if I use the mute button for an extended period of time.. I'll press mute
 again to unmute it but my Mic will just stop working and I have to unplug my mic cable and plug it back in for it to be able to use my mic.. I was just wondering if anyone else has this problem with the mute button or if this is just like something with the
 chatpad that needs to be updated in the near future. I can say that I use to use the headset adapter before the Xbox one chatpad released and I could keep my mute button activated for long periods of time and just press mute again and my mic would work just
 fine without having to unplug and plug back in my mic cable. if anyone could let me know any information or if they also experience this issue please reply to this post. I appreciate any kind of feedback! Thanks!

<h2>            Cleared Data for ME3</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>I beat ME2 back when it first came out.&nbsp; Recently, I purchased the three story downloads - Overlord, LotSB, and Arrival - and just finished my second playthrough.... (well, sort of.)&nbsp; Before I began my second playthrough, I read somewhere (don't remember
 if it was here or on the Bioware forums) that the story would make "more sense" playing Overlord and LotSB during the campaign,&nbsp;but&nbsp;wait to play Arrival until&nbsp;after I beat the main story.&nbsp; So I'm doing that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just finished the Suicide Mission, everyone lived,&nbsp;told TIM to take a hike, and watched the credits.&nbsp; After the credits concluded, I was prompted with two choices:</p>
<p>A. continue playing from here to explore the galaxy and finish undone missions, or-</p>
<p>B. go to Main Menu and start a fresh campaign with your current Shepard's stats, guns, armor, resources and credits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So here's my question.&nbsp; On ME1, there is a "ghost save" that is made&nbsp;after every conclusion of your campaign, containing all your choices that you made along the way.&nbsp; And when ME2 came out, you used that "Ghost Save" and imported your Shepard, with all
 the info of what you accomplished from the first game.&nbsp; After beating ME2 just now, when I saw that screen asking me&nbsp;which choice do I want, A or B&nbsp;--- I imagine that an ME2 "ghost save" was just&nbsp;created so that I can import over to ME3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the thing is.... I haven't completed Arrival yet.&nbsp; I saved it for last because of the recommendations of a few people stating that the "Arrival" mission is best completed after you beat the main story.&nbsp; But since that "Cleared Data Save" or "Ghost Save"
 was already created, are my decisions on Arrival going to be omitted from that "Imported Save" because I never completed Arrival&nbsp;until AFTER&nbsp;the "GhostSave" was created?&nbsp; Hope you guys and gals understand what I'm trying to say because I don't know how else
 to explain what I'm asking. ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>That's good news! &nbsp;Thanks a million, Schuey! &nbsp;I thought I was gonna have to go back to a previous save slot before the Suicide Mission and play Arrival from there. &nbsp;That's a load off my mind. &nbsp;Thanks again, sir!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps. I have VERY much enjoyed all the downloadable missions.&nbsp; Very good.&nbsp; I'm almost done with Arrival.</p>

<p>I'm curious as to what the differences are going to be based on the decisions you make in 'Arrival'. &nbsp;Sounds like, no matter what the outcome, you're going to find yourself in court at the beginning of ME3 anyway. &nbsp;Are The Batarians going to be loyal to
 you in the next game because you warned them that you're about to destroy one of their systems?</p>

<p>I assume so, which is why I chose to warn them. &nbsp;But it always seems that you're on 'thin ice' during conversations with Batarians throughout ME1 &amp; ME2. &nbsp;That's what I like about them. &nbsp;They are easily pushed over the edge and won't hesitate to pick a fight
 with Shepard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which reminds me... I hope Bioware doesn't forget that my Shepard is still waiting patiently for another meeting with Balak. &nbsp;Shepard's got a 'loose end' that needs tying!&nbsp; I have a bullet with Balak's name on it!</p>

<p>Interesting that HERO SMURF brought up Balak. &nbsp;I was wondering about his reappearance in ME3 myself, ironic though, he was probably one of the more mellow Batarians in the game. &nbsp;If you killed Balak, the other Batarian who you met earlier on Asteroid X57
 would assume command. &nbsp;Having made this deal with him, you'd think that he'd owe you a favour and perhaps help out in the fight against The Reapers...:-)

<h2>            Is Photo Impact 8 compatible with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have a new computer with windows 7 and have been using Photo Impact 8. however some of the features on PI8 do not seem to be compatable with widows 7. I have tried, compatability with XP and Vista but no luck. Maybe I need to purchase a later version
 of Phot Impact. Any help would be appreciated

            <p>Corel do not support PhotoImpact X3 and refer to it as a legacy program. They would not let me register a new OEM version for this reason. In fact I couldn't get it to work on Windows 7 anyway and the program compatability feature showed that it is not compatible.</p>
<p>If you manage to download a trial copy of PhotoImpact X3 you will find that it is timestopped and will not work without an activation code.&nbsp; This costs money and will be money wasted if you succeed in activating the program as it will not work.</p>
<p>The Corel news release above dates from 2008 and is now redundant.</p>

<p>it looks like the latest version of PhotoImpact is X3. This is the successor to version 12.</p>

<p><br />
Unless your tablet has a wired plug and/or you are using a USB to Ethernet adapter or something similar - you don't use wired ethernet.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
Sounds like you have other issues than just your Internet and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
First - get yourself a decent&nbsp;router to go between you and the rest of the&nbsp;world.&nbsp; The router helps separate you from the other people using the same Internet Service as you - you end up controlling the network on the other side of that router competely.&nbsp; Make
 sure you change the router password to something good (15+ characters containing at least three of the four following character sets: uppercase letters, lower case letters, numbers and symbols) and if it is a wireless router and you want to use it - WPA2 with
 a password different from the router password itself that follows the same rules already given for a good password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Once you have that - you could probably go wireless with a confidence - as long as you follow a few other common sense computing ideas.&nbsp; All your local accounts should have passwords that follow the same rules already given.&nbsp; Same for your online accounts -
 all of them should be changed to follow as closely as possible those rules.&nbsp; You may find some web pages won't allow the 15 characters - at least try to stick with the three of the four character types on those sites.&nbsp; Make sure you have your firewalls enabled
 on your systems - no exceptions allowed on the firewall settings.&nbsp; No third party remote software installed if you don't need it (LogMeIn, TeamViewer, etc.)&nbsp; A good antivirus software installed.&nbsp; A good antimalware software installed (no - an antivirus and
 antimalware software are *still* not the same thing as of yet.)&nbsp; Keep both of those updated - automatically.&nbsp; Don't install random stuff off the Internet.&nbsp; Don't open attachments to emails you don't trust - and even if you do trust them - scan the attachments
 first.&nbsp; Same with instant messaging.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
The encryption thing - other than protecting individual files you send out over the Internet and/or protecting some files you have saved on the local system from prying eyes if they get on the local system with some other account than yours (depending on your
 setup) - that's probably not helping you in the least.</p>

<h2>            Battlefield 4 Premium&#58; Refund Request.</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Battlefield 4 and the Premium Season pass but the game runs Atrociously on Xbox 360 and the game itself is unfinished, (Probably EA to blame.) The quality of the product is abysmal and am returning the game to where i bought it, however i cant refund
 the Premium pack at a retailer due to it being digital so i was told to ask Xbox for a refund and im asking how i would go about this, Thanks in advance :)</p>

<h2>            wireless racing wheel DOESNT have a center in games &#40;right or left, no straight forward&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Today i bought a used xbox 360 wireless racing wheel, it works fine, but there is no center in game (NFS Underground 2 and Forza Horizon).</p>
<p>It's right or left there is no straight forward, only sometimes.</p>
<p>Do i have something to download, a driver or something? Or do i need the original disc?</p>
<p>My xbox 360 elite is 2 weeks ago disconnected from the internet now because of a holiday.</p>
<p>I hope someone really can help me due the coming bad weather here in the Netherlands!</p>

<p>Grtz from Holland!</p>
<p>Ps. Sorry for any bad english!!</p>

<p>Hey mate, have you connected to Xbox Live since owning it? The best way to download the drivers is by connecting to Xbox Live. See here:

<p>I'm not sure what you mean by straight forward? Do you mean to accelerate? </p>

<p>What he means is that his when driving in the game, the car is always turning. There is no way to keep the car straight. My advice would be to check the sensitiviy. Turn it down a bit if you can. If that does not work, delete the driver, clear system cache

<p>I think it might a sensitivty issue since you said it sometimes goes straight. Try that out and if it does not work let us know.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Volldream,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on the forums.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>You might have some 3 party programs running in the background that’s crashing your system.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Let's try clean booting the system to remove 3rd party software and see if that clears up the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to place your computer in “clean boot”&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;orb on your Desktop</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Under Selective Startup, click to
<strong>clear the Load Startup Items check box</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to <strong>select the Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then
<strong>click Disable All</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong> OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Did you get the same error message?<br />
<br />
If this <strong>does</strong> resolve the issue, then see the following Microsoft Article on “Clean boot” and the section “How to determine what is causing the problem” to determine which program or service maybe causing the issue.

<p><span><span>How to set your computer back,&nbsp;to boot normal:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box. Type <strong>msconfig</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.&nbsp;<br />
Click the General tab.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> - <strong>load all device drivers and services</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>When you are prompted, click Restart to
<strong>restart the computer</strong>. </span></span></p>

<h2>            Classic Jigsaw - My Collections have disappeared &#38; Ghost Image doesn&#39;t always match puzzle pieces.</h2>
                    <p>My Premium Classic Jigsaw has been having issues.&nbsp;</p><p>1- The ghost image on one puzzle did not match the actual pieces. The image had less sky than the pieces provided, etc.</p><p>2&nbsp;- A few&nbsp;days ago I purchased three collections with "gold" and they downloaded.&nbsp; The next day or so, ALL&nbsp;of my "purchased" collections disappeared.&nbsp;I paid for the premium version in August&nbsp;because the ads were causing major freezes and&nbsp;driving me crazy.&nbsp; Now I can no longer finish the collections I've built up over the past several months.&nbsp;I've tried to contact MS Games directly, and Support is literally not available by phone or chat. Instead a&nbsp;virtual assistant sent me back to the forums. There are similar issues listed there, but they have not been answered.&nbsp; Please help--I would very much like to have My Collections back!!!<br /></p>

            <p>Same issue here with trying to preview DNG files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brand new Surface Pro 3 (Windows 8.1 x64) fully updated but unable to preview DNG files or see meta data in Explorer (Details tab of File Properties).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to download and install "Update for Microsoft Camera Codec Pack for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB2899189)" I get a message saying it's already installed. I can confirm this exists in the registry but not on the file system at "C:\windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\b7fdfb823998fa048bbaf86410b71f0c\windows8.1-kb2899189-x64.cab".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to download and install "Update for Microsoft Camera Codec Pack for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB2859675)" I get a message saying it's not applicable. I'm unable to find any references to "KB2899189" in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching for "codec" in Programs and Features, Installed Updates showed the Codec. I uninstalled it restarted and successfully reinstalled KB2899189. Windows Update offered a different update "</p>
<p>Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB2979500)" but after installing it and a restart I'm back at square one with no previews or meta data for DNG files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone at Microsoft please look into this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Adobe Lightroom 5.6 also installed.</p>

            <p>Hi Walt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post! I understand that "Turn off password protected sharing" won't stay turned on. I'll try my best to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reproducing the issue, following the steps you provided. However, when I turned off password protected sharing and tap Save changes, when I came back again, it was still chosen.</p>
<p>Because yours does not save changes, try choosing "Turn off password protected sharing" again, restart your device, and go back to the settings again.</p>
<p>Please ensure that your device is fully up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know the results. Hope to hear from you soon!</p>

    <title>Skype doesn&#39;t recognise my microsoft account and merged my Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hernancaceres13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype doesn&#39;t recognise my microsoft account and merged my Skype user with a gmail account, a complete mess&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to sign in with my primary email (@hotmail) it doesn't recognise my account and loads an account which I never created, but now it is associated with my&nbsp;@hotmail email. If I log in with my username, on the other hand, although it recognises
 my contacts and overall account (it even has my @hotmail email listed as primary address), it often doesn't recognise my password. In summary, I am always having issues login into my Skype account. Is there any way of merging accounts, or doing something about
 these constant problems with the app? Considering it is a personal/business account it should recognise changes in the primary email and maintain the same account details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help, cheers,</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4cccdc1f-588a-4a36-9f21-9cb5733c1fa7" title="hernancaceres13">
<p>
</p><p>If your Skype account was fully-updated (<em>successfully merged to a Microsoft account</em>), you can either use
<strong>Skype name </strong>or <strong>Microsoft email address </strong>(<em>the one merged to your Skype account</em>)&nbsp;then its password to sign in to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you usually sign in using a <strong>Skype username</strong> and then you signed in using its primary email address instead, it will automatically create another Skype account under it. The new account has the system-generated username
<em><strong>"live:[Whatever word comes before @ in the email]" </strong></em>and can be accessed using the email account credential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, it is not possible to merge <strong>two Skype accounts </strong>as well as a
<strong>Skype account to an existing Microsoft account</strong>. What possible is to merge a Skype account to a new Microsoft account created within the process of merging.</p>
