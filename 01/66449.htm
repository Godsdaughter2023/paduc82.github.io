            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />Please, try the following procedures below:
<br />
<br />1. Try right-clicking a Word icon app; on the Context Menu, click Open With, and then click the option to set the default program. 
<br />2. Specify that the file should open in Word. If you don't see Word in the list of suggested programs, you have to browse for winword.exe.

<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />

    <title>Microsoft Boot Option in My Bios - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuckclausen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Boot Option in My Bios</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run windows 10 on a Dell XPS 8920 computer. Until just a few days ago there were only (3) boot options in my bios and they are Windows Boot Manager, Onboard NIC (IPV4) and (IPV6). Now, suddenly, out of nowhere, there is a fourth option named (microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea where this fourth option came from or why it's on my computer. Microsoft certainly never told me in anyway that they were changing&nbsp;or adding a new&nbsp;boot option in my bios and I never asked them to do so. I want to know how and why this additional
 option was put on my computer. I'm concerned that this may be a security breech because Microsoft didn't tell me that they were making changes to my computer. Does Microsoft even know that this kind of change is happening? So far, all of the tech support people
 &nbsp;who I have spoken to say they are completely unaware of this issue. The Dell Support&nbsp;representative&nbsp;who&nbsp;I spoke with&nbsp;connected with a Microsoft representative who said he had never heard of such a change taking place&nbsp;and dismissed my concern. Of course that
 only heighted my concern and made me more determined than ever to find out why the boot bios on my computer&nbsp;has been altered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If somebody could enlighten me about this change I would seriously appreciate the help and the&nbsp;education.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C.C.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure where a "Microsoft" boot option would come from, except possibly as a result of a build update... I have never personally seen this either...</p>
<p>Do you possibly have a pending upgrade to Windows 10 waiting a Restart in Windows Updates ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did not actually add anything to your computer's bios...</p>
<p>What is most likely happening is that your "Bios" is detecting an additional boot file and\or partition on one of your HDDs\SSDs\Flash Drives\… The same as it does "WindowsBootManager" which is on the small "EFI" partition......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check in Disk Management to see if you might have a new partition on one of your drives... It is possible that the partition in question... if it even exists... is "Hidden" and may require a bootable 3rd party Disk Management utility to view it...</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I checked the 32\dfrgui and there are no hidden partitions, just drives C and D which I have always had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been curious to use the Microsoft boot option as the first option but so far I'm a little too chicken to commit to the plunge.&nbsp;I don't want to make any changes I can't easily undo until Support at Dell gives up their quest to try and figure out what's
 happened. It's times like this that I wish&nbsp;my computer was Bill Gates computer because the problem would probably be solved in about two minutes or less but alas....I'm just a pleb asking&nbsp;for help and hanging on to hope.</p>

            That potentially looks like an option to mount the Microsoft recovery partition. I have never seen it before, but could you try booting from it to see what it does?

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted from the Microsoft option and the computer stared up normally. After that I rebooted it again to check the bios and the Windows Manager appeared as the first option and the Microsoft option was moved back to the fourth option. I repeated this a
 few more&nbsp;times and got the same result every time. I don't know what to make of it. I also deleted the 4th, Microsoft option but as soon as I pressed F9 to load the defaults it returned so it seems to want to be a permanent fixture.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About four days ago I was into the control panel and opened up Security and Maintenance, just checking stuff out. I noticed that there was a small icon blinking near the Security arrow just above the Maintenance arrow. The word download was blinking and
 for some reason I was immediately suspicious so I did nothing except close off the page from the small x at&nbsp;the top right of the page. I never went back into the control panel until this evening to see if the word download was still there and still&nbsp;blinking
 but it wasn't. I have a feeling that something was downloaded onto my computer even though&nbsp;I didn't authorize it.&nbsp;I had forgotten about this little incident until this evening and now I'm really vexed. I'd be a lot happier if that blinking request for a down
 load was still visible but there is no sign of it anywhere.&nbsp; Of course there is the possibility that it is not related to the appearance of the new boot option appearing&nbsp;in the bios&nbsp;but it did ask to be downloaded and the coincidence is rather timely. Sadly
 I'm not savvy enough to determine if an actual download of software took place.</p>

    <title>Forza Horizon 2 &#40;I was charged 3x for this game&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 2 &#40;I was charged 3x for this game&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>When I went to download Forza Horizon 2, I was charged 3x for the same download. I have spoken with support on the phone, and they advised me that they would look into this issue and would eventually (in 72 hours) refund my money. The problem is that I use
 a secondary bank account for games and entertainment purchases that only has the amount of money in it that I budget for these expenses. When the Xbox store charged me for 2 extra copies of this game, it overdrew my account. Fortunately, I had enough money
 in my primary bank account to cover the cost, but now my bank is still charging me fees for overdraft protection and my account almost got locked.</p>
<p><br />
This has been a huge headache over something that shouldn't have been an issue in the first place. I was told by a support tech over chat that they couldn't help me and I needed to lodge my complaint here.</p>

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>sorry for the poor terminology!</p>
<p>Downloading from the support page as I do not have a disc drive.Following the prompts, and the printer is failing to find a computer. Keep getting message 'Run the software on the computer before continuing'</p>
<p>I click Download again, then run then get the Failed message.</p>
<p>Have tried saving it then running, and still getting the same Failed message...sooo frustrating!Trying turning the printer off and starting the whole install again...Wow seems to have done the trick.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway :)</p>
<p>Oh No!!</p>
<p>Now I am getting 'Communication error.Check the connection' when trying to scan to desktop. :(</p>

<div>Hi <strong>Perrybassplayer</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.&nbsp; Are you able to see the gadgets listed when you right click on your desktop?<br />
2.&nbsp; Do you remember any software/hardware changes done on your computer?</div>
<div>3. What happens when you launch the gadgets?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.</div>
<div>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of
 your first troubleshooting steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click Allow<br />
b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:&nbsp; <strong>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; [The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft versions.]</div>
<div><br />
A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time<br />
c. If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to continue<br />
d. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find any integrity violations"<br />
e. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan –</div>

<div><strong>You can also use the Event Viewer&nbsp;to check for the errors related to sidebar or gadgets.</strong></div>
<div><br />

<p>

</p><p>The PC of a friend has been having this problem for a while. Whenever he tries to install software he gets the error "A required privilege is not held by the client". So it is virtually impossible to install anything. We have tried to apply different 2 solutions,

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>Thank you for getting back to me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not 100% sure, BUT I'm almost certain the PC is set to get automatic updates &amp; so has the most recent version of Windows, because in the past, this person always had this updates settings</li><li>Currently <strong>NO program can be installed</strong>. We tried several including a version of Ants download manager. I can only access the PC via TeamViewer. In the last couple of weeks, he's
<strong>not been able to install anything</strong> &amp; so that's why he contacted me. This behavior is recent &amp; there had never been a failure to install any software before</li><li>The PC only has the one administrator account &amp; there's no problem with this before</li></ul>
<p>I've in the meantime posted your suggested link but it'll take a while to get feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

    <title>Taskbar disappeared on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dana_a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar disappeared on Windows 7</h2>
                    My taskbar just disappeared, for no&nbsp;apparent&nbsp;reason - I don't recall pressing any special keys or something to change any settings.
<div>I can get it back with the Windows-key (below-left corner of keyboard, used to go to Start Menu), but it's quite annoying to have to press it every time, and I just want my taskbar back. I already checked the taskbar's properties and the Auto-hide function
 is turned off, so that can't be it.
<div>Also, when I close/minimize the windows of all the programs, i.e. when I'm on my desktop, I can see the taskbar again. But as soon as I open a window, it disappears.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any advice on how to make the taskbar permanently&nbsp;visible&nbsp;again?</div>
</div>

            Hi&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/70077d0b-fb40-4c46-bb76-35f5fbb1774c">
Dana_A</a>,
<div><span>There are several possibilities for why. Here's the most likely:</span><br />
<br />
<span>The task bar is resizable, like a window. You may have accidentally</span><br />
<span>resized it to zero lines high. Put the cursor on the bottom of the</span><br />
<span>screen and move it up and down slightly until it turns into a</span><br />
<span>double-headed arrow. Then click and drag it to the size you want.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<span>If that doesn't work, it may be zero lines high on another side of the</span><br />
<span>screen, so try on all four sides.</span><br />
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>If None of these work, Try This <a href="http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/regs_edits/xp_taskbar_desktop_fixall.vbs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            No I already checked if I didn't accidentally put it on full screen, and that wasn't it either. It's just the taskbar that's missing, not the tabs in my internet browser, and if I press F11 it still goes to full screen - which means that it isn't on full
 screen right now.

            I had this problem today after running a Windows Update (sigh....why do small things stop working in Windows every time I run an update??????&nbsp; One day, I'm going to defect to the Mac.)&nbsp; After searching the web and trying a bunch of recommended solutions
 and checking settings (like you did),&nbsp; I finally fixed it ACCIDENTALLY! &nbsp; I clicked on the Restore icon in the upper right hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; The IE window resized into a smaller window.&nbsp; Then, when I hit the Restore icon again, the IE window went
 back to full size.&nbsp; But this time, the task bar was showing at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; Go figure.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps crashing after getting Windows updates today--DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL error</h2>
                    <p>So, when I got up today, my Lenovo tower, which I've barely had a year and has Windows 10, was working fine. Then some Windows updates automatically installed. Now every time I go to log in, Windows 10 crashes and restarts after showing an error screen with
 this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get as far as my desktop before it craps out, sometimes not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going into options and doing a system restore, but apparently my system does not set restore points automatically, so I couldn't try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>help! right now that PC is unusable, and I a had to dust off my old Lenovo ThinkPad, which still runs Windows 7 . . .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi. Sorry for belated response . . . been very busy and just hand't had time to deal with trying to go through these steps . . . plus up til today, every time I tried, I got nowhere, bc my PC would keep crashing, and I couldn't even get it go into safe mode,
 much less get in and access the dmp files and upload them etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyhoo I finally called Geek Squad at the Best Buy where I bought the PC tonite and made an appt to take the PC in and get them to deal w problem. I just re-upped my coverage anyway . . . but one thing guy said--if using a wireless keyboard such as an MS
 or LogiTech one, could be causing part of problems; some sort of conflict with both Windows 10 and Webroot, the antivirus I got when I purchased PC and that covers that and my old laptop currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so before packing up my tower to take it in, I found my old wired keyboard and mouse, plugged 'em in to the PC, powered up, got back into Advanced Options, and lo and behold was able to get the PC to go into safe mode and stay on. I found the dmp files and
 zipped them up and saved them to my external hard drive, bc I couldn't access the Internet in safe mode. but before resorting to working on getting one drive set up on my old laptop, I decided to try restarting my PC in normal mode. and lo and behold that
 worked too, so far, but I also had it go back to working normally on its own for a few days last wk, before starting to crash again. so I don't totally trust it yet and still may take it in tomorrow as planned to get cleaned up. right now the login screen
 is only showing a garish green background and no cool Windows 10 backgrounds, for one thing . . .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>but, here is link to my last three dmp files on OneDrive anyway . . . <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s%21AuFmnnIwYQ3xhD7d_EidJgtHFTJ6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://1drv.ms/u/s!</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>if you can suggest anything before mid-day EST on Wed, maybe I will try it befroe tkaing to geek squad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andy</p>

            <p>hi, thanks. these two responses seem to jive with what the guy at Geek Squad was saying--that some wireless keyboards + Windows 10 updates + Webroot = crashes or inability to boot up. The crazy thing is I was using the same exact MS 2000 wireless keyboard
 and mouse combo for close to a year with this new PC and Windows 10 and Webroot with no such issues . . .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using old wired mouse and keyboard since last night &amp; no crashes thus far, so opted to hold off on taking into Geek Squad . . . have not tried getting and installing the keyboard driver fix yet, not sure I follow that. and have not read all of
 webroot article yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to keep using my existing wireless keyboard and mouse with this PC if possible. if I get those fixes on the one page, what is chance I will be able to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>but if I have to do wired or a different wireless mouse and keyboard, can do, anything that prevents those instant crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again,</p>

<p>
</p><p>The issue appears to affect some Microsoft wireless keyboards only.</p>

    <title>Making a Win XP PRO 32bit SP3 into a dual boot Win XP&#47;Win10 system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meanspitfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making a Win XP PRO 32bit SP3 into a dual boot Win XP&#47;Win10  system</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I need advice on the following: I have a 2TB HD with Win XP PRO 32bit, SP3. I want to make it a dual boot disk with 100GB for XP, so that I can&nbsp;keep my flight simulators, and 1.9TB for Win 10. After I back up all my data and delete all but XP from my HD, how
 do I proceed?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1- I'm not sure if I should keep XP and then partition the HD to add Win 10, or if it's the other way around, 10 first, and then XP. I have&nbsp;the original XP disk, but not SP3 of course.<br />
<br />
(I have a Surface3 which I can use for downloads, if neeeded.)<br />
<br />
2- When dowloading Win 10, I assume that I have the option of saving it to disk, without installing it immediately, am I right?<br />
<br />
3- If I need to wipe XP, will I still be able to install SP3 for it later after re-installing it in its own partition? I assume all the security&nbsp;updates added to XP over the years will NOT be available anymore?<br />
<br />
If you can give me a step by step modus operandi, I'd appreciate it greatly.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, &nbsp;:-)<br />
<br />

            <p>When dual booting Windows 10 and older versions of Windows, the older version of Windows (XP in your case), must be installed first. There is no point in dual booting only to eventually delete Windows XP at a later date. Installing on a logical partition
 will only complicate matters. If your intention is to use XP at a later date, it would be better to put it in a virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sense you might need to use Windows XP in the future, keep the current configuration. Just reduce the size of the partition to a 100 GB as you suggested, then install Windows 10 on the much larger partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download Windows 10 and create a bootable copy on a USB key or DVD:</p>

<h2>            Win XP Pro&#58; fresh install won&#39;t boot</h2>
                    
<p>I'm upgrading an old computer from a 20gb harddrive to a 250gb drive.</p>
<p>The 250gb drive is a Western Digital USB external that I connected to another system and verified that it loaded properly and had been formatted before it was put in storage. I removed the IDE drive from the external USB housing and removed the 20gb drive
 from the tower, then installed the 250gb drive into the tower.</p>
<p>After starting the machine back up, I set the BIOS boot order to: IDE0; CDROM; floppy (this computer is that old...)</p>
<p>The drive has the jumper setting at Master, and is plugged into the end of the ide cable, it is the only item on that cable. BIOS recognizes it during POST as being the primary master, and idetifies it as a 250gb WD drive.</p>
<p>I booted from my XP Pro install disc, and installed XP successfully using a 15gb partition for the install. When it boots up now, BIOS still identifies the HDD properly during POST, but it won't boot. I can only boot from CD.</p>
<p>I've tried using the Recovery console and the commands "bootcfg /rebuild" followed by "fixboot" followed by "fixmbr" and it still won't boot from the HDD.</p>
<p>If I don't go to the recovery console, the XP CD offers to repair the already installed system or install it fresh, I've tried repairing and I've tried deleting all partitions again and re-installing, no change.</p>
<p>ANyone have any ideas? This is driving me crazy and I'm sure it's gotta be a simple stupid fix that I'm overlooking, but I'm at my wit's end..</p>

<p>Department of Shoulda, Coulda, Wouda:&nbsp; you might have been better off using a disk cloning app, e.g., Acronis True Image, to simply clone the 20 GB drive to the 250 GB drive.</p>
<p>However, ...</p>
<p>If the computer's really old, the BIOS may be having difficulty with the large disk, notwithstanding that you've only used 15 GB for the primary partition. IIRC, I used to have a Win 95 computer in which the BIOS did not automatically detect the disk, but
 rather had to be configured for the number of platters, tracks, etc.&nbsp; If your BIOS is on the cusp of automatic detection, it may be stumbling over the size of the drive, so look in the BIOS not just for boot sequence, but for something to do with recognizing
 the drive.</p>
<p>Also note that Win XP had no support for disks over 137 GB prior to Service Pack 1.&nbsp; What service pack level is your XP install CD?&nbsp; If you have a pre-SP1 CD, you ought to slipstream it to make an SP2 CD (if you want to have an SP3 CD, you'll have to do
 it in stages, as SP3 requires either SP1 or 1a, and won't install properly from XP gold).</p>

<p>The 20gb had that stupid WinBorg XP ____ on it, since I own a legitamate copy of XP Pro I wanted to install that instead, I don't trust "hacked" tool collections with stolen software..</p>
<p>I know what you mean about the cylinder numbers and whatnot.. I vaguely recall my K6-II chip/board combo needing that information, this BIOS doesn't have those options though.. IIRC its Award ver 6.00, could probably use a flash, but it does accurately identify
 the HD during post as a WB 250gb..</p>
<p>My XP includes SP3 ver. 2002.</p>
<p>I'll check those links, thanks for taking the time to respond! I appreciate any and all help :)</p>

<p>Sorry about that.&nbsp; I thought I did a copy and paste: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/303013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/303013</a> -- but it's an sp1 article and probably won't help if you installed XP sp3.</p>
<p>The other one is a rather long and rambling thread that a number of people with different but related issues hijacked.&nbsp; There may indeed be nothing in there that relates to your particular situation.&nbsp; On re-reading more closely, it looks as if the common
 point in that thread is that all of the problems were related to the boot partition being &gt; 137 GB -- which is not your issue ... and especially not so given that you installed XP sp3, which should be able to deal with large partitions.</p>
<p>To me, it sounds like a BIOS issue, but that's only a guess.</p>

<p>no problem, like I said, I appreciate your time in trying to help.</p>
<p>I'm thinking maybe a BIOS thing too.. I guess it has been a LOOONG time since I've worked with an older machine, last time I did anything like this, you could still get BIOS flash updates for free.. now it seems they want $30 for a yearly subscription? WTH?</p>

<p>Firmware updates are still free as far as I know.</p>
<p>Make sure you're checking the manufacturers website for it.</p>

            <p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>External CD players are plug-n-play device. You just need to connect them to the computer (USB port) and Windows will detect it. The drivers will be automatically installed for the drive.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you facing an issue while using an external CD ROM when connected to the computer?</li><li>Do you receive an error message? </li></ol>
<p>If the device is not getting detected, you may use a different USB port and verify the status of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you need more assistance on the issue. </p>

            Hi areebyounus,
<br />
<br />In the batch file. or Powershell script, you could set these credentials in a variable. 
<br />
<br />You will need to modify the command to include the -u and -p switches, as well as the variables: psexec.exe \\&lt;ENTER SERVER NAME HERE&gt; cmd  $username -p $password
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

<p>Hi,&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Could you please answer these below questions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From which Government website are you trying to open the file?</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you receive any error message while opening the file?</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which is the Internet browser you are using to open files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could also occur if the right file is not associated to open them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence follow the link below to change the file association on your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change which programs Windows uses by default&nbsp;</p>
