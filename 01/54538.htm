<h2>            Game DVR issues&#47;bug</h2>
                    
<p>my game dvr has been <strong>acting strange</strong> the the last few months. it all started around the time the ea access play days ended in june. i had been using the feature extensively which i always do when i play a new game. after a game session i
 would launch the app to review the clips i made.i noticed that some clips were<strong> missing</strong> but checking back later they were there. then when i checked my<em> xboxdvr.com</em> for my clips i noticed that a massive ton of clips were missing.the
<strong>purge</strong> affected a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">specific area</span> so i had
<em>older clips that were fine as well as my newest ones</em>. when i checked the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>game dvr app on the xbox</strong></span> one the clips were still there but i could
<strong>neither save or delete them</strong> the only option i has was help and switch user for a clip.all the clips affected were unsaved but i did not get any space warnings and some pretty old unsaved clips were still present.so i had a ton of clips that
 were unsavable/undeletable that could not be view outside the xo game dvr app <strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">even on the official</span> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
xbox website and the windows 10 app the clips were inaccessible</span></strong>. to try and remedy this i deleted the older clips after downloading and archiving &nbsp;them but it did not work i had a mostly empty game dvr with a ton of deadweight clips. i could
 upload these clips with upload studio though but i would have to do so for each clip individual with about 200 clips this wold not be a viable option.<em>things only got worse</em></p>
<p>after a while all the affected clips were <strong>deleted</strong> somehow so they were
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lost foreve</span></em>r.also originally some
<strong>new clips were also deleted</strong> and lost( a few of them very special and very hard to replicate.it got even more worse than before</p>
<p>now i cannot have more than around 90 to 100 clips(<em>i get no space warnings</em>) &nbsp;because clips on the lower end get<strong><em> deleted automatically</em></strong> at my peak i had 270 clips+
<em>before i got any warnings and clips would never get deleted automatically</em>. shortly after a clip is added they cannot be saved and
<strong>can only be</strong> deleted and many clips <strong>fail</strong> when i save them i had 0 saved clips so
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">my saved space is not filled in any way</span></strong>. i tried to save a bunch of newer clips but only a fraction of them actually are now saved. this is frustrating &nbsp;because now i record a clip(always 30 seconds
 btw) then a few days later it may become <strong>inaccessible</strong> outside xo game dvr app then it will
<em>eventually get deleted</em> somehow.</p>
<p>my favorite feature of the generation is the game dvr i it has become such a huge hassle. now i always download and archive new clips to my laptop.</p>
<p>this has become a huge burden to me because i am interested in content creation(specifically as a hobby)and want to use my clips as material. i also share my clips with others most notably in the halo community and get my clips featured in youtube videos
 . when they click on a link i posted and i comes up to and error it hurts my credibility.</p>
<p>i had contacted xbox support on twitter and after looking into they told me to<strong> contact the phone/chat</strong> team.this is a problem as i made my account in america but do not currently live there but in a unsupported country so this post is my
 best option. im looking to contact support because i think my game dvr data is having sync issues and my cloud space is corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>in short my game dvr worked fine before and is not working fine now and getting worse.</p>
<p>i have tried the troubleshooting methods but to no avail&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/recording-problems-with-gamedvr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/recording-problems-with-gamedvr</a>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey, Mazharul Alam! I'm incredibly sorry to see any frustrations, however you've hit the nail on the head as to why you are having issues. You are likely having all of these Game DVR issues because you are in an unsupported region, and your account information does not match that region (which can cause further issues). We cannot guarantee the experience you will have while in unsupported regions, and we are unable to provide any assistance for users in regions that are unsupported.</p>
<p>If you are in a region that is currently supported, and need further assistance, please do not hesitate to create a new thread detailing what you're running into so that our community can help you out. Thanks for understanding!</p>

    <title>Indexing Service &#40;Windows Search&#41; hangs -- prevents other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjsante  say:</h3>
<h2>            Indexing Service &#40;Windows Search&#41; hangs -- prevents other applications from launching</h2>
                    Running Vista Ultimate on an HP Media Center PC with 4 GB memory, Intel Core 2 processor.<br />
<br />
In the last week, Outlook 2007 stopped launching without an error.&nbsp; It hangs with the splash screen and the outline of the main window visible.&nbsp; Adobe Lightroom 2.6 stopped launching, providing a "Server Busy" dialog box where none of the buttons appear to
 do anything.<br />
<br />
Looking through several Microsoft and Adobe forums led me to the indexing service, Windows Search.&nbsp; The indexing applet in Control Panel opened and displayed the message "Attempting to retrieve indexing status" and never changed.<br />
<br />
I tried stopping Windows Search service but it would not stop--returning an error that stated that it had not been able to stop the service in the allotted time.<br />
<br />
I then tried disabling the service, rebooting the PC, and everything worked&nbsp; as it should, although when I launch Outlook it gives me a warning message about the indexing service being disabled.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Restarting the service again prevented Outlook and Lightroom from launching--again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So, how do I get the indexing service to run again, without adversely affecting my ability to run other applications?

            The safest way: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/gp/windows_search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/gp/windows_search</a><br />
The (probably)&nbsp;safe way - it is possible that one of the search filters is causing the issue. You may want to use
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/search_filter_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this program</a> to list&nbsp;file extensions associated with filters&nbsp;that Windows Search uses. You may want to compare the list of filters with those from a "almost clean install of Windows Vista SP2"&nbsp;(check
<a href="http://cid-2346b7ae026281f6.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/WSearchFilterList.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>). You may want to remove the extensions for non-Microsoft programs.<br />
The dangerous way -&nbsp;try the below <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">at your own risk</span> (tested in a very limited way on Virtual PC, it seems to be&nbsp;working but I can't tell if it doesn't break anything).<br />
Set Windows Search service startup type to "Disabled" and reboot. After reboot open Command Prompt as an Administrator (right-click on Command Prompt icon and choose "Run as Administrator"). Enter
<strong>rmdir /S /Q %programdata%\Microsoft\Search</strong> in the Command Prompt window (this removes the folder where, by default, Windows Search stores it's files). Once you do that, set the Windows Search service startup type to "Automatic" and start the
 service. Now, it may not start the first time you do it. In that case try again.

<p>We have also been having youtube issues for the past couple of weeks. Anything else seems to work fine (netflix, etc) but Youtube consistently signs us out of Xbox live.. So we sign in, try to access &amp; it signs us out again. Endless loop, two different XBOX360's,
 2 different accounts (just live now - not Live gold as of last week). Youtube isn't a paid application is it?</p>

            My XBox 360 was randomly disconnecting from Youtube during searches and videos, or refusing to load the Youtube app. When I ran the XBox connection checks, it told me everthing was fine, but that check doesn't relay info on connection speed or program
 conflicts. I was able to find and solve the problems, and all has been well for 3 months. If you want, follow the link below to the discussion where I explain the steps and what to check. I hope it helps. It's a shot and it's fixed the problem for others.

    <title>How to disable network discovery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable network discovery</h2>
                    
<p>When we were having problem with our old router, I have set up a computer-to-computer ad hoc&nbsp;network connection with&nbsp;my roommate's laptop computer in order to share my internet access (that is all).&nbsp; I set up a workgroup for both laptops (i.e. both Windows
 Vista).&nbsp;&nbsp;We now have a&nbsp;working router with TW, but she has been having problem&nbsp;browsing the internet whenever my compter is off or sometimes whenever I am browsing the internet her internet connection drops.&nbsp; The&nbsp;odd thing is it is intermittent.&nbsp; There is
 no pattern.&nbsp; The solution, in my mind, is to turn off my network discovery.&nbsp; But I can't do that too as the choice to turn off is greyed out.&nbsp;It seems the router only recognizes my compter only.&nbsp; Desperate to find answer. HELP PLEASE</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>As I understand it your computer connects to the Router and you have a second network card that connects Ad-Hoc to the second computer.</p>
<p>If so, the second computer is Not part of the Routing and that is why it behave as you describe (Network discovery as nothing to do with it).</p>
<p>You need to switch On ICS on the Host computer, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Using-ICS-Internet-Connection-Sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Using-ICS-Internet-Connection-Sharing</a></p>
<p>However, by doing so, you would get double NAT (Router+ICS) and it probably would be "Quirky" too.</p>
<p>The best solution is to get a New decent Router (they are very inexpensive these days), or to find out why the second computer is Not connecting well to the current Router.</p>

<p>Thanks Jack for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you are right. It seems to me that the second computer is not routing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buying a new router is not an option.&nbsp; We just had a new router from Time Warner.&nbsp; We replaced the old router.&nbsp; But no one can seem to fix the issue.&nbsp; We called Time Warner, Dell and even Norton.</p>
<p>Is there a simple solution to this? I did not configure anything else but the network sharing.&nbsp; If there is an option to turn it on.&nbsp; I should turn it off right. Because my roommate was able to turn off hers but I couldn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you mean by we would get double NAT (router + ICS) if I switch on my ICS?</p>
<p>Regards!</p>

            You should not use a large drive such as that for a recovery drive. A 16 GB USB thumb drive would be more appropriate. The 2 TB external would be better as a backup drive for your computer.

                    <p>Original title: DIGITAL CAMERA Fun.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DIGITAL CAMERA, cheap &amp; nasty.</strong></p>
<p>Have an old Digital Camera, found in Op-shop. Worked fine as web cam under (old) WIN98. Out of curiosity, tried on WIN7, won't work. Well, actually, there is no driver for it now. Could dig up WIN98 disc, but it's more fun any other way, ( read interesting).
 Disliking planned, or unplanned, obsolescennce, more wondering what the driverf file would look like, name, etc. It's an old dime-store el-cheapo model, called DIGITAL CAMERA, wow! Yeah, I know, dump it, but I really wnt to work out the Menu for it's operation.
 Multi -FUNction single button op' on rear, pretty basic. Probably a whole Mega- pixel job. Huge. 19 shots. Thanks, in&nbsp; advance, for any interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SUPERNOVA-EXTRORD.</p>

<h2>            Frozen while restoring</h2>
                    I tried to do a system restore to a previous save point, and the computer froze on me somewhere.&nbsp; It's been sitting on:<br />
"Please wait while Windows files and settings are being restored.&nbsp; System Restore is restoring the registry."<br />
<br />
It's been like this for over 24 hours now.<br />
<br />
How can I either get it back up or reinstall without a system disc?&nbsp; The computer never came with a restore disc.&nbsp; The computer is an E-Machine and is approximately 2 years old.

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by
 selecting the Repair computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash, when you are up and running
 again.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the
 disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

                    I &nbsp;have recently taken a free upgrade from windows 8.0 to 8.1 and Serif Pagemaker 9.0 (originally on Windows XP and loaded succesfully on to Windows 8.0) no longer opens. Message is that in entry procedure duplicate file handler not found in Windows\system32\urlmon.dll.
 Any chance of a fix? Yet another reliable piece of software torpedoed by the MS wiz kids.&nbsp;

<h2>            Noisy fan, squeeking sound</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry if i make mistake,im french ^^</p>

<p>I just wanted to know.. Im im the only one ?! Its my third Xbox one.. Sent it 3 times. Each one got the same problem after a couple of months..</p>

<p>Happened to a friend too, saw some ppl on the internet who had a noisy fan too.. And i take good care of my console. So i know it not my faut. I do play a lot though lol.</p>

<p>And its not the grinding sound somme ppl have.</p>
<p>More like a hamster wheel without oïl, or a mouse squeeking. '' sqeeek-sqeek'' &nbsp;every 2 sec or so. Loud. Your clearly ear it even if i up the volume verry high. Si annoying..</p>

<p>Just happenned 2 times with my mots recent Xbox, but if i heard it 1 one, im sure its gonna come back.. Im feeling haunted by my Xbox lol.. -.-</p>

<p>Im pretty sure its the fan, and thing is.. My warranty is out.</p>
<p>Ive been with Xbox for near 9 yrs.. Never been so disapointed towards them than i am now..&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a console that jour suppose to do everything with it, even watching TV, what good does that make when jour console start making noise after somme months..</p>

<p>Dont wanna pays 400 more for a maybe noisy new Xbox, i dont want to pay 135 of repair for something like that.. And i dont want to pays 400 for a PlayStation!!</p>

<p>Ive bhought 3 Xbox, one uses that still work #1. I've never Said a word. Now im ***..... What do i do?! Can we make complaints lol... ?!</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Captain Smilley,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry you're having problems with your Xbox One. If the fan is making noise I would suggest trying to use a can of air and blowing the dust out of the fan. If that doesn't work then really your only solution is to do a repair request at
<a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://myservice.xbox.com</a>. I personally have 3 consoles, one being a launch console, one other well over a year old which do not have any of these symptoms so I assure you that's it's not every console. Unfortunately
 sometimes parts wear out as with any computer. If the fan is spinning, but making a little noise and you do not want to spend money to get it repaired, then I would suggest just letting it go for right now. It's unfortunate that it's noisy, but really a repair
 is the only option if an internal part like this goes out, and you cannot fix it by conventional methods like blowing the dust out of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype messaging issue</h2>
                    <p>Seeing that skype clearly says that messaging is working fine, i have high doubts that you guys have any intelligent people working there...a simple program such as skype and yet you keep **** it up...tell me, how the **** can i be offline, have my messages
 stuck at ''sending'' yet receive all of the messages people are sending?? That's...the most idiotic thing i've seen since you guys ''''''updated''''' the UI for skype....which actually wasn't long ago....huh, you guys really never cease to amaze me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not exactly a programmer, but i know enough to tell you guys that slamming your head against the keyboard isn't gonna make the best code, just a tip.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I understand your frustration and we apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you, for your information, we had an issue with sending a message but this has been rectified and you should be able to send messages again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, based your description, it appears that you're experiencing the ongoing issue with limited service of signing in to Skype. We've been receiving reports that this issue causes difficulty in signing in, changing status and appearing offline to their

<p>
</p><p>Do not worry, we're actively working to resolve the issue as soon as possible. For the meantime, we recommend to try these workaround options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to Skype using a different account.</li><li>Use Skype for Web.</li></ul>

            <p>If you want to change the target path of File Explorer shortcut in the Taskbar, it can be done but only using a registry edit, which also works for WinKey + E. Let me know if you're interested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, you may create a desktop shortcut to open Documents folder. Open File Explorer, right-click Documents (under This PC), click Send To &gt; Desktop (Create shortcut)<br />

                    <p>This is the image of the problem. &nbsp; Sometimes when I click the Windows key on the Task Bar, the Start Menu has only All Apps and Power. &nbsp;It is missing Downloads, File Folders and Settings. &nbsp; (Note I removed the default icons from the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time it happened was when I turned on my laptop this morning. &nbsp;Last night I had used Shut Down. &nbsp; I did a reboot and was then fine. &nbsp; I just did a re-install of an HP printer and did a reboot, and got the problem again. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>After the last restart, the Start Menu was fine, and I immediately did another restart and it was still fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, the uninstall of the printer software and install like a new printer from the original CD seems to have fixed problem with scan feature.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 when inactive no sound or play back on videos</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
When I leave the PC inactive for too long, I will not be able to play back videos on youtube or even songs on itunes, &nbsp;and occasionly it will play the sources but no sound, the only way I can fix it is to restart each time... Does anyone know of the soulation?
 I upgraded from 7 to 10 thinking it would fix this but the problem is still here..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Lana, <br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
From your problem description I understand that the Canon Printer is not listed in the Windows 8 programs.<br />
<br />
Please don’t worry; I’ll try my best to help you.</p>
<p>A green question mark "?" in Device Manager means that a compatible driver for this device is installed, indicating the possibility that all of the functionality may not be available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Method 1: Use a troubleshooter to fix the issue:</u></strong></p>
<p><br />
a. Type "control Panel" on the start screen,<br />
b. Open "Troubleshooting"<br />
c. Click on “Hardware and Sound”<br />
d. Select Printer,<br />
e. Run the troubleshooter and restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Method 2: Uninstall the printer from Device manager and install in Windows 7 compatibility mode:</u></strong></p>
<p><br />
a) Download the network drivers from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b) Right-click on the driver and click on ‘properties’.<br />
c) Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.<br />
d) Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with additional options available that you can utilize to get this issue resolved.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Explorer search in libraries fails to find results - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Explorer search in libraries fails to find results</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have Windows 7 installed and I can successfully search using the Start Menu search box, but when I use the Windows Explorer search box against any libraries it fails to find any results. &nbsp;If I click on searching the Computer, it searches the same folders
 and returns results, but using the same criteria against any libraries fails. &nbsp;Since my libraries are pretty simple (e.g. the My Documents library) and some are very small (no folders at all) I would have thought it would be able to find something - but nothing
 is returned. &nbsp;This is very annoying to have to search my entire computer just to find the document I'm wanting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have indexing and searching subfolders turned on, and I have tried re-creating my library as suggested (annoying step by the way) and creating smaller libraries (not really ideal), but to no avail. &nbsp;Please advise what my next step should be. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check this article about Explorer the&nbsp;Libraries, note&nbsp;Libraries are virtual folders.<br />
<br />
Features new to Windows 7 - Windows Explorer - Libraries (be sure to read the last paragraph<br />
of the Libraries section)<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_new_to_Windows_7#Windows_Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_new_to_Windows_7#Windows_Explorer</a><br />
<br />
Control Panel - Folder Options - View - set to Show Hidden Files and Folders <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Search issues can be very difficult at times to solve so one method as a quick check is to<br />
make a new ADMIN Account with your same password - REBOOT (do not just logoff) and<br />
Logon to the new Account - try Search. If needed you can migrate to the new Account.<br />
Always keep an unused ADMIN Account to use to test and fix (not used on a daily basis).<br />
<br />
If needed to fix the old profile.</p>

<br />
=================================================<br />
<br />
One thing that seems to be affecting many is the ACHIVE bit has been set on some files that<br />
Index can't set and Search can't find. So the ATTRIB&nbsp;-A *.* /S&nbsp;&nbsp; which means the archive bit<br />
is REMOVED for the Parent (top) folder/directory files and for those in all sub-folders/sub-<br />
directories.<br />

<br />
===============================================<br />
<br />
Another problem seems to be McAfee and some other antivirus programs are interferring with the<br />
Index and/or Search functions. McAfee would have to be uninstalled using the Uninstall routine in<br />
Windows AND the McAfee removal too to be sure no remnants are left. (Possibly other antivirus<br />
programs are also causing this error.) Of course you would want to switch to another antivirus<br />
such as MSE (Microsoft Essentials), Avast or others.<br />

    <title>My 360 Keeps Turning Itself On - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            My 360 Keeps Turning Itself On</h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently using the 250GB Slim console and recently it has been turning itself on. It started two nights ago, I had finished playing and went to bed. While I was laying down I heard my console turn on and the top left green light went on indicating that
 player one was signed in. I checked all my controllers, but none of them were turned on. I turned my console off and went back to bed, but less than five minutes later it happened again. I ended up turning the console off and unplugging it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day I plugged it back in and everything seemed fine, but a few hours later when I returned home I noticed my console had turned itself on again. I then tried plugging it into the wall instead of the surge protector it was plugged into and I removed
 the batteries from my Guitar Hero 3 controller thinking maybe that was the issue, but last night the exact same thing happened again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The weird thing is that it only turns itself on, not off. Over the last two days when I've been using my 360 I've had no issues. It never turns itself off while I'm playing, and the lights on the console never change.
</p>

<p>Do you have other consoles in your household? &nbsp;Possibly someone synced their controller to your console? &nbsp;The other option could be that the power button is extremely sensitive, even to static electricity. &nbsp;Is your console on a rug or other type of fabric?
 &nbsp; Static could cause it to turn on. &nbsp;Lastly it could be sticky buttons on the controller? &nbsp;The guide button could possibly get a little stuck and cause it to turn on?</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. I do have an older 360 in my house and I turned that controller on, but it did not turn on my console. My 360 is currently standing up on my carpet, but I don't think static electricity is causing it turn on because that wouldn't explain
 why the player one light is on the console ring, or why the console hasn't turned itself off yet. When it first happened I checked my controllers and none of them were turned on, so I don't think that's it either.

<p>Hey Stanley,<br />
<br />
Do you have a cat(s)? My cats do this sometimes..<br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, this does sound like a hardware problem. I would suggest you<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/pages/consolemanager.aspx?useraction=requestarepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">request a repair</a>.&nbsp;<br />

<p>It turns out that EyEdEaLz advice was correct. I've been taking the battery packs out my controllers the last two days when my console is off and it hasn't turned itself back on since. Thanks to both of you for replying.</p>

<p>One additional piece of advice: It really isn't a good idea to keep your 360 (or any other electronic device) directly on a rug. &nbsp;Static electricity can really wreak havoc on electronics.</p>

a.Power the phone off<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b.Connect the cable from PC and phone<br />
