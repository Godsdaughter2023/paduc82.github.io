<h2>            How do I change my default install drive &#40;I spilt it&#41;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">A while back I had to completely reinstall windows on my computer because it got a deadly virus. Ever since, I've split the hard drive. (C: Drive
 and E: Drive) C: Drive is where my system is kept, and I don't want it to get corrupted, so I try to download everything onto the E: Drive. Lately I let my brother use my computer,&nbsp;ever since it automatically downloads everything I download onto the C: Drive,
 which is an issue not only because of corruption, but also because the C: Drive has only very limited storage (only just more the what is needed for windows). I need help to switch this default to the E: Drive. Thanks!</span>

                    Run Windows XP SP3 on our PC with Windows Firewall and MSE. Last night MSE detacted the above problem and destroyed it. Afterwards run a full scan which showed 3 more different threats&nbsp;which were removed. Since this morning every time the PC is turned
 on the Trojan&nbsp;warning cames up and is being dealt with. I have run another full scan which showed nothing else. When I am on the internet I cannot access certain websites = one of them is the Microsoft one (using a laptop now). I downloaded Malwarebytes but

    <title>LOCKED - Ranked multiplayer 1v1 huge mess - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LOCKED - Ranked multiplayer 1v1 huge mess</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, first of all, so far I like the game, aside from not being able to determine my land ratio in the deck editor (what gives!). Then I decided to try do some multiplayer; first did a game or 10 in unranked (by accident only found out i was playing unranked
 because my ranking didnt register. So i finally found how to get a ranked 1v1 game (why hide the 1v1 functionality like? and why give people the option to change a 1v1 ranked game into a 2x2 wierd stuff). Only to find out that they still show which deck players
 are going to use causing the very annoying switheroo and last second switching (with changing your ready status).
</p>
<p>Ok finally action time... <br />
win 1... errrr... opponent disconnected.... ok happens i guess so lets try again....
<br />
win 2.... opponent disconnected.... wth, not a single disconnect in all the unranked games mind you.... try again...
<br />
win 3.... opponent disconnected... WHAT!!!<br />
loss 1.... all is fine. right.<br />
and so on... in the end i managed to play a finish couple of games that i'd won, not a single discconnect on losses.</p>
<p>OK so I spend about 8 hours straight playing (oops) and went to check on my ranking. WHAT!!!! Lame-@@@ trueskill system, not even won/losss/discon ratio? deck ratios? Stats in general? Good grief why not simply use the ELO system which is a very good system
 for ranking games like this.</p>
<p>So after a night of playng ranked 1v1 here's the bullet list:<br />
1. Disconnect galore by people trying to avoid the loss.<br />
2. Decks still show.<br />
3. No 1v1 menu option.<br />
4. No best out of 3 or best ouf 5 options (and rankings).<br />
5. After each game finishes you get thrown back to the main menu on the Campaign option.<br />
6. Trueskill based 1v1 ranking is not fun at all, ELO system much better (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system</a>), trueskill is the free hand me down from MS for devs to make it easy to inlcude
 a ranking system imho. For example ranking 1. playername - 2800 elo - 50 wins - 14 losses - 3 dissconnects. Right now there is nothing to fight for as trueskill is a vague system based around averages, nice to compare skill levels terrible to rank on.<br />
7. No stats of your and your opponents multiplayer performance.<br />
8. Due to missing true 1v1 menu option quickmatch wihile searching for 1v1 will land you in 2v2 games, plus players can adjust a 1v1 into a 2v2.<br />
9. AI doesnt take over as advertised (optional in unranked).</p>
<p>Ok let&nbsp;me have it, are others feeling the same about the RANKED 1v1 system or am I just a total fruitbasket?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
David<br />
Ps. single player gameplay is very good, also all cards seem to work as intended as far as I have seen, ability where you have to sacrifice x permanents to block a creature is the worst idea in magic ever; you allready sacrifice creatures by making them block
 that ability is beyond the whole base concept of magic..</p>

<p>Multiplayer is working fine for me. The only annoying thing is that about half of my games are against Strength of Stone (ironically, the deck I use :P) and the other half are mixed between Vampires and the UG one (which I hate more than anything... If it
 gets to 8 mana with the Tidewalker, it wins).</p>

<p>Showing decks is HUGE minus IMHO. That needs to be fixed ASAP, don't know why on earth they brought it back in Duels 2012.</p>

<p>Another thing, IDK if this has happened to anyone else:</p>
<p>I was playing a game yesterday, and it skipped my precombat main phase two turns in a row, then next game skipped it a couple times sporadically. &nbsp;Then it was okay for a few games, then it would start skipping phases again. &nbsp;At first I thought it was some

<p>[/quote]It skips your main phase if you don't have any playable cards in your hand. Yes it's annoying especially if you want to use an ability before combat. You kinda have to think ahead of time and press X to stop the timer to do your stuff.</p>

<p>Hmmm, my point is, is that Ranked multiplayer is all about bragging rights and competition. Current model will see the community die off quickly. Ie people will play the single player portion and then toss the game aside. If there is nothing to fight for
 (trueskill) why bother playing ranked. I may as well go play a couple of unranked games.</p>

<p>[quote user="DrAtomic1"]</p>
<p>Ok, first of all, so far I like the game, aside from not being able to determine my land ratio in the deck editor (what gives!). Then I decided to try do some multiplayer; first did a game or 10 in unranked (by accident only found out i was playing unranked
 because my ranking didnt register. So i finally found how to get a ranked 1v1 game (why hide the 1v1 functionality like? and why give people the option to change a 1v1 ranked game into a 2x2 wierd stuff). Only to find out that they still show which deck players
 are going to use causing the very annoying switheroo and last second switching (with changing your ready status).
</p>
<p>Ok finally action time... <br />
win 1... errrr... opponent disconnected.... ok happens i guess so lets try again....
<br />
win 2.... opponent disconnected.... wth, not a single disconnect in all the unranked games mind you.... try again...
<br />
win 3.... opponent disconnected... WHAT!!!<br />
loss 1.... all is fine. right.<br />
and so on... in the end i managed to play a finish couple of games that i'd won, not a single discconnect on losses.</p>
<p>OK so I spend about 8 hours straight playing (oops) and went to check on my ranking. WHAT!!!! Lame-@@@ trueskill system, not even won/losss/discon ratio? deck ratios? Stats in general? Good grief why not simply use the ELO system which is a very good system
 for ranking games like this.</p>
<p>So after a night of playng ranked 1v1 here's the bullet list:<br />
1. Disconnect galore by people trying to avoid the loss.<br />
2. Decks still show.<br />
3. No 1v1 menu option.<br />
4. No best out of 3 or best ouf 5 options (and rankings).<br />
5. After each game finishes you get thrown back to the main menu on the Campaign option.<br />
6. Trueskill based 1v1 ranking is not fun at all, ELO system much better (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system</a>), trueskill is the free hand me down from MS for devs to make it easy to inlcude
 a ranking system imho. For example ranking 1. playername - 2800 elo - 50 wins - 14 losses - 3 dissconnects. Right now there is nothing to fight for as trueskill is a vague system based around averages, nice to compare skill levels terrible to rank on.<br />
7. No stats of your and your opponents multiplayer performance.<br />
8. Due to missing true 1v1 menu option quickmatch wihile searching for 1v1 will land you in 2v2 games, plus players can adjust a 1v1 into a 2v2.<br />
9. AI doesnt take over as advertised (optional in unranked).</p>
<p>Ok let&nbsp;me have it, are others feeling the same about the RANKED 1v1 system or am I just a total fruitbasket?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
David<br />
Ps. single player gameplay is very good, also all cards seem to work as intended as far as I have seen, ability where you have to sacrifice x permanents to block a creature is the worst idea in magic ever; you allready sacrifice creatures by making them block
 that ability is beyond the whole base concept of magic..</p>
<p>[/quote] I agree with almost everything you said. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-21.gif" />&nbsp;One thing you're wrong about though... if you sign out or dash board you still get a loss. I lost my connection earlier and I ranked down.
 Some of us in party chat were talking about this earlier. It's just like Black Ops. No way out of a loss if you deserve it. Like it should be.</p>

<h2>            Post Win 10 Oct&#47;17 Upgrade issues</h2>
                    <p>Could someone help with the following problems? -</p>
<p>Since the last big update restart does not work properly on my HP Envy laptop (16g RAM, i7, 1 tb HD, just 5 years old).&nbsp; I use a usb mouse.&nbsp; On restart the mouse does not work and the login box does not appear.&nbsp; I found a workaround.&nbsp; If I press the left
 cursor key and then the esc key the mouse pointer appears and then the login box.&nbsp; Can this be fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously, before I found this out if I forced a shut down and then restarted I got the start screen of my desktop computer which wasn't even turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next problem - two control panel apps appear to be corrupted.&nbsp; Symptoms - Control Panel launches and then dies.&nbsp; I ran a scannow which found nothing.&nbsp; Trying to launch the individual .cpl apps I found that TabletPC.cpl generated the following message - Tablet
 and Pen settings is unavailable.&nbsp; For assistance contact the manufacturer of your tablet computer (error=15299).&nbsp; Next, idtnc64.cpl doesn't launch and generates no message.&nbsp; After that I used DISM.&nbsp; The control Panel now appears, starts to load the apps and
 then crashes my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find clean copies of these two control panel apps.&nbsp; My Windows operating system was part of the general upgrade done by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>We did some more digging this morning and found a fix.&nbsp; Apparently when I had the original update from Windows 8.1</p>
<p>to Window 10 it caused a problem with the Beats control panel which disappeared altogether.&nbsp; Over time the sound quality on my laptop has deteriorated and then just lately the control panel would only remain on the screen for seconds before closing.&nbsp; FIX
 - reloaded the old IDT Audio driver from the HP site where the problem is posted as an issue and Ta-Da - the Beats control panel is back - the Windows Control Panel is working and the sound is lovely!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you.</p>

<p><span>Hi rcoose,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you re-install Windows Vista on a new partition?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 you say “downloaded Windows 7”, do you mean to say that installed Windows 7 using Windows 7 DVD or you downloaded Windows 7 from online stores and then installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Deleting the partition that contains the original operating system on a multiboot system could render your system inoperable. That partition contains
 system files that your computer's basic input/output system (BIOS) relies on to start your computer, regardless of which operating system you want to use.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Warning:<br />
</span></em></strong><em><span>Formatting a volume will destroy any data on the partition. Be sure to make backups of any data you want to save before you begin.<br />
You cannot format a disk or partition that is currently in use, including the partition that contains Windows.<br />
Quick format is a formatting option that creates a new file table but does not fully overwrite or erase the volume. A quick format is much faster than a normal format, which fully erases any existing data on the volume.</span></em></p>
<p><span>If you want to permanently remove Windows&nbsp;Vista from your computer, consider performing a<em>clean</em> installation of Windows&nbsp;7. Restart your computer
 using the Windows&nbsp;7 installation disc (this is commonly known as<em>booting from</em> the installation disc). During the Setup process, you can repartition and reformat your hard disk and then reinstall Windows. The process will erase your files and programs,
 so be sure to make backups of your data and have your program installation discs or files saved before you begin.

 before you begin reinstalling Windows 7 if possible, even if you're reinstalling Windows 7 on a hard disk partition, and you have personal files on a separate partition. For example, if you have encrypted files, you might not be able to access them after reinstalling
 Windows. A custom installation replaces the current version of Windows 7 and all personal files.</span></em></p>

            I too have all the latest software and skype hasn't worked for the last 12 months or so. I have survived by using older versions of Skype. But now they don't seem to work either!

<h2>            Xbox One dashboard tiles&#47;adverts not showing</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever my xbox loads up the dashboard tiles for the likes of the games,app store etc doesn't load and just has one big blank box in each window, everything is working fine apart from this, it just makes the dashboard look abit ***, any ideas what could
 be wrong? Ive just switched from PS4 to Xbox and tbh I am having nothing but issues with the XBONE.</p>

<p>been having the same with mine, some people have suggested it may be to do with home hub and bt.</p>
<p>open the browser on the xbox to see if you can do the first time setup for it.</p>
<p>other than that to make it load go to settings&gt;network settings&gt;advanced&gt;alternate MAC and then clear</p>
<p>this will fix it until an unknown amount of time (for me until i reset the xbox again)</p>

<p>I was given an Xbox Elite over the Xmas period and have the same problem with blank tiles and reading the above comment I am using the BT Home Hub so I'll give it a try and see if it resolves the issue as the screen looks naff with just blank tiles for everything,
 apps, films and games and alike.</p>
<p>Overall I'm impressed with the new console as have a 360 set up in another room, just need to figure out linking with the computer.</p>

    <title>Yellow tint on Surface Book Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffs1977  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yellow tint on Surface Book Screen</h2>
                    I have a really noticeable yellow tint stain on all sides of my Surface Book. I spent well over 3 grand roughly a year or two ago on this "State of the Art" machine and now this? I need this fixed - how do I get this resolved? If its past the time limits
 you still need to fix this issue, I have seen too many posts on this now and it seems like faulty equipment - not something we should have to have already on this machine we invested so much into!!&nbsp;

<p>I know this sounds silly. Have you turned on "Night Light" by mistake?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are running Windows 10, select the notifications icon bottom right of your screen. Then "Expand" if not already expanded, and make sure Night Light is not turned on.</p>

<p>Update on what happened -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took my Surface Book 1 into my local Microsoft store - they could not have been nicer. I showed them my unit and they replaced my Surface Book 1 with the new Surface Book 2 model with better specs. They told me they would take my old machine to use it
 to analyze the issue more - ( my screen was bowing out and it had dark yellowing stains). They believe it had to do with the battery behind the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>End result was they told me this is their "Flagship" product and they wanted me to have a machine I could use with no issues. I would recommend setting an appointment at their store and they should also take care of you. Microsoft did me great and I am a
 customer for life.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I took my Surface Book 1 into my local store, showed them the issue and they upgraded me to the newest model with even better specs then my Surface Book 1. They honored it, understood the problem and came to a wonderful resolution with no hassle or issues.
 I would highly recommend scheduling an appointment with them and discussing any issues you have with them and see if they will also honor the sale. This is their flagship product and I feel they want to make it right and will do so by replacing it. I went
 in thinking I would have to buy a new screen or send it off somewhere to get fixed - blown away when they replaced it for even better (outside all warranties) and helped me set everything back up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft did me well and I hope they do to you as well. It gives me peace of mind they were more concerned with my satisfaction then asking me to shell out more money. Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Took your advise - took it into a local store here in Dallas and they could not have been greater. Flagship customer service and care. They quickly diagnosed the problem and replaced my Surface Book. As I stated below - the service and care exceeded my expectations.
 Its refreshing to see a massive company step up and do the right thing by the customer. Well done Microsoft, well done!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a six-hour ordeal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An hour and fifteen minutes drive to the nearest Microsoft store, three and a half hours working with the in-store technician to try diagnosing and&nbsp; resolving the yellow tint issue, and then an hour and fifteen drive home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The in store technician at rhe Florida Mall was phenomenal. He was kind, patient, and truly invested in resolving the issue to my satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried everything from updating the operating system to updating drivers. He tried to get in contact with regional and corporate technicians for assistance without success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally we replaced my 1 terabyte 15in with a 512 gig 15in since that's the only one they had in store. The yellowing wasn't as bad as my original unit but it was definitely noticeable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curiously their display model which they called a pre-production unit was perfect. But every unit they took out of a box ( we tried a few) had the exact same yellowing /browning issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This saddens me because after much research the Surface Book 2 15-in is unparalleled; there's nothing else like it which is why I was paid the premium price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I believe for the money, this very obvious screen defect should be a non-issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I returned it ... much to my disappointment as this was my Birthday present to myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only Silver Lining is that I had not packed off my Surface Pro 4 to a nephew so I atleast have a computer.</span></p>

            I had the exact opposite experience.&nbsp; The screen of my Surface Book is yellowing on both sides, so I took it into the Microsoft Store in Los Angeles (in the Century City mall).&nbsp; They told me that I'd need to pay $600 to replace the screen.&nbsp; It's truly
 unbelievable to think that I spent $3000 on a computer that needs the screen replaced after a little over a year due to a known defect.&nbsp; Shame on Microsoft for this.&nbsp; I'll highly recommend to everyone I know to stay away from the Surface in the future.

    <title>SLOW system with 3GB RAM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mborger  say:</h3>
<h2>            SLOW system with 3GB RAM</h2>
                    Hello. I have an Acer Aspire running Vista SP1. I can type faster than my computer can usually catch up, which results in it missing characters. So annoying! So I swapped out one of the 1GB memory chips for a 2GB chip, so it now has 3GB RAM total. However,
 it is STILL crazy slow. I have to slow down now just typing this or I'll have to go back and edit every other word. I do not run a ton of programs. Right now I just have Firefox (~200MB) and Word. When I look at the Performance tab of Task Manager, I get the
 following:<br />
Physical Memory (MB)<br />
Total 2814<br />
Cached 1900<br />
Free ~15.<br />
<br />
The CPU Usage History graphs are normal -- both hover relatively low, so the problem seems to be memory. Too much cached and not enough free? I don't know how the two are related or how each affects performance, but almost 0 free memory just obviously seems
 wrong and adding an entire GB of memory hasn't changed -- this was the same as before.<br />
<br />
What can I do? Thanks for your assistance.

    <title>Windows Error warning message on My Quickbooks program - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kg5000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Error warning message on My Quickbooks program</h2>
                    <p>When I click on My Quickbooks program for my business an error message comes up: "Warning- ! The file you specified cannot be opened. Make sure that it is not currently being used by another program or a read-only file.&nbsp; The Windows Error was 'The file exists'
 "Then an "ok" box. The box bings when you go to close it and stays open and will not allow you to close the Quickbooks 2011 program even from the corner "X" tab. Has never happened before in 13 yrs of using the program. I restored the computer to a few days
 back and no luck then restored with w back up from 2 weeks previous when the program was fine and it restored but error warning came up&nbsp; again.
</p>
<p>Any help?</p>

<p>I need some help with Windows Live Movie Maker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there is a function to get your videos to show in 16:9 (Widescreen HD), but I have a video that is not 16:9, and shows black bars down the side. Is it possible to render it in full widescreen using WLMM?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, Jamie.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Windows 7&#93; Parental Controls won&#39;t work. How to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    
[Windows 7] Parental Controls won't work. How to fix it?
<div>Ok let's set an example.<br />
<br />
I can't play a game named Plants VS Zombies due to an error I recieved.<br />
<br />
It said:<br />
- LOCKED. This program does not have access to run on this computer. Please ask the administrator to set the parental controls before playing.<br />
<br />
But, I tried alots of stuffs already but still... Parental Controls won't run. It's like.. nothing is responding.<br />
<br />
Things that I did:<br />
1) I tried clicking Parental Controls @ Control Panel (Classic View or Category View)... it won't work.<br />
└► NOTE: It is already starting as Administrator.<br />
<br />
2) I tried running Plants VS Zombies @ Run as Administrator... still won't work.<br />
<br />
3) I tried making a new account @ User Accounts... but it still won't work.<br />
<br />
4) I tried opening "cmd" (Command Prompt) as administrator and opening my Administrator account by typing this command... (net user administrator /active:yes). But it still won't friggin work.<br />
<br />
So... any solutions about fixing this Parental Control problem?<br />
~ Thanks in advance.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
DLCXtime.dll is part of your Dell Printer drivers. You probably need to reinstall them. Also contact Dell Support
<br />
and their forums for any known issues.<br />
