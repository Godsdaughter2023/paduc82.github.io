    <title>Windows 10 and a Glitching Wifi - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 and a Glitching Wifi</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so for as long as I've had this problem none of what is out there seemed to help. Back in August I downloaded Windows 10, wifi didn't work, looked up and saw it glitched with wifi because of driver incapability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I rolled back to 8.1. Recently I went back to Windows 10, and had a heck of a time getting it all to work. At first my new Windows 10 wifi worked fine. But then my computer had to restart for some updates and then it all went downhill. Wifi would not
 work. It kept clicking on and off and I had to run the trouble shooter over and over like every 30 minutes and it would claim I had missing protocols or my wireless driver stopped working. Ended up having to refresh once and then reinstalled Windows. I reinstalled
 all my drivers and rolled back my wireless one to a previous one along with all the other usual options in similar threads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was fine until the updates again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and after uninstalling the ones for that day EVERYTHING WORKED FINE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my NEW problem. Windows continues to update this same one and I'm tired of having to remove it every day. It's called Windows Security Update KB3116900 (along with a KB3119147); the one I think is the culprit for messing up my wifi is the first.
 What is it and how can I stop it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is an HP Pavilion laptop if that helps any. It's about a year or so old? At least since I bought it.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily
 cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I had already tried the first few things in the thread you sent me to. I downloaded that "hide updates" thing and waited a day or two after giving it a run the first time, and did it again today and it still did not 'see' the update I'm having trouble
 with so in short that did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my computer is now shutting completely off when I close the lid. I looked in my settings and the boxes are all checked where they need to be for it to just 'sleep' like it used to but it still just shuts off. Even when I leave the lid open for a while
 it wont just go to sleep it will be completely off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with both of these problems would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I have completed this step as well as over a dozen other options. I have tried to do the "disabling hardware acceleration" many times. The option is not there. Every post regarding help says the same thing about restarting my PC. It doesn't matter how
 many times I restart it. As sure as I know my computer will turn back on, I know the problem will still be there. It only occurs in Edge. I like the browser, but it may be time to return to chrome due to videos not playing at all from the sites I use. It works
 for youtube dailymotion etc. Not the ones that use MP4 Players and other types. Green screen just like most of the sites I use. If you could simply tell me how to get the actual option of hardware acceleration to display when I click settings, like in every
 screenshot I've seen on how to fix the problem, then maybe I could attempt that fix. The tab for display under adobe settings is not even listed. Only privacy, microphone, storage, and camera. I would like to enjoy simple videos within ed

            <p>This is outrageous. Many videos on the internet don't play in the new Edge or IE browsers in Windows 10. This is not something I should have to run some utility to fix, when Chrome and Firefox have this figured out... heck IE had it figured out before Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a browser that is advertised as making the web "just work", it just doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome, and Firefox have no problems with the same websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a common example, try playing the repair video here:</p>
<span>
<p>http://www.appliancepartspros.com/ge-evaporator-fan-motor-wr60x10185-ap3875639.html</p>
<p>It starts loading then goes black... works fine in Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not some isolated incident, it occurs with all kinds of video content.</p>

<p><span>Hello, Scouteron</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>Does your time zone reset, or does it keep its setting?</span></p>
<p><span>Does this happen when you disable time synchronizing?</span></p>
<p><span>You can disable time synchronization by clicking the clock in your task bar and clicking Change Date and Time Settings. On the Date and Time screen go to the
 Internet Time tab, click Change Settings, and uncheck the Synchronize with an Internet time server checkbox. OK out of the windows and try rebooting your machine to test.</span></p>
<p><span>It is also possible that your CMOS battery is low on power.</span></p>
<p><span>We look forward to hearing back from you.</span></p>

    <title>Media Center Extender Error&#58; A critical Windows Media Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heaths  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Center Extender Error&#58; A critical Windows Media Center process has failed.</h2>
                    <p><span>When trying to access TV recording or live TV on my Media Center Extenders, I am encountering the following error:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Application Failure</span></p>
<p><span>A critical Windows Media Center process has failed. Restart the computer and try again. If the problem persists, contact your hardware manufacturer for assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate (32 bit) with service pack 1 (upgraded from Vista Ultimate).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have three Media Center Extenders (Linksys) connected to my network, and the all have the same problem. They start up, and can browse the menu, but I get the error when trying to access the
 TV or recorded TV programs. <span>&nbsp;</span>The MCE will scan my computer for media files (MP3s, etc) but when I try to play them I get an error saying the audio file cannot be played.
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Center on the computer itself seems to work fine. I can record, watch live TV, and watch previously recorded programs.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This problem seems to have started after my wife somehow downloaded some malware. The malware was the “Windows 7 Security 2012”. I followed the removal instructions at mybleepingcomputer.com,
 which included a registry fix, and running Malwarebytes Anti-malware. Instructions located here: http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-win-7-security-2012<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The removal worked, but the malware must have corrupted all System Restore files, as I could not restore to any previous date, even in safe mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have been searching for this MCE error, have not found any fix that has worked. I have tried turning off and on Media Center using “Turn Windows features on or off” in the Control panel. I then
 disconnected the extender and went through setup again. I also tried running the System File Checker (sfc /scannow). No problems were detected. I thought maybe reinstalling Windows 7 may fix the problem, but it tells me I cannot do it as I have a newer version
 of the operating system already installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If anybody has some idea of what is causing this problem, or better yet some suggestions to fix it, I would appreciate your responses and suggestions. Thank you!</span></p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>I purchased Skate 3 last year and I am unable to download it. The error I receive is&nbsp;<span>800700E8. I have deleted all files for Skate 3 from my hard drive, cleared cache, signed out of my account, yet I still receive the error and can't download Skate

<p>I see. For this one, since the game is no longer available, there's a possibility that the game publisher has already pulled-up this game before. Thus, I highly recommend that you contact the game publisher of Skate 3 and see if they have a back-up work
 around for their game since you've paid for this. Here's their contact detail: <a href="https://www.easports.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>You actually have a point there. However, the information that I have provided you is based only upon the way I experienced your same case. I have contacted the Xbox Accounts &amp; Billing before but was informed to contact the game publisher.</p>

<h2>            Sexual harassment of a 13 year old girl, and myself.</h2>
                    
<p>I'd like an explanation as to why there is no complaint choice for sexual harassment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing she is 13 years old, &nbsp;Member's of xbox live continue to barade my daughter's &nbsp;inbox with some disgusting idea's.</p>
<p>She's learning most of her damn sexual education from these creeps.</p>
<p>I'm DISGUSTED with how there is nothing I can do about this.</p>

<p>I would recommend the family gold four pack, &nbsp;For the price of two gold accounts, you can have four and you can set up wonderful parental controls that are not normally available. &nbsp;You can make it so that she can not sent, receive or hear messages from people
 who are not on her friends list. &nbsp;You can make it so that you approve the friends. &nbsp;Typically what I do is allow my son to play with others a few times with the sound coming through the tv so I know what is happening and what sort of conversations are going
 on before allowing him to add a friend. &nbsp;I also noticed that you said they knew she was a 13 year old girl . . . maybe remind her NOT to tell people her age, sex, location and make sure that her profile is not broadcasting that information either. &nbsp;The other
 way to control it is to monitor what kind of games she plays. &nbsp;She is obviosly going to meet different people playing black ops than she would playing minecraft. &nbsp; Good luck.

<p>My guess to the reason there is not one specifically for sexual harassment is because if they started getting that specific on what was happening the list would be way to big and I'm guessing they want to try and keep it more broad. No matter what if you
 file a complaint on someone it will be reviewed within 24 hours. Think of you filing a complaint on the the person for the message they sent you as like you filing a complaint on them for sexual harassment. It doesn't say that they are sexually harassing you
 and your daughter but when an enforcement agent reviews it they will be able to see that is why you filed the complaint and will deal with the person appropriately. Also, you can limit what can happen on any account including who she can communicate with right
 here on Xbox.com. Just sign into here account and click on my profile located at the top of the page. Under the settings and preferences section it should say Privacy and Online Settings. Go into that and you can change it to custom or one of the presets that
 is already there and control what can happen on the account.</p>

<p>Set your daughter's privacy to "only hear and receive messages from friends". &nbsp;This way, she can't hear stranger's online and can't get inappropriate messages. &nbsp;You can also set it to where you have to approve of friends by putting in your password. &nbsp;I won't
 type out what was said, but my son had some very inappropriate things said to him on LIVE when he was younger. &nbsp;Luckily, I was closely monitoring his activity and all. &nbsp;It was beyond disgusting, and MS did nothing. &nbsp;It is up to you. &nbsp;In all fairness, they
 do give you the tools to correct this situation, but you have to take action and not rely on others. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>

    <title>Win XP - How do I configure desktop icons to be large AND - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ron zemke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win XP - How do I configure desktop icons to be large AND high-resolution&#63;</h2>
                    I finally figured out how to properly enlarge desktop icons on Windows XP.&nbsp;
<div>(Desktop Properties&gt;Appearance Tab&gt;Advanced Options&gt;Icon&gt;enter higher value).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd really like them to be size 60 or greater. However, at this size, all my icons look blurry.&nbsp;</div>
<div>This screenshot is of my desktop icons at size 60.</div>
<div>http://i50.tinypic.com/2we9smp.jpg</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Size 70 would be even nicer, but of course that makes them look even worse. Could this blurriness have something to do with the fact that I make custom icons? With the program I use (iConvertIcons.com), when I convert my PNG icons to ICO format, they automatically
 become 16x16 in size... Maybe this small size is the reason they look blurry when enlarged? Is there a way to make my ICO files larger than 16x16 perhaps?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway, any kind of solution would be appreciated. Thanks.</div>

    <title>Bottom right Show Desktop button is hard to click - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ndmvhc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bottom right Show Desktop button is hard to click</h2>
                    I have my taskbar on the bottom (default I think). If I move my mouse pointer to the absolute bottom-right of the screen, the Show Desktop button is not clickable. If I move my mouse pointer up literally one pixel, the button becomes clickable. This does
 not happen with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
It's incredibly frustrating. Has anyone else noticed this or better yet, found a way to fix it?

The action of the button works just fine (showing the desktop). The clickable area of the bottom of the button itself needs to be extended a few pixels more.<br />

            The answer on this page explains (better than I could) why this issue is annoying to me:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/new-show-desktop-function-in-windows-7-is/c297c3d6-8f53-4e38-9f7e-74ad67e33685<br />
<br />
"Here's the reason it was moved:&nbsp; Fritt's law (google it).&nbsp; It's very easy to 'slam' your mouse to the bottom-right of the screen without even trying:&nbsp; it's impossible to miss the mark.&nbsp; This is also why the Start button is at the bottom-left:&nbsp; you can just
 slam your mouse that direction and click:&nbsp; you don't have to aim or even try to think about it: it just works.<br />
<br />
If they didn't put the Show Desktop button in the right side, it's very hard to click:&nbsp; You have to aim and carefully try to get the pointer at the exact right spot for the tiny little icon (this is how it was in Windows 98, 2000, XP)."<br />

Thanks. I don't know what it could be. I've tried altering all the settings I could find. I've tried updating mouse, monitor, graphics drivers. I'm stumped.<br />
<br />
The thing that is strange is, if I move my mouse to the extreme bottom-left, the Start button comes up (as expected). Moving the mouse pointer to the extreme bottom-right is the only problem.<br />

Yep strange. Moving the mouse pointer to the absolute bottom right of the Desktop makes it unable to click anything.<br />
<br />
Another note:<br />
<br />
If I move my mouse pointer to the extreme bottom right of the Start screen, I am able to click the minus (-) button just fine.<br />

    <title>ySurface cover for Surface Pro 3 does not work anymore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ySurface cover for Surface Pro 3 does not work anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>After turning on our Surface Pro 3, we found that our SP3 no longer recognizes the Surface Cover.&nbsp; When you type in the Device Manager, and click on Keyboards, it only shows 'HID Keyboard Device'.&nbsp; It will not load (or allow us to load via drivers, anything).
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>That particular cover works fine on my Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; So I tried to attach mine to the SP3 and it does not work or will not load. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, the Surface Covers have proven to be fine and work on the SP4, but neither works or will let us load the info required to run them on the SP3. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - a regular standard keyboard plugged in to the USB port lets us use the standard keyboard but only to type.&nbsp; Luckily, the SP3 has touchscreen capabilities, so we between the standard keyboard and touching, we're at least able to use the unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does anyone have any other idea.&nbsp; I have spent 3.5 days now trying to fix it, to no avail.&nbsp; Called in my "expert" friends, nope.&nbsp; Nada.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John R-A</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Oh! Sorry to hear about that, It's none of our intention for this to happen and definitely this is not the experience we want for you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>• So, what we will going to do right now is that, please run&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a>, this will fix the hidden issue of your device.<br />
• After, we need to do the Windows update, Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Updates &gt; Check for updates.<br />
• Restart after the doing the Windows update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted the outcome.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<div>- typically, even a wipe and reset won't fix these. Something seems to happen</div>
<div>during the upgrade process (for any random update) that causes this condition.</div>

<p>Consider the following general guidance for dealing with bluescreens:</p>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings-&gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way out
 of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload the dump to your SkyDrive, and provide a link.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86. Note that memory that passes tests is not necessarily good memory - it just hasn't failed a test. &nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of
 modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date, as well as ensuring that you're using the latest BIOS.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 clock not keeping time</h2>
                    <p>Good morning -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently did a complete OEM replacement to Win7 Pro. Upon update, I realize the clock was not keeping time. It was only gaining time when I was moving the mouse. Here is what I have tried:</p>
<p>Replace CMOS battery (though I am going to bring a tester to see if the battery is bad)</p>
<p>Chipset Update</p>
<p>Syncing to Internet clock (including checking time zone, etc, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm completely at a loss. Anyone have any other suggestions? &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Julia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the clock is not updating the time when the computer remain idle for some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 </strong></p>
<p>If Internet time is set and you are connected to the Internet, the computer connects to an Internet time server and synchronizes the time to the time on the server. Internet time can provide an accurate method of keeping time and is normally recommended.
 However, in some cases, Internet time might actually cause problems. Use the following steps to disable or enable the Internet time setting depending on what is currently selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click Start, Control Panel, Clock, Language, and Region, and then click Date and Time.</p>
<p>2. Click the Date and Time tab.</p>
<p>3. Click Change time zone. Make sure the correct time zone is selected. Place a checkmark next to Automatically adjust clock for Daylight Saving Time if it is not already selected, and then click OK.</p>
<p>4. Click the Internet Time tab, and then click Change settings.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an Administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>5. Make sure that Synchronize with an Internet time server is checked.</p>
<p>6. Make sure the computer is connected to the Internet and click the Update Now button.</p>
<p>The computer connects to an Internet server and updates the time on the computer.
</p>
<p>7. Click OK and try using the computer for a few days. If time continues to be lost and causes problems, continue using the rest of the steps in this document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: If the computer fails to receive an update from the selected Internet time server, a message opens stating that an error has occurred. Select a different server and try again. If the computer fails to receive an update, click OK and continue with rest
 of the steps in this document.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2.</strong> If the above steps does not resolve the issue try to update the bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer has a BIOS update available, the update might fix time-related problems.
</p>
<p>How to update the bios?</p>

<p>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 </strong></p>
<p>If the above step fails restart Windows time services and check if the issue persists, follow these steps:</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Click Start, type “services.msc” (without quotes) and press Enter.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Locate and right-click "Windows Time" service.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;Right-click on Windows Time service, and then click Stop.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;Right-click on Windows Time service, and then click Start. And set it to Automatic and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4</strong></p>
<p>Check and make sure that the date and time are correctly set in BIOS (Basic Input Output System).</p>
<p>If he not comfortable with changing the date and time in bios, you can contact the computer manufacturer for changing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
 configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>

    <title>Cortana&#63; Useless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beevreeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana&#63; Useless</h2>
                    <p>I was excited at the prospect of Cortana, which promised a new way to interact with my PC. Unfortunately it seems less than useless. Firstly, Windows Speech Recognition simply WILL NOT use the microphone built into my Logitech webcam, although it is working
 perfectly in other applications like Skype and is the only recording device. Speech recognition simply doesn't see it at all. I have tried everything, for hours. Ditch voice recognition. Okay, so let's try typing: I have Office 365 on my system and use Exchange
 for mail and calendar. But when I TYPE to Cortana "What's on my schedule?" I get told "No appointments" although I have a full schedule. Seriously? It's not intelligent enough to detect and use my Outlook calendar? So what's the point? Then I tell it to "Send
 mail to Bill" and I get "I can help you send e-mail, you must first set up an account" !!! I try to add my e-mail address and it tells me 'There is already an account like that' "SERIOUSLY???" So why can't you use it, Cortana??? &nbsp;I tell it (as suggested) to
 'Play me a song' - I have a huge media library. It opens the Groove Music application with a message "We didn't find anything on the other end of that link" &nbsp;What a complete waste of time! It's like trying to communicate with a retarded three-year-old.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install Cortana on my Android phone, which is synced to my PC. I asked it the same schedule question. I got a google search of irrelevant flight schedules and what's on at the Vancouver Aquarium!! (I live in South Africa)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is supposed to attract people to the Windows platform it is going to have exactly the opposite effect. It's embarrassing. I'm sure Siri is having a good laugh!</p>

<h2>            Privacy and Location Settings Do not Work in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1 on a Surface Pro.&nbsp; When I go to turn up location settings to allow the Weather app to sense my location the tab is entirely grayed out and will not let me turn on globally (or for any particular app).&nbsp; I am doing
 this as an administrator.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p><br />

<p>This should enable you to change the Location&nbsp;options under Charms&gt;Settings&gt;Change&nbsp;PC Settings&gt;Privacy&gt;Location which are set on a per user basis.</p>

<p><strong>Method 2: Temporarily disable all the security software and then check if this fixes the issue.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disable antivirus software or any security software installed on your computer temporarily.
<br />
You can follow the steps given below to turn off Firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
<br />
Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps given in the link below to start the computer in clean boot.</p>

</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Important</strong>: Please follow the Step 3 after you are done with all the steps to Reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this resolves your issue, please write to us if you have any other issue related to Windows.

<p>1) Have you logged in to your computer as n administrator user? Not usually,did as suggested,but changed nothing(same problem)<br />
2) Do you have any third party antivirus or security software installed on your computer?yes,Avast,Spyware Blaster<br />
3) What is the exact complete error message? Exactly as I submitted in my original thread.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Stop and start Volume Shadow Copy service.</strong></p>
<p>I tried this,and it made no difference</p>
<p>Method 2 Temporar1ly diseabl.....</p>
<p>Instructions to turn off Firewall were not included,and I don't know how to do this!</p>
<p>Method 3</p>
<p>A clean boot did not solve the problem</p>
<p>I did'nt try the Link&nbsp; because of risk of virus!Should I try that link anyway without Ativirus protection?</p>

<h3> cliff at glos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Startup Folder</h2>
                    <p>I have a program called Digiguide, and one of the options is to have it start when Windows starts, what it does is puts an entry in the "startup" folder. It doesn't start when Windows starts, and I believe it's because I don't have a startup folder. I have
 tried searching for it in Cortana but to no avail so I suppose I haven't got one. Is there any way I can get this folder back? There used to be one in Windows 8 in the Start menu, can I just add one there?</p>

<p>Hi Cacky Birdlegs - You cannot cancel your monthly membership on the website, to cancel your XBOX Live Membership you have to call XBOX Support for your region and tell them to turn off automatic renewal, that will essentially cancel your XBOX Live Account.</p>

    <title>Office attachments will not open directly off my email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> websterdug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office attachments will not open directly off my email</h2>
                    <p>Hi. When I try and open an attachment in excel or word off my email , it will not open. A message comes up saying that I don't have enough memory or space on my hard drive. I have since freed up space on my hard drive ( 40GB ) and I have 8GB memory of which
 only about 5 GB is used.</p>
<p>If I download and save the attachment, I can then open it, but that is doing it the long way round.</p>
<p>How do I solve this problem?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Louie</p>
<p>I am using Microsoft office Home &amp; Business 2016 . The excel&nbsp; version is 1805 build 9330.2124</p>
<p>I am using windows live Mail 2012. the version is 2012 ( build 16.4.3528.0331)</p>
<p>The two have been working perfectly until my HDD&nbsp; filled up . Now that I have made space , the problem still exists.</p>
<p>This problem exists with any excel or word file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary,</p>
<p>I use Windows Live Mail 2012&nbsp;for my email. ( Outlook would not let me install my isp settings )</p>
<p>I use Office home &amp; business 2016 for my excel, word &amp; power point usage.</p>
<p>They worked perfectly together for months. Then my HDD filled up and files would not open directly from email.</p>
<p>A message would pop up saying that I did not have enough memory or hard drive space.</p>
<p>I have since made plenty space on my HDD , but the problem still exists.</p>
<p>I can open any other files from email such as .pdf or .jpg files, it is only office files that are the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled office 2016 but that has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Doug</p>

<p>May I ask why the question received no attention before you happened to notice that it hadn't, almost a month later? Wouldn't it have been better to attend to it when it was posted, rather than waiting until it had been inactive for so long?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that you are only a moderator (an expert engaged by Microsoft to mark the best answers, manage abuse, and maintain community health) and not a support engineer (an expert engaged by Microsoft to answer questions), so&nbsp;perhaps you were just waiting
 for someone&nbsp;else to answer the question. If this is the case, though, how is it that you turn up a month later and respond substantively to the question?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't really know, because the fault lies outside Windows Live Mail. However, I would make these suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Clear out your folders for both temporary files and Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp;<br />
P<span>ress Windows key + R, type </span><strong>%temp%</strong><span> and press
</span><em>Enter</em><span> to open the temporary files folder;<br />
</span><span>P</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ress Windows key + R, type

</span><em>Enter</em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> to open the
</span><span>Internet Properties dialogue. Click <em>Delete</em>, then select the top two boxes and click
<em>Delete</em>.<br />
(Both of these are also available in the Windows disk clean-up utility. To run that instead,
</span><span>p</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ress Windows key + R, type
</span><strong>cleanmgr</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> and press
</span><em>Enter.)</em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span>&nbsp;<span><br />
