            <p>Hi Chuck,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that your new Lenova laptop is very slow and was told that it could be due to a malware. I have a few questions to understand this issue better;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you running any third party security software?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Windows Firewall</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if Windows firewall is switched ON and if it setup to start automatically. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Check if Windows firewall is turned ON</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer this link to see how to switch ON Windows firewall:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Check if Windows firewall service is running</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the Windows firewall service is running. If it running, make sure it is set to automatic. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +R, type “services.msc” and press enter</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the services window, locate Windows Firewall</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right click and select properties, set the startup type to automatic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check if it is a malware that is making the computer run slow, I would suggest you to update your Windows defender and run a complete scan to check and remove any malware in the computer. Refer this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/how-find-remove-virus</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to check this link to improve your PC’s performance:</p>

            Try uninstalling your anti-virus software and using Windows Defender.&nbsp; I use Defender and have never had a problem with anything.&nbsp; Defender will not run with other anti-virus software in the computer.&nbsp; You should do this ASAP, otherwise the third-party
 software could crash your computer when you try to do an update so bad that you will not even be able to re-load the disk.&nbsp; It is as hard to uninstall&nbsp;Norton&nbsp;and McAfee as some viruses.&nbsp; I just uninstalled&nbsp;the Norton trial when I got my computer and searched
 Symantec and Norton in the File Explorer and threw away everything that came up with those words in the title.&nbsp; If you do not get everything, your computer will not know that the software is gone and will not let you turn on Defender.&nbsp; This is so MS cannot
 be sued for 'deliberately forcing Norton etc. out of&nbsp;business.'&nbsp; I hope this helps.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Melody. My Windows 10 Notebook laptop is maybe a month new. At first start up of my PC, there was already terrible performance, lag, freezing. I can barely do anything. Everything takes long, it is super slow. Even quick actions such as typing,
 or switching tabs, start up, take several minutes. This computer as I said, is NEW. I do not know what is wrong with it but this should not be an issue with a brand new computer. I need help to fix my PC a.s.a.p because I would like to use it for many things.
 I can't watch videos without freezing, lag. I cannot play my games, I cannot open a browser period without diffrent things popping up like anti virus programs insisted I purchase when I cannot. PLEASE HELP ME. It is even worse when my page lags scrolling up,
 or down.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It doesn't matter if it was a joke or not. As per the XBL Terms of Service it is forbidden and the XBL PET (Policy Enforcement Team) have made their stance on the matter very clear:
 (this goes for anyone hosting, advertising and/or participating in infected lobbies)<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up until this point when a user was found to be exploiting infections in a game they were issued a temporary cheating suspension.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, after discussing how infections are obtained and weighing just how disruptive these modifications are to gameplay , this policy has now been changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intentionally activating and exploiting infections in multiplayer matchmaking is a blatant violation of the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct, and users who purposefully engage in such activity will be&nbsp;suspended appropriately. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From this moment on, any user account found&nbsp;exploiting infections will be subject to<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>We know exactly what is required to be infected, which means we also know that it cannot be done accidentally.&nbsp; Suspensions will not be lifted simply because you make a false&nbsp;claim

            <p>As it is Retail, you can certainly transfer it or change the Hardware; whatever you want to do, as long as it is only installed on one computer at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't deactivate it as such; you reactivate it on the new machine.</p>
<p>Hopefully it will reactivate as it is Retail.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you checked your router for updated firmware? Have you tried running updates on<br />
a different network?<br />
<br />
When I had a similar issue on my Surface 2 RT only a Reset worked. Even a Refresh did not<br />
clear the issue. (The updates would not apply though they did download.)<br />
<br />
Try doing a "Refresh your PC without affecting your files"&nbsp;(or changing your personal<br />
settings)&nbsp;or even a Restore. <br />
<br />
Windows 8 includes special methods to Refresh (keep files and settings)&nbsp;&nbsp;or a&nbsp;Reset
<br />
(new install removing all).<br />

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am a Microsoft Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />Sounds like what you need is to download the necessary codec
<br />
<br />To do this, follow these steps in Windows Media Player 11:
<br />On the Tools menu, click Options.
<br />Click the Player tab, click to select the Download codecs automatically check box, and then click OK.
<br />Try to play the file. If you are prompted to install the codec, click Install.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

This Grammy is sick and tired of all the ****. I'm not over the hill and have been using computers for 20+years (work and pleasure). 


My webcam and microphone worked perfectly with Skype...I could talk and see my grandchildren.  That is before "The Company"  


wanted to expand and get a larger market share of what other companies were producing.  Whatever is going on in Windows 7  


(have 32 and 68 whatever you call it on my computer) but now camera or microphone doesn't work...nor does the CD/DVD drives.  


All worked perfectly on my old computer and even this more recent one.  Whatever Windows has done my system is now a  


nightmare. Windows doesn't even read that they're on this Dell computer.  Your stock will never advance if you can't help  


customers with even the basics!  This is my wake-up message...or must I again be nickeled and dimed by going through paid support?

            <p>With Windows 8/8.1, Windows uses User Account Control to protect you from accidentally harming your computer. It does this by not running any of your programs as administer automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few ways to get around this, but since you just want to remove some files, I would recommend that you&nbsp;run Command Prompt as an administer and deleting the files that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press&nbsp;WinKey + X</li><li>Select Command Prompt (Admin)</li><li>Navigate to the directory location of the files using:
<ul>
<li>"cd.." to go to the previous directory</li><li>"cd &lt;directory name&gt;" to enter a directory</li><li>&nbsp;"dir" to view files/directories in a directory</li></ul>
</li><li>Once you are in the directory of the files you wish to delete, type "del &lt;filename&gt;" to remove the desired file</li></ol>
<p>TIP: Be sure to include the file extension. If you are unsure of what it is, type "dir" to view the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works!</p>

</p><p>I have HP 250 G3 with Intel N3450. I clean installed Windows 10 and all the drivers using Windows 10 Update, HP Manager and Intel Driver Downloader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything you wrote here and it works after restart, but only until the first shut down of the system. When I start my PC again the problem comes back. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            External Hard Drive making controller react slower.</h2>
                    Been playing on my xbox forever now and i have had the external hard drive for months and an issue like this has never happened. I got up today and turned on my xbox and my hard drive wasnt working so i unplugged it and plugged it back in and all my games
 came back up but then my controller began to start acting up. It was on and it would take about 1 minute for it to actually react to me pressing the button. Its a brand new controller so it cant be that. When i unplug the hard drive the controller works fine
 then when i plug it in, after the games load in, the controller begins to act up again. Anyone know how to fix this?

<p>Hello Brady,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue with the controller. Try first to manually shut down the console. To do this hit the guide button&gt;go to far right icon looks like a gear then scroll down to turn off console. Leave the console off for about
 30 seconds then turn back on. Once completely booted up try an <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update the controller</a>.</p>
<p>

            Is the controller wireless or wired? If its wired just simply try unplugging it and plugging it back in. If its is wireless, try to resync your controller. I've had similar reaction/connectivity with a wireless controller that was brand new before too...all
 I did was resync it and it was fixed.&nbsp;

            I would try a resynch for the controller first. If this won't fix it do a power cycle. To do that press the power button for ten seconds. After the console shuts down unplug the power cord for at least a minute&nbsp; Than put the power cord back in and restart
 the console. Hope that fix the issue.&nbsp;

<p>It could be possible that if the controller had a previous update that was stored within the hardrive some of that data is either missing or corrupted due to you removing the hard drive but if you use this link it can show you how to update your controller
 again&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            What happens if you don&#39;t activate Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    My legit copy of Windows (HP machine) recently and inexplicably deactivated. Have gotten the usual runaround, of course, and am facing a full restore, which I'd like to avoid. Anyone knows what would happen if I don't actually re-activate? I might be able
 to live with the reminders, but wonder what else happens.&nbsp;

<p>Yes. Regardless of genuine status, you'll still be able to get critical security updates. However, if your copy of Windows isn't genuine, you won't be able to install many updates that are exclusively for genuine Windows customers, including
 Microsoft Security Essentials. Microsoft strongly recommends that you get genuine Microsoft software immediately to help ensure a safer computing experience.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 after shutdown will not power off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcecil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 after shutdown will not power off</h2>
                    
<p>When I do a shutdown in Windows 7 it appears to shutdown but it does not power off the computer.&nbsp; I then must manually power off (hold power button for 4 seconds).&nbsp; When I power on and Windows starts my raid (running mirrored) starts a verify and correct
 (takes forever).</p>
<p>Here is what does work (believe it or not):</p>
<ol>
<li>I can do a Window 7&nbsp;restart - it works great, no problems, raid is okay.</li><li>I can do a restart and switch to Vista (I have a dual boot) and then shutdown.&nbsp; It powers down correctly.&nbsp; I can then power up and boot windows 7 - it works great, no problems, raid is okay.</li><li>I can do a restart and boot from a CD (like Acronis), then reboot Windows 7 - it works great, no problems, raid is okay.</li></ol>
<p>There is something strangely different between shutdown and restart in Windows 7.&nbsp; Also, I have no problems shuting down Vista.&nbsp; My workaround is&nbsp; to do a restart, boot from Vista, and then do a shutdown.&nbsp; At least when I do powerup, Windows 7 boots fine
 and raid is okay.</p>
<p>I've tried about everything I can find in the way of suggestions on this forum and other Internet sites to no avail.&nbsp; I'm stumpted.&nbsp; My latest test involved using msconfig.exe and disabling all&nbsp;non-Microsoft services.&nbsp; But no joy!</p>
<p>My computer is 3 years old. I'm using an ABIT board with an Intel cpu.&nbsp; This is the first problem I've had in the three years.&nbsp; No problems with XP early on and none currently with Vista.&nbsp; The only problem with Windows 7 is the shutdown.</p>
<p>Well, that's it.&nbsp; There's got to be one smart person out there with the answer.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p><span><span>This worked.<span>&nbsp;</span>I found that the "print spooler" was the cause.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had installed an old printer (worked fine on Vista) and it appeared to work great with no problems on Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;</span>So I assumed that the failure to power off was for some other reason.<span>&nbsp;</span>But after finding out
 that the "print spooler" service was causing the power off failure, I deleted the printer and then the driver for the printer.<span>&nbsp;</span>The printer is an HP Laserjet 2100.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Now all works.</span></span></p>

    <title>New Skype - No Thank You - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hairy goose  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype - No Thank You</h2>
                    <p>Wow - its been a few weeks now since I suffered the shock of the new version of Skype on Android, now I have also to suffer it on iPhone. &nbsp;I have read hundreds of 1 star reviews across google play &amp; App Store and even more damning reviews on microsoft communities.
 &nbsp;I also see a few replies from the 'Skype Team' on communities and they all have two things in common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. They are all as weak and woolly as the latest update - scripted and lacking sincerity. I am sure no-one is really paying any attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. They all focus on just one point - viewing which contacts are on line - yes this is annoying but you have many other issues to address too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a real shame if the Skype team failed to react accordingly to save what was a working, suitable and in a lot of cases a 'lifeline' product of communication that was easy to use across several generations and platforms. &nbsp;I work away from home
 and use skype to talk to my girlfriend, my children, grandchildren and my parents too - the beauty of the old V7 was all of these generations could figure out how to work it - it was just very simple and intuitive - all that has gone now, for some new updated
 modern version that it seems the vast amount of existing users didn't need or want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a 13 year Skype user and now find myself looking for other options and that is sad. &nbsp;Skype always did exactly what I, and I suspect millions of other users, needed. &nbsp;It worked well, with only the occasional glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Skype team know that the modern user will complain but never vote with their feet and close their accounts to move somewhere else. &nbsp;That is exactly why they will get away with this shambolic update and lame gestures to keep people on Skype while
 they pretend to listen and pretend to offer fixes. &nbsp;Know your demographic Skype. &nbsp;I bet the average Skype user is over 30 and not interested in all this tosh you have now added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to fix from my perspective -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Keep Skype contacts individual, dont share my other contacts in this platform. &nbsp;Also, when I dial a number in the new skype, there is no way of then saving that number to my skype contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;File share option is missing to share in Skype - Oh Dear, how did you miss this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Yes, I like to see my contacts status, it makes a difference as to whether I call them or IM them</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;Get rid of all this colour and style nonsense - its way too intrusive, having to swipe up to go through the options is mandatory to be able to get rid of them to continue using the product</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be a good start for me, but you, as developers, probably know better about your customer needs than your customers do right? &nbsp;Thats why we have this latest useless release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand how powerful your tool was. &nbsp;I switched to android recently from iphone. &nbsp;when the auto update came down to the android and it was so bad, I switched back to my iphone as my default. &nbsp;When the iPhone updated (my mistake I might add) I looked
 at which phone I could roll back - The android won - and now I choose which phone to take out with me based purely on which version of YOUR app is installed - think about that for a moment Skype Team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look elsewhere if you dont fix it quickly - the fastest way to do that is to give us the old version back. &nbsp;Food for thought though - your last version was so good for me, I would happily pay an annual subscription to retain it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you listen to the reviews but if you don't - I hope the users grow balls and walk away, closing their accounts as they do.</p>

<p>Well said. &nbsp;It's a shame that the people that make the decisions that affect the roadmap of this app are far removed from the end user and will never read this comments. &nbsp;The Minions will copy and paste from the sheet they have been given - standard practice
 in most companies today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me .. uninstall Skype 8. Download the APK for the last update for Skype 7 here&nbsp;http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/skype/skype-skype/skype-skype-7-46-0-596-release/skype-free-im-video-calls-7-46-0-596-android-apk-download/ &nbsp;Install the apk and disable

<p>You understand where the user is coming from? Were you educated at the funny farm university? You continue to destroy a perfectly good application yet say you understand where the users are coming from. You guys are unbelievable!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This reminds me of the Windows start button mess. A company that stops listening to its customers will sooner or later fail. The sad thing is that the people making decisions about Skype will just move to another company and start destroying another product.</p>

            It's an unmitigated disaster and am removing it. Every time I sign off a call it shows as still running........so, are the other callers still listening? Apart from the useless teenager color styling of course, but at a push can live with that.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply - but yet again, you miss the point..........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates due to transitioniong from P2P to cloud - I get that , but it is a mess, you should have had a better product BEFORE releasing. &nbsp;I took another update of Skype on my iPhone last night and it hasn't made a blind bit of difference that I can see -
 Is that now the 4th update since V8 release? &nbsp;To be honest, I am losing count.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>Beginning July 1, 2017, Skype users on some platforms will no longer be able to sign in to Skype</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>If you are using the unsupported Skype enabled devices, and platforms may experience problems with calls and chats, lost or dropped calls and instant messages, or could stop working completely.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Really? &nbsp;You are just going to turn Skype off for some users? &nbsp;I wonder how many that will affect. &nbsp;Should be ok though - you will have done your homework and know just how many people this will affect right?</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>Regarding your contacts, syncing your native contacts to Skype will give you an easy access to know who among your contacts are using Skype and as the new Skype does not have an option to save phone numbers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span><span>You can easily make a phone call by clicking or tapping your address book, for you not to dial their number manually.</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">No No No No No. I don't want to sync my 'native' contacts. &nbsp;I want to have my Skype contacts completely separate from all of my other contacts. &nbsp;And here's the thing that you really have missed. &nbsp;I manually punch a phone number
 into my Skype dialling pad - this number is not in my contact list anywhere but a completely new number. &nbsp;After I have finished that call, in V7 I could then save that dialled number into my Skype contacts but now, that VERY useful function has gone. &nbsp;The
 only thing I can do in V8 is invite that number to Skype - what a load of tosh - my bank will be overjoyed if I keep sending them messages to join Skype, or my Doctor, or the garage that services my car - you really haven't thought this through at all.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">New Skype does not support file sharing. But you can share photos, emoticons and Mojis.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>When people read this statement - you really are done for. &nbsp;See, I like many of your users have already passed through puberty. &nbsp;Me and the missus are well into our 40's. &nbsp;So instead of sending
 her meaningful files for her to wake up to, I can now send her Mojis designed by 12 year olds for 12 year olds - Good work Skype, you really did excel this time</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Please understand where I am coming from when I tell you your new product is a mess, an abortion, unsightly and lacking all of the function that made it attractive. &nbsp;In a couple of weeks when
 I return to work in Asia, if the functionality that I need is not back, YOU will leave me with no choice but to look for something else.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>One more time just to be clear - and please, share this with everyone involved in 'New Skype'. &nbsp;Many thousands of users are unhappy. &nbsp;Your product is lame but nowhere near as lame as the insincere,
 non commital responses posted by the Skype Team and its moderators.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Stop focusing on that one item of being able to see contacts status - I know what you are doing, focusing so hard on that one thing and will scream a victory when you do finally release an
 update that fixes this (somewhere in 2019 I predict). &nbsp;There are so many problems you need to deal with.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>V7 had it all - V8....................has nothing of interest to anyone out of their teen years.</span></p>

            I use skype for a number of purposes, but as a priority for use while travelling internationally on my mobile on wifi to call landlines. &nbsp;While I can use the "keypad" to enter numbers, all of my skype contacts that have stored landlines no longer work.
 &nbsp;Within address book there does not seem to be a "call using skype" feature. &nbsp;What's up.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Marites</p>
<p>
</p><p>Totally support all the other comments here about what an utter disaster the direction Microsoft is taking many versions of Skype in, which fits in with the theme of many many posts across the forum and quite a few media articles that have come my way without
 looking or them. &nbsp;Some Microsoft people have had the barefaced cheek to ask which functions we want back! &nbsp;LOOK AT THE FORUM, many people post again and again and again similar messages. &nbsp;Migrating to the cloud should have just been done at the back end of
 the application, leaving the user interface pretty well unchanged, had you done this then the forum would not be flooded with complaining unhappy users. &nbsp;I have posted this before, but anyone with any development experience (mine in engineering) would expect
 this as a bare minimum from any organisation displaying minimal levels of responsibility for their products &amp; user base. &nbsp;This quote below should therefore be securely and indelibly posted by every Skype developers screen in very large letters:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is NOT a game.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 for lost time and loss of income while you toy with this important application. Of course I am sure there is no hope of that.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 around with and for frivolous stuff like adding colours, graphics, etc whilst losing functionality.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 to. This was NOT the case for this latest installment of technicolour dung.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 yes, that is fine. But to fundamentally change the nuts and bolts of a functioning app and CRITICAL application, just so you can pimp it and migrate it to the cloud, illustrates a fundamental lapse, or woeful misunderstanding of the business you entered into
 when Skype was acquired.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
 PERFECTED, and only trial, roll out new builds to those that are interested and make it easy to roll back to the previous version if the new version is not suitable."</span></p>

<h2>            Instructions for upgrading to W10 directly from W8 - bypassing 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am currently running 8 on my Asus Vivobook, as 8.1 made it crash all the time and it became completely un-useable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have figured out from the forums that it is possible to upgrade from 8 to 10 without having to install 8.1 first. However, I don't understand the brief, one-sentence instruction that has been given!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please post an IDIOT'S GUIDE (for I am an idiot) on how to go from Windows 8 to 10 without having to go via 8.1? Preferably with pictures!? I would be eternally grateful and this would make a baffled woman very happy. :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your requirement for upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 8 PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you're running the latest version—either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update. As Windows 10 is designed to run on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 PCs. That means
 your device is likely compatible and will run Windows 10. To learn more, visit the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/Windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Not every device will run every feature of Windows 10. Unfortunately you have to upgrade your Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 before you can get free upgrade to Windows 10.
 One way is to download the ISO of Windows 8.1 setup and upgrade your system using it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer the below mentioned link for more information on Windows 10 FAQ’s.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this will address your query.</span></p>

            No, no other changes were made prior to the issue.<br />
<br />
Yes, other programs appear to be running normally. (Outlook, Word, Adobe Reader, Adobe Photoshop, etc).&nbsp; PhotoScape is the only program we have found this to be an issue.<br />
<br />
PhotoScape.exe has not run on THIS computer, but we have two other XP machines it runs well on, that we also maintain similarly (same update schedules, defrag, etc).<br />
<br />
I will try the 'clean state'&nbsp; option soon.<br />
<br />
Since this is XP, I did try it in 2000 compatibility mode with the same results.&nbsp; I have since turned off compatibility mode since it made no difference.<br />

    <title>Mercenaries 1 freezing&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meowfia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mercenaries 1 freezing&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So I recently bought mercenaries 1, which I played a bunch on Xbox original. I tried playing it on my xbox 360, but ti keeps freezing. No other game freezes, except for mercenaries 2. So either my xbox hates the mercenaries games and won't play them, or
 I have 2 damaged mercenaries discs, bought from different people, and the mercenaries 2 was bought new. Help please?! :)</p>

<p>Hi, Make sure the disk is not cracked, Just test the game out at your friends house or other console if it fails to work, its something to do with the disk. Also try deleting the game file by System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; storage device &gt; select content &nbsp;&gt;
 select content &gt; Delete. Try clearing system catch by going into System Settings &gt; Memory &gt; Highlight HDD, Press Y &gt; Clear System Cache &gt; Say Yes. Hope this helps you out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried it on my brothers &nbsp;xbox and it froze too, also tried deleting the save file and system cache, so I assume it is the disc then? Anyhow I bought it off amazon, they said I could get a refund so I most likely will and then just try buying from a different
 user. Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>So too whoever reads this, I found a permament solution to mercenaries 1 freezing on the xbox! so i figured this out after the second disc i bought froze again, I did some research, and what you have to do, is clear your system cache, and then you will be
 able to download xbox original updates. I dont know for how long or what, but you cant download it until you clear system cache, and once u download the mercenaries 1 update, it will be fixed. Signs of this problem, are when u go to the chinese territory your
 map will turn blue and it will freeze soon after. hope this helps. If u need help feel free to add me on xbox and i can walk u thru it thru voice chat</p>

            What about the download version? I am still having the same problem with mercenaries on 360 which is free to download this month. I've contacted Microsoft they had no solution and i was told they are aware of the problem and it is being looked into. Help
 please anyone who knows how to fix or avoid this problem.

            <p>I just had a similar issue happen to me. I'm 8 years strong as an Xbox live member. Never any issues with bans or other problems. Now there's an overabundance of low gamerscore smurf accounts that abuse the ranking systems on pvp games such as Halo 5. They wreck match after match with obvious smurf accounts with 80 or 120 gamerscore for example and then message crude and explicit messages. I finally had enough and started repeating back some of what was sent to me. Yesterday I received a 24hr communication ban. I can not file a review request because it is not over 24hrs. Really disheartening as a long time and loyal xbox live&nbsp;customer. I don't even use game chat, I only communicate on party chat with my own family or friends. That was taken away from me by the heartless user with an alt account by reporting me. The user then sends me a message saying he was not banned so I'm dumb for saying anything... while he is online enjoying a pvp match in Halo 5. Questioning renewing my live service

            <p>Hello, so sorry to hear stories like this, however it is your misunderstanding of the policy that is the real issue. Abuse of any player is subject to Enforcement action, that means that retaliation is also cause for action taken against your account. And to be clear only those who actually gamed with you can file a complaint, it is not possible for friends to add to a complaint, only players actually in the game. All forms of communication must abide the&nbsp; Code of Conduct, voice in any chat and messages sent through any Xbox device, it all is subject to the Xbox Terms and Rules that we all have agreed to.</p>

            <p>point remains, either ban all at fault or none at all. Smurfing is fine it seems, but swearing isn't? Both break the code of conduct, still waiting to see smurfs get console banned</p>

            They screw me over all the time with this [<strong>mod removed</strong>] too. Ive had 3 enforcement actions against my account because these sensitive [<strong>mod removed</strong>]&nbsp;10 year olds go ballistic when they see the word "trash". Can't [<strong>mod
 removed</strong>]&nbsp;believe it counts as "sexual harrassment" or "profane language" to call a game trash. I feel your pain and I've had about enough of this treatment from the [<strong>mod removed</strong>]&nbsp;IN MICROSOFT!

<p>Hi, you should start a new thread and not bring up old threads, as it is against forum rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you aimed your comments in a message or voice chat, you will get investigated and enforced up on. Your word can be used as an insult. I strongly suggest refreshing your sel on the code of conduct&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com</a></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;tarantuloid6078</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why the golden rule is to report and block, Never respond or you can both get a ban. You would never find out what happened to the people you reported since that's confidential. Xbox Enforcement looks into all reports and can see a lot of stuff behind
 the scenes. Sometimes bans happen weeks after then fact there not always instant&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, swearing that much in a forum reply does very little to convince anyone you didn't deserve the Enforcement action. If you have something we can help with, please create a new thread instead of reviving old ones; that makes it
 easier for us to help you. However, continuing down the road of swearing and name-calling will get your posts deleted and possibly your forums account suspended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have questions about Enforcement actions on your Xbox Live account, those are best directed to
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enforcement.xbox.com</a> where you might be able to have them reviewed if you meet the criteria they set out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I will be locking this particular thread as it's old and the OP won't be returning.</p>
