<h2>            Linking Facebook account to Microsoft</h2>
                    I have tried to connect my Microsoft account&nbsp;to Facebook&nbsp;using a variety of apps and browsers but it always comes up with a message saying it cannot connect. I've tried photos, people, messaging and through the Microsoft account website using&nbsp;a variety
 of devices but it always comes up with a message saying it cannot connect to the service.

<h2>            Error code C00D11B1 when attempting to play audio .wav files</h2>
                    <p>Windows Media Error Code C00D11B1</p>
<p>When attempting to play audio .wav files for work-related tasks, I receive an error code C00D11B1 and the .wav file will not play in Media Player or any other software, nor will Windows even recognize it as a playable file. This ONLY occurs on system running
 Windows 7 64bit. The .wav files played fine 3 days ago on an older system (XP pack 2) and according to many forums, this is an issue happening with others specifically on Windoes 7 64bit. I need these files to play. Any help? I have tried all troubleshoot
 options.</p>

<p>If you did some lenovo updates, it could be the new hotkey driver for windows vista. You can try reverting to the older version of the driver.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Photos team didn't implement the Play To functionality in the new Photos App and they removed tons of other features, too. Take a look at PhotoWeaver in the Windows Store.</p>

<p><br />
sorry to hear that. I don't have any other apps to recommend. Seems like the Photos teams removed just about every existing function from 8.0 that customers enjoyed.</p>

<h2>            Problems with AVCHD files with .CPI exentions&#33;</h2>
                    Whilst on holiday abroad, I took a number of clips on an HD video camera, downloading them to my laptop every few days with the intention of making a proper 'Holiday DVD' on my return to the UK. On my return home, all clips seemed to be successfully transferred
 from laptop to desktop. However, some files are coming up with .CPI extensions and won't play on Windows Media Player like the remainder of the AVCHD files with .MTS extentions.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would be extremely grateful if someone could tell me how to correct this to
 enable me to use the clips, what I may have done wrong and how to prevent it happening again?

<h2>            Windows cannot use this hardware device because it has been prepared for &#34;safe removal&#34;, but it has not been removed from the computer. &#40;Code 47&#41; &#40;vista Home Premium</h2>
                    
<p><span><span><span>I have a customer that I sold a new machine to(desktop). He has an SD &nbsp;card reader in it. The first time he inserted
 a camera card into it, it was read and he chose the Nero photo editor. He pulled the card out without clicking the remove hardware safely icon, and since then the dang thing won’t work. He is running Windows Vista Home premium, and the other card readers in
 the panel work fine. It happens regardless of the SD card used, as the same thing happens when I use a known good card. &nbsp;Insert the card, and it gets read.&nbsp; Try to remove it using the &nbsp;hardware removal icon, and it gives you the “this item can be safely removed”
 signal. Remove it and it cannot be read upon reinserting.&nbsp; Check Device mangler and there is a yellow icon the says it is a USB Mass storage device. Check properties on the device and you get this. “Windows cannot use this hardware device because it has been
 prepared for "safe removal", but it has not been removed from the computer. (Code 47)”. The only way to remove it is to uninstall the device and reboot. Then upon inserting the card, it is read but the same thing happens. Rebooting the machine does not clear
 the error unless the device is uninstalled.</span></span></span></p>

<div>
<div>
<div>Windows cannot use this hardware device because it has been prepared for safe removal, but it has not been removed from the computer. (Code 47)</div>
<strong>Recommended resolutions</strong><br />
<br />
Here are some things that you can try to resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Reconnect the device</strong><br />
<br />
This error code occurs only if you used the Safe Removal application to prepare the device for removal, or pressed a physical eject button.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Reconnect the device to your computer</strong><br />
<br />
Disconnect this device from the computer, and then connect it again. <br />
<br />
<strong>Restart your computer</strong><br />
<br />
Make sure that the device is connected correctly to your computer, and then restart your computer. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Shut Down</strong>, and then select
<strong>Restart</strong> in the <strong>Shut Down Windows</strong> dialog box to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would do this :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - click in the blank/white area - then VIEW at top<br />
<br />
Check Show Hidden Devices <br />
<br />
Now look for ALL instances of the&nbsp;SD Device (or whatever it is labeled as)&nbsp;in&nbsp;Disk&nbsp;Drives&nbsp;and everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers<br />
<br />
If you find any right click on them and UNINSTALL<br />
<br />
Now - go to USB Controllers and RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING except the category itself.<br />
<br />
APPLY/OK<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh your entire USB setup and often fixes your issue.<br />
<br />
A utility to help :<br />
<span><br />
USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently connected to your computer, as well as all
<br />
USB devices that you previously used. Under OPTIONS - check the top 4 choices do you see everything. You
<br />
would be looking for ALL instances of that device to remove it. I would do the above procedure 1st.<br />

<br />
<br />
BTW here is that procedure in XP from Microsoft, it is same in Vista except in your case we also<br />
want to remove the disk devices so they can also refresh.<br />

    <title>Windows Update Corrupt Files. Error 0x80070490 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kuban94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Corrupt Files. Error 0x80070490</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, I have a 64 GB i3 Surface Pro 3 running windows 10 pro. After upgrading some apps fail to update. I ran the
<strong>sfc /scannow </strong>command and it says it found some corrupt files that was not able to fix. The I ran the
<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong> and it says it's repairable. Then I tried to do the&nbsp;<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
</strong>but it fails. Therefore I made a Windows 10 usb using Media Creation Tool, and wrote&nbsp;<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth /source:esd:D:</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>\Sources</strong></span><strong>\Install.esd:1
 /Limitaccess </strong>where D is the usb drive and esd instead of WIM because when I looked inside the files it's Install.esd and not Install.wim. I also tried it using a mounted iso. In both cases I still got the error "source not found." After so much frustration
 I backed-up the data and did a clean install. Although now windows seems to update and windows apps don't fail to update, so far (It's not even 24 hours since I did the clean install), I decided to run another&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow
</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong>, which still tell me there are corrupt files and that the image is repairable, respectively. I really want to fix this corrupt files, and I'm also concerned this could be a hardware-related
 problem, in which case the fact that is a tablet makes it a lot harder to fix. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.s. I also did some other procedures like cleaning cache and changing the SoftwareDistribution and catroot2 names to allow a new folder to be created. I also tried restarting the wuauserv, sryptsvc, bits, and msiserv services. I did the suggestion of making
 a new local account with admin rights, transfering my data, and deleting the old one. And of course, the windows update troubleshooter, which says it fixes the issues but does not. plus some other smaller procedures scattered throughout the internet. On a
 side note, before doing the clean install, apparently windows update worked, but windows store app updates did not, yet the error code was 0x80070490 as well. I tried signing out and in again, but no luck. Thanks and sorry for the length of the question.</p>

    <title>Cannot connect to Bluetooth headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mfiiknee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to Bluetooth headphones</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a pair of Ausdom M4 wireless BT headphones. They work fine on my phone, but I cannot get them to connect on my Windows 7 64 bit PC. I can pair the headphones, but I am unable to get them to connect. I'm using a BT 3.0 USB dongle, and I installed
 the Broadcom drivers from the CD that came with the dongle, but that didn't resolve the issue. Below is a screenshot of my settings, along with what I've found while attempting to troubleshoot so far.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no 'Control' option when I right click on the headphones in my list of Bluetooth devices.</li><li>When I go to Control Panel &gt; Sound, right click on the headphones, and choose 'Connect', nothing appears to change. The headphones stay disconnected.<br />
</li><li>When I go to Control Panel &gt; Sound and&nbsp; right click on the headphones, the 'Set as Default Device' option is greyed out, presumably because the device is disconnected.</li><li>My PC has all the current Windows updates save a graphics update that errors when I try to install it. (should be unrelated to this issue)</li></ul>

            <p>I have the same model of headphones (Ausdom M04) and I had the exact same problem for a few days. I have tried to find the drivers of the headphone but then I figured my computer was causing the problem. Then I updated the bluetooth driver of my PC (Packard
 Bell Easynote TJ65 - Windows 7 64 Bit) and the problem is solved. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I can help. Good luck.</p>

Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
I understand that you are unable to connect your Bluetooth head phone.I appreciate your effort in trying to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">This issue can occur due to incorrect Bluetooth settings or device driver issue.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">.</span></p>

<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
You might need to make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth devices, or set Windows to alert you when a new device tries to connect to your computer. To do this, you need to control how your computer pairs with (connects to) Bluetooth devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
To control how your computer pairs with Bluetooth devices</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
a) Open Control Panel by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
b) In the Control Panel search box, type Bluetooth, and then click Change Bluetooth settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
c) In the Bluetooth Settings dialog box, click the Options tab and do any of the following:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
a. To make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth devices, select the check box for Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
When a Bluetooth enabled computer is in discovery mode, it broadcasts a wireless signal that allows it to be detected by other Bluetooth enabled computers or devices. This is sometimes calledpairing mode.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
b. To allow Bluetooth devices to connect to your computer, select the check box for Allow Bluetooth devices to connect to this computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
c. To be notified when a Bluetooth device is trying to connect to your computer, select the check box for Alert me when a new Bluetooth device wants to connect.<br />

            <p>Fan errors are generally hardware issues. There's a fan in the case whose sensor does not detect that it's available or spinning. This could be a problem with the actual fan or with the fan's sensor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this have to do with? Are you talking about an error displayed by a Windows machine? If so, what version of Windows? At what point does the error arise? At boot time? Before or after Windows allows you to log in? When you supply no details, it's
 nearly impossible for anyone to help. </p>

    <title>Install Network printers without Local admin rights in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisc1227  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Network printers without Local admin rights in windows 7</h2>
                    I need to allow general users to select Network Printers on our domain and install them without getting prompted for Password of Administrator. is this possible. or does the admin have to install it at all times. is this a builtin windows feature to protect
 the pc from things being installed on it. I have tried a few soultions and none of them worked. I tried allow non administrators to install and put the GUID for printer in there and it didn't work. the only way I can get this to work is by adding the drivers
 on the PC as administrator and then the local user can install the printer. because the driver is already installed.

<p>This worked for me... found this after I posted the above. hope it helps some of you having the same issue. I did this on my local pc not the Domain GPO so it would work in either place.</p>

<p>There are TWO "Point and Print Restrictions" settings</p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Printers/Point and Print Restrictions</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>User&nbsp;Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Control Panel/Printers/Point and Print Restrictions</span></span></span></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Of these two, the one under Computer Configuration seems to be the important one. But guess what? The original Server 2008 doesn't include this setting in the list -- you need Server 2008<strong>R2</strong> for this setting to show up.&nbsp;<span><span><span>If
 you&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=16f69ffe-d51b-4e02-9d02-3e57f3ccd490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>download the administrative templates from Server 2008 R2</span></a><span>,

 this missing policy will show up magically in Group Policy Management Editor.

 about parse errors</span></a><span>, but it works just fine to click "OK".</span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Once you've installed the proper ADMX files, for this to work in Windows 7, configure&nbsp;both<strong>&nbsp;</strong>of these "Point and Print Restrictions" settings to:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Enabled </li><li>Security Prompts, When Installing Drivers for a new connection = Do not show warning or elevation prompt</li><li>Security Prompts, When Installing Drivers for a new connection = Do not show warning or elevation prompt</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div><span><span><span><span>Also,
 don't forget to make sure the users have permission to install printer drivers, since you're not even going to try to use Admin privileges any more:</span></span></span></span></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\System\Driver Installation</span></li><li><span>The setting is called "Allow non-administrators to install drivers for these devices setup classes".</span></li><li><span>You will need to add the<a href="http://xpdrivers.com/troubleshooting/device-class-guids-for-popular-types-of-hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>device
 class GUID</span></a> of printers: &nbsp;</span><span>{4d36e979-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}</span></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div><span><span><span>Don't forget to update the computer policy on the workstation by running "gpupdate /force". Then log on as a non-admin
 user, and test! It worked for me with an annoying </span><a href="http://onyxftp.mykonicaminolta.com/download/SearchResults.aspx?productid=945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Konica Minolta bizhub C550 fax driver</span></a><span>&nbsp;that
 was prompting my Win7 non-admin users for privileges when the logon script tried to install the driver for them. YMMV.</span></span></span></div>

                    I connected to a duplicate screen through devices, and after I reconnected to PC only, my google chrome will not open. I have tried to uninstall it, but it wont uninstall b/c its asking me to close&nbsp; the programs open in it, but I cant close them because
 I cant open the browser. I tried to do what was suggested with firewall and turn that off for a minute and then turn it on, and that did not work either. I tried opening through the start page, no success. Basically, I can't open google chrome at all and I
 cant do anything to restore it. The "devices" has defaulted to second screen with a message saying "nothing can be sent from the desktop." The outsourced agent said that windows automatically defaults to the second screen even though it is set on pc screen,
 which seems weird. Everything was wrkng just fine with google chrome until I set devices to second screen. I actually never connected to a second screen because my tv wont support the technology. everything else works fine... e

            Thanks Anannya,

<div>I had repaired the problem last night before I read this. I restarted my computer, which I should have known to do right away, but didn't think that would resolve the issue. After the restart, I was able to uninstall and reinstall. The good thing was chrome
 saved all my bookmarks! Happy about that. All seems to be in order now. Thanks for your reply! If it happens again, I will refer back to this.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Is there a way to force a program to use a secondary GPU&#63;</h2>
                    I have 2 GPU's (Nvidia GTX 970 and 1080) and I want to force a program to use the 1080 for certain programs/games. Going to Settings&gt;System&gt;Display&gt;Graphics Settings should give me the option to switch GPU's. Unfortunately it does not list both of my GPU's
 nor does it allow me to change to another one, only the default GPU is chosen (the 970). This is a desktop computer and I have tried the Nvidia control panel and UEFI settings without much luck. If I tried selecting a program to run on my 1080 (through the
 Nvidia control panel), it would still run it on the 970. I have tried switching the GPU's around with not much luck there either. If I can suggest to Microsoft the option in the Graphics Settings to list both GPU's for selection, that would be great. Otherwise
 I don't know what to do. Does anyone have any suggestions? Thank you for your time.

<p><span>Hi Zeond1987,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you getting any error message?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have a multi-GPU system running Windows 10, you can now manually specify the preferred graphics processor an app should use for performance or to improve battery life.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to force an app to use a discrete GPU instead of the integrated one, or vice versa to provide better system performance or battery life, I suggest you to follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
</ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Settings, and click/tap on the System icon. Click on System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click on Display on the left side</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under “<strong>Multiple displays</strong>,” click the <strong>Advanced graphics settings</strong> link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Select the kind of app you want to configured using the drop-down menu:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Classic app </strong>— these are your traditional Win32 desktop programs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Universal app </strong>— these are those app available through the Microsoft Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. If you select Classic app, you’ll need to click the Browse button to locate the “.exe” file to add the app. Otherwise, if you select the Universal app option, you’ll see a second drop-down menu to select the app.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Select the app you added from the list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Click the Options button</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Set the graphics preference you want to use:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>System default </strong>— this is always the default setting, and Windows 10 decide which GPU to use automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Power saving </strong>— runs the application on the GPU that uses the least power, which most of the time is your integrated graphics processor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>High performance </strong>— runs the application on the most capable GPU, which is most of the time an external or discrete graphics processor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. Click the Save button.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I also recommend you to update the <strong>GTX 1080 drivers</strong> from the manufacturer website, and
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope it helps, </span></p>

            This is a desktop computer, not a laptop and the drivers are already updated. The 2 video cards I have are huge and would not fit in a laptop. I want to make a program run on either GPU and I was hoping that Microsoft could make it so that in the graphics
 settings, I could choose which video card I want to use. As this is not a laptop, it does not list both GPU's, only the default one (the 1080).

<p>My 1080 is connected to one monitor and is the primary monitor. The other 2 monitors I have are connected to the 970. They are not both connected to the same monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings&gt;System&gt;Display&gt;Graphics Settings I believe is a new option located only in Windows 10. I don't know if I can post links but if you search for it you might be able to see what I mean. The problem I have is that it doesn't list both dedicated GPU's
 (this is not a laptop). I personally can't find it useful until Windows 10 actually lists both GPU's to choose from in those settings.</p>

<p><em>"only the default GPU is chosen (the 970)"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the 970 is the default gpu how is it your monitor #1 is your <em>main display</em> ? Seems contradictory.</p>
<p>If you disable/disconnect both monitors that are connected to the 970 your 1080 will run the games, yes ?
</p>
<p>If not, it would seem the 1080 is faulty. </p>
<p>Switching the gpu's around would do nothing but change the monitors that are connected to the 970. The 1080 has to be made</p>
<p>the primary/default gpu/monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have never seen an option on my desktop Win10 (currently on 1809) to select different gpu's from anywhere in the Display settings,
</p>
<p>and while I don't have two dedicated gpu's I do have my Intel HD graphics connected to my second monitor and the only way</p>
<p>I can run a game on the Intel HD graphics is to select the option to only show display #2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, even if both monitors are enabled (extended - can't do duplicate with the two different brand gpu's),&nbsp;</p>
<p>games only run on monitor #1 which is the main monitor and connected to my Nvidia gpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only recent addition to Display I've seen&nbsp; is the <em>Graphics Settings</em> &gt;
<em>Graphics Performance</em> nonsense which I think came with 1803 update.</p>
<p>[EDIT: This may work if both gpu's are connected to the same monitor ? (I may give a whirl tomorrow to find out) Pretty pointless with a</p>
<p>desktop machine. Wouldn't save much power. </p>
<p>I have never seen an option to select which gpu to run a game on when using more than one monitor though. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If it is possible to select one of two different gpu's, be they dedicated or combo dedicated/integrated and you have read a description</p>
<p>of how this is done on desktop machines do post the link ( the link tool is in the tool bar - third from right )</p>

<p>I am really sorry if I've been confusing. I switched my 1080 and 970 around in order to test some things. My current default GPU is 1080 (it's in the firs PCIe 3.0 x16) and I have the 970 in the second slot. Both GPU's are Nvidia and I am currently on the
 latest updates in Windows 10 (1809). The 1080 is currently not faulty as I have run some games at max settings on it. Using the Nvidia control panel, you can make any display the primary display (at least with my setup you can).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/103965-set-preferred-gpu-apps-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This</a> is a website that shows you how to access the option and what I am talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I forgot to add that I have not been to the Geforce forums yet. There are options to select an alternate GPU in the nvidia control panel but some programs that I have selected to run on the 970 specifically have only ran on the 1080. I'm going to have
 to clarify some things over there and maybe I'm doing it wrong. Unfortunately I do not think of some things through and I jump the gun when trying different options. This isn't Microsoft's job to listen to the suggestions of just me, but I was hoping I could
 probably get that graphics settings option to work or they could implement it (if it isn't too hard and there is a need for it). I'm sorry if I come off as sounding like a person that is undesirable to be around.</p>

<p><em>"I'm sorry if I come off as sounding like a person that is undesirable to be around."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not at all. </p>
<p>But before I go on, and on... While I very much doubt you will get results, because there would have to be several hundreds of
</p>
<p>thousands asking for the same feature, at least. You need to put your case on the Feedback loop (bottom of every Settings page).</p>
<p>All anyone on the forums can do is address how to deal with Win10 as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the article you linked is exactly what Mithin outlined in his post, and from what I gather, this only applies</p>
<p>to selecting between integrated and dedicated gpu's. The whole gimmick is about power saving.</p>
<p>Notice it only shows Intel HD 620 and 940MX, which is an laptop card. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- I just ran a test and connected both Intel and Nvidia to a single monitor, and if it did switch to the Intel HD there was no way of telling</p>
<p>if Paint 3D was running on the Intel because the Intel HD Control Panel was not available.</p>
<p>If it did switch to Intel HD and I wanted to access the Intel HD control panel I would have had to disable the Nvidia in Device Manager</p>
<p>as in the 'old' days to force the screen to run only on Intel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to one gpu on each screen, and when I used the Graphics Performance option and selected a game that I knew would not run well</p>
<p>on Intel (power saving option),&nbsp; the game still launched on the main/Nvidia screen, but runs poorly.So it looks like this 'feature' will switch my main monitor to run the Intel HD even with it connected to the second monitor if I select a game/software to
 use the power saving option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect that neither of your Nvidia gpu's fall into the category of 'power saving' which is probably why you can't pick and choose</p>
<p>between them ?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>[EDIT:</em></span> Maybe what's happening is Windows is selecting the 970 rather than the 1080 because you have it connected to two monitors ?</p>
<p>If you connect the 1080 to two monitors instead does it become Windows favourite ? ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Another reason is Integrated graphics are controlled by the mobo, and with Win10, even without this new 'feature' I have had Win10</p>
<p>switch to the Intel screen when booting into Window with earlier iterations of Win10, and if I remember correctly,
</p>
<p>I've been surprised to find it being used on my main screen at various times more recently.
</p>
<p>Haven't paid a lot of attention to this seeming anomaly but probably happens when I have uninstalled the Nvidia drivers using DDU ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is why I referred to <em>Graphics Settings</em> &gt; <em>Graphics Performance</em> as a nonsense earlier (even though I've never messed with it until today).
</p>
<p>Much as Game Mode is only any help with low end machines, if at all.</p>
MS has become very laptop/notebook/tablet/phone focused since the advent of Win10, and this feature looks to be pretty much 'device' centric.&nbsp; Fair enough, I guess. Most casual, and many business/professional PC users have left desktop for laptop.<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't bother with NV Control Panel for display setup even when using my Nvidia card on both monitors. Windows Display</p>
<p>does the same thing when using only the one card and wanting to make monitor 2 the main monitor.
</p>
<p>Even then I tend to select the run <em>only on monitor 2</em> option rather than
<em>make this the main display </em>because I've found that I've had to</p>
<p>to jump through a few hoops on a few occasions to get monitor 1 back as the main display.</p>
<p>(my #2 is a 3D vision Benq so I sometimes still use the Nvidia on it with the few games that 3D vision is effective on.
</p>
<p>My newer 27" G-sync doesn't do 3D)</p>

            You all have been very helpful but this feels like it's starting to get a lot more complicated then what I can handle. I appreciate the sharing of your insights and knowledge but I don't think I should bother anyone or myself with this anymore. If this
 becomes a bigger priority for Microsoft down the line, I'll take a look again to see if anything has changed but I doubt it will. Again you are very nice people and Microsoft is a wonderful operating system. I hope all of you have a great day, goodbye.

<h2>            PROBLEM SOURCE FOUND - Different blue screen of deaths every day on a brand new Lenovo Y700</h2>
                    <p>So I've gotten maybe 6 or 7 different crashes since I got my new laptop last saturday. The first few were Kernel_Security_Check_Failures, error code 139 and something else. I updated all the drivers I can and haven't gotten that type of crash anymore. Yesterday
 my computer worked fine but it suddenly crashed again, but this time the BSOD didn't last seconds but shut down immediately after showing up. Reliability monitor says that "Windows could not be closed properly" when it happened. Oh and it also happened when
 I was simply watching HD video on youtube.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I got a crash once again just 20 minutes ago before writing this. I was watching a video on youtube and bang, the same thing what happened yesterday happened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the monitor and apparently the Search UI or Cortana (which doesn't work where I live) had stopped working 20 minutes before the blue screen. The blue screen also was because "windows could not be closed properly".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously I'm considering giving away my laptop to the store where I got it from because it just crashes unexpectably sometimes without a good reason. I don't want it to crash when I'm doing something important and haven't saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feels like I was ripped off for 1000€</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I got the last 139 crash, I updated all my drivers. I also downloaded iOBIT Advanced Systemcare and checked all the options (execpt the internet boost option) from the first page and ran them. I also got their defragging program and ran the defragment
 and file priorisation feature of it on my C-drive.</p>

            Hi AD46,
<br />
<br />Honestly, I would not install KB4074588, it is causing havoc, it is disabling USB ports and hundreds of users are reporting they cannot even log into their PC's . . . 
<br />
<br />I would hide that update and wait for the next cumulative update: 
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it:

<h2>            How do I delete a work account that is an &#34;account used by other apps&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    I left my old school district and I had used Microsoft for my work mail, calendar and other things but I no longer have access to that account because I am not in that district.&nbsp; I would like to delete the X-ISD account and add my new Y-ISD account. I
 keep getting notifications that I need to update the account settings - I just want to delete it.
