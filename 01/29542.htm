<h2>            My external hard drive is suddenly not recognized.</h2>
                    I use Windows 7 home premium 64-bit. I have a Western Digital external hard drive which was fine until yesterday. Just yesterday my computer did not recognize the external hard drive. The message came as "E drive needs formatting". I did not do that. How
 do I get it recognized? Any device driver update needed? How do I get it?

<h2>            Mouse motion jerky&#47;shaky in games.</h2>
                    Hello, I was wondering if windows 7 has known issues with USB mice, or just mice in general. I am an avid gamer, and most of the time my games seem to run smoother using the 360 gamepad, more so than with a mouse. My mouse is not wireless. It is a logitech
 MX518 optical USB mouse. I tried a different mouse, which was a PS/2 mouse, and it was actually worse. Basically, anytime I pan my view in a game, it is a shaky, choppy looking motion. With the gamepad, it is as smooth as silk. I know I can't be the only person
 with this problem. If you are familiar with this issue, your help would be greatly appreciated. I have seen many potential causes, suggested by different people, but so far, no solutions. People have suggested it could be a problem with mouse smoothing in
 games, windows' own pointer precision settings, the fact that some of these games are ported from console and are still using that gamepad's x,z stick coordinate system and a few other things. I have yet to find a real solutio

            <br />
I don't really know what to say except -<br />
- It wouldn't be because the games are console ports. Heaps of games are console ports these days.<br />
But, out of curiosity - what games ?<br />
- Win7 does not have an inherent issue with USB mice, wheels, controllers, or keyboards.<br />
- If there was an issue with the USB then the controller should not be smooth either. Unless you<br />
have the controller plugged into a different USB port. Individual ports can apparently develop issues.<br />
As a cross check - Logitech controllers have an option to use mouse X and Y settings. If the 360 controller has that option see if it still runs smooth when using mouse&nbsp; X/Y .<br />
The interesting thing here is many people have a problem getting the XBOX360 controller fully<br />
functional, so you're one step ahead there ;)&nbsp; .<br />
<br />
- Has the mouse only recently developed this problem ? If so did you install any software just<br />
prior to the problem starting ?<br />
- Have you checked there is no dust,&nbsp; lint or small piece of fiber in the mouse's light well ?<br />
- Are you using a mouse pad in good condition or if you use a desk/table top is it clean ?<br />
Little specks of hand gunk on that builds up on a desktop can cause irregularities.<br />
<br />
- While you still have the same problem with generic Windows drivers -<br />
If you have not reinstalled recent Logitech drivers for your mouse then do so. They would only<br />
be a problem if the previous install was corrupt somehow. It may be a good idea to delete any folders<br />
that have files leftover from the previous install so you have a clean start. If you have reinstalled uninstall<br />
again first.<br />
On my setup they have folders for settings in your User \ AppData\ Local\ LogiShrd\ Setpoint and in<br />
AppData\ Roaming \ Logishrd \ sp6log&nbsp; and Logitech \ Setpoint .<br />
SetPoint installs to Program Files\ Logitech, and there is another sp6 in Program Files\ Common \
<br />
Logishrd . I have four Logitech software installed one each for mouse, keyboard, wheel / controller and G13, so if you only have the mouse software you can delete anything that may be lingering that I have not mentioned.
<br />
Note also that Set Point may include your keyboard as well so you will loose any keyboard<br />
hotkey&nbsp; settings as well. This is different with different keyboard/mouse combinations. Some of the newer mice have a SetPoint driver/software separate to the keyboard.<br />
<br />
- For my gaming profile the pointer is set to zero acceleration,&nbsp; angle snap is disabled,
<br />
and&nbsp; the option for OS settings is disabled as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have not already been to the Logitech forums you may find something useful there.<br />

            Well, thank you for the reply. It's actually been doing this for quite a while, so if it was after an install of a certain program, I wouldn't remember what that would have been. I'm going to go ahead and try the new logitech drivers and see if they fix
 the problem, or perhaps, give me more options to fiddle with, such as the gaming profile software you spoke of. I found a big hair in the light well a while back and got so excited. I thought, right here is the problem! Alas, it did not make any difference
 when I removed it. I recently bought one of those big steel series gaming mouse pads, but it made no difference. Since then I have tried many different surfaces. As far as the games in question, it's actually most of them. Crysis 2 was the first game I noticed,
 that when using a gamepad, the problem was gone. At first I thought it was running poorly, then I plugged the 360 gamepad in and it was totally smooth. All of the games I play run smooth when walking, running or strafing, it's only when

            Just realised - the 360 right stick is already set to mouse X/Y (derp) - shows how much/little<br />
I use the controller, eh!<br />
<br />
Yes, the second one is <span style="font-style: italic">really</span> bad.&nbsp; A bit of glitch on the right in the first. Only on the periphery,
<br />
but I'm not as sensitive to this sort of thing as many, and tend, at least in the case of the first video,<br />
to put it down to being something in the game (or being a game). Plus I'm kinda old (66).<br />
<br />
I'm starting to think I have to read fewer threads relating to micro-stutter, peripheral jerkiness,<br />
and the like or I may get afflicted with the awareness as well ;) . <br />
Well, maybe I have been already. I was noticing a bit of jerky movement when swinging sideways
<br />
playing&nbsp; Skyrim in 1st person last night&nbsp; (after reading about micro-stutter again).<br />
[Bethesda games have always had a jerky movement going up stairs in 1st person that makes me wonder if the guy who thinks it's a cool representation of walking up stairs must be the son of the owner of the company, or it would never get past the development
 team. ]<br />
<br />
I'll check this out with BF3, Skyrim and maybe Crysis 2 as well, later (at great risk to my gaming enjoyment,&nbsp; but for the good of the gaming community - :D ) .&nbsp; I'll do the controller thing as well.
<br />
it was smooth. I didn't see any in Crysis 2 or BF3 (but only did a brief run around in BF3 and can't<br />
play multi-player atm due to the huge update and my pitiful 5GB monthly limit ( our so called cheap<br />
plans here in Oz are pretty stingy. I'll be able to play again in a couple of days after finishing the update<br />
I started last month. I can squeeze up to an extra 1GB out of my plan if I download in the last hour).<br />
<br />
The second example may be so bad due to using too high settings for his system, or maybe V-sync enabled when the fps is not high enough to warrant using it. V-Sync, even with triple buffering on<br />
can still cause lag if the fps aren't already high.<br />
- The comment about disabling HT is a valid suggestion. I've read posts elsewhere from people with<br />
i7's who had issues with HT on in some games.<br />
- If this sort of thing happens consistently in all games I would agree the mouse may be the source,<br />
but I don't really think it is.<br />
<br />
GTX680 - bloody well should, mate ;)&nbsp; (I'm running a close second - HD7970).<br />

            Haha, I hope it doesn't ruin your gaming enjoyment, delving into this sort of mess! I tried the newest Logitech drivers and it doesn't seem to have made any difference :( &nbsp;Think I'm going to disable HT next and see what that does. I just started playing
 back through dragon age origins and noticed there is absolutely no jitter/stutter when using mouse look, granted the visuals are quite a step back from the likes of Crysis 2 and battlefield. I would have chalked it up to a performance deficiency due to higher
 demand engines, but the fact that it goes away in most of the games when using a gamepad is just confusing. I appreciate your help on this. Nice card, btw. I actually had 2 6970s crossfired in my rig before I switched. I had a lot of problems with crossfire
 performance and decided to stick to single cards from now on, lol. It's really tempting to order this mouse I've had my eye on, but it is a little pricey, considering it may not have a positive effect at all. I've also tried fiddlin

I've always stuck with single cards, largely due to budget, partly due to a less is best attitude.<br />
There are enough things that go wrong with PC's and it's even worse with games. I don't want<br />
to add another layer of frustration.<br />
<br />
The MX series are a good mouse. I used the MX510 for a while then went for G5. <br />
Apparently&nbsp; optical mice are still the preferred option with the pro fps players. The old MS two button<br />
1.1 and Intelli mouse 3&nbsp; with a <span style="font-style: italic">very</span> large mouse mat, apparently.
<br />
I guess they don't like driving tanks though. Don't know how they would spin the turret in games like<br />
BF-BC2 without being able to switch to a high dpi. <br />
- I tried the G500 but the side buttons stick out just that little bit more, making me hit the rear one accidentally, and the R/click was too sensitive. The result was my hand was cramping from trying to<br />
compensate.<br />
I'm using a G9 now. (second hand, but the Logishop on ebay has good deals on all their stuff on a regular basis), and have found it the most comfortable of all the mice I've used.
<br />
It's low short profile means my palm barely touches the mouse and has made me realise
<br />
I'm a claw grip mouser rather than the palmer I always thought I should be. I like having two shells<br />
too. I mostly use the smaller one, but having the larger one is good for a break.<br />
If I were going to try another brand I'd have to try the Razer DeathAdder. Hugely popular here in Oz.<br />
<br />
"<span style="font-style: italic">My son said he just wouldn't worry about it and play the game, but after sinking money into a gaming rig, I guess I just expected a more perfect experience,"</span><br />
<br />
I've read a lot of threads on the Nvidia forum from people with high end machines who seem to
<br />
have the same expectations.&nbsp; On that forum they blame the drivers for everything under the sun,
<br />
of course...&nbsp; The ATI forum also has a lot of threads regarding this glitchy peripheral thing, and micro<br />
stutter (it the two issues are different).&nbsp; Obviously video #2 had a major problem and would be unacceptable even to the most easy going among us, but he didn't list his system specs, so....<br />
Your son is wise beyond his years, I reckon&nbsp; :D&nbsp; .<br />

            Thank you for these links, they are very informative. The second one has me wondering if my problem has anything to do with mouse correction, or maybe the fact that I've just been using the 125hz default polling rate. I guess I am a claw grip guy, as well.
 It feels better, whenever I need to make small precision movements, to be able to anchor my wrist and use just my fingers for the adjustment. I honestly can't see being comfortable with the palm grip and having to use my arm to make small adjustments every
 time. I'm sure those guys probably have their own little tricks for that, though. According to the second article, and what you said, I think I'll just stick with the mx518 for now. Hopefully the polling rate will make some difference. It seems like it is
 possible this could cause similar behavior. He also said that usb ports are all capable of 1000hz report rates, thus it would not actually be overclocking to crank it up, but I wonder, would it still increase heat on the motherboard. I wou

You know, I almost mentioned polling rates, and did turn mine down to 250 as a test, and<br />
things may have looked a little bit less smooth. I didn't use it for long as I was looking for something<br />
more dramatic.<br />
Crank it up . You&nbsp; have the power for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
lol - Starting to sound a bit paranoid imo. Looking for Reds under the beds maybe ?<br />
What is the temp on the motherboard ? Not over 50C max ?<br />
Not overclocking ? Not running the RAM at 1600MHz&nbsp; (an OC speed ) ?<br />
Processor - what speed does it run at ?&nbsp; 3.0 + GHz&nbsp; ? <br />
What does the cpu usage go up to with BF32 ? - Around 60-65% on my i53570.<br />

            Lol, I don't have anything OC'd, as I don't want to shorten the life of my hardware. All stock cooling and my i7930 is running at 2.8ghz, it's factory speed. Honestly, and it probably sounds dumb now, but I have never really ran any kind of temp software,
 as I didn't think I had to worry about that, since I don't OC. My ram is supposed to be able to run at 2000mhz, but I don't think my MB is even capable of that anyway.I'll have to check my usage in battlefield, haven't done that yet. What's weird, is I just
 stumbled on this page about polling rates and shaky movement, specifically with a couple of logitech mice, including the G400, however, these people claim that the shakiness gets worse the higher you go with the polling rates. The problem with that is, as
 you know already, I'm at the low default rate of 125hz. If shaky movement and certain jitter is tied to polling rate, especially with logitech mice, it makes me think that maybe it could be the mouse afterall.&nbsp;
<div>http://www.overclock.net/t/1168175/logitech-g400-polling-rate-problem &nbsp; &nbsp; This is one page I found. One guy said he got a stable 500hz rate only after adjusting the bios. May have to do some tweaking. Something is definitely wrong if my shaky movement
 is the same as these guys, yet I'm already running a low polling rate. Maybe getting closer to a solution? It's pretty exciting, lol. Usually when I feel this way, however, I'm let down a majority of the time. So many different variables and potential causes.</div>
<div>Once again, thank you for taking the time to troubleshoot this with me.</div>

Exactly, and why trying all suggestions is a good idea. Whatever ends up working for you.<br />
<br />
Tried my best to replicate the stutter. Changed polling from 1000 down to 125 and back, but<br />
don't see any difference. Settled on 500 for now BF3, Skyrim too. Must have been mass hypnosis
<br />
making me think there was some stutter the other night - whew!!!<br />
What about keyboards ? Could it be the stutter is induced by the W A or D combination rather than<br />
the mouse ?<br />
I also had a look into my BIOS and all the options in the link you gave are either set to Auto or Enabled.
<br />
<br />
Maybe a bit off topic - The memory controller on your cpu only supports 800 or 1066MHz RAM. Anything over that would be an OC speed, but if you have not set the speed up via BIOS I suspect it may be defaulting to 800MHz (possibly 1066MHz). I would be surprised
 if the machine were stable @1600MHz without&nbsp; OC'ing of the cpu.<br />
- While it may not help with the stutter - If the RAM defaults to 800MHZ on your motherboard<br />
you could safely up the speed to 1066MHz in your BIOS settings, at least for a test.<br />
DDR3 @ 1066MHz is already so fast anything over that has no real world benefit. However, with some RAM using a speed lower than what it is capable of yields better timings, and low latency is (said to be) good for games.<br />
- eg.&nbsp; I have 1600MHz RAM running at 1066MHz (motherboard default) on my older AMD Phenom 965 machine (memory controller can run up to 1333MHz w/o OC'ing), and the latency drops automatically from&nbsp; 9.9.9.24 to 7.7.7.20.
<br />
<br />
My pleasure, I'm sure. I learn a lot by responding to questioins, and it's nice when communicating with&nbsp; people who don't think everything has to have the brevity of a&nbsp; text , or twitter message.

<p>Have the same question as the first... This didn't help. If I try to alter the default applications through settings it refuses to change them. Thought I found a work around by determining defaults by app instead of function, but even though it changes it
 and it finally accepted the changes, the same window keeps popping up every time I click on something that would open a website besides my browser...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"How do you want to open this website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use an app</p>
<p>Use the default browser" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't list any options and it just stays there until I restart my computer.</p>

            <p>This solved it for me. &nbsp;There was no default browser set. &nbsp;I searched for 'Default apps', set IE as the default web browser and now it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried to set IE and Chrome as the default browser within the apps themselves but that did not work, I had to set it via the settings before it would remember.</p>

    <title>Win 10 Narrator reading PDFs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> motobojo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Narrator reading PDFs</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows Narrator on Win&nbsp; 10 (Pro 1607 branch -- up-to-date).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC (v 17.009.20044). According to Reader's update checker this is the most up-to-date version available.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appeart that Acrobat Reader does not play well with Narrator.&nbsp; Narrator doesn't seem able to read or manipulate the Reader controls, nor does it read the pdf content.&nbsp; Does that sound right?&nbsp; Also, I can't get Reader's read-aloud feature to work
 if I have Narrator activated.&nbsp; If I deactivate Narrator and can manage to make my way to turning Reader's read-aloud feature on I can get Reader to read aloud.&nbsp; However, that's yet another tool I have to learn to use whose operation is different than that
 of Narrator.&nbsp; And depending on the degree of one's visual impairment being able to actually make that switch from Narrator to Reader's built in reader might be very difficult if not impossible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something here?&nbsp; I'd really like to just use Narrator and have it read my PDFs.&nbsp; How do you recommend I best do that?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Narrator can read the PDF files but you would need to open them with Microsoft Word. For steps, you can refer to

<p>Thanks @Rhina Vib for the suggestion / pointer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My version of Windows 2013 wasn't very helpful for this.&nbsp; When I try to open PDFs it says it has to convert them into an editable Word document.&nbsp; When attempting to do so it gives an error indicating that the PDF author does not grant permission for such
 an operation and the open fails.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But the notion of using an application other than Adobe Acrobat Reader DC to read the PDF prompted me to try using the Windows Reader App.&nbsp; No luck there.&nbsp; It seems odd to me that a Microsoft App (Reader) doesn't work with Narrator and hence doesn't really
 support Microsoft's own accessibility standards.&nbsp; But that is a different issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge showed up in my context menu "open with" options for pdf files so I gave it a try and it works.&nbsp; Microsoft Edge opening the PDF worked with Narrator.&nbsp; Great.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unfortunately finding that many applications do not necessarily support (work with) Narrator.&nbsp; That is unfortunate.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.<br />
<br />
Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>See if this assists you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Do a System Restore in Safe Mode to before the problem:</p>

<h2>            Progress Bars on the Task Bar</h2>
                    I like to have my computer running for Best Performance (no fancy graphics)&nbsp;and want to disable the Progress Bars for all Programs that show on the Task Bar. I don't need them or want them. They are annoying when someone can see that you are transferring
 files. It is distracting to say the least. I would like an option under the FIle Explorer Options and in IE to disable this (or Performance Settings). I&nbsp;can check on my File Transfer/Download/Copy-Paste Progress myself&nbsp;by clicking on the taskbar icon myself
 and don't need the user-friendly option. Please help!

<h2>            Xbox One takes multiple attempts to turn on.</h2>
                    
<p>I have just recently changed the power saving settings to not always run because of the hum being to loud when I was trying to sleep. &nbsp;But now if I don't play my on my Xbox for a couple of hours and I try to turn it on, it attempts to turn on but shuts off
 before anything happens. &nbsp;I have to do this between 3 and 7 times before it will actually start up. &nbsp;The power supply is plugged directly into an outlet and everything is plugged in securely. &nbsp;Is this happening to anyone else or is something wrong with my
 Xbox One? &nbsp;(And yes, I have tried plugging it into other outlets and unplugging it and plugging it back in)</p>

<p>If your console is not on stand by it takes longer to boot up. It will show the green screen with the loading dots and then go to a black screen for a minute then show the xbox logo. Are you turning it off on the black screen before the logo appears? If
 you can turn it on then quickly hold the power button on the front of the console until it turns off then unplug it for 30 seconds from the outlet then plug back in and try powering back on again. Hopefully it will be able to boot up no problem.</p>

<p>No problem. I just wanted to make sure because a lot of people are impatient waiting for the xbox logo to pop up on the black screen and assume it's not working. When you get it to boot up finally I would switch it back to stand-by.

<p>That's good that they're checking it out for you. I'm sorry you have to send it in though and it's not anything that can't be fixed with troubleshooting. They are the best people to take care of it though. I hope everything works out for you. Best of luck!</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get past the home screen.</h2>
                    
<p>After powering up my Xbox One today, I was unable to get past the home screen. When trying to sign in, load up games, go to the settings, etc. I got to the first part of it loading, then I got an error message reading:</p>

<p>'For some reason [settings, Fifa 14, etc.] has taken too long to start. 0x8027025a' -&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/4sJCzn9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/4sJCzn9</a>&nbsp;- It is the same as this but instead of 'TV' it is just whatever I am trying to go to.</p>

<p>After this message has came up, it redirects me straight back to the home screen. I have looked around the internet for a while and I was unable to find any problems the same.</p>

<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>1: &nbsp;Push the console power button for 5-10 seconds until I turns off</p>
<p>2: &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the console - (has to be from the console)</p>
<p>3: Wait 30 seconds</p>

<p>Should hopefully be working okay now. If not let us know :)</p>

<span>Hi Sbaker51,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft 7 answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the Operating system installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was it working fine before without any issues?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to perform complete PC backup or are you trying to backup certain files and folders?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you trying to backup to a different drive or the same hard drive?</span></p>
<p>
<span>There might some System File corruptions, you may perform System File checker [SFC] scan on the computer, the scan replaces the corrupted system files with the original Windows
 version files, follow the steps below to perform the scan:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box. </span></p>
<p>
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p>
<span>When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.</span></p>

<h3> bar10dr  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am in the process of encrypting a drive but Windows wants to reboot, how do I proceed&#63;</h2>
                    I started encrypting a external drive with bitlocker, its taking a lot of time, its run for about 5 hours now and its 24% into the encryption process.<br />
<br />
I guess MS released a critical patch today because without asking me it suddenly told me I had to reboot, I can choose the maximum of 4 hours before it starts auto-rebooting.<br />
<br />
My question is, can I put the bitlocker encrypter on pause, reboot, and somehow continue the process?<br />
Or do I have to go to my computer every 3 hours and tell it to wait 4 new hours until the bitlocker encryption process is complete?<br />
<br />
Thanks

Solved problem by opening command prompt in admin mode and typing 'net stop "windows update"'.<br />
<br />
Service will restart when I manually reboot.<br />

<h3> markhyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon ip2000 printer driver download hangs in Win 7 Pro x64</h2>
                    <p>The download both in the automatic installation that pops up when I plug the printer in, as well as through Windows Update, hangs at 66% finished. After a while the installation process gives up and Windows Update just keeps sitting there. There's no network
 traffic. The driver download itself is supposed to be 6.9 MB according to the installation process and 6.6MB according to Windows Update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way to clear the already downloaded 66% to restart the download completely, as at the moment it restarts the process from that point, or is there a way to download the driver manually? It's supposed to be a fairly recent driver, published 20th
 December 2012. Canon offers no driver downloads for Win 7 for this printer, only driver addons and another piece of software neither of which helps with installing the printer at all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Edited to add: I forgot to mention that other updates from Windows Update download and install just fine.</p>

<p>As you can see, this game's old now and I only see alot of people go online. I dont know if I posted on the right section but if anyone would be interested for a match, it would be awesome.</p>
<p>We can either play:</p>
<p>* 4 versus 4 friendly match with rules</p>
<p>*ordinary match without rules</p>
<p>*battle of the genders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place one of this before the new forums came out and god knows where it is right now so hit this thread up if you're up for it. Thanks. I love this game and I would want it to continue.</p>

<p>Sure, sounds like fun. I prefer the 1st Left for Dead though (I have both however). I will send you both a friend request and when you see me online, just send an invite across. It is fun when you are with a group of people to talk to.</p>

<h2>            CLR Error&#58;80004005 on Windows 7 machine</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am trying to run a simple bot program on my Windows 7 machine running .Net 4.&nbsp; This is a core i7 with 4gb of ram that came with 7 installed and I have no other versions of the .Net program on my machine.&nbsp; I have searched the internet and found that I should
 uninstall and reinstall the .Net program.&nbsp; I uninstalled, rebooted and reinstalled through Windows Update with no problems but it did not fix my problem.&nbsp; What else can I try?<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help in advance<br />
<br />
Joey<br />

<p><span>You may uninstall&nbsp;multiple versions of the .NET Framework by using the .NET Framework Cleanup Tool, and then reinstall the components.</span></p>

            As I stated in my original question, I am trying to run a bot.&nbsp; Your the Engineer, a bot is a simple program designed to run a series of tasks.&nbsp; Also as I stated in my original question, the error I got was CLR Error:80004005, the rest isn't important
 but it said "The program will now terminate." Again, as I stated in my original question, I have already uninstalled the .Net program from my computer with no problem, rebooted my computer and reinstalled the .Net program but this had no affect on my ability
 to run the bot, same error message. I don't have any problems updating Windows so I don't see how the instructions on the page you referenced are going to help.&nbsp; The only reason I uninstalled and reinstalled .Net is because that is what I found that might
 work in doing an internet search but again, it did not work.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><span>This error is generally caused by having more than one .NET framework installed on the system at one time. While two or more .NET frameworks can work simultaneously on a system, some have compatibility
 issues. To resolve a CLR error, the multiple frameworks must be uninstalled and reinstalled correctly.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>As you have already uninstalled and reinstalled .NET framework try the following and check if it works.</span></div>
<div><span>Remove any compatibility statements that are checked in the compatibility section of the system.</span></div>
<div><span>To remove program compatibilities try these steps:</span></div>
<div><span>a. Navigate to the folder where the program is stored on the computer's hard drive.</span></div>
<div><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Right-click</strong> the program name, hover over "<strong>Properties"</strong> in the window that comes up and select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>."
</span></div>
<div><span>c.&nbsp;
<strong>Uncheck</strong> any boxes that are checked in the window and click <strong>
"OK"</strong> for the changes to take effect.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; This too I had found in my search for a solution and have already done this with no affect.&nbsp; I only have one version of the .Net framework on my computer though which is more confusing to why this would be happening.&nbsp; I know it
 is my machine and not the program because I have the same bot running on another computer that is also Windows 7 and the bot was built on a 7 machine.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions?<br />
