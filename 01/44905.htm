<p><span>Hi louietufillaro,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you uninstall the touchpad driver from device manager and program and features and restart the computer later check if the
 mouse cursor freezes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, </span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Control
 Panel</strong>, click&nbsp; <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, click &nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span><span>‌</span><span>If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then visit Toshiba website download and install the latest driver package for the touchpad using the below link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>For additional support you may post your query in the Toshiba forums.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://laptopforums.toshiba.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://laptopforums.toshiba.com/</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you perform clean boot procedure and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer are causing the mouse cursor to freezes.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>

<p><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Messages not sending on wifi</h2>
                    <p>every time i try to open or send messages on my xbox it does not allow me to do it,saying it was unable to get my messages and to try again later.i have had this problem for over a year now. I then tried on my phone with the same WiFi that I was connected with on my Xbox.I also tried messaging someone on a different account on my Xbox on the same WiFi only to encounter the same error. So I tried messaging a friend on the Xbox app,this time using mobile data,and it worked.I was able to send messages and open them,so I'm only guessing there is a problem with my WiFi.Any advice???</p>

    <title>Windows was not able to find any backup sets - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows was not able to find any backup sets</h2>
                    
<p>My hard drive crashed yesterday. I knew it was coming and performed a full system&nbsp;backup using Microsoft Backup and Restore&nbsp;last thing before it crashed.&nbsp;I backed up to my external hard drive.&nbsp;I replaced the defective hard drive and reinstalled Windows Vista
 Ultimate x32. Now when I go to Backup and Restore, select Advanced Restore &gt; Advanced Restore &gt; Files from a backup made on a different computer &gt; FreeAgent Drive (F:) (the name of the external HD), I get the error message "Windows was not able to find any
 backup sets on F:\. Please select a different location."</p>
<p>I can see from various searches (performed on a different, Windows 7 OS, computer because I have no internet access on my computer that has only Windows Vista and nothing else installed on a brand new hard drive), that I can go throughly an unwieldy process
 involving downloading Virtual Server 2005 to make this work, but I don't seem to be able to find the download file to actually download it.</p>

<p>Microsoft only supports official Xbox accessories, so I would buy the official brand that we can trust rather than buying cheap knock offs which are not always guaranteed to work.</p>
<p>However, if you want to identify your Xbox as a Jasper console What you need to do is read the specs near the MADE IN CHINA.</p>
<p>12V----16,5 A = Xenon/Zephyr</p>
<p>12V---14,2A = Opus/Falcon</p>
<p>12V---12,1A = Jasper</p>
<p>12V ---10,83A = Trinity (Valhalla)</p>
<p>12V --- 9,86A = Corona.</p>

 the specific issue that you are having with your Power Supply for your Elite Xbox 360?</p>
<p><br />
If there is a specific issue, and for reference, what is the color of the LED Status on the power brick indicating?<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Green - Power Good </li><li>Orange - Standby </li><li>Red - Fault Alarm&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p><br />
As for what Jasper means.&nbsp;Jasper was simply a codename for a revision to the Xbox 360 internal chipset and other improvements put in place in September 2008. Namely&nbsp;implementing a 65&nbsp;nm CPU and GPU, reduced power consumption as a result, and introducing 256&nbsp;MB
 of on-board flash memory.</p>

<p>The light is green. Sorry i did not specify what its doin. Its making noise like how do i describe. A loud humming noise. When you fittle with it it goes nuts with loud noises. Is this uncommon for these? Yes its an official one. The one that came with the
 consol. Anyway the one i bought says FOR MICROSOFT XBOX 360 150W Jasper POWER SUPPLY BRICK AC ADAPTER. &nbsp;So this one is a unofficial one.</p>
<p>So how do i identify the consol as a jasper? settings or what? please tell me the steps? will it confuse the cosole plugging in this jasper one and ruin it b4 identifying as a jasper? Oh man sounds like i shoulda got one that did not say jasper. Should i
 just send the jasper one back,and get a non jasper?</p>

<p>You can do what Nimahan says and look at the sticker on the back or look at the power socket on the console and compare it to the following image:</p>
<p>[View:http://www.consolesandgadgets.co.uk/catalog/images/360psu.jpg]</p>
<p>Just so you know, the 150W PSU for Jaspers will only work on Jasper consoles whereas the 203W PSU for Xenon/Zephyr will work on all Xbox 360 models bar the Slim consoles.</p>

<p>well well my consol plug looks just like the 2008 jasper with the top and middle dividers. OH and my brick adapter is a 12v 150w. I just looked at a PSU one and the plug doese not match mine. The jasper one doese hmm.</p>

<p>If your console is definately a Jasper then all the Original Xbox 360 PSU's will work on your console, the 203W, 175W and 150W. So back to your original question, yes the 150W PSU will work with your console as long as yours is a Jasper. Do not use a drill
 or anything to make the wrong PSU fit as they won't be able to properly supply the required power. I'm not sure if you were or not but by PSU I am reffering to the power brick, if you have looked up for a 150W PSU you may of found a PC PSU.</p>

<p>Derp yea I forgot about that but if you still have a functioning zepher unit I am impressed as they had some seriously bad overheating problems but as I best remember aloft these psu's operate in constant voltage/current source mode operation so a zepher
 will work for any if the models just be careful with non-licensed hardware as it can use lower quality components /less power regulation and could potentially fry your 360

Contact eMachines for how to do it.<br />
Each Manufacturer has their own particular&nbsp;Recovery Process.<br />
It is their Recovery Software/Process, not Microsoft's.<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option to automatically import contacts on Mail app is not yet available at the moment unless, you're using an&nbsp; Exchange account. What we can offer you for now is to<strong> sign in to your Microsoft account</strong> and go to the
<strong>People app</strong>. (<em>Take note that you need to use the internet version of People app</em>). Click this
<a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link.</strong></a><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>From there, go to "<strong>Manage</strong>" click the drop-down menu and select
<strong>Export contacts</strong>. Once "<strong>Export contacts</strong>" has been selected, you can now export them all to a csv file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, just let us know.</p>

</p><p>I really want this issue resolved!!&nbsp; I set up a new computer and transported "my stuff" from old to new computer.&nbsp; Everything is fine except the people app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my business contacts were exported to&nbsp; Windows Mail.&nbsp; But when I go to People there are no contacts, so modifying them is impossible.</p>

<p>No, I cannot.&nbsp; We have tried everything and will just re-enter all contacts one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems strange that the contacts are available in Mail but not in People since People is the source of contacts for Mail.</p>

    <title>computer freezes up regularily - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derotser  say:</h3>
<h2>            computer freezes up regularily</h2>
                    <p>There are two types of "freezing up" that I encounter, and please keep in my mind when this happens, I lose all control. Keyboard does nothing. The only option I have is to hold in the on/off button and restart the computer.</p>
<p>One freeze up is when I get the blue screen where it says "Your PC&nbsp;ran into a problem and needs to restart. Were just collecting some error info and we'll restart for you". Well, it never restarts. The only keyboard combo I've tried is "ctrl+alt+del" and
 nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other freeze up I encounter is my screen goes black, and if I am listening to music,&nbsp;the music stops and it&nbsp;is replaced with a loud humming. When it happens and there is no music playing I do not get that humming noise. The screen stays black as I hit
 keys. Sometimes, the screen goes black then comes back, then goes black, and comes back. But most times it stays black and I have to hold the power button in.</p>
<p>I've had a computer guy do a virus scan, and I there are no virus or malware present. The only issue I can share with you, is that after updates with windows 10, I got a dialogue box telling me that my AMD Radeon graphics driver update is not compatible.
 There was an automatic download and install but I got a prompt telling me that this update is not compatible.&nbsp;Compatible with what? Is there a chance that my graphics card needs to be replaced?</p>
<p>I am at a loss as to what info I need to provide about my computer.</p>

<p>The next time I have probs I will take pics and record what I do. Thanks for any help offered.</p>

            I did what you recommended. I will reply by the 24th in the event nothing happens between then and now. In the "disable enable" section in the&nbsp;task manager, I saw&nbsp;the program that was automatically downloaded, and after the attempted install, received
 a dialogue box saying this program is incompatible. - "Catalyst Control Center"&nbsp;.This coincides with all the problems with my computer. I'm not sure what Catalyst Control Center is, but I do remember seeing that prior to the problems I am having. Thanks for
 your help and I will keep you posted on how my computer functions.

            <p>My computer just froze up, the screen went black and I had to hold in the&nbsp;on/off button to get it going.
</p>
<p>After the computer restarted the "Store" started working again, and what I mean by that, is that when I am in the store looking at games to download, they are always is queue, they never download. After my computer restarted, I got the prompt that told me
 Backgammon was just installed.</p>
<p>Also, after I completed what you first recommended, a Windows Defender dialogue box appeared and&nbsp;it automatically performed a "quick" scan. Prior to the scan starting, a yellow yield sign was in the corner of this dialogue box and when the scan was finished
 it was replaced with a green outline around the entire box. I never turned off Windows Defender nor has my Internet Security from Cogeco Cable turned it off.</p>
<p>The windows store has not worked properly in months. I select a game or app to download from the store, and it never downloads right away. I can't remember if there is a link between my computer freeze ups and the store downloading afterwards. I have read
 about the time/date/region settings interfering with windows store, and when I enter the true values for these, Cortina stops working. Country is listed as United States but I am in Canada. Language is English United States and I did chose English Canada.
 I like using Cortina so I left it alone. When I did select the correct language and Country, the downloading for the language was always is queue, it would not download automatically. Once I selected "ON" for automatic time zone and it kept changing the time
 so it was an hour behind.</p>
<p>It seems the more I type here the more I am remembering about problems I have/had. I do not know enough to know if these are all related to the same type/kind of problem or if it's a cluster of problems.</p>
<p>Again, I want to thank-you for reading this and offering any help. I hope I am being specific enough to help you determine possible causes but not too specific to insult your intelligence, know what I mean?</p>

<p>I am not able to restore to my previous version of windows. I tried the "restore your PC" option.&nbsp; After it reached 100% complete the screen was black with that clockwise swirly thing-a-ma-jig spinning in circles. It did that for two hours before I had to
 hold in the off/off button again. I turned it on again and I was stuck at that same screen again so I had to hold in the on/off button again. I let the computer sit for awhile and then when I turned it on, a message on the screen said it was undoing all the
 changes. All together this took about 5-6 hours.</p>
<p>It seems the last thing for me to do is reinstall windows 10 again, and hope. Not only would I lose EVERYTHING I downloaded and paid for, to be told to reinstall everything again is me spending way too much time and effort on a program that seems to be riddled
 with issues for the common home user. </p>
<p>I want to thank-you for you help but at this point right now, I feel the best thing for me to do is tolerate the issues I do have with windows 10. When I reinstall anything it will be for my new mac when I can afford a new computer.</p>

    <title>Skype Account Does Not Display Contacts, Recent, or Skype Credit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Account Does Not Display Contacts, Recent, or Skype Credit Balance. Behaving as New Account. Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after purchasing a new computer I have signed into the Skype desktop app. However, upon login none of my contacts are displayed. Additionally, none of my recent conversations are displayed. Worst of all my $$ balance is showing as $0.00 when it should be
 ~$20.00. It looks as if Skype is recognizing my profile/account as a new user, rather than a returning user. I tried signing in via the website, thinking perhaps it was an app issue. The behavior was the same in both the app and website.&nbsp;What can I do to bring
 my account back to what it was before upgrading computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the description, it seems you are facing issues downloading Apps from Windows Store.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To assist you better I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message / code?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you logged into a Microsoft Live account or a Local account?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps and check,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you are logged into a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to use the wired connection and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
<b>Make sure that the date and time are correct on the computer.</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Check the setting for Date/Time by choosing the Desktop tile and then left click on the date/time in the corner.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on change date and time settings. And then verify the time zone is correct as well as the internet time tab has the option
 to Synchronize with Internet time server.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: What to do if you have problems with an app.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run
<b>Apps troubleshooter </b>(It is in the above given link).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Reset Windows Store cache</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type <b>"Wsreset.exe"</b> and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Note:</b> When you reset Windows store, all the apps in the windows store will get refreshed.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 4:
</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:
</span>Perform Clean Boot.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known
 as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important</span></b><b><span>:
 Reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
 After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span></span></span><span>Press the

<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Disable third-party Security Software</span></b></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>On your Computer screen Task Bar next to System Clock..</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You will see the third-party Security Software Icon.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer
 against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or
 a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 5: I would suggest you to check in new Microsoft account.</span></b></p>

I have a similar problem.<br />
I use a wifi router from BT. This allows other users to use the FON network.<br />
If I connect to my private router WIFI network, I have no access to Windows Store<br />
If I connect via the public FON network - I get full access.<br />
<br />
Same router - Same laptop - Different wfi networks one open one encrypted.<br />

Any ideas<br />

    <title>Poss bug in gamertag change script on Gold family plans - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mraughur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poss bug in gamertag change script on Gold family plans</h2>
                    
<p>I have an Live Gold Family account, and my 8 year old son&nbsp;(TommyTurtle) &nbsp;wanted to change his gamertag to something a bit "cooler". We logged into Live using his user account, and proceeded through the screens until we hit the point where it needed to charge
 the 800&nbsp;points. There were no points on his account, and only 160 on mine. When I attempted to add points, the XBox informed us that his account couldn't do it, so I hit the Guide button and quickly swapped the active signin to my own account. I then charged
 my card and added 800 points to the account.</p>
<p>After charging the card, we clicked the button to complete the name change transaction. There were MULTIPLE people in the room, and everyone saw the same thing. It clearly showed my SONS gamertag (TommyTurtle)&nbsp;on the screen, along with a confirmation that
 we would be changing it to Zombi3sRTasty. My gamertag was never used or displayed anywhere in the gamertag change workflow. I confirmed, and it charged the 800 points. Unfortunately, it did NOT apply the name to his account, as the screen stated, but to MY
 account, which was the one signed in. This is clearly a bug (I've been a software developer for 19 years and even worked for Microsoft in the late 1990's, so I know what a bug is). The software apparently was displaying the screen information&nbsp;from the name
 change session that we had started while using one account, but actually applied it to the then-active account instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already contacted phone support and they weren't very helpful. I requested that they either correct the gamertags and apply the new name to the correct profile (restoring my original name), or refund me 1600 Microsoft points so that I can change my
 own gamertag back, and change his gamertag to what I actually paid for. They refused to help me, and actually recommended that I call my credit card company and do a chargeback for the points purchase (which still puts me $10 in the hole...while that would
 refund the money I've currently spent on the change I didn't want, I would still&nbsp;have to buy&nbsp;ANOTHER 800 points to set my own gamertag back to what it was supposed to be).&nbsp; As of right now, I have spent 800 Microsoft points and have TWO&nbsp;profiles that need
 to be fixed. His didn't get the change we&nbsp;paid for, and mine got a&nbsp;change I never requested.</p>
<p>Is a credit card chargeback really the only solution here? I just want the names to reflect the change I paid for, and that was displayed on the confirmation screen. There HAS to be a better way to straighten this out!</p>

<p>from the sounds of it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what you did is incorrect which is why you got the result you got</p>
<p>1st and foremost</p>
<p>child accounts on family plans cannot have a creditcard thats what the master account is for</p>
<p>2nd from the sounds of it you purchased the 800 ms points for the gamertag from the creditcard</p>
<p>thats not a bug</p>
<p>you just werent reading what you were doing</p>
<p>a child account cannot charge anything to the parental account including ms points for gamertag</p>
<p>thats not how family plan works</p>
<p>the only way to get 800mspoints for a family member on the family plan is not direct purchase</p>
<p>the primary account must purchase 800ms points and then allowance to the child account and you apply the gamertag change</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you do not buy the gamertag change directly from the card from his account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>only the primary account can have a creditcard on it any other account will have their creditcard info deleted upon joining the family plan</p>
<p>a child account cannot make a gamertag change without 800 ms points since they cannot buy using their parents account</p>
<p>the primary must purchase the 800ms points then allowance it to the child account then the gamertag gets changed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if a child account in a family plan tries to make a purchase it will say no payment method or not enough ms points if there is no ms points</p>
<p>&nbsp;im going to gather this is most likely the case</p>

<p>after you allowance the ms points to the child</p>
<p>you sign into the child account then ask for a gamertag change</p>
<p>then the 800ms points get deducted</p>

<p>No, you apparently can't tell me what happened. We proceeded through the "Change Gamertag" workflow using my sons XBL gamertag. We were logged in as HIM. When we hit the screen where it informed us that he couldn't add points, I hit the Guide button, signed
 him out, and signed in using my own gamertag. That did NOT terminate the Change Gamertag workflow. I was able to directly add the credits using my signin, while still inside of his Change Gamertag workflow. When the credits were added, the software allowed
 me to complete his workflow, which still claimed that we were changing HIS gamertag (It recognized that I was the logged in user, but still showed his gamertag as the one to be changed). When I applied it, however, the change actually applied to my account,
 and not the one displayed onscreen during the confirmation. I didn't "misread" anything...there were several of us in the room, and we all saw the same thing.
</p>
<p>This is a fairly classic software bug. The user ID changed mid-workflow, and the software didn't catch the change and display it properly on screen. If the Change Gamertag functionality applies the gamertag to the logged in user, then it SHOULD have displayed
 MY gamertag on the confirmation screen. If it applies the gamertag to the user who started the process, then it SHOULD have applied the new name to HIS account. Either of those outcomes would have been acceptable, but that's not what the software did. Instead,
 it displayed HIS gamertag on the screen, and applied the changes to MY profile. That's a software bug and not user error.

<p>Oh, and the fact that I "could have" assigned points to his account doesn't change the fact that this is a bug. If the developers intended that points be assigned to family pack users via the Allowance functionality, then their software should NOT permit
 someone to simply switch their ID mid-workflow, without a single message or warning, to add points this way. If this doesn't work, the software shouldn't allow it AND offer up confirmation windows erroneously suggesting that it's completing properly.
</p>
<p>From my perspective, there was nothing wrong with anything I did. The software informed me that I couldn't perform a task while logged in as User X, so I changed to User Y to finish it. The screen told me that I was still updating User X's account, so I
 had no reason to question it. &nbsp;If there was an alternate way that I SHOULD have been doing it, then the software should have offered some sort of message saying so. Instead, the software confirmed that it was doing one thing, and then did something completely
 different.</p>

<p>thats not how xbox live works</p>
<p>you cannot be signed into two accounts at the same time on the account management</p>
<p>the gamertag screen change does not transfer between accounts</p>
<p>you cannot purchase the gamertag change from his account</p>
<p>you must goto your account purchase the 800 ms points</p>
<p>there is no workflow this is not computer science</p>
<p>this isn't a graph</p>
<p>you can only be in one account and make account changes on one account from one controller</p>
<p>you would have to click on your controller and sign in on the primary</p>
<p>then purchase the ms points</p>
<p>then allowance the account</p>
<p>then you can either sign out and sign into his account or on his controller click the guide button and sign into his&nbsp;own account&nbsp;and then goto account management to perform the gamertag change</p>
<p>either way it still requires you to sign out</p>

<p>Nope, that's the bug. If you are logged into a sub account and make it all the way to the billing screen in the Change Gamertag workflow, hitting the Guide button and logging out/logging in as another &nbsp;user does NOT boot you out of the Change Gamertag workflow.
 It SHOULD do that, but it does not.&nbsp;It keeps you in the same spot instead of returning you to the home screen, which means that you ARE technically connected to two different accounts. In my case, it didn't even take me away from the Add Points screen...the
 screen simply went from being disabled to being fully functional. This is why I called it a "bug". The software
<em>shouldn't</em> do that, but it did anyway.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, this has now been resolved. I contacted another support number and they were able to verify what I was telling them. I was then connected to Billing support, who refunded me 1600 Microsoft Points so that I could make two more gamertag
 changes to the account. I was able to revert my gamertag to its original, and change my sons to the new one. Presumably this has also been logged internally as a bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and it absolutely IS computer science! Underneath those glitzy graphics, it's all just a collection of stacks, sessions, and logical workflows. In this case, I apparently found&nbsp;a spot where, if you poke just right, those sessions and workflows go out
 of sync. Bugs happen and, since Microsoft made it right, I'm not upset about it at all. I've programmed long enough to know that all the unit testing in the world won't prevent the occasional bug from leaking out, expecially when your users utilize your software
 in unpredictable ways (I'm assuming that not many people change their signed in profiles while on the Add Microsoft Points screen in the Change Gamertag workflow).</p>

<p>you dont know how xbox works</p>
<p>a child account does not have a billing option as only the primary is allowed to have it</p>
<p>if you did then your in the wrong account..</p>
<p>gamertag changes do not carry over</p>
<p>when another account intiates it.</p>
<p>you have to sign into the account management to add a payment method</p>
<p>by your own post wouldnt you think it is funny if you hsd to reenter the same gamertag change</p>
<p>no because it is a different screen</p>
<p>the social part of the dashboard displays all names on the dashboard</p>
<p>there is no changing names from a different profile</p>
<p>you need to be signed in</p>
<p>to add a payment method you need to be signed into the primary</p>
<p>you cannot add it to a second</p>
<p>you need to sign out and I even did it on another profile</p>
<p>and it didnt affect any other profile</p>
<p>only one account can be signed into the account management screen and be controling the dashboard ata time</p>
<p>that would be player one</p>
<p>you cannot both press guide it is one or the other</p>
<p>that is not a bug</p>
<p>you need to pay attention to what you are doing</p>
<p>in order to controll another profile it cannot be done from one controller</p>
<p>you would have to switch to the other controller or sign out on controller one and sign in you cannkt control 2 profiles at the same time</p>
<p>and believe me you would know if you sign &nbsp;out or switch controllers</p>
<p>that would be where you made your mistake</p>

<p>I don't know why you're insisting on arguing this point when XBox support has already confirmed that I am correct.
</p>
<p>You seem to be off on two important details here. First, you don't have to sign into account management to add funds to an account. Any time you attempt to purchase something via the console and have insufficient funds at checkout time, there is an option
 that says "Add Microsoft Points". That option is present even when you're on a sub account. If you actually try to click on it while logged into a sub account, it gives you a message saying that only the primary account can add points.</p>
<p>Second, you don't have to go back to the Dashboard to change the signed in user. You can do it directly from the Guide. There is no "starting over" required.</p>
<p>You can try this yourself if you have a Family account on your XBox and insufficient points to do a gamertag change. Login to one of your XBL accounts, pop up the Guide, go to Profile, and go through the Change Gamertag screens. Pick your new gamertag and
 try to continue. Because you don't have enough Microsoft Points, it will display the confirmation screen showing both the new and the old gamertags, the number of Microsoft Points required, and the number available on your account. When you hit this spot,
 you will also see the "Add Microsoft Points" button at the bottom. Click the Guide button, hit X to log out your current XBL account, and hit X again to signin with one of your other XBL accounts. Hit B to clear the Guide box after the signin finishes.</p>
<p>You'll see that you're still staring at the Change Gamertag confirmation screen, and that it STILL shows the original gamertag that you just signed out of. Even though you have changed the active account, the XBox dumps you back to the same screen you just
 left, with the same data showing on the confirmation screen. If you switched to a primary account, you can also now hit the Add Microsoft Points button to charge up your account.</p>
<p>The screens will continue to show the gamertag of the user you signed out, even after adding Microsoft Points and completing the gamertag change. The screen will SHOW the gamertag for the previous user and claim that you're changing the gamertag for that
 user, but it will actually APPLY the change to the account you're currently signed in with. It says one thing, and then does another.</p>
<p>Try it yourself if you really don't believe me. I just fired up my 360 and gave it another shot just to make sure. Signed in using sub, swapped to primary on gamertag chage confirmation screen to enable the Add Microsoft Points button, and verified that
 it's still showing the previous users gamertag on the confirmation screen after switching users.</p>
<p>So yes, that is a bug.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Error&#58; System ignores default sound setting&#59; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> partner4wellbeing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Error&#58; System ignores default sound setting&#59; reverts to built-in speakers</h2>
                    <p>Anybody know how to fix this? Restarting the computer usually helps, but this is annoying. The reason I am sure this is a system problem with Windows 10 is that, when this happens, and I go to my playback/speaker settings, I can not configure/reconfigure
 my settings nor even see the option of the external speaker system I use. I never had this problem with Windows 8 or 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:

The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code 39 means that Windows cannot load the device driver for your hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. To resolve this problem, we suggest that you refer to this

<h2>            What will not run properly without VCRUNTIME140.dII&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every Windows10 update brings problems like this. Unlike others who post problems, my desktop and my HP laptop still are usable. Microsoft is going to see a massive exodus to Mac products when our PCs are no longer functional because of these Windows10 updates.
 My question is why I should have to do anything to remove the VCRUNTIME140.dll message? If I X out of the popup, my laptop works fine. What&nbsp; will not run properly without this app? How about the next Windows 10 upgrade just delete the popup?</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is using bridging on your laptop instead, if you are using ICS that won't help with your NAT issue:-</p>

What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. If you aren't logged on as an administrator, you can change only settings that apply to your user account, and some event logs might not be accessible.</p>
<p>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur,<span>Windows</span> records the event in an event log that
 you can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with<span>Windows</span> and other programs.</p>
<p>Event Viewer tracks information in several different logs. <span>Windows</span> Logs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Application (program) events.</span> Events are classified as <span>error</span> ,<span>warning</span> , or
<span>information</span> , depending on the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem, such as loss of data. A warning is an event that isn't necessarily significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information event describes
 the successful operation of a program, driver, or service.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Security-related events.</span> These events are called <span>audits</span> and are described as successful or failed depending on the event, such as whether a user trying to log on to<span>Windows</span> was successful.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Setup events.</span> Computers that are configured as domain controllers will have additional logs displayed here.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>System events.</span> System events are logged by <span>Windows</span> and<span>Windows</span> system services, and are classified as error, warning, or information.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Forwarded events.</span> These events are forwarded to this log by other computers.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Applications and Services Logs vary. They include separate logs about the programs that run on your computer, as well as more detailed logs that pertain to specific<span>Windows</span> services.</p>

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>I have newly acquired the Asus N551JK, which comes with a mSATA slot, (precisely a
<em>half-size mSATA, </em>hence 25mm; correct me if I'm wrong). So I was wondering if I could put a 128Gb SSD in it and use it as boot, not only as caching, so can I install Windows on it? And secondly, what SSD brand or model would you recommend me, for approximately
 90 Euros?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Is there a fix for Cast To not working in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Before the Windows 10 upgrade "play to" worked fine with all devices.&nbsp; Now with Windows 10, I'm getting "no devices found" mostly.&nbsp; But on the rare occasion that a&nbsp;device is&nbsp;found (after multiple attempts), it does not transfer and says the server is not
 available.&nbsp; Network map shows that all devices are available.&nbsp;

            <p>I had the same problem. Cast To was not working on Windows 10 although it was working good in Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Following solution helped me out</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Control Panel --&gt; Go to Home group ---&gt; Start media sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Windows Media Player ---&gt; Stream --&gt; Automatically allow Device to Play my media</p>

            Sorry for the late answer, but I&nbsp;recently experienced the exact same problems as you described and&nbsp;on the off chance that this wasn't fixed yet, disabling TCP/IPv6 for your network adapter (Control Panel-&gt;Network and Internet-&gt;Network Connections) worked
 immediately. Hope this saves anyone the evening of trial and error I just had.

            <p>This one vexed me for months but I finally found it.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open up&nbsp;<code>chrome://flags/#media-router</code>,
 it should say&nbsp;<strong>Media Router Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS:</strong>&nbsp;<em>Enables Chrome to access external presentation-type displays and use them for presenting
 web content. #media-router</em></li><li>Change it from&nbsp;<code>Default</code>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<code>Disabled</code></li><li>Restart chromium-browser</li><li>Install Google Cast extension if necessary</li></ol>
