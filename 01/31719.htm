<h2>            Button Monitor stopped working</h2>
                    I am getting the error message "Button Monitor stopped working." <br />
This is a GATEWAY computer, not a Dell.<br />

How do I fix it?<br />

<p><span>Hello Jhonson,<br />
</span><span><br />
</span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista community forums!</span></p>
<p><span>How long have you had this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Button Monitor is a utility for the button on top of the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>You&nbsp; will have to visit Gateway website to download and reinstall the application for it to work properly again.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.gateway.com/support/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.gateway.com/support/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>However,
</span><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue resolved:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
6. Check if you still have the issue.<br />
<br />

Reset the computer to start as usual After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> , type
<span>msconfig.exe</span> in the<strong><span> Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click the
<strong><span>Normal Startup</span></strong> option, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></p>

    <title>hyperlinks in my emails suddenly display as plain text&#59; not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edkozoyed  say:</h3>
<h2>            hyperlinks in my emails suddenly display as plain text&#59; not active&#47;non clickable</h2>
                    <p>For years, <span>I've sent article &amp; video titles and their corresponding weblinks through my email (AOL / Yahoo)
</span></p>
<p><span>ANY</span> full URLs that I had saved and then copied and pasted into emails would automatically transform into hyperlinks once sent.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Suddenly, last week,&nbsp; this automatic function quit working.&nbsp; NOW, web links are displayed as plain text even after
</span><span>I send them.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Even links copied/pasted directly from the address bar and sent via email&nbsp; do not transform to hyperlinks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have proofed this by sending weblinks to myself via AOL/Yahoo email accounts, and via Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.</span></p>
<p><span>I now seem to be forced into enabling only one-link-at-a-time by typing/pasting the name of the article in the top field;</span></p>
<p><span>and the corresponding web address in the lower field of the&nbsp; "insert hyperlink box" . &nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>This one-at-a-time hyperlink process is just not acceptable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I simply want to copy/paste lists of articles / web addresses sent in hyperlink form as it has worked for years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e.&nbsp; (if I send these, below, they all show as plain text;&nbsp; nothing active, nothing clickable)</p>

<p>But not now,&nbsp; older emails in my inbox and sent mail (once active) are now plain text.&nbsp; No, blue, no underline, not clickable.</p>
<p>??&nbsp; Does anyone know how to fix this?? &nbsp; I've been on with AOL tech support for hours;&nbsp; They don't know.</p>

<p>Thank you for answering.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can probably tell that we're older (being on AOL).&nbsp; </p>
<p>We came a little late to all the tech / computer/ internet/phone stuff.</p>
<p>But, when we did AOL seemed to be the way to go then.</p>
<p>We've never seemed to have much trouble until now.</p>
<p>You're right though, we probably should go to a gmail account </p>
<p>or something.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Thank you again.</p>

            Dear Vijay Verma,<br />
uhh~~ not sure about being configured in Outlook.&nbsp; We don't use Outlook, but tried to see<br />
if it would copy/paste/hyperlink multiple web addresses at once.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband made a new<br />
account in Outlook, but it didn't work either.<br />
<br />
We've had AOL for many years, usually having their program in our computer.<br />
However,&nbsp; when we bought a new desktop (Lenovo) a few years ago,&nbsp; we didn't want to<br />
load the whole AOL program into the computer.&nbsp; So, we accessed our account&nbsp; via<br />
FireFox or MSEdge.<br />
<br />
Last week, when this&nbsp; problem suddenly came up, I was on with tech support (2 AOL techs)<br />
for a couple of hours.&nbsp; The could not find the problem even after taking-over our computer<br />
with some Bomgar (sp?) program.&nbsp; When they finally thought the problem might be from the<br />
way we were accessing AOL,&nbsp; the second tech convinced me into loading their Desktop Gold.
<br />
Unfortunately, that didn't solve the problem.<br />
<br />
Here's some particulars:<br />
<br />
Windows 10<br />
Microsoft Edge 42.17134.1.0<br />
Microsoft EdgeHTML 17.17134<br />
FireFox=&nbsp; 62.0 (64 bit) (but think it updated on 09-05-18 )<br />
XFinity- service<br />
<br />
I've tried many experiments (AOL email to ourselves;&nbsp; to Yahoo,&nbsp; Yahoo to AOL;&nbsp; both ways to<br />
friends;&nbsp; copy/ paste to Word first, then out to AOL email) Also weird,&nbsp; is that links in my sent and<br />
saved mail that "were once hyperlinks",&nbsp; now show up as plain test too. <br />
<br />
I've tried to research as much as I could; but we're not all that tech savvy.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've unchecked<br />
"Hide images in mail from unknown senders"&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; "Disable links in mail from unknown senders"
<br />
(AOL settings).&nbsp; My husband tried a system restore.<br />
<br />
I've tried to research:&nbsp; enabling hyperlinks, copy/paste,&nbsp; HTML formatting,&nbsp; native copy url,<br />
configure auto format, reset browser security settings, keyboard shortcuts (controlV) IMAP (?),<br />
Turning a batch of text URL’s into hyperlinks.&nbsp; Started looking into new e-mail services and add ons:<br />
Thunderbird, K-9, Copy Link Text,&nbsp; CopyURL+,&nbsp; Copy Page Title and URL, Create Link (Chrome)<br />
CoLT (unfortunately not for our version), Install older version of FireFox,....................................<br />
I've really tried to figure this out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>It's been almost 2 months since your initial post! Got it resolved finally? How? Care to share?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just noticed my PC with Win 7 is having the same issue (non-clickable links in emails). I have been looking for a solution for days to no avail. Very frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For testing, I sent AOL mails with links to my AOL and other email addresses. I noticed that the links can be opened with my Gmail address but not my AOL and Yahoo addresses. Also, there seems no issues to AOL friends with Windows 10. Not sure why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intend to keep looking for answers. Will update if any luck!</p>

<p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp; If you ever find the answer, please respond again.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I talked to 2 AOL techs for over 2 hours. I even let them take over remotely.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>They were absolutely NO help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For some strange reason when I initially posted the problem here, 2 people answered
</p>
<p>and when I went to answer the second person, I couldn't get back in to my own question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So I never got to thank the 2nd person for at least trying to help me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>What irritates me the most is that we're older, not all that computer savvy, and have the
</p>
<p>type of AOL account which we pay for to insure tech support!</p>
<p>Never had a problem like this.&nbsp; It always recognized internet addresses and automatically hyperlinked them for me in anything I sent.&nbsp; (even a list of websites)</p>

<p><span>When composing a new email to insert a hyperlink into the body of the message, you have to click on the&nbsp;</span><strong>Hyper-Link</strong><span>&nbsp;icon in the Compose window as shown below:&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fdl-mail.aolmail.com%2fws%2fdownload%2fmailboxes%2f%40.id%3d%3dVjN-kBUrBJ5ph8pDsNpVv4S0MFTm8hd1l0q9wkVZMxAMlNYGeL39sbkoXqFt-pJ151XYGH4nkLovJSeSm65J69qU1w%2fmessages%2f%40.id%3d%3dAPf3dupwjVsJW7vu2AALuAdg2rA%2fcontent%2fparts%2f%40.id%3d%3d2%2fraw%3fappid%3daolwebmail%26amp%3bymreqid%3d322dec5b-0264-0e17-2f0f-37013a010000%26amp%3btoken%3dzitEzqOML3j84e6ealFTT5U7-km5qEQF52lp7AcCuBaX6sNDH0DfQbC3UYOimXaYiXIPhZ_f2-U4TVskpVeN8AZ4vf2xuSheoW36knXnVdgYfieQui8lJ5Kbrknr2pTX" width="600" /></p>

<p>Might have a solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, I'm not sure if you are still working this problem but I too have been extremely frustrated by the non-hyperlinked urls copied and pasted into emails. I just didn't have time to troubleshoot a fix until tonight. Furthermore a hyperlink search was
 useless but a url AOL search today finally got me here to your question page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And after a little homework, I might have accidentally stumbled onto a solution that is working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In AOL mail I went into the OPTIONS pull down menu and selected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MAIL SETTINGS</p>
<p>
</p><p>This landed me in GENERAL SETTINGS. Under READING I selected and checked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ENABLE READABILITY MODE</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SAVE SETTINGS</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked. All my URLs are hyperlink active again and I've tested several emails, new and old with the urls and they are now working as before. I'm OK with the larger more readable fonts as an effect of this setting but others may need to get used to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 theories on why this solution worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Any General Settings change/save procedure shakes loose the hyperlink capability for some reason or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Changing and Saving the Enable Readability Mode was THE specific catalyst that fixed the hyperlink issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know why it's working but I'm OK with the result. Troubling that AOL tech support couldn't/didn't know how to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it works for you. Good Luck</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can't thank you enough. Hope the original poster&nbsp;<span>Sue Kozoyed and others with a similar concern find their way here to enjoy your wonderful discovery!</span></p>
<p>By the way, if the 'bigger fonts' bothers you, try press-n-hold the 'Ctrl key' and then press the "+" key (or the "-" key) which will increase (or decrease) the size to what you are used to. Give it a try.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What do you mean when you say "The power button doesn't seem to turn it off such that the blue light stops flashing"? Does it mean that after shutting down your computer mouse doesn't shut down.</li><li>Did you make any recent changes (Hardware or Software) on your computer?</li><li>Was it working fine before? If yes from how many days you are facing the issue?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In order to fix the issue you may try the troubleshooting steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

<h3> grandjury07  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox won&#8217;t connect to TV&#47;Screen</h2>
                    <p>Decided to set up my Xbox one again, as i previously used it (it worked fine) but i disconnected because it was taking up space. I plugged in the power cord and into an outlet, and connected my HDMI cords from the console to the HDTV. I flip to the HDMI channel that should display the xbox, and when i turn on the console nothing happens. the screen remains a bright blue&nbsp;saying “no signal.” I decided to leave the xbox on, while watchingn tv on&nbsp;another HDMI channel, and when i returned&nbsp;to the channel that should display the xbox screen, something was actually on it. A screen with an error code and two options reading “Restart this Xbox” and “Troubleshoot.” I tried to click one but the controller (connected to the xbox by charging cord to ensure that it was connected) would not work or click any options. i searched up the error code and did what the forum told me to, it was not successful. Anyone else having this problem, or anyone know how to fix it?</p>

            <p>Try turning the Xbox One off at the plug and then on, then hold the eject and power buttons, you should hear a chime keep holding until you hear the second chime. Then you should see an image in 480p with reset image options. Go into settings and set the image options back to how you want them. Hope this helps!</p>

            thank you for your reply... but if it is at all possible would rather try some other means of locating "Defragment and Optimising Drives" first rather than going for Restore point...… would be worried that I might lose some of my files etc.,

<br />Click your Start Button, then just type cmd

<br />From the resulting list, right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Paste this command at the Command Prompt and hit Enter
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />When that completes, paste this command at the Command Prompt and hit Enter
<br />
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />That command will take time to complete, when it does, close Command Prompt, then restart (not shut down) your PC . . .

    <title>My Surface Book 2 thinks it is detached when it isn&#39;t. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dandiego235  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Surface Book 2 thinks it is detached when it isn&#39;t.</h2>
                    My Surface Book 2 that I got 2 months ago has started to have issues on detaching and attaching the Clipboard. When it is attached, it says "Detached" and "Ready to Detach". My Surface has a Geforce GTX 1050 GPU, so when this happens, the surface doesn't
 recognize it. It shows the GTX when I press "Show hidden devices" in Task Manager, and it says that the device is not connected, even when the Clipboard and Keyboard are attached. The problem is fixed when I detach and reattach the Clipboard, but sometimes
 the Clipboard doesn't even detach. It only detaches when I press the button on the keyboard, and it flashes a green light for a few seconds. It is also very inconvenient to do it every time the Surface boots up because the problem reappears every time it turns
 on. This is my second Surface Book 2 that has had the same problem. I had to return the first one.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Detaching/attaching problems with your Surface Clipboard can be caused by dirt, or by software or driver-related issues. Can you tell us more about the steps you've done to troubleshoot the problem? Here's a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023472/surface-troubleshoot-your-surface-book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for troubleshooting steps that you can perform to address clipboard issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. The SDT resolves common Surface problems and it takes 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer depending on your internet connection speed and on the repairs that
 the tool needs to do to fix the problems. Click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to run the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this helps, and keep us updated on this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I'm experiencing the same issue as Dandiego235. I have a new 15" Surfacebook 2. In order to get the Nvidia GPU to work, I have to remove and reattach the screen. I've noticed it stops recognizing the Nvidia after finishing a game or after leaving the computer
 alone for a while. This is the case even though I don't remove the clipboard/screen. I haven't found a distinct pattern yet as to why this happens. I have tried the suggestions to run Surface diagnostic tools and even clean the contacts between the keyboard
 and clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem is software related. The device driver is disconnecting the Nvidia GPU when it shouldn't be. I hope an update will be released soon to fix this problem. In the meantime, we'll have to keep disconnecting and reconnecting the clipboard
 to get the Nvida to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to any suggestions anyone has and hope for a fix soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Thank you for getting back to us. It seems that there's a possibility that the detach controller have an error. To isolate the issue, we suggest that you put the device into
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026206/windows-get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a></strong> then
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">perform a clean boot</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
While you're conducting a clean boot, there's a section that you will go to the <strong>
Startup</strong> tab in <strong>Task Manager</strong>. Once you are there, look for the
<em><strong>'Surface DTX</strong></em>' service then select it and press <strong>
Disable</strong>. Once you have restarted the device, go the the <strong>Task Manager</strong> again then re-Enable the
<em><strong>'Surface DTX</strong></em>' service. After that, restart the device the second time around.<br />
<br />
Keep us posted on the outcome.

<p>It didn't work. Now, when I attach it again, it doesn't show the NVidia control panel. Is this a software problem? How is it possible that in two different Surface Book 2s, I have had the same problem?</p>

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have tried several steps to isolate the problem. To get more details, can you check the current Windows version and OS build of the device? You can go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About&nbsp;</strong>to find this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further check if this is a software problem, let's perform a two-button reset. This process will reload the drivers and software on your Surface to allow the device to communicate properly with the keyboard. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switch off your Surface.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button simultaneously for at least 15 seconds. It may enter the Surface UEFI. Wait until the screen goes off before releasing both buttons.</li><li>Switch on your Surface normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I'll look forward to your update.</p>

            Hello! I have done what you said. When I turned it on after the two-button reset, the detach icon says "Surface Detach: Hardware Failure". It doesn't show the GPU again.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I does find it in Device Manager, but it didn't show the NVidia Control Panel. I installed new drivers, and for the moment, I think it is fixed. It shows the control panel and the GPU works. I haven't turned it off just in case the issue starts again.</p>

<p>I was experiencing the same issue. The green sign "attached" would appear randomly. No suggestions (like cleaning the keyboard contacts, disabling/enabling Surface DTX service, etc.) would help. It was driving me mad and I was at the point of returning my
 Surface Book 2. As a last resort, I tried reinstalling Windows 10 completely. And voila, all the problems are gone! I suggest you doing the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: After a few Windows updates, it's back! Now I know it's a software issue. Going to reinstall Windows again and block Windows Update service. Thanks you Microsoft!</p>

<h2>            cdrom driver for hp pavilion dv2615nr</h2>
                    I have a pop out internet cdrom tray. It worked fine in windows vista but never seemed to work right with 7. The cdrom.inf file talks about some "mitsumi" driver or something? I've tried EVERYTHING I can find to get this working. sfc, drivers updated.
 CD/DVD doesn't show up in device manager but it does in the BIOS as "ATAPI CDROM" I'm chasing my head here trying to figure out if something got corrupted along the way or what... I made sure all the files are in the right places, and even added the subkey
 Microsoft suggested and still nothing. Please help! HP Pavilion DV2615nr Windows 7 Home Premium.

<p>How many files are there on the disk in question?&nbsp; If you are trying to run this within the Windows environment I suggest that you run it in the Native environment instead (before the Windows session starts)... and be prepared to wait!&nbsp; With millions of
 files chkdsk could run for DAYS...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you open a file on the volume chkdsk will ask you if you want to dismount the volume, if you answer no it will then ask you if you want to schedule a chkdsk when the computer restarts.&nbsp; You cannot cancel a chkdsk in progress unless you press and hold
 the power button and doing so may damage the file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you must absolutely run chkdsk from the Windows environment, (are you running it in the read only mode?)&nbsp; you can increase the user address space with the use of the boot.ini /3gb switch... but I'm not sure that will help.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the additional
 user space comes at the expense of the system space.</p>

    <title>Harmony 880 remote and Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Harmony 880 remote and Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have been going crazy to get my Logitech Harmony 880 remote to work on windows 8.1. &nbsp;The remote shows it's connected to USB, but when I run the Logitech harmony software the software doesn't detect the remote. &nbsp;I've tried different USB ports, different
 cables. &nbsp;I've uninstalled and re installed the software, I've ran the software in other compatibility modes and no luck. &nbsp;I've disabled AV and firewall as well and no luck. &nbsp;This worked previously on Windows 8 and Windows 7.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My remote is now useless as I can't update the settings or add new devices or activities.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>what worked for me:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harmony Remote Software was open, trying to write to the remote but couldnt detect it.</p>
<p>Leave it open, go to Devices and Printers on Configuration screen, you will find a Unknown Device Harmony Remote 0-4,4,2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Delete it.</p>
<p>Disconnect the Remote from the USB cable.</p>
<p>Reconnect the Remote.</p>
<p>Windows finds the same unknown device.</p>
<p>Open Harmony Remote software and click try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange work-around, I know, but it works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Logitech and Microsoft will work out a better, more permanent solution.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Reinstall Microsoft Store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> comatoselaptop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Reinstall Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p>So basically, despite trying everything short of reinstalling Windows, I no longer have Microsoft Store on my Windows 10 computer. It's not that I just can't open it, it's completely gone from my computer, and no PowerShell command I've found has been able
 to restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MY SPECS</span></p>
<div>Windows edition: Windows 10 Home</div>
<div>Manufacturer: ASUSTek Computer Inc.</div>
<div>Model: G751JL</div>
<div>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz &nbsp; 2.59 GHz</div>
<div>Installed memory (RAM): 8.00 GB</div>
<div>System tupe: 64-but Operating System, x64-based processor</div>
<div>
<p>Pen and Touch: Touch Support with 10 Touch Points</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THE LONG TRAGIC STORY OF WHAT HAPPENED</span></p>
<p>I noticed that on my taskbar there was a blank space where Slack used to be. Clicking on it yielded no response, so ultimately I decided to take the uninstall/reinstall approach to it. Right-clicking on the app in the Start menu and clicking "Uninstall"
 did nothing, but finally it seemed to be gone once I restarted my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to the Microsoft Store to reinstall Slack, but once it downloaded, it said something unexpected happened and gave me the following error code:&nbsp;<strong>0x87AF010A</strong>&nbsp; As I tried to fix this, one of the suggestions was to make sure the time
 and region settings were correct. I recently moved from the US to the UK, so my laptop still had the United States set as its region, so I changed it to United Kingdom. Makes sense that might've been messing with it what with dollars to pounds and whatnot.
 But still nothing happened, so I tried the next suggested method: resetting the Store app, based on the following instructions:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-apps-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-apps-in-windows-10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But now clicking on the Microsoft Store app did absolutely nothing. So then I updated Windows, but once I logged back on, the Store was gone completely. I couldn't even find it in the Start Menu. I tried running&nbsp;<strong>wsreset.exe&nbsp;</strong>in
<strong>Run</strong> (Windows + R), but after a blank terminal window opened for ten seconds, a popup said,
<strong>"You’ll need a new app to open this ms-windows-store"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I found this thread:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/youll-need-a-new-app-to-open-this-ms-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/youll-need-a-new-app-to-open-this-ms-windows-store</a></p>
<p>Putting the first code into PowerShell gives me this:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6, Package could not be registered.</p>

<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Finally, I made a new local account, where the Microsoft Store works perfectly well! So I tried to copy the relevant files over to my original account, giving Full Access to the C:\Program Files\WindowsApps folder to both users
 in the process - one suggested solution was to copy that folder on the working account and paste it into the account with the missing Store, but with all my Permissions finagling, I couldn't get the files to copy to a flash drive (or, my Android phone anyway,
 which was the closest to a flash drive I had on hand).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is there a solution that won't require me to reinstall everything on my computer?</p>

            Either way using a new account or rebuilding windows will lead to reinstalling apps and reconfigure everything.
<br />When i do this i take everything from c:\users\myoldfolder and copy that to c:\users\mynewfolder.
<br />
<br />Some apps you will need to reinstall if they are not set for everyone.
<br />But some you might see them in the new account when you search for them.
<br />Check that before you reinstall your apps.

<h2>            Xbox 360 Backwards Compatibility </h2>
                    
<p>Hi There guys. I am rather sad to find out the Sims Bustin' Out isn't compatible with the 360? &nbsp;I have read a few reports and faq's on the net and found that this game is extremely popular and there are a lot of people including me that would love to play
 this game again</p>

<p>Isn't there maybe some way some sort of patch we can download onto our consoles to make this game work again. Because I just got it a few weeks ago, not knowing that it wouldn't work. Most of us grew up playing this game and we would really love to be able
 to play it once again on these consoles</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
<p>I hope you can maybe help us out here</p>

<p>No. Microsoft ditched backwards compatibility in 2007. The 360 can't even emulate the games that work now properly.

<h2>            BioShock Infinite Ringtones</h2>
                    
<p>The audio team at Irrational is an inspiring crew, creating emotions and subtle tones out of thin air. While many of our fans have heard some of the iconic songs, there’s also a number of reoccurring tones and themes that occur via specific actions in-game.
 Since <em>BioShock Infinite</em>’s release, we’ve seen much praise from our fans regarding the soundtrack and subtle interludes, but one request has been popping up time and time again, and we’re here to deliver with a few custom ringtones taken straight from
 the game. Inside the downloadable .zip below, you’ll find the following five tones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Songbird Tune </li><li>Songbird Call </li><li>Lovers Inflamed </li><li>Value Appreciation </li><li>Salt Machine Tone </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have two more ringtones available exclusively <a href="http://majornelson.com/2013/04/26/bioshock-infinite-sounds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
via Major Nelson</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Step On Up </li><li>New Objective </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re looking at potentially creating another batch of these as well, so if you have any specific requests, post a comment below and let us know. Please note that we generally cannot use specific songs from the game or in-game voices for ringtones.</p>

<p>Pretty cool!!</p>
<p>Course, it's not hard to make your own from any sound-bites in Infinite.</p>

    <title>System becomes unresponsive after the recent installation of Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougday011  say:</h3>
<h2>            System becomes unresponsive after the recent installation of Windows 8 pro &#40;Dual Boot&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: "Maintenance In Progress" - Windows 8 Unresponsive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>????Anyone know the convention on this forum for closing a question/marking complete when you've answered it yourself????</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: The description below is perhaps verbose. For a full understanding of the issue you may want to read it, but I am providing a workable partial solution that should be much more succinct.&nbsp;You may want to scroll down and start with that&nbsp;instead.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed Windows 8 Pro. Began having problems with System becoming frozen/non-responsive almost immediately. The problem would occur with video or if the computer was left unused (or not given any input)&nbsp;for 10 minutes or so. Basically any program that
 is open will begin to register as "Not Responding". The mouse cursor will go to the "loading" spinning circle and slowly over about a minute nothing will respond anymore until I power off/on. This cycle often causes a disk check to be necessary (which tells
 us something substantial is happening when I shut down).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After days of fiddling with the issues I determined there were likely several things causing my system to be unstable. The new Win8 video drivers supplied by Nvidia appear to be problematic and there is a problem with "automatic system maintenance" causing
 this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I removed my Window 8 partition, re-installed Windows 8 Pro, allowed no updates of any kind, and installed no programs. Within minutes I had my first system freeze just as described above. The common denominator each time is that the Action Center icon in
 the taskbar shows "Maintenance in progress".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot see what the maintenance is because the system wont respond. I attempted to turn off "Automatic System Maintenance" but that is not possible (nice).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I run the Automatic System Maintenance manually my system will crash and stop responding as described previously. The System Maintenance troubleshooter says there are no problems detected (in admin mode).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can find no decent documentation about this feature and what exactly it is doing. There is no discernable way to figure out what is wrong. No KB articles I can find, no articles here that show any solutions, nothing. I have checked my Event Viewer and
 haven't found anything of use excepting critical reports where I have manually shut down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 8 dual booted with Windows 7 on seperate partitions of the same HD. I have considered cleaning it all off and installing only Windows 8 but its annoying to have to tweak around with several guesses and re-installations in order to bug test
 this situation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at my wits end. I have serious reservations about this OS and I am trying to learn how it works but I don't have time to be a beta tester for MS on this product. I have come within a hairs breath of abandoning Windows 8 on a couple of occasions. The
 only thing that is making me give this one more try is I want to look at developing for Windows 8 apps and I need it to work. It takes enough time to setup a new build and start becoming productive with a new OS without having to troubleshoot what seem to
 be clear mfg defects before I can begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to proceed to correct this problem or how to properly document and report it to a MS channel that may be able to come up with a resolution? I have no more time to waste on an OS that I cannot be productive with. This is why I usually
 refuse to be an early adopter. I'm guessing this OS will be so much better after the 1st SP release.</p>
<p>**Addendum</p>
<p>Running Windows 8 in safe mode does not crash. Of course the System Maintenance does not run in Safe Mode, nor can it manually be started.</p>

            <p>Praveen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for stepping up to begin the troubleshooting process. I began down a troubleshooting path on my own yesterday and believe I have solved my problems with Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had planned to post my solution and thanks to all who had taken the time to read my plea/gripe/whine but I wanted to get several steps into the process and give adequate time to make sure the issues did not creep back at some point. Then I got tired and
 went to bed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll add a reply letting anyone else know what may be going on. I also may see if I can change the title to more fully reflect the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doug Day</p>

            <p><strong>Solution listed below:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First let me just thank all those who have taken the time to look at this post. I appreciate your attention. I'm following up in hopes of helping anyone else who may experience this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll just post the solution then a few additional items if anyone wants to go that far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HD Partitioned into 3 originally. System Reserved (100 mb), a partition for Win7 and a partition for Win8. Both OSs were clean installs from last week. I don't remember which one I installed 1st but I suspect it was Win7 due to the size of the "System Reserved"
 partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removed all partitions. Created a 250G partition for Win8 and installed again (System Reserved partition created at 350mb this time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long and short of it is that was it. Windows 8 works fine now. I was fairly slow and methodical and nothing is giving me any problems what-so-ever. I am still trying to decide what strategy of "dual boot" to take and I don't know exactly what was going wrong.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a plan with some flexibility to take into consideration the unknowns regarding how the System Reserved partition may be affected and I'll see what happens&nbsp;from here. The basic plan is simple. Create another partition for Win7. Leave enough space for
 a System Reserved partition to be created if it wants and see what happens when I install Win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>I'm torn about leaving this post/issue open until I successfully complete with a "dual boot" OR call this fixed and if I have other issues open a new question and post a link to this?!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>******Additional Information (the process)&nbsp;some may or may not be interested****</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System (it is kind of old but far from slow or tired):</p>
<p>HP xw8400 - 2 x Xeon 5140 - 16GB Ram</p>
<p>Nvidia Geoforce GTX 250 - 1 GB Graphics Card</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed Windows 8 as stand-alone OS choosing custom install and turned off all options for the OS to initially install updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially only operation was to allow the machine to sit idle until it went to sleep then hibernated. Woke fine. Let sit another 4 hours to see if "Maintenance" would kick on and start any problems. No maintenance, no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran "Automatic Maintenance" manually. Process completed in approximately 20 minutes without issues. Tested using other apps and OS features while in progress without issue.</p>
<p>NOTE: I still have no idea exactly what is going on in this process. I have an idea but...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tested IE10 with flash (long, short, full screen, etc). No problems, same with Chrome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed initial 5 Windows Updates. 1 for flash in IE10, 1 for video driver update, a couple were unspecified Windows updates and a Windows Defender definition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System continues to function in all areas as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still don't know what will happen with my "dual boot" experience. I would guess it will go much better with the plan outlined above but who knows? I have an extra HD I use for backup and I have considered installing Win7 and Win8 on separate HD but there
 are 2 main drawbacks to that:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the event of a HD fail I'd prefer to have my backup separate from my working drive for what I think are pretty obvious reasons.</li><li>Dual booting on separate HD will make the boot up process much less convenient for switching between OSs.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>********************** Dual Boot Follow Up***********************</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dual booted with Windows 7 per above. Both OSs working fine still. I haven't had a single hiccup in either one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best I can surmise is that when dual booting starting with Windows 7 creates issues that the Windows 8 installer is unable to cope with. I'm not about to re-install everything again just to try to duplicate that (as I said I'm not interested in beta testing).
 It may prove to be wrong or right its just the best logical guess I can come up with out of the circumstances, but as we all know with computers that could be a trap and assumptions are often big mistakes.</p>

            I have this problem, but I don't believe it has anything to do with partitions. I've upgraded from Windows 7 on my Dell Studio XPS (i5, 6gb ram, 1tb hd).&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Every day at seemingly random times I'll return to the computer and find it's frozen. I can move the mouse cursor and can see the flag icon on the task bar has a notification reading "Maintenance in Progress" however I can't see what it's doing, no programs
 will open or close including task manager. Start button does nothing, nor does &nbsp;any key combo like ctrl+alt+del.
<div><br />
<div>I have only a single partition plus an external hard drive where documents and a couple of programs are installed.</div>

            I am having the same issue with "maintenance in progress"/Automatic Maintenance. I have not figured out how to turn off Automatic Maintenance entirely. So every other day I get the "maintenance in progress" icon in the taskbar and only certain programs
 slow down or freeze. What's weird is that the Automatic Maintenance is scheduled to run at 3am, but it runs in fact in the middle of the day.
<div><br />
<div>I'm with&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4c0c86b4-a9b5-4fa7-9415-d09b8aae93aa">ChrisMoore77</a>&nbsp;and I don't think this issue is related to having other&nbsp;partitions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What I have noticed:</div>
<div><br />
<div>-MS Word has crashed at least once during "maintenance in progress"</div>
<div>-Windows Explorer becomes slow</div>
<div>-Task Manager opens, but does not actually display anything but a white window and it becomes unresponsive.</div>
<div>-Opening Action Center and trying to "stop maintenance in progress" does not actually stop it.</div>
<div>-"maintenance in progress" never actually completes, I have to force shut down (holding power button until power is cut off)</div>
<div>-Google Chrome is operational and I have no issues browsing the web. No apparent slow down with Chrome.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Without Task Manager working during "maintenance in progress" it is difficult for me to find out what exactly "maintenance in progress" is doing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am running:</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Windows 8 Pro upgrade straight from microsoft, no other partitions.</div>
<div>-Laptop is an Asus Zenbook UX31E (i5 sandy bridge, 4gb ram, 128gb SSD)</div>
<div>-Asus has provided up to date drivers and I've had no issues with such.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Additional Information:</div>
<div><br />
<div>-One more issue I've encountered with Windows 8 has been with shut down/ restart behavior. Very often, when I would shut down the computer, I would get a black screen after "shutting down" screen and laptop would never actually shut down (activity lights
 on). I'd have to force shut down by holding the power button. What was strange was that up powering up I would not get any "windows was shut down improperly" error. Windows would start just fine. SOLUTION: so far what has worked was turning off "fast start
 up" on power options. After turning this setting OFF I have not had issues with the laptop hanging after shut down or restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope we can find&nbsp;</div>

            <p>This message is for both ChrisMoore77 and Ili-22.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above did fix my issue but I don't really know why as I stated and I can only muddy the waters a bit with some new information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had everything working perfectly for a few weeks and I decided to delete all my partitions and start again. This time after re-installing Windows 8 as before I did one thing different than the time it worked (I didn't really think about it until later).
 I kept all the defaults during installation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point I was back to my same old problem. System Maintenance would freeze the system. You can't turn off System Maintenance sorry to say. I also had a new problem... I was experiencing problems with the Windows Update as per the now infamous issue
 many have had. On top of that if I was stubborn with Windows Updates I could make partial progress but they would crash or freeze during the reboot. I was pretty much irate at this point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I calmed down I torched the partitions and started over once again. This time to maintain some control I took the same steps during installation I used when I previously had success. I used the "Custom Install" options and I turned off anything to
 do with updates and pretty much everything it offered. After installation was complete I ran System Maintenance and it worked properly. I was able to do Windows Updates and turn on automatic settings for that (although I don't let it install them automatically).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't do this thinking it was a magic fix. I did it to have more granular control over the installation experience. I can't say it was the actual "fix". All I can do is report to you what I experienced and the steps I took that worked out for me in the
 end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't actually believe my issues had anything to do with partitions at this point either. I would guess it has something to do with drivers and perhaps the order in which they are installed or otherwise handled. Who knows?</p>

            I just gave up and reinstalled 7. Without having a touch screen the upgrade seems pointless anyway. And ads on Minesweeper made me see red.

            <p>I've had a similar issue.&nbsp; I just installed Windows 8 Pro in a multi-boot scenario where I now have four partitions, Win7Pro x86, Win7 Pro x64, and now Win 8 Pro x64, plus an additional partition where I store my downloads and other data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing Windows 8 Pro I've noticed that my machine just powers down after a few minutes, about 20-30 minutes for no reason.&nbsp; I suspect it was something going on with Windows Update re-booting, except that it just shuts down, or actually hibernates,
 because it comes back up in Windows 8 without the Multi-boot prompt.&nbsp; If I shut the computer down and start it back up the multi-boot selection comes up fine.&nbsp; I've turned off the automatic updates to force a prompt, didn't help.&nbsp; I've just gone through the
 advanced power settings and set up things like I like them.&nbsp; It hasn't shut down yet, but I'm waiting for it to happen soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way I'm really enjoying Windows 8 so far except for this glitch.&nbsp;&nbsp;After about an hour of playing around with it I found the Desktop tile and now I feel like I'm in familiar territory.&nbsp; I'm learning to set up the tiles like I want and I think this
 is a better visual experience than Win7's start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm getting this posted before I crash, but I'll be back to follow up soon.</p>

            <p>I still haven't crashed again, perhaps the changing the power settings helped.&nbsp; I need to give a little more info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an external monitor connected and I keep my laptop closed most of the time except when I'm mobile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an HP tx2120us tablet PC, one of those with the swivel screens that turns into a tablet.&nbsp; It has a single touch "touch" screen and also stylus input.&nbsp; I use it most of the time with an external keyboard and trackball, no touchscreen or stylus.&nbsp; In
 spite of HP stopping support on this model at Vista (I refuse to buy another HP because of the lack of support and poor engineering on this unit that cost me over $1200 new.)&nbsp; I have managed to be able to upgrade to Win 7 and now Win 8.&nbsp; It actually works
 pretty good in Win 8 with a dual core mobile AMD Turion processor and just the single touch screen.&nbsp; I tried Win 8 Preview and was surprised how well MS did in recognizing everything on this "tablet."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue I am having now is that the video drivers are not up to speed, limited to 1024x768 instead of the&nbsp;native 1280x800 on the&nbsp;laptop display or 1920x1080 on my external display with the NVidia GeForce 6150 GPU.&nbsp; This computer has died from overheating
 in the past, but was brought back to life with a re-balling and new heat shims put in place.&nbsp; I used Avon PCPitStop in Avon, New York to do this and they did a great job.&nbsp; I also have two HP dv9000s (given to me by a friend from work), one is an Intel and
 the other is an AMD unit&nbsp;with the same problems of overheating.&nbsp; One of these has died twice, but was brought back to life both times by Avon PCPitStop.&nbsp; One of the dv9000s used the same NVidia chipset and the other uses an Intel chipset.&nbsp; The Intel unit died
 a second time because&nbsp;of a local tech who replaced broken hinges and thought the upgrade was done improperly and so undid the changes&nbsp;and the machine failed again shortly after leaving his shop.&nbsp; Obviously he was the one who didn't understand why the changes
 were needed.&nbsp; (The shop owners have been friends for about 20 years and this was their son who was the technician, so I haven't jumped all over him as I would have someone else.)&nbsp;&nbsp;All three machines have been performing admirably since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmm, I just realized that my shutdown problem might have due to overheating on this tx2120us&nbsp;laptop.&nbsp; That would explain the unexpected shutdowns.&nbsp; With the new Win 8 installation I was seeing high CPU usage, so I might have had an overheating problem.&nbsp;
 I will start monitoring that now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enough for now!</p>

<p>Hi Yodio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no record or history of the purchase in your <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account's order history</a> then the transaction was not completed&nbsp;&nbsp;and there was a possible error in the process causing Epic to not be able to apply the currency into your Fortnite account because they are responsible for that and not Microsoft. The Microsoft
 store is just the platform where you buy the V-bucks but that is the virtual currency that they have control over since they sell V-bucks on every platform the game is available on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the money was drawn from your bank account but the transaction did not complete, then the money should be credited back automatically by your bank institution which you should call ask and about the transaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest also getting in contact with Xbox customer support so they can go over your account with you:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</span></a></p>

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>j'ai acheté la bd "Batman arkham city" qui contenait le jeu "batman arkham city".</p>
<p>Pour sauvegarder je dois me connecter sur "Windows live for game" en entrant une clé produit.</p>
<p>Malheureusement, ni sur le cd ni dans la bd il n'y a de cle produit.</p>
<p>Pourriez vous, s'il vous plait, me donner une solution pour que je puisse profiter pleinement de mon nouveau jeu.</p>
<p>Merci.</p>
<p>Bien cordialement.</p>

            <p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you are unable to install the Windows updates, it seems the update service on the system is facing corruption. I suggest you to try running the Update troubleshooter
 to check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Update.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Refer these steps:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + X,</strong> select <strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>
view by</strong> option on the top right to Large icons.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong> and click on the view all option on the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Run the <strong>
Windows&nbsp;Update troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>
</span></span></span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> the system and check if the issue is resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Method 1 doesn’t help try resetting the update components.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for the steps to
<strong>manually reset the Update components</strong> and check if it helps<strong>.</strong></span></p>

            <p>Ok.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>And another thing.&nbsp; On reading the steps in manually resetting the Windows Update Components, I read that step 11 would tell you to install the latest Windows Update Agent.</p>
<p>But this would be assuming your Windows Update Program is already working well, right?</p>
<p>So can this be done after you restart the computer?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            error 0x00000050</h2>
                    
<p>Iam trying the fix for this error. When I type:<br />
<span>ren %systemroot%\inf\INF file name from Step 5&lt;/var&gt;.inf *inf.old</span><br />
<span>ren %systemroot%\inf\INF file name from Step 5&lt;/var&gt;.inf *inf.old</span><br />
<span>ren %systemroot%\inf\INF file name from Step 5&lt;/var&gt;.pnf *pnf.old<br />
<span>ren %systemroot%\inf\INF file name from Step 5&lt;/var&gt;.pnf *pnf.old<br />
at the command prompt, I get a syntax error. Should the command prompt be: C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator.Glenna&gt;</span></p>

            i'm not sure where who you are getting instrauctions from but you haven't replied to the original thread. anyways from the looks of things you are simply trying to rename all the files to .old<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
rather than doing that way first navigate to that directory by entereing the following commands:<br />
<br />
cd \<br />
cd windows<br />
cd inf<br />
<br />
ren somthing.inf somthing.inf.old<br />
<br />
<br />
another tip for you:<br />
when you press the TAB key it will automatically try to spell the filename out for you. that way you can't make any spelling errors.<br />
<br />
i think thats what you are trying to achieve ... good luck<br />

<h2>            Programs not responding in Windows Vista.  Computer freezes.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron laptop with Windows Vista.&nbsp; All of a sudden I started having issues with windows.&nbsp; After windows opens, I start getting messages saying that certain programs are not responding (Windows Sidebar, HP CUE, EULALauncher, etc) When I try
 to open Internet Explorer I get the same message... basically nothing works, the computer freezes and I have to shut it down. Below is what I have tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can open it in Safe Mode and it seems to work ok.&nbsp; </li><li>I tried doing a Clean Boot, but I had the same issues.&nbsp; </li><li>I thought maybe it was because of the Sidebar so I deleted the settings.ini file.. that didn't work.&nbsp;
</li><li>The last two things I installed on the computer were Malewarebytes and Vista SP2.&nbsp; I did not have any problems after installing them.. but since those were the last changes, I uninstalled both but that did not resolve the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>I tried to do a System File Check (sfc/scannow).. but it got to 56% complete and then nothing happened.. it stayed at 56% complete for about 8-10 hours.. so I just shut the computer down.&nbsp;
</li><li>I can't do the system recovery because I don't think I had it turned on so I have no points in time to go back to.&nbsp;
</li><li>I did run Malewarebytes before uninstalling it and it did not find anything.&nbsp; My anti virus software is Trend Micro PC-cillin which is running.. but I do need to update my subscription so I can get the latest updates.. unfortunately I cannot do that now.<br />
<br />
Because of my limited knowledge I am afraid to do anything more to my computer.. I don't want to make the situation worse.&nbsp; I don't know if I have a virus or some other problem (corrupt file?).&nbsp; Any help woulg be greatly appreciated!!!!
</li></ul>
