<p>They r right, u need to research the facility then hire them. The only problem I have is that my zoo is @ the half mark for capacity. I hired five 3 star janitors and five 3 star zookeepers. there is trash everywhere, put more trash cans up but that made
 it worse. I would see the keepers just walking around with there brooms over there shoulders. So I just jumped in my buggy and emptied the trash cans myself.</p>

    <title>Why am I receiving an nVidia driver update to my nVidia GeForce 8800 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why am I receiving an nVidia driver update to my nVidia GeForce 8800 GTS video card in Microsoft Updates &#34;Important&#34; section&#63;</h2>
                    When I checked the updates that came down on November 13, among the important updates was one to my nVidia video card. The update was named "nVidia - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2, Other hardware: nVidia GeForce 8800 GTS". Why am I
 getting this in the "Important" updates? There is no mention of a security issue in the description. I have Vista SP2 32-bit.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Usually, Windows Update check for updates not only for Windows components, but also for other softwares/drivers as well. Here, Windows Update found an update for your display device. The description of the update is given by the manufacurer/developer as
 an important update, so it is classified as an important update. As it is an important update, it may include a security update or a solution to a vulnerability issue you may not have experienced or driver update, apart from software update.</p>
<p>Being a third party software, description may be brief, but apply the update as recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
        </p>

The error is due to Windows side-by-side (Winsxs)&nbsp;configuration error. You can contact nVidia support for this issue.

            <p>I've also had problems with Windows Vista Updates for nVidia in the past. I didn't install the nVidia update because I wanted to check nVidia&nbsp;control panel&nbsp;first for updates. I do have a driver update showing dated October 10th that has not been installed
 on my machine yet.</p>
<p>Could that be the problem with the Windows Update?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the&nbsp;driver need to be installed first before nVidia WDDM1.1??</p>
<p>What is WDDM1.1?&nbsp; Is it a Windows&nbsp;program for my graphics card or a nVidia program?</p>

My drivers for my 8800GT is/was version 182.50. I&nbsp; do not game on my pc&nbsp;&amp; when i took a new final update drivers from nVidia years ago it messed up my CyberLink PowerDVD Blu ray performance so i stayed with 182.50.&nbsp;Why is it Microsoft adds this update for nVidia,&nbsp;believes
 what may be the issue is with the update then does not offer the fix but tells you to go to&nbsp;nVidia to try to fix the issues caused by it? Had i known it was not&nbsp;a OS related update for Vista i would have not taken the update either. Now i am stuck with trying
 to get a fix from a 3rd party source who is not in the business of making&nbsp;a OS or&nbsp;updates. Thanks alot Microsoft!&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I work in a medium sized University IT department and received this update. Unfortunately we didnt have a WSUS in place to filter out updates (especially "important" ones).
<br />
<br />
The resulting updated driver broke nearly all of our staff workstations (100+) which required our IT team to manually roll back individual computers on Monday. Needless to say this was very time intensive and a great majority of our staff were not able to work
 for a few hours. <br />
<br />
The root of the problem was faulty firmware on the video card. I realize that this isnt completely Microsoft's fault, they probably didnt know that such a niche existed. But I would highly advise NOT classifying driver updates in the future as "Important" and
 keep them optional unless there's a serious security or functionality problem (which there wasn't). Automatically (classified as "important") including something as critical to functionality as a driver update is unacceptable.
<br />
<br />
We now have our WSUS up and running thankfully and are blocking all driver updates to our client machines. This should not happen again.
<br />
<br />
We have 8400GS equipped HP DC78000s for most of our staff machines. <br />

            <p>Took me a while also to figure out the cause of my PC's untimely death. As I have a mission critical workstation to support several hundred users and off site locations.</p>
<p>In fact it took me two or three days to restore due to the errors behavior and investigating the issue.
</p>
<p>This is not acceptable service, support or responce from Microsoft, Also in light of the history of Microsofts
<em>pushing out updates</em> and recommending <em>autoupdateing</em> the problem is compounded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft if you want ot know why your falling behind and people and companies are looking for alterantive software to your products. This is a prime example! Not one person in this discussion is a Microsoft Support person that expresses any consern in the
 issue, nor has the update been pulled back after so many reported issues.</p>
<p>Nivida your not off the hook either!</p>

                    <p>Several years ago I purchased Flight Simulator X Gold Edition which includes 2 DVD's and the acceleration Expansion Pack. Now I wish to load it on my new Windows 10 laptop which does not have a DVD drive.

<p>Please provide link that allows me to access FSX so that I may activate using the Product Keys on each of my DVD's. Hopefully the same access will enable me to load MS Combat Simulator and MS Train Simulator.

            Just further to your switch over to a laptop with Win10: &nbsp; laptops are not renowned for giving good performance with FSX unless your specs are quite high or you are running FSX in its vanilla state (i.e. without demanding add ons). &nbsp; Since you have not
 given those specs., I just thought to remind you.

<h2>            Can&#39;t change Windows 7 Region and Language format</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, I am having a problem here to change the format in the Region and Language tab. Hmm to be more specific, my current format is English(UK) and I want to change it to Japanese(ie). Initially everything is fine but once i try to apply settings,
 the format will revert back into English(UK) and I have no idea what to do. Any clue for cause of such? Oh and after some tests I realize only few formats such as English and Chinese can be applied.</p>

<h2>            DirectX Un-installing Issues.</h2>
                    Hey there,&nbsp;<br />
I have a problem with un-installing DirectX.<br />
So, the time after I reinstalled Windows 7 on my laptop, I started installing things which are required to run things, for example games.<br />
-As for games, DirectX is something which is needed.<br />
I installed DirectX Jun 2010's SDK, (it had DirectX with it, so I went ahead to install it)<br />
Now after some months after the installation, I've come across a point in which some programs aren't working.<br />
-I've been suggested to reinstall a few programs, such as DirectX, Visual C++, Microsoft .NET Framework cause any of their's .dll files may be corrupted or missing.<br />
I went ahead to trigger the uninstall of the DirectX SDK, with coming across the error which told me that
<br />
"<strong>Can't locate uninstallation file, Unable to proceed</strong>."<br />
I then went ahead to look for a solution for this on the internet, and one of the articles suggested me to install the DirectX SDK by downloading it again, and installing it again.<br />
While installing the DirectX SDK I was shown the S1023 DirectX SDK error, which isn't uncommon and it's known.<br />
And it was easy to fix it by removing the Visual C++ 2010 latest redistributable package, and then running the installation for the DirectX SDK again.&nbsp;<br />
And it worked out.<br />
After installing the DirectX SDK again, I triggered it's uninstalling from the Programs and Features, Uninstall a program entry.<br />
It gave me the prompt of the DirectX SDK being uninstalled.&nbsp;<br />
But when I went ahead to run a game, or check the system32 folder for the directX's files, they are there.<br />
Nothing is removed from the DirectX.<br />
I've tried to install the dxwebsetup, but it always tells me that the newer version of directX is detected on my system.<br />
And there's no entry in the Uninstall a program's list, just so that I could trigger the uninstallation of DirectX.<br />
<br />
There are files of the DirectX in the system32 folder, and a bit of registries in the Registry Editor.<br />
I'm not deleting any of these since I'm too afraid to do so.

<p>I extracted the directx_Jun2010_redist.exe<br />
And then I ran the DXSETUP.exe<br />
It installed successfully.<br />
I was expecting a entry in the Uninstall a program list, so that I can remove DirectX and install it again.</p>
<p>But I found nothing.<br />
Is there a way to manually remove DirectX, or trick the DirectX web installer to think that DirectX isn't already installed, just so that it can install DirectX, replace the .dll files and provide a entry in the Uninstall a program list?<br />
As you said, start from 2008, assuming you wanted me to firstly install the .net framework 3.5 SP1(since it came out in 2008) I downloaded it, but when I launched it, it gave me the error of it not being a valid Win32 application. So I continued to install
 the .net framework from 4.0 to 4.8, (4.7.2 failed).<br />
Thank you for any kind of further assistance.<br />

<p>Back up your data using one of the methods below. You cannot "extract" programs; they will need to be reinstalled from the installation CDs or installers downloaded from the Internet. Then test your hard drive before you do a clean install of Windows to
 make sure it isn't the underlying issue.</p>

</span></p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and the Windows files will be visible in Linux. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, there will be a Linux burning program to use.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com</a>

<div>I wonder how that other one turned out...</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are getting the same kind of error, you should always run chkdsk /r first - that may be all you need to do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then, MAYBE implement KB307545, but never just start with it.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?</div>
<div>(this includes plug pulling and power buttons)</div>
<div><br />
<div>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</div>
<div><br />
<div>It makes zero sense to start trying to copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and fixing that may resolve&nbsp;your issue entirely.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD, or create on a&nbsp;bootable XP Recovery Console CD.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;If&nbsp;you are not sure what kind of bootable CD you have, make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD&nbsp;and &nbsp;be sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD when no XP media is available by following</div>
<div>the directions in this link:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic276527.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic276527.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>After booting into the Recovery Console, you should be in this folder:</div>
<div><br />
<div>C:\WINDOWS</div>
<div><br />
<div>For each of your hard disk partitions, you should then run:</div>
<div><br />
<div>chkdsk /r</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example, from the Recovery Console prompt, enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>chkdsk c: /r</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long&nbsp;time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is&nbsp;</div>
<div>still flashing, it is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount to&nbsp;be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The chkdsk /r needs to complete without any errors, so you may need to run it&nbsp;multiple times until it does.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</div>

<p>If my information on data retrieval was over the OP's head, I doubt he's going to be happy with all that, either.</p>
<p>To "mwwise499" - Computers are powerful and complicated machines. I have never understood why people who have no hesitation about calling an electrician or an auto mechanic (and I certainly call those experts when I need to) think they somehow should be
 able to fix their own computers. Sometimes a computer problem can be easily solved by an unskilled user but very often it cannot. If what I and JoseIbarra have written is incomprehensible to you - and there's no reason to feel bad about that since we all have
 our areas of expertise - then take the computer to a reputable local professional. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.</p>

<p>KB307545 works properly if you "do it right".</p>
<p>Doing it right means following the directions exactly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When folks try it and say it doesn't work or they are getting some error it is either because their file system is corrupted or they are not following the directions.</p>
<p>The resoltution of these kinds of errors hardly ever requires the implmentation of KB307545, but KB307545 should still work (and it does). &nbsp;I will never offer a solution that just starts right off with KB30745. &nbsp;I don't think I have ever even recommended
 it to anyone.</p>
<p>KB307545 will never work (or trying some other things - try Safe Mode, try this, try that...) if the file system is corrupted. &nbsp;If the file system is corrupted, attempts to implement KB307545 will almost always fail miserably resulting in&nbsp;frustration&nbsp;and
 an&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;reinstall of XP (preceded by attempts at file salvaging) so starting with the KB should never be step 1.</p>
<p>KB307545 is indeed a good way to restore a registry that is really corrupted, but usually, you hardly ever have to go that far unless you corrupted it yourself. &nbsp;It is almost always something much easier.</p>
<p>KB307545 is popular because it is the first thing that comes up on a Google search for these common XP won't start messages, but tell me when you have seen a thread that starts with advice to implement KB307545 and has a happy ending... &nbsp;Solutions that start
 with KB307545 almost alwys quick&nbsp;deteriorate&nbsp;into a string of messages excahnges of things to try next, but never seem to end favorably for the OP.</p>
<p>Usually, the OP will not have any XP media and that is a requirement but it is never made clear, so the next few posts are "I don't have any CDs... my system did not come with any CDs, etc.</p>
<p>There just don't seem to be any happy endings when you start with KB307545 as the first solution. &nbsp;The message threads start running into 5, 10, 15+ messages and at that point, it is pretty much not worth reading anymore - it is out of control and hopeless.</p>
<p>If I can get you to boot into Recovery Console, your are almost done - even if you do need to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;KB307545. &nbsp;I don't know why that milestone of getting into RC is so elusive sometimes...</p>
<p>I have solved routine problems like this dozens of time (and so have you), but not by starting with KB307545, not with some Live CD, not with some external device, not moving the drive to another machine, no USB device - you have to be able to describe a
 method to solve it when none of these options are available. &nbsp;Certainly reinstalling XP is never an option no matter what, so you learn how to solve it without doing those things. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If people knew how to do all that stuff, chances are they would not be posting here for help in the first place. &nbsp;If they don't get Windows XP&nbsp;enough&nbsp;to fix these easy (for us) problems, they are not going to get Ubuntu, know how to bur an ISO image or know
 what a Live CD is either so I will never even bring things like that up. &nbsp;If XP is over their head and they need help, they sometimes will never get the other stuff.</p>
<p>I have purposely inflicted just about every XP won't boot situation - XP can't find it, missing or corrupt, hal.dll, NTLDR, \SYSTEM, whatever I can think of &nbsp;I can imagine on my system many, many times just do I can learn how to get my system running again
 with just a Recovery Console CD and nothing else (hence the how to make a Recovery Console CD article). &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go to a professional, they will just reinstall XP most of the time anyway (maybe the professionals don't know how to fix it either) - reinstall, repair, restore point, etc. not required for these kinds of problems.</p>

            I'm not sure if you're talking to me or the OP, but you know I don't disagree with you. I just was commenting that what is easy for techs to do isn't necessarily easy for laypeople to do and that if s/he can't do it, not to feel bad about that. Whether
 a pro will just reinstall Windows or not, I can't comment on that. I know *I* don't unless it is warranted. I don't think that every computer problem can be fixed easily or in a forum is all. I hope that clarifies my various replies in this thread.

<p>Hi all, getting the exact same results as the original post, cannot copy software file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Noted the recommendation above to use chkdsk c:/r and tried that. &nbsp;The command prompts chkdsk c:/r, chkdsk c: /r, and any combination did not work. &nbsp;I finally got a minimal result from "chkdsk c:" (volume appears fine, didn't check it) and a recommendation
 to use /p to check the volume anyway. &nbsp;So far, no variation I can think of has gone any further. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any more ideas on this subject?</p>

<p>Hey everyone. I made a new xbox account and i want to take advantage of that "stay gold now. Just 1 dollar" offer. They say its a limited time offer. How long does the offer last? but my real question is every time i try to enter my billing info such as
 my credit card number, address,..etc it says it cant retrieve info from xbox live. it also says please try again later. I've tried 10 hours ago and I just tried now. STILL THE SAME ERROR! it comes with a status code also. status code:80169D03.</p>
<p>Did anyone ever have this problem? What should I do?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>My netbook came with 1gb ram, xp, 15 gb ssd that is partioned into 2 8gb drives.&nbsp; Can I install windows 7 and have it create one 16gb drive?&nbsp; I ran the advisor and it say I need a minimum 16gb free space.</p>

            While installing, at the section where you are asked where to install go to Drive options (advanced) and delete the partitions you have. Leave the space unpartitioned and just highlight it as where you want to install.<br />
<br />
However, with only 15GB you will be able to do very little. There will be little space to install applications or store your data. I think you would be unwise to install Windows 7 on such a small disk.

                    <p>I have two Skype accounts and both of them are blocked. I have provided the information required and it still doesn't work. I have contacted Microsoft via chat 4 times and each time the Microsoft employee assured me that it would be fixed. Tracey, Napthali
 R. and Juan O. have promised me it would be turned over to the tech section to fix immediately. I have been trying for more than a month and still nothing. Skype has had problems ever since Microsoft took over. I used it trouble free for more than 10 years
 before.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a suggestion of how to get my accounts working again since Microsoft isn't doing it?</p>

            My sincere apologies. The people here will not be able to fix up issues associated with your account. You will need to work with Chat Support of Skype the way you had been working.
<br />
<br />Additionally, you can contact Microsoft Help -Here you get live agent support not virtual agent support. Use below option to reach out to Microsoft Support.
<br />
<br />By Phone - You can talk to support by picking up appropriate country

<p>I am struggling with an UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION in Windows 10. It started not long after I upgraded my Dell laptop to Windows 10 a few months ago, and continues even after reformatting my hard drive and installing a fresh copy. Sometimes it happens once
 or twice a day, and sometimes it's only once a week. It doesn't happen on my other computer which also has Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In searching for answers, i've concluded that it's best to post here since so many different things can cause it. I have the dump file that i can post later, which I've seen done in some cases, for analysis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Changing Product ID key after installing windows 7</h2>
                    I upgraded from windows vista to windows 7. However the Product ID key displayed in System Properties is my old key. I did try the change product key option so it would use my windows 7 key. The dialog box said that my activation was succesful but still
 the old product key is displayed and i can't use the contact micorsoft support option becuase of it.

            I'm confused. Are you saying the windows 7 product ID is the same as the Vista product ID? that doesn't seem possible. What is the exact message you get when you try to contact support..
<div><br />
<div>To help solve this please post a MGA diagnostic report and we will try to sort it out.</div>

<p>
<span>To properly analyze and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the diagnostic report produced by the MGADiag tool (download and save to desktop

<p>
<span>Once downloaded, run the tool.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Continue button, after a short time, the Continue button will change to a Copy button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your post.</span></p>

            EagleKeeperF15, you will have to check with your Flight Controller manufacturer to find out if they offer any drivers for Windows Vista, or maybe even testing ones designed for XP. Unfortunately Windows Vista no longer supports the gameport, thus compatibility
 is not guaranteed. If you desire, you may list your device make and model number and we can attempt to locate any available drivers for your device.

    <title>Windows Explorer - Cannot se network computers in Windows Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ingvarai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer - Cannot se network computers in Windows Explorer before I invoke &#34;See full map&#34; in Network and Sharing Center</h2>
                    <p>I have several compuers in a network, two Win 7, one Vista.</p>
<p>One of the machines cannot see the network computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem machine:</p>
<p>Windows 7 x64</p>
<p>Firewall turned off</p>
<p>Network discovery turned on<br />
</p>
<p>All machines:</p>
<p>All PCs belong to the same workgroup</p>
<p>All PCs have hte same subnet mask</p>
<p>Disabled virus apps on all</p>
<p>Can ping both ways<br />
<br />
On problem machine I can:</p>
<p>1) I type the address of one of the computers in the address field in explorer, like this:<br />
\\192.168.0.1 and press Enter. What happens now, is that this particular PC shows up under Network in Explorer, and I can access the shared folders on the remote PC. I can continue doing so the
 the rest of the network. But I see the numbers only, no computer names.<br />
<br />
2) I do the "Open Network and Sharing Center" from the tray, then click "See full map". All of a sudden, all remote PCs
<b>and</b> the host machine (itself) are listed under Network in Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, (2) solved it. It is like it should be. But am I supposed to do this all the time??? For every Windows session? On the other machines, there is no need for this extra effort. I must obviously have started something by doing "See full map". A service?
 Discover network is turned on. Can it be that a certain service still is not started at boot time?<br />
Any ideas about this are welcome! Especially if someone knows if there are some service(s) that I should check are tagged "Manual" when they should be "Automatic".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I would approch it this way:<br />
What registry settings could possibly cause this?<br />
What services are not started at boot time, that ought to run?<br />
<br />
I had this visurs attack, called "Windows 7 ativirus attack 2012" one year ago. And have had this problem a long time, but am not sure it is related to the virus attack. Yes, I have installed the repair tools from Microsoft, and Kaspersky Antivirus, but have
 a feeliong not everything is ok. <br />
</p>
<p>I am almost certain ther is a registry setting wrong, something is not started / working properly before I invoke "See full map".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Ingvar<br />

<p>I understand this topic is difficult to explain, and it is my fault using too many words. Your reply is good, but has little or nothing to do with my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question boils down to:</p>
<p>Why does Network -&gt; right click: Properties -&gt; <u>See full map</u> &nbsp;display the network computers correctly, when Explorer itself cannot do it initially after booting Windows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the question. I believe something is initially not running, something is flawed.</p>
<p>It ois a minor issue, yes. But my other Win 7 machines do not behave like this.</p>

<h2>            Hyper-v gone on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi all, <br />
<br />
I installed Windows 8.1 from the Store (64-Bit), I went to Programs and Features and meant to tick the "Hyper-V" box so it installs, but it didn't appear in that box at all.&nbsp; I am on the Official Build (downloaded from the Store app) of Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; After
 this, I went into my computers BIOS and made sure Virtualization was enabled. Shut down my computer completely, started it back up. Hyper-V still is not appearing.&nbsp; Then I checked for update (Windows Updates) and there was none.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please oh please, someone help me get Hyper-V.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            HI. I, too, have this issue. Yes, it IS supposed to be in the 'Turn Windows Features On and Off' but it is NOT. Can you confirm that under 8.1, the requirement is simply to have Virtualisation turned on in the BIOS and after that, Hyper-V should appear
 in the&nbsp;'Turn Windows Features On and Off' control panel ?? Or is there something else required to configure first.

            I suspect you work in management. What you said is technically correct. However, it has nothing helpful in your response. Not even a link. The correct answer, so I have found out is, I was sold a crock of s$$$. The laptop was sold as having Windows 8 Home
 Premium, of which there is no such version. It appears that I ACTUALLY have basic Windows 8, not Pro which is required for Hyper-V

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Well as most here I am a volunteer. And I did say if you have 8.1 Pro it would appear there.<br />
<br />
You are always better off getting support from the official support sites and venues. If we
<br />
start to answer technical questions that are not supported here and are supported elsewhere</p>
<p>where do we stop? And things change so we might not be as up-to-date with the best<br />
information to assist with your issues.<br />

<p>I was searching for it too.</p>
<p>So i started checking everything step by step. And then i noticed after the update tot windows 8.1 it was "degeraded' tot normal windows 8.1 instead of windows 8.1 pro. I then went to ad windows options in the contoll panel and there id entered the windows
 8.1 productcode. After 2 reboots i could install Hyper-v</p>

            You are right Hyper-V is not supported feature for Win 8.1 but only for Win 8.1 Pro. So you have to upgrade to Pro version if you want Hyper-V.

            Generally for home users there's no need for a VPN. They're nice to have for going out in public on a laptop or phone when you connect to open/unsecured networks, but if you're in your home and have a secure network, it's not really necessary.

<p>It's really up to you. If you have a use case that requires end-to-end encryption over the internet, a VPN is for you. A VPN is also for the paranoid, but you don't impress me that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do understand that there is nothing truly hidden on the internet, VPN or not. A VPN owner has lots of data about its customers that would be worth lots of money and, besides, how much do you really know about the people behind the VPN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end it comes down to what kind of person you are what you believe. There's no right or wrong answer.</p>

<h3> andrew pliml  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t install my sound drivers</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is about 8 years old with an Asus P4S800 motherboard and is running XP with SP3 and all the latest updates. A few days ago my sound card failed. I am trying to switch to my integrated sound and have gotten the driver for 2K/XP from Asus but I
 can't install it.</p>
<p>There's two .INF files in the directory but when I click on them they open in notepad and I'd like to install them as drivers. The Windows hardware application doesn't recognize any of it and the install program that came with it doesn't work - I already
 tried running it on a fresh installation of Windows, but that didn't help.</p>
<p>I imagine there's a way to manually install the drivers but I can't figure it out. If I can't get it I need to get a new sound card.</p>

<p>try installing it on this way...</p>
<p>1. open device manager. you may go to start &gt;&gt; run, type-in devmgmt.msc</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;look for your sound card, that would have the yellow punctuation mark since it dont have driver yet.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;right click it, choose "update driver" then browse where you saved your downloaded driver.</p>
<p>hope that it would help if not then try a tool that would automatically scan, download and install driver for your,<a href="http://xpdrivers.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows XP Driver</a>&nbsp;&lt;&lt; is what I use.</p>

            The fundamental problem appears to be that Windows isn't finding my onboard sound, which is why it doesn't show up in Device Manager. I tried your program and it doesn't find it either. Nevertheless I'm sure I have onboard sound because there are jacks
 for it on the computer.<br />

<p>Firstly, have you checked to see if the correct sound</p>
<p>and recording playback devices are selected in your</p>
<p>Sound and Audio devices control panel?&nbsp; With two</p>
<p>sound devices, you may have the wrong one selected</p>
<p>and thus no sound.</p>

<p>If you have installed the Asus P4S800 SoundMax <span>WHQL</span></p>
<p><span>v5.12.01.3665</span> Audio Software and driver (<a href="http://dlcdnas.asus.com/pub/ASUS/misc/audio/ad1888/WDM_3665.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found
 here</a> ), you</p>
<p>may want to remove the old sound card and reboot.&nbsp; Windows</p>
<p>will then select the only remaining audio device for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have <strong>not</strong> removed the old sound card, you will have</p>
<p>to go to the Sound and Audio Devices control panel and</p>
<p>select the embedded audio device.&nbsp; Once you've opened the</p>
<p>Sound and Audio control panel, click the "Audio" tab.</p>
<p>You will see "Sound playback", and "Sound recording" devices</p>
<p>in the displayed panel.&nbsp; Select the embedded audio device</p>
in both places.&nbsp; Don't mess with the "MIDI music playback"
<p>device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should consider installing the the VGA, LAN and IDE</p>
<p>controller drivers in addition to the Audio driver from</p>
<p>ASUS (<a href="http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?model=P4S800&amp;os=17&amp;SLanguage=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> ).</p>

<p>The device does not show up in the Sound and Audio Devices panel - and therefore can't be selected - nor in Device Manager. I have removed the old sound card and restarted; I also used the Microsoft tool given above and it failed to find the problem with
 no reason given.</p>
<p>I CAN'T install the Asus driver, as I said in the first post, because its install program does not work - it simply quits immediately, with no error message or dialog. That's why I asked for a way to manually install it.</p>
<p>Finally I checked my bios setup and it has no options relating to sound whatever.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can only Activate XP with an XP Product Key, not Activate&nbsp;Windows 7 with the XP Product Key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either contact the PC Manufacturer and ask them to send you XP Recovery Disks, to reinstall the original Operating System it contained, or buy a Windows operating System Disk and Product Key as a package and install that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
        </p>

            <p>You will need to purchase a license for Windows 7. Windows XP product key cannot activate Windows 7. Although the COA sticker would qualify you to purchase an upgrade license for Windows 7:</p>
