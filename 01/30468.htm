<h2>            My security protocol won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to connect my xbox to the wifi on campus at Louisiana State University, and when I try connecting it I get a message saying "This console supports WPA/WPA2 (personal), WPA2 (personal), and WEP network security protocols, but your router is using something else. You'll need to change your router's configuration. For info about changing your router's security protocol, visit xbox.com/network hardware. After you've changed it, check your connection again." How am I supposed to change the campus's router?</p>

    <title>How to email general comments to Microsoft on Windows&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to email general comments to Microsoft on Windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I went to Microsoft today to (1) find a link where I could (2) email Microsoft to send them some general comments, or feedback, relative to Windows.&nbsp; That was well over 35 minutes ago.&nbsp; Ever tried to find such a link?&nbsp; IT is NEXT to impossible so finally
 I came here hoping someone, anyone, from Microsoft would see it and then pass it to someone at Microsoft that gives a hoot about what I have to say which seemingly, is an impossible task although there used to be in "HELP" a feedback link where we could click
 it and send, even a long, note to Feedback with suggestions or comments.&nbsp; I do not want an answer to a problem!!!&nbsp; Believe it or not Microsoft, there are actually times when people want to send you some comments and not ask for help on a problem.&nbsp; But, in
 actuality, consider this,&nbsp;it has taken me well over now 40 minutes to attempt just to send you some useful comments and so far unable to do so because everything but everything is geared toward solviing problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does that by any remote chance tell you,
 Microsoft, anything, anything whatsoever?&nbsp; YOU have TOO MANY PROBLEMS!!! IF the software was written properly and correctly which by the way is a part of "properly" there would not be problems!&nbsp; Simple deduction!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So anyway, here is my feedback for whatever you want to do wi th it which I imagine based on what I have seen here so far, will be zero but at least I have told you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was searching for a document.&nbsp; I was not sure what the name of the document was in my system and given that I am on this system at least four hours every single day as a minumu and I have had this system since April, 2004, there is a ton of files in my
 system.&nbsp; But the document I am looking for was written around 2 or 3 years ago.&nbsp; SO I went to Windows Explorer and clicked on search.&nbsp; I was rather in a hurry so I just clicked on the older search system, which is much easier anyway, and I entered for the
 file name - "*.doc" as I knew it was written in Word.&nbsp; Then for words in the document, I entered one single word which was the name of a certain, specific company and then clicked on search.&nbsp; Now, you can imagine thenumber of files that appeared in the list.&nbsp;
 IT would be wonderful, absolutely totally helpful if then I could simply click on CTRL+A and then CTRL+C thus copying all the information contained within the search results listing.&nbsp; Then, if I could go to Excel and paste that listing into Excel I would have
 a spreadsheet file on every file in my system that deals with this specific company.&nbsp; Except, it cannot be done.&nbsp; Oh, you can click on CTRL+A and you can even then do CTRL+C but when you go to Excel, you cannot paste the info into Excel in a workbook sheet.&nbsp;
 So, if it is humanly possible, could you all please add the ability to copy part of or all of system/windows search results so we can then paste it into whatever Microsoft program we wish to?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, as an example of what I was complaining about at the top of this, look below at what is next for me.&nbsp; First is the forum so I just hit WINDOWS.&nbsp; Next is version - totally unrelated to my comments!&nbsp; So WHY do I need to pick a version?&nbsp; Next is WINDOWS
 TOPIC and APPS.&nbsp; Come on do we have to do everything for you?&nbsp; You people break things down so far that in order to do a simple little task at Microsoft online, it is nearly impossible and takes so long going thru all the quesitons and qualifications, one
 forgets why they came ther ein the first place.&nbsp; I know that is what&nbsp; you want, but too bad - simplify your system.&nbsp; Okay now I have committed the ultimate error in making three sets of comments/questions/whatever.&nbsp; I complained about how hard it is and how
 long it takes to get to a simple point of just sending you some general comments,t hen I made my suggeston or request and then I complained about the continuance of yet more qualification questions.&nbsp; You have my email address, but of course I do not have yours,
 is that fair?&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; So, if you want, email me regarding my suggestion, IF you can figure out what it is about.</p>
<p>Thank you very kindly.</p>

<p>Did you try your answer, or just happen to come across it and decided to throw it out there in order to tell me a more calm approach might help?: &nbsp;The reason I ask is because if you had tried it, you would never have recommended it as an answer dude! &nbsp;Try
 it and you will see why! &nbsp;Secondly, after spending as long as I did when I did not have the time to waste, frustrated the living begeevers out of me so yes, I was not calm because Microscrew makes us that way!</p>

 Free Speech right?. </blockquote>
<p>I really hate to be a real hard ball and do not intent to criticize when people try to help, but did you not just reprint what my problem was without a response or did y ou hide your response some where in my long winded speech to Microsoft or am I just
 so blind that I cannot see your response?</p>

            <p>Rob,</p>
<p>Your answers are kind of like the one from Billboggs and I have to ask, have you tried the ones in your l;ist to insure one can use them for feedback? &nbsp;The reason I ask is that the last time I use Microsoft Support - Contact Us, I found no where any place
 showing how to send an email to them without furnishing an encyclopedia of information that total is not related to the feedback. &nbsp;As for the phone numbers, if you call of those to offer feedback, either they will not accept it as anything more than a comment
 that goes no where or they want money to speak to tech support when it is not an issue where you are asking for help!</p>
<p>As for the last item where it says "Select Product" that is the beginning of a long loop that endlessly takes you no where that facilitates sending a message for feedback. &nbsp;I was 100% accurate in that Microsoft totally believes no one wants to contact them
 except to ask for help and there is lies the issue. Back in the beginning days of Microsoft, with each program under HELP there was a spot that said FEEDBACK. &nbsp;Like in Excel and WORD and so forth. &nbsp;You could send in comments for each program.without a whole
 bunch of nothing that you had to fill out before you could send it. &nbsp;Microsoft should re-install that ability in each program from them where all you enter was your name (optional), your email address (optional) and then whatever you wanted to say. &nbsp;You were
 promised you would not get a response. &nbsp;I do know for a fact that the feedback was read as mine usually contained suggestions and many of my suggestions were later employed in the programs. &nbsp;Now wouldn't that be easy?&nbsp;</p>

<strong>How to rename the Software</strong><span><strong>D</strong></span><strong>istribution folder in Vista -</strong>
<p>1. Stop the Windows Update service (make sure you are logged on as an Administrator)<br />

Right-click the Windows Update service and click Stop.<br />

2. Click Start, type %windir% in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />

Locate and rename the SoftwareDistribution folder. <br />

(Provide the Administrator password or confirmation if prompted to do so.)<br />
Right-click the Windows Update service and click Start.<br />
<br />
This procedure will erase your history on the Windows Update Site. Not important. It's easy enough to check what's installed by checking "installed updates".<br />
<br />
Try WU gain and see if the update in question downloads and installs.<br />

    <title>Sound card causes 100&#37; CPU usage for all games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> udrescu bogdan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound card causes 100&#37; CPU usage for all games</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been having this problem for a really long time now and I managed to narrow it down to the sound card. I used to shut down each program to see if there are any improvements and I discovered that disabling the sound card fixes the low fps and 100% CPU
 usage issue but it is frustrating to play without sound.</p>
<p>What I did so far was to reinstall the hardware and also the drivers multiple times. I also upgraded from windows vista to win 7 thinking that it might fix it but there are no improvements.</p>
<p>Other info: the low fps/high CPU usage thing lasts for at least an hour if I keep the game opened but if I close it I have to leave the PC idle for half and hour so the game will run smoothly. This kind of bug only affects the games for some unknown reason.</p>
<p><br />
My laptop uses the following software/hardware:</p>
<p>-Windows 7 Professional 32bit</p>
<p>-2.50GB ram</p>
<p>-Genuine Intel(R) CPU&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 575&nbsp; @ 2.00GHz<br />
-High Definition Audio Device with driver from 13/07/2009</p>
-Mobile Intel(R) 45 Express Chipset Family (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM 1.1) with driver from 06/05/2009 because the most recent one was causing issues with a game<br />
I can provide any other info if required
<p>Just as a side note, the game I play most is World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Later edit: I have to mention that in the first few months when I bought this laptop I had no cpu/fps issues. They simply started out of a sudden.</p>

<p>Your later edit says it all. "they simply started, all of a sudden!"</p>
<p>Like&nbsp;after you had installed "World of Warcraft", and, started playing it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, sport, I'm trying to be compassionate/sympathetic here, but, I can't, you're trying to play a game on a lap-top that is NOT designed for................playing games on.</p>
<p>How do I know that?</p>
<p>-Mobile Intel(R) 45 Express Chipset Family &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;this is why.</p>
<p>Nearly all Intel-based Lap-tops are notoriously bad....for playing games on.</p>
<p>Even the latest and best are very suspect.</p>

<p>Even though it is a laptop and it's not made for gaming I get some decent 30fps all the time which is more than enough when I want to play but I'm not at home. The problems started without any reason at all in the middle of a game. No new software or anything
 like that. As I mentioned in the previous post, there was a time when it could run things smoothly. I can't figure out what started this.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Is this issue is confined to a particular folder or partition? </p>
<p>2. Where exactly are you trying to create a new folder?</p>
<p>3. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>If you are trying to create a new folder in system reserved folders, you won't be able to modify or edit the folder.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>What are permissions? </strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were able to create folders in the known location, you may apply permission to the folder and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 fix it for 8.1 but I'm not seeing a fix for it for Windows 10 at all.</p>

            I have attempted all of the mentioned things in both her reply and yours as well as completing a full factory reset on my laptop. At best, the error message goes away for a few hours and then comes back. I should also make you aware that I haven't plugged
 in a USB device to this laptop for several months and it hasn't been acting up at all till now. I'm truly just lost on this one. I've done nearly everything I can find and it's still here and quite frustrating.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker and install the latest BIOS, chipset drivers, and any USB drivers (there may or may not be any as many include them in the chipset drivers). After installing those and the reboot for each check in Device Manager to see if there are
 any specific device drivers needed for any devices you want to use.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>Hi Seth, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the performance of computer hindered in any way? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Swapping is the process of evicting infrequently used application memory from the computer's physical address space yet retaining it within the process's virtual address space. This is done by writing it to a non-volatile backing store called a swap volume.
 The swap volume is typically stored on a hard disk as either a swap file on a file system, or as a dedicated swap partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an application references the memory that has been evicted from the physical address space the operating system will have to load it from the swap volume back into the physical address space before proceeding. This allows a computer to operate more efficiently
 by ensuring that high speed memory is populated only with data that is frequently used.<br />
<br />
Swap usage is the used capacity of all swap volumes that the operating system is allowed to use.</p>

            <p>it was subsequently explained to me that by default, rainmeter's system monitor defines "swap usage" as ram usage + swap usage.

<h2>            iBall Slide i701 Touchscreen not working after update to windows 10. Please Advice</h2>
                    <p>My Tab's touchscreen has stopped working after the windows 10 update. After an exhaustive research online i believe the Silead Touch Screen drivers seem to have compatibility issues with Windows 10.&nbsp; Many other brands have their Silead touchscreens with
 the same problem on updating to windows 10. The Tab came with a promise to be upgradeable to windows 10 and this happens to be one of the most well priced tabs in the market thereby making it one of the most sold. However iBall support has no idea how to solve
 this. To make it even worse they do not even have a Driver Download section.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make and Model: iBall Slide i701 </li><li>OS: Came installed with windows 8.1 Single Language Home</li><li>Updated to Windows 10 Build 10240</li><li>Windows is activated on upgrade. No other External softwares were installed.</li><li>All drivers are installed and system updated. </li><li>There is no physical damage so we can rule out device malfunction.</li><li>The touch screen driver(KMDF HID Minidriver for Touch I2C Device) shows as installed with no issues shown in the Device Manager but the Touch Screen is not showing any signs of working.
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Following are the details of the driver that worked before the update:</p>
<p><strong>##############################################</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>There are quite a few versions of Silead Touchscreen drivers on the internet. But none of them works. Also most of the drivers have a "sileadtouch.fw" copied to the driver folder. But the Double Driver backup I took with the old 8.1 OS did not include a
 "SileadTouch.fw". Can anyone post the correct "SileadTouch.fw" for version: 17.11.5.47 dated: 6-29-2015 if there is such a file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Advice.</p>

<p>Dear <strong>Zatap117</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to take a backup of all the drivers installed on your system and upload it to a google drive or any file hosting service? You can use Double Driver v4.1 (It is a standalone application so no need to install the software) to take the backup
 of the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/double_driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/double_driver.html">Double Driver download link
</a></p>
<p>or</p>
<p>http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/double_driver.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is better to get the entire set of installed drivers since the device uses custom drivers for i2c and other com interfaces which in-turn connects to the actual onboard devices. Once the backup is made you could use WinRar (www.winrar.com) to compress
 the driver folder(Usually the entire set of drivers on the system can be compressed to under 75mb).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it will take up atleast an hour of your time but if you could provide the driver backup we could possibly solve this issue and a lot of us can avoid going into the RMA service and getting back a Windows 8.1 device which kinda beats the purpose. I
 personally know about 20 guys who have the exact same problem. The actual number could be thousands considering the number of tabs they have sold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Joe</strong></p>

    <title>File Explorer Search fails wildcard partial numeric name search. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldw7guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer Search fails wildcard partial numeric name search.</h2>
                    Wildcard Searches in a single folder that has less than 50 empty files with 10 character filenames and that does not have any subfolders work as expected.&nbsp; More characters in the filename will cause the Search to fail with fewer files.&nbsp; With fewer characters
 the Search will not fail until more than 50 files exist.<br />
If subfolders exist then their contents affect Search failure.&nbsp; In testing I created a new folder and used “New Text Document” to create files with numeric names like: 1234567890.txt, 2345678901.txt etc. Using *2345 in the Search box every 10 or so files added,
 worked as expected listing all files that had 2345 as part of the name, but after the 50th file was added the Search results showed only files that started with 2345.&nbsp; These results continued with shorter searches like: *3 should have listed all 50 files but
 instead only listed files that started with the number 3.<br />
I have rebuilt the Indexing Options many times including selecting only the test folder, which had no affect at all.<br />
My actual filenames are quite long, all start with alpha acronyms or abbreviations followed by a dash, model and part number.&nbsp; There are over a thousand files in 8 sub folders.&nbsp; My real Searches are for a partial model number.&nbsp; This problem has cost me many
 hours of research and recreating what I thought were missing drawings and documents.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand you are facing issues with the Wildcard search on the computer. As this seems to be occurring due to a corruption in the indexing, I suggest you to run the
</span><strong><span>Search and Indexing</span></strong><span> troubleshooter on the system.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with search and indexing of files and folders. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check the status of the issue. Refer these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Press <strong>
Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Control panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Change the <strong>
view by </strong>option on the top right to <strong>Large icons.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> and click on the <strong>view all</strong> option on the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Run the <strong>
Search and Indexing troubleshooter.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>
</span></span></span><strong><span>Restart</span></strong><span> your computer and check if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still face the issue, run
<strong>System File Checker</strong> scan and check if there are any system files missing or got corrupted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the&nbsp;steps provided,&nbsp;in the link below in order to run SFC scan on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>I had already tried all of those steps before I started creating the Test folder and files that I described in my initial post.&nbsp; The test that I have described has failed on other W10 systems.&nbsp; I suggest that you yourself create these Test folder and files&nbsp;on

<div>I do not believe that my system has any problem as the wildcard partial numeric name search issue occurs on all Windows 10 systems of family and friends.</div>
<div>I believe the priority of this issue should be raised because the Search Results vary depending on the number of files involved creating confusion and incorrect results.&nbsp; With less than 40 files the wildcard partial numeric name search returns the correct
 results.&nbsp; With more than 50 files the wildcard search becomes a whole number search only listing files that have the exact number.&nbsp; With *2345 in the search box and more than 50 files in focus, Search will Not&nbsp;list 123456.txt but will only list 2345.txt.&nbsp;
 With less than 40 files in focus All files with any numeric string containing 2345 will be listed.</div>

            The Clean Boot procedure at KB929135 does not cover Windows 10.&nbsp; So I just installed Windows 10 to a new hard drive.&nbsp; There was no change in the File Explorer Wildcard numeric Search issue.&nbsp; I expected that because I had already tested numerous other Windows
 10 systems and all worked the same way.&nbsp; File Explorer with a wildcard numeric search like *234 will Not See a filename like ABC123456789.txt when there are more than 50 files in the Search window.&nbsp; But if there are less than 40 files in the Search window
 then the Search results will show the file.&nbsp; To see the number of files in the Search window, select a folder like Documents then put * in the Search box.&nbsp; The number in the File Explorer Status bar, bottom Left, is the number of files to be searched.&nbsp; For
 less than 40 files just make a New Folder and then in that folder make a New Text Document with the name like ABC123456789.txt.<br />
It seems that with less than 40 files, File Explorer is Not using Indexing but is doing a character by character search.&nbsp; With more than 50 files, File Explorer is using Indexing which is replacing the numeric characters with their binary value making the partial
 string search fail.<br />
To prove this I rebuilt the Search Index table using Control Panel, Indexing Options, Modify and Unchecked the Selection Box for my Documents folder and then in Advanced Settings, clicked on Rebuild.&nbsp; When it completed I opened File Explorer, selected Documents,
 entered *234 in the Search box and filename ABC123456789.txt was displayed in Search Results.&nbsp; This is not a fix, it takes a long time to Rebuild the Index table and without it all searches are slow, accurate but slow.<br />
When there is an * with numbers in the Search box, File Explorer should be doing a character by character search regardless of the number of files to be searched.<br />
Can you escalate this and create a case for the File Explorer support team?

<p>
</p><p>In my case doing a search using PICT????a&nbsp; yielded nothing but a search with ~"PICT????a worked as expected.&nbsp; Note that there is ~" at the beginning and no trailing quote.&nbsp; Also there is no field specifier such as "name:".&nbsp; You can check out my question

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When did the issue occur?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Use audio recording troubleshooter and see if it can find a solution.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if microphone is the default sound/recording device.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Click Start<br />
b) Go to Control panel<br />
c) Select Sound<br />
d) In the new window under Recording click Properties and test the microphone and see if it is detected.<br />
e) Under Recording set Microphone to be the Default recording device<br />
f) Click Apply.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you try increasing db(Decibel) level in properties of recording tab.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>a. Get into Microphone properties.</div>
<div>b. Select recording tab</div>
<div>c. Select rear input and drag the db to increase the db level.<br />
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Also, increase the sampling rate to 128 or 256 kbs</div>
<div><br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If this corrects the issue then add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware causing the issue. Then get updated drivers software for that particular device.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2: Perform</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<strong>Hardware Clean Boot</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the device manager Expand&nbsp;<strong>display adapter</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>right click</strong> on the display adapter and try to disable and try to boot to the desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note: Devices that can be disabled for doing a Hardware clean boot are:</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Display Adapters.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Sound, video and game controllers.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Network Adapters.</span></span></li><li><span><span>USB Devices and controller (Please don’t disable this if you are using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse).</span></span></li><li><span><span>DVD/CD-ROM drives.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Modems</span></span></li><li><span><span>Ports</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs or not. In Safe Mode computer starts with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article to boot to Safe Mode. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</span></strong>" in the provided link to return your computer
 to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

<h2>            NEED HELP LINKING MY ACCOUNT</h2>
                    
<p>HELP. I've recently signed up on the Rockstar Social Club in order to transfer my GTA Online character from 360 to One when the game comes out in a few weeks, however, when I try to link my XBL account to my Social Club account it keeps saying "We're unable
 to complete your request. Microsoft account is experiencing technical problems. Please try again later."..... My Microsoft account is in the midst of a 30 day waiting period for "security infro update" which ends November 25th, could this be the problem? Any
 information of this matter would be greatly appreciated!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>if you want help I can help, I thought it would be better through private messaging but anyway</p>
<p>what I need to know is do you have access to your email address (account alias) or your secondary email (security information) or maybe a phone number on the account (Microsoft account)</p>
<p>if you do, go to account.live.com, select cant access account, then select forgot password</p>
<p>then punch in the email address (the one you see on your xbox 360 console in the top right corner) then the characters below</p>
<p>after that, you will see some options to choose from, if you have access to any of those, you can get back into your Microsoft account quickly, but if you don't, you will need to go to the acsr forms, and you will need to answer as many questions as possible.
 you don't really have to worry on that page if you cant answer everything you just have to answer everything you can answer, if you have any questions, let me know.</p>

<p>Hi Zone.</p>
<p>Thanks for the tip, but don't think that's going to work. </p>
<p>When I press link to Microsoft account/ Xbox Live, it says "We are unable to complete your request". I don't get the option to enter my details.
</p>
<p>If I had put my user ID/login and then got this message, I would agree that it had something to do specifically with my account/password.</p>
<p>Microsoft support, &nbsp;I'm still waiting for a response.</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>that sounds very odd...</p>
<p>Well at this point, I recommend you first call XBOX customer support so an escalation can be created to help you get back into your XBOX Live/Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            Suddenly cant connect to xbox live through wireless adapter&#63;</h2>
                    

<p>I enabled port forwarding and my NAT type is open as well. Today I have been unable to connect to xbox live through my wireless adapter and my router settings are still the same. It keeps saying "Unable to sign in to profile". When I did get connected for
 a game of black ops I was lagging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me with this?</p>

                    <p>I have had multiple crashes a brand new laptop.</p>
<p><span>I have used windows debugger to look at the dump files and am not sure what to conclude from them. Is this crash driver or hardware related?</span></p>
<p><span>I think it is driver related to my CPU. If so how do i proceed when there appears to be no replacement drivers for the CPU.</span></p>

            Hi Ciaran, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />That is a very serious error and usually hardware so if this were my own brand new laptop this is what I would definitely do.
<br />
<br />Since the computer is new and still under warranty please contact System Maker's Support and the seller. As OEM they are responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done. 
<br />
<br />====
<br />
<br />If you really want to troubleshoot the issue which I strongly recommend you not do on a brand new laptop :

<br />
<br />This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is  "possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the fatal hardware error implication. You may need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy  or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.
<br />
<br />Check the processor seating, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and the heat sink which are common causes.
<br />
<br />There have been a few instances where Norton/Symantec and other antivirus/security programs have caused this error.

<br />BCCode: 124   0x00000124

            The error code BCC124 is usually hardware error and your dump file proves to be no different: 
<br />Error : BUSLG_OBS_ERR_*_NOTIMEOUT_ERR (Proc 0 Bank 4) 
<br />Status : 0xf2000010000b0c0f 
<br />This means a BUS Error was observed by the processor. 
<br />General BCC124 Guide:

<br />But Thankfully, yours actual error is not a Hardware error. This seems to be an issue created by a recent Windows update for AMD based systems. 
<br />I have seen many customers regarding this issue. 
<br />The only current fix is to disable fast startup:

    <title>I cannot login to my laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garrettfair  say:</h3>
<h2>            I cannot login to my laptop</h2>
                    I bought a new laptop and the first time I turned it on I setup a new outlook account. I immediately forgot my password and got myself locked out of my account. Since I have never used the account I could not provide enough information to Microsoft for
 them to verify my account. I have decided to give up on trying to unlock that account but the problem is that outlook login some how became my computer login so I cannot get on my computer at all. I am stuck at the login screen with no other options to select
 a different user. How do I bypass that login so I can use the computer?

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The only way you can access your laptop is to try to recover your account.</p>
<p>If you have forgotten your Windows password, Please try to follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online
</span><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></li><li>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you still cannot sign in, you will need to reinstall Windows 10. You can contact your laptop manufacturer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Regards.<br />

<br />6. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
