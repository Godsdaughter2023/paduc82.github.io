<p>original title: Remove viruses</p>
<p>I think I need serious help.&nbsp; My Dell computer is only less than 2 months old.&nbsp; I have never received messages regarding viruses, nor do I have much knowledge about protecting my computer from them or what to do if I do get viruses.&nbsp; When I logged on to
 my computer this morning, I had an entire page of warnings.&nbsp; They were as follows:&nbsp; My hard drive has 5 viruses; my shared documents has 5 viruses; my security system is infected.&nbsp; The viruses listed were as follows:&nbsp; 1.) Trojan Horse IRC/Backdoor.SdBot4.FRV
 with a medium threat level; 2.) Magic DVD Ripper with a high treat level; 3.) Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Tibs.tc with a medium threat level; 4.) Trojan-Downloader.Win32.Small.dge with a high threat level and 5.) Adware.Win32.Look2me.ab with a critical threat
 level.&nbsp; I was recommended to click the "Start Protection" button to remove all threats.&nbsp; I did this and&nbsp;the following box appeared asking if i wanted to save or run the following program:&nbsp; Name:&nbsp; bin_2024-9_b8.exe; Type::&nbsp; Application, 206KB; From:&nbsp; bc1f2.versusspywaregruard.com.&nbsp;
 I am usually very skeptical about such boxes and from all that I recall, I have not downloaded any files from a source that I do not trust.&nbsp; To say the least, I am in a bit of a panic.&nbsp; Absolutely ANY help/advice/suggestions/guidance you could provide me with

            I think you are in serious trouble. Your machine is infected with several nasty viruses, some of which claim to protect it against viruses. They don't. I suggest you do this, preferably with the assistance of a friend who is computer-savvy:<br />
1. Save all your personal files, including your EMail files, to an external disk.<br />
2. Restore your machine to factory condition. Read the Dell manual to see how it's done.<br />
3. Make sure the Windows firewall is enabled.<br />
4. Remove any virus protection that is included in the factory image.<br />
5. Download and install Microsoft Security Essentials - http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/. It's free.<br />
6. Scan the machine for viruses.<br />
7. Restore your documents.<br />
8. Scan the machine for viruses.<br />
9. Practise safe hex.

<h3> chi ki man  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reinstall Windows 8 in my laptop if the hard drive is crashed &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop with windows 8 installed (product key is embedded in bios I think and no more license sticker on it).
</p>
<p>Just want to know </p>
<p>1. How do I reinstall Windows 8 if the hard drive is crashed</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and I don't have any recovery&nbsp;media and the&nbsp;warranty is expired</p>
<p>2. Is there any media can let me reinstall my windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.g. using the OEM windows 8 disc which can be brought in any computer shops</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know windows 7 can.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;When I use other media to reinstall windows 8 in my laptop, it will ask for product key during the beginning of installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I find the key for installation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In future, I&nbsp;may face this situation. I hope somebody can help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I think most Techs know how to use a recovery partition but the real problem with recovering Windows 8 is that each (oem) brand will need a separate installation disk for their particular model. We can install a Dell windows 7 cd on any OEM PC and after
 doing updates it will certify itself. With windows 8 you may not even get windows to install on the PC if the Security in the BIOS does not approve of the disk you put in it.&nbsp; In other words you need the proper (HP,Dell,etc...) model numbers version of Windows
 8 recovery CD to even be allowed to install it. <br />
If you are a system builder or building&nbsp; a PC for yourself I think the normal OEM cd should work as long as you know you OEM KEY number or Product Key. Its the BRAND NAME PCs that will be a pain in the butt in the future for Techs that have to reinstall Windows
 8&nbsp; on a NEW BLANK hard drive.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t start past date&#47;time screen</h2>
                    <p>Since Thursday or Friday, any time I start my computer running Windows 10, it loads to this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9630e89-f21d-4b97-aa16-49e88d866196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9630e89-f21d-4b97-aa16-49e88d866196" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>After that, I am able to use the mouse to click to get to next screen but sans a login prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f31de1d3-dbcd-4a2c-9275-7496bb2bbbb7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f31de1d3-dbcd-4a2c-9275-7496bb2bbbb7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Shift+restart to get to the Advanced Settings screen. No luck. I have started it in System Recovery mode that came with my PC, and all the diagnostics come back saying nothing is wrong. But, I can't get past this screen. I've tried holding down
 the power button three times in a row. This brings up a blue screen that says "Windows Defender Offline" and runs a quick scan of Windows Defender. When it is done, it brings it back to the first screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a password for this computer. When I start it, it is supposed to go straight to the desktop screen. I have managed to somehow get it to boot to that screen once in the past four days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions and help would be welcome. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I am not aware of any changes made to the computer besides an iTunes problem where I had to completely uninstall iTunes and all Apple software from my computer and reinstall, and that was several days before this issue began occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above, I tried the Shift+restart method. All it does is restart the computer back to the time/date screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control+Alt+Delete also does nothing nor does pressing any keyboard keys or clicking the mouse or anything. All you can do is click on one of the three symbols in the bottom right of the screen or press and hold down the power button to force restart.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem. I have a Dell Inspirion desktop running Windows 10 upgrade from 8 over a year now, no recent changes that I can remember, but this problem started over 2 months ago, so not absolutely certain about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine will boot up to the sign in window, but no login box, just the background pic with Date/Time and
<span>Easy Access and Network icons</span> in the lower right corner. &nbsp;The mouse works but no keyboard input - ctrl-alt-delete doesn't work either. &nbsp;So I'll power on and off several time to get to<span>
 the troubleshooting screen, try to get it to diagnose/fix the problem, but it always seems to hang as it tries to fix the issue, then on restart it does give me the sign in dialog.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next time it happened I &nbsp;managed to remove the password protection, but that didn't help with the startup issue, except that when I go through the same steps it eventually takes me to my desktop without the sign in step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Everything worked fine after that, but I cannot turn off the computer without running into the exact same problem the next time I start it up. So I've been using hibernate instead of shutdown, which works fine, sometimes
 for days or weeks even, but eventually I'll discover that Windows turned off the computer (possibly during an update) and I'm back to square one.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I think something is seriously wrong because the last time had this problem, it changed/got worse. I tried to run the diagnostic it said it was unable to because of some major issue (sorry can't remember what it said)
 so tried to roll back to a time before the problem started (hate this cuz it wipes all newer apps), but no luck, Windows said there was an error and couldn't roll back.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Tried a few other things but no go, says my option is to reinstall Windows, AAARRRGHH. But when I exited this the machine started up like it always does and I'm back to using hibernate, lol. Don't know what is SUPPOSED
 to be wrong, but it's running normally, just can't shut down without going through that B.S. rigamarole, grrr. I'm beginning to suspect maybe it's a virus or malware, but I'm not savvy enough to figure it out and haven't heard any comments that it might be.</span></p>

<p>Hi Russell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupted Windows startup files. To help you in resolving this issue, we suggest that you run the startup repair. Please try the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1A. <strong>Option 1: If you have installation media for Windows.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Start your computer from the installation media.</span></li><li><span>Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer.</span></li><li><span>If you see the message asking you to </span><strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>, do so.
<span>If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB.</span><br />
</li><li><span>When you see the </span><strong>Install Windows </strong><span>page, </span>
<span>click<span> on </span></span><strong>Repair your computer</strong><span>to start the&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1B. <strong>Option 2: </strong></span></span><span><strong>If</strong></span>
<span><strong>you</strong></span> <span><strong>don’t</strong></span> <span><strong>have</strong></span>
<span><strong>installation</strong></span> <span><strong>media</strong></span> <span>
<strong>for</strong></span> <span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span><span><strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Use the power button to restart your computer three times.</span></li><li><span>This will start the</span><strong> Windows recovery environment</strong><span>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Once that you are in</span><strong> Windows recovery environment</strong><span>,<span> under</span></span><span> the
</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span> screen</span><span><span>, click on<strong>
</strong></span></span><strong>Troubleshoot</strong><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click on </span></span><strong>Advanced options</strong><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click on </span></span><strong>Startup Repair.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Janeane. This is actually my original post. Not sure if you were trying to help both of us or just Russell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the three restart method, which I've done before with limited success, I actually got the computer to boot to the login screen (I don't have a password so it just logged in to the desktop) which is where I am right now. I don't have recovery media.
 Not sure what to do at this point, and I am afraid to turn the computer off for fear it will happen again.</p>

            My computer shut down with an error message that I couldn't get a picture of in time before it attempted to restart. I haven't been able to get it to a recovery environment or anything since. After restarting by holding the power button three more times,
 it came up with Windows Defender Offline and did a quick scan, then restarted and was back at the original screen. I haven't been able to get back to the desktop since.

<p>Since that you can't boot in to the Windows recovery environment, we recommend that you boot your computer through Media Creation Tool. Media Creation Tool is used to download a disc image (ISO file) that can be use to install or reinstall Windows 10. The
 image can also be used to create installation media using a USB flash drive or DVD. Please refer to this Wiki article created by Andre Da Costa for the steps:

<h2>            Ping request times out once ever 20 seconds or so</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded to Windows 10 and as you would expect I had a few teething problems but I've managed to work through everything apart from this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, when I run a ping test to Google the ping is usually around 20-30ms which is fine but once every 20 seconds or so it jumps anywhere from 300ms to 900ms and then goes back to normal. For usual browsing and Netflix and whatnot it's not an issue,
 it's fine and does not inhibit me in any way, but when I'm doing some online gaming those couple of seconds of lag are a massive hindrance and make competitive play almost impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my network cards drivers manually to the latest (Qualcomm Atheros AR922X) and it's a new card so I know it's working fine. I've disabled the P2P Windows update option, tried without defender or firewall running, changed channels on my router,
 tried a different wireless card and all to no avail. We have another PC in the house running Windows 7 that does not share this issue and I didn't have this issue before Windows 10 so it's definitely something on this platform rather than my games servers
 or my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I had to do a fresh install of Windows 10 after the upgrade so I can't go back to Windows 7 like I wanted to, I can't even download the ISO from you because my key apparently came from the manufacturer so I need to contact them for a new install disk
 (one never came with this desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could give me your insight I'd really appreciate it because this has basically made my PC a Netflix paperweight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Scott</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Pin to Left Side of Start Menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> o-h-i-o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Pin to Left Side of Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to Windows 10 today, July 29th, upon the public release. Everything seems to have gone fine in the update. However, I am unable to pin programs to the left side of the Start Menu. From what I've read I should be able to drag a program to the
 Start button and get an option to pin. Instead all I get is something that says "Link." Nothing happens if I just drop a program on the Start button. Additionally, I've read that you are supposed to be able to right-click on any blank area of the Start Menu
 and get a pop-up menu that will allow you to get into the Start Menu properties. When I right-click on the Start Menu nothing happens. Any ideas on what's going on?</p>

            I have this exact same problem. I think they removed the ability to pin items to the left side of the Start Menu under the "Places" list in the final version of Windows 10 that was just released. It's a real shame, I have disabled the "Most Used" and "Recently
 Added" lists so now I just have a big blank area in that part of the Start Menu. It would be great to be able to add things to the "Places" list like we could in older preview builds.

<p>Oh my. It was the inclusion of the Start Menu items in the Win 7 format that convinced me to make the move to Windows 10. What a shame. I've done exactly the same that you have with the Most Used and Recently Added, with the intention of using the space
 for my favorite programs list. What in the world is it with Microsoft that they couldn't just give that flexibility? Apparently it was in at least some of the builds leading up to the final release. Thanks for your reply, even though it's a disappointing one.</p>

            <p>I have the exact same issue. I disabled the useless "Recently Added" and "Most Used" items because I've never had use for the unorganized mess that they have been in the past and I've removed all of the horrible tiles because nobody should have to deal with
 that. After I resized the start menu to its smallest width all that's left is a huge blank space that I can't use. Attempting to add anything to that by dropping it on there will do nothing. Pinning things will just add a new tile and change the size of the
 start menu without my say-so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I wanted to do was use the start menu for what it has always been used for: an extension of the taskbar... but Microsoft couldn't get that right, not matter how straightforward the requirements are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What they should do now is change the start menu view to condense the tiles into the familiar list format when resizing the start menu to its smallest size. That makes the most sense and gives much more functionality without completely removing their beloved
 tiles or changing the definition of "pin". That'll probably come out in Windows 10.1 when they again realize that they've made a mistake, so long as enough people mention something about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I'll be heading back over to the Classic Shell website to get my start menu working correctly again. At least somebody knows what a start menu is supposed to look like. It's a shame Microsoft's developers didn't think to look at what people
 had been replacing their start screen with when designing their new one.</p>

            Well said, Ryan, and exactly my own thoughts. I personally have no use for the tiles whatsoever. So would it really be a big deal for Microsoft to have given us the choice? Tiles for those who want them, a classic Windows 7 menu for those who don't? I've
 gone back and reinstalled StartIsBack++ on my laptop, which was Win 8.1 and is the computer I "upgraded" to Win 10. Much happier now. The sad part is that the OS itself is pretty solid, but MS just can't get past the philosophy that they've got to try to tell
 us what we ought to like. And don't even get me started on Windows updates that install without permission. That's going to come back to bite 'em.

            <p>I will say that the WinX start menu looks very nice after all the tiles have been removed. It's just useless in that state is all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did mention that it's still a work in progress pending user reviews. Hopefully everyone asks Microsoft to just give the people back what they had. I'm all for a UI update. It's pretty, almost resembles the menus of a few Linux distros I've used, but
 if it reduces the functionality of the previous versions of the same UI element then it's not an improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized that I can always create a toolbar using a non-printing character title and minimal space. Adding items to that toolbar will give you a simple drop-down menu of the shortcuts linked there. It's not great, but it's better than the current start
 menu and doesn't hurt my startup time.</p>

            <p>The menu "looks" OK with the tiles removed, but as all in this thread (and, doubtless, in countless other forums) have pointed out, what remains on the left side has no value whatsoever. Recently used and new program entries are generally the first couple
 of items I eliminate from a pop up menu, and without the ability to pin our own choices to the left side, the menu has no reason to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's incredibly frustrating is that this is largely what millions of frustrated users communicated to MS when Win 8 was published. The fact that they could spend years -- and without any doubt, millions of dollars -- to tell the world they listened and
 are bringing back needed functionality, then tease us with several preview versions that actually allowed pinning to the left side (albeit in a horrible fashion) -- only to release yet another crippled product, is stunning. It's clear that the people in charge
 of user experience simply don't get it -- period. This is an embarrassment, when it could have been a triumph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other brilliant concepts like sharing WiFi connections - BY DEFAULT - boggle the mind. But back on topic: the lack of ability to pin programs on the left side pretty much forces serious users to go with Classic Menu, StartIsBack or Start10 -- all 3 of which
 return normal function to the Start Menu. The built in start menu is about as useful as the front legs on a T-Rex.</p>

            <p>Oh no! So Microsoft have gone and broken the Start Menu. I don't want tiles. I don't want Most Used. Just want to pin programs to the start list as in Windows 7. Hopefully this will be fixed soon or else it means installing a 3rd party app. Hmm.</p>

            <p>Stunningly, after blowing it badly with Win 8, never getting it quite right with 8.1, and spending all this time in between promising to get it right with 10, they did indeed blow it once more on release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They. Just. Don't. Get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Classic Menu, Start10 and StartIsBack are all great, with differences that are a matter of user preference. The first is free - and has a ton a features and settings. The second two cost a few bucks, but are virtually instant effortless installs. I've got
 Start10 installed - did it as soon as I realized that MS just won't give up hawking their crippled interpretation of a user interface, and haven't looked back. Windows 10 is perfectly usable now. Not holding my breath for MS to ever get this right. They simply
 refuse to understand user experience or listen to their customers.</p>

            <p>If you want to add folders here's what I suggest:</p>
<p>Go into your start menu, and click settings.</p>
<p>After that, you want to click Personalize.</p>
<p>Go to Start, then click&nbsp; "Choose which folders appear on start" at the bottom.</p>
<p>Now choose your desired folders. Next, enable Show Most Used and then open programs you want to show up in there. Anything you don't want in there, you can just right click, and then click "Don't show in this list."</p>

            <p>Caelan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate the attempt at offering a solution, what you suggest is a poor substitute for basic functionality that would allow users to simply pin any program, folder or url directly to the left side menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have to use programs before Microsoft deigns to recognize them as most frequently used programs. Look at Start10, StartIsback and the start menu in Classic Shell. These are all excellent, and add back the functionality that Microsoft took from
 us when they ditched the Windows 7 start menu in favor of the ill conceived UI that helped Windows 8 actually shrink consumer demand for new PC's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not another modern operating system that won't allow a user explicit control over the items shown in its launcher. Windows 10 was going to address this fatal UI flaw, but at the last minute someone in Microsoft once again thought that he or she
 knew better than the users and industry experts, and chose to disallow user control over the list of items in the menu, and their sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This once again illustrates a stunning lack of awareness of UI design, user experience principles, and an arrogance deriving from the notion that Microsoft knows better than their customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Truly an embarrassment for Microsoft and a disappointment for their customers. If third parties didn't release products like Start10, Startisback and Classic Shell, I could not have used any version of Windows past 7.</p>

</p><p>1. I've checked system with System File Checker - "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violation".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No color calibration for display was applied and nothing was found in Color management settings (empty field).</p>
<p>

                    <p>*Original Title: Teco AC Servo Driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping to find some help here locating a driver so I can connect my laptop to a Teco AC Servo Driver.</p>
<p>The exact servo driver model details are; TSDA-20B-CB751C27F</p>
<p>It controls a Shinano (or Sinano) servo motor on a CNC for cleaning upvc profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original servo driver failed so I sourced a replacement. Unfortunately the parameters need changing and I can't connect my laptop to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/advice very gratefully received!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I was trying to post it on the forums you suggested but I couldn't see which category was the most relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the manufacturer several times but have received no reply.</p>
<p>Similarly I have tried sellers of a similar servo driver but with no success.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes, I googled it and emailed the manufacturer but all to no avail.</p>
<p>I think it's because this is an old product which has probably been superceded at least twice.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have a cnc standing idle because I can't reset the parameters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frustrating.</p>

<h3> kentlrda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 won&#39;t allow me to enter administrator password</h2>
                    I upgraded from Win8.1 to Win10.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Win8.1, I was the administrator, and my password allowed me to perform any administrator function. Since the upgrade, it appears that Win10 has made me a general user.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I try to install something (a new program,
 an upgrade, etc.) I receive a dialog box that tells me to enter the Administrator's password and then press 'PROCEED'. However, there is no place for me to enter a password and the 'proceed' button is shaded out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, I am unable to make any changes
 on my computer.

            <p>Dear Vijaya:</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. When I signed on (in Win10) I was using my Microsoft Account which, in Win8.1, signed me on as an administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally got frustrated and called Microsoft Windows support.&nbsp;&nbsp; They tried doing a remote session, as well as everything
 else they could think of - with no success.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally THEY RECOMMENDED THAT I RETURN TO WIN8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, because Windows created a completely NEW administrator name and password when it installed Win10, and because I could not provide the password, I (or a Microsoft
 Technician) was unable to do a roll-back.&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the only way that I was able to go back to Win8.1, was to reinstall it from my original install disk. Before I did the reinstall, I backed up all my data files to a separate, internal, hard drive (which
 I use for backups).&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I installed Win 8.1, it not only reformatted my primary (C:) drive (which I expected), but it also erased and formatted my backup drive and I lost ALL of my very valuable data files.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not begin to say how disappointed I am in Microsoft Windows and Windows10. I tried upgrading all three of my computers to Win10, and all have since been returned to either Win7 or 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the one computer, the administrator name and password were
 changed by Windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other two,&nbsp;MICROSOFT programs that ran great on Win 7 &amp;&nbsp;8 would not run on Win10.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have been a long-time, loyal Microsoft Windows person. Yet, Win10 is the absolute worst upgrade they have ever sent out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can now see why
 it was free.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Very disappointed.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft mahjong not working after upgrade</h2>
                    I am operating Windows 10 and upgraded about June 2015.Mahjong was operating successfully until mid November 2015. The app keeps crashing just prior to the log in. I have tried all the suggestions that Microsoft Mahjong FB site have offered. However when
 I turn the internet off on my lap top the app will load correctly but to play Daily Challenges I then turn the internet on again and the app is okay. I am unable to turn off the internet on my PC so we are unable to use it on that PC. Surely there must be
 some one who can sort this out as I am getting frustrated be cause I don't want to give up.

            <p>Thank you for your suggestions.Unfortuneately not at all successful.</p>
<p>1. There is no error message.</p>
<p>2.The app trouble shooter could not find anything.</p>
<p>3. I have un installed and re installed several times and re started as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned in my first question. The app will load when I turn off the wifi. When it is loaded I turn the wifi on again to play the daily challenges the app stays on and is okay. I can only do this with the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again the app was good when I upgraded to windows 10 for about 5 months.</p>
<p>I am also aware that there are a lot of other people experiencing the same problems.</p>

            Well yes I have conducted both methods to try and eliminate the problem but this is not happening.&nbsp; All the drivers are updated and working correctly. The trouble shooter did not find any issues either. So what next? Please.

            I have conducted all of the suggestions offered and my laptop and PC show no signs of any malfunctions. All updates are down loaded and installed. I believe that the app itself needs attention. FB app did a similar crash a few days ago and I notified them
 and they had it fixed within 24 hours. All other Microsoft apps work perfectly well. As I am not the only user experiencing this problem I am surprised that it has not been rectified yet.

            I have re installed several times and this issue is still not resolved. I think it is an app problem as FB had a similar issue and I took it up with them and they had it fixed within 24 hours. If you take a look at the store down load page you will find
 lots of people with the same issue. I don't believe it has anything to do with our computers. Please can you fix it?

<h3> radiocam  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Sign in with email address or phone number&#34; - The latter never works for me. Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
This happens all the time, but&nbsp;I'll use the concrete example of what just happened to me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started One Note on my Windows 10 Pro PC.<br />
It came up and asked me to sign in with the message that says like the subject line above, "Sign in using&nbsp;a phone number or email address"<br />
I put in the phone number that I have registered with MS, in fact the phone number that it uses&nbsp;to confirm my sign-ins or changes to my profile etc - so I know it's what's on record in my profile.<br />
And it NEVER accepts&nbsp;it - puts me in a&nbsp;repeated cycle of repetition, telling me that's not valid and asking me to do it again, etc.<br />
<br />
I always have to enter my email address finally and sign in as usual.<br />
Why is it doing this?&nbsp;Is there some format that it wants me to put the number in? (I've tried everything, with country code, leaving out leading , etc etc)<br />
Or is this normal behaviour for sign in on the PC?</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I managed to solve my problem from info gathered from different sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Restart into safe mode. At login page Windows 8.1, press shift+ Restart. This took me to Diagnostic Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Select [Troubleshoot] option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Under Troubleshoot select [Advance Options].</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Under Advance options select last item [Startup Settings]. Description says "Change Windows startup behavior".</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Under [Startup Settings] select [Safe Mode]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Once in Safe Mode, go to Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Look for device Intel Dynamic Platform And Thermal Framework Manager. Uninstall all items under this device. Select delete driver where prompted.</p>

    <title>Unable to program numbers beginning with zero into skype contacts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to program numbers beginning with zero into skype contacts</h2>
                    <p>I am from America but work in Thailand and Laos, I have encountered a problem when entering Thai or Lao phone numbers into Skype. Cell numbers in Laos and Thailand begin with the number zero ( 080, 020, and so on) but when I try to create contacts for Thailand
 or Laos, Skype automatically discards the zero, rendering the number unusable. I have tried editing the number several times, thinking that it would retain the zero if I put it back in, but it has not work. What can I do?</p>

<p>The problem is not with the country code, it is with the phone numbers following the country code, the typical phone number is +66 080 403 8551, when entered into the Skype contacts it is changed by Skype to +66 80 403 8551 and does not work because skype
 automatically edits the first zero out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lao numbers are similar, all Lao cell phone numbers start with a zero the country code is 856, no zeros so no problem, but the number following the country code will always start with a zero, such as 020 ##### or 030##### and Skype automatically edits
 the first zero out&nbsp;leaving the number unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If you would&nbsp;create a contact in Skype using the phone number I provided as an example you would see the problem and understand.</p>

<p>It is standard practice to omit the leading zero from the area code when the number is being dialed from outside the country. It is not supposed to be dialed. You can verify this on many sites by simply performing a web search such as "Dialing Thailand omit
 zero". The number may be unreachable using Skype for other reasons.&nbsp; If Caller ID is not enabled on your Skype account, enable it (using a mobile you can verify).&nbsp; Sometimes numbers are unreachable due to blocking all non-Caller ID calls. Other times certain
 networks might be inaccessible.</p>

<p>This is interesting, especially because if you are in country you cannot omit the&nbsp;zero. Also the information on available on web searches states that the first set of digits are the area code yet if you purchase a sim card for your cell phone&nbsp;in Thailand
 the first group if numbers can vary widely through the same retailer and in the same city.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I will check the other settings as you suggested.&nbsp;Thanks for explaining.</p>

<h2>             xbox one will not turn on with the controller anymore.&#10;</h2>
                    
<p>Up until&nbsp;a few days ago&nbsp;when I wanted to play xbox I just grab my controller and press the xbox button. And it powers on. Well not any more. It just stoped powering on that way. I have to do it by using the button on console. my controller is connected and
 working fine. I just cant turn the xbox on with it.&nbsp; Any one know whats going on???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked out this link <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-functions-improperly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../wireless-controller-functions-improperly</a>&nbsp;but nothing there really covers my problem. I have two controllers neither one will turn on the xbox like they use to. Now that I think about it. This may have happened after I updated my controllers.
 When the adapter came out from microsoft. The adapter that lets you use your onn headsets.</p>

<p>Just power cycle the Xbox by holding down the xbox button on the console for 8 secs. Power adapter light will glow amber. Then start up again.</p>
<p>Glad that you got it fixed, just try the power cycle method, should you have any trouble in the future.</p>

<h2>            C&#58;&#47;Windows&#47;Temp file is a wopping 128 gbs</h2>
                    I was checking out my computer and i realized that my hard drive was nearly full, so i was looking through my folders until i came across the temp folder. Ive tried Disk Cleaner and deleting Software Distribution Downloads to save some space.&nbsp;In the temp
 folder there are about 60000 files called AppXDeploymentServer, all around 5mbs each. Is that normal?

<br />3. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<div><span>Yes, they can, and should be, deleted periodically.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>The temp folder provides workspace for programs. Programs can create temporary files there for their own temporary use. Each program should delete all its temporary files when it closes, but for various reasons it doesn't always
 happen (for example, if the program crashes, it never gets to do this). That's why it's a good idea to periodically clean out anything left there.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Also note that there are some program installations which work in two steps. The first step concludes by writing temporary files and rebooting. The second step starts automatically after rebooting and needs to find those files
 there (and then deletes them when it's done).</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Other than doing it automatically when rebooting (that would interfere with installations like the kind I described), it's always safe to delete the contents of the temp folder. Because it's safe to delete any temp files that
 aren't open and in use by an application, and since Windows won't let you delete open files, it's safe to (try to) delete them at any time. If any fail to delete because they're open, they'll either be deleted automatically when the app using them closes,
 or you'll get them the next time you delete manually.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Some people may suggest that you reboot before deleting anything, but that's not necessary, for the reason described above (on the other hand, it doesn't hurt to do it).</span></div>

            <p>Using Edge didn't change anything either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still can't upload if it is on my status post. &nbsp;It does work if I am commenting on someone's post, then the pic will go right in, but not on my status. &nbsp;Still goes big and comes in and out and won't let you exit. &nbsp;If I hit post in just the right spot often
 enough, it will sometimes work.</p>
<p>Another thing I have noticed just recently (I think since the update came thru), my downloads and even some of my pictures got over and are stored in One Drive. &nbsp;Not under pictures or downloads. &nbsp;I have a hard time fining my stuff. &nbsp;I'm about ready to go
 back to Window 8.1, or restore my computer back to before this happened, and then the update would be gone too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm starting to think it happened when I uploaded pictures from my camera to my computer. &nbsp;The photo thing is totally different in win10 than it was in 8.1 &nbsp;and I don't like it at all.</p>
