<h2>            Is it possible to download DLC from the Xbox website&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I recently purchased a copy of Resident Evil 5: Gold Edition and I wanted to redeem the code. Problem was I don't have the wireless adapter for the non-Elite 360. I attempted to run a either net cord through my computer and bridge the connection but
 I just get an IP error so my last hope was to go to Xbox.com. Which, brings me here is it possible to download DLC from this site put it on something like a flash drive then install it onto the xbox that way?</p>

<h2>            Driver problem &#40;code 37&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everytime I plug in USB port any of the Texas Instruments evaluation/development boards I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware. (Code 37)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting my computer, uninstalling/reinstalling drivers, manually pointing windows to the drive folder (in the installation folder of the software which came with the hardware products) and nothing works. I'm guessing the problem is with my computer/Windows
 since none of the other users of this products reported similar issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a few days ago I pluged in USB port brand new WD external hard drive, the whole computer just crashed and now it doesn't recognise it when I plug it in. It works fine on a different laptop which is another reason why I think the problem is with my PC/windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run Windows 7 on a Toshiba Satellite L555.</p>

            <p>From that aswMBR log (thanks, by the way) it's showing a hidden service (driver appears to be likely loading at boot). Also, given you tried to run HJT, and it prevented you from doing so noting that the admin set policies (which you yourself clearly did
 not do), it looks as if my analysis was correct and you're infected with a rootkit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My expertise is analyzing/debugging, not malware removal by any means. With this said, I myself cannot give you proper removal instructions. I can say that TDSSKiller will probably show the rootkit, and be able to remove it, but using TDSSKiller and removing
 a rootkit can at times depending on the rootkit render your OS an un-bootable paperweight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would I do if I was you? Honestly, just wipe the OS and walk away. Could you remove the rootkit? Maybe, but you are at great risk after that, and when you have an MBR-based rootkit, it's nasty and leaves a lot of problems behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also since it's your best and your choice try to remove it, and maybe even with the help of our security experts/MVP's here (in the proper forum, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up to you and some food for thought!</p>
<p>

                    If you ask Cortana to play a song by title she replies Sorry I can't play music on Groove right now and nothing happens. There are no displayed errors and you can run groove and play the song manually. Has anyone seen this issue and found a solution? This
 is windows 10 and it used to work fine.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Defender hogging resources and bogging down my computer</h2>
                    <p>I had thought that perhaps some malware infected my computer and I open up task manager and the resources are being hogged by Windows Defender itself, which seems to be a bit of malware itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;Specifically something called Antimalware Service Executable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the other postings, and I don't want to get that far into my computer and mess it up. I don't want the usual list of stray URLs to follow and find that it doesn't really solve any problem. Also, I am sort of busy and I am actually using my computer
 to do stuff, and not as a hobby in itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I just use task manager to to kill the Antimalware Service Executable, or do I risk really screwing things up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do you uninstall Windows Defender?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Recommendations on replacements?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Why is it 2018 and Microsoft is still putting out defective software?&nbsp; It is defective since it wasting my time figuring out what is happening and how to fix it. Computers in 2018 and going forward just need to work and not be a hobby in themselves.&nbsp;</p>

            Before we make any adjustments, can you open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update
<br />
<br />Are there any pending updates?
<br />
<br />If so, make sure they are installed. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to disable Windows Defender, follow the steps in the following article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/disable-windows-defender-security-center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/disable-windows-defend...</a>
<br />
<br />or install third party Antivirus such as Avira which would automatically disable Windows Defender.

<p>1. No pending updates. Good information on how to check. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You link to an article about which version of windows installed go to another link which goes to another link. No really helpful. I have work to do tonight and Microsoft is not my hobby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I took a guess and found out that it is 1803. Installed 5/17/2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going on Facebook and ask friends for what is a good antivirus antimalware anti etc. software and get it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate Anytime Upgrade product key won&#39;t activate bootable VHD</h2>
                    I bought a Dell laptop with Windows 7 Professional. &nbsp;I then bought a Microsoft Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;The reason for this upgrade purchase was to learn to generate bootable VHDs. &nbsp;I have created a bootable Windows 7 Ultimate VHD which
 boots up no problem but when I try to activate the instance using the Windows 7 Ultimate product key that I received with the upgrade, I get an activation error message saying the upgrade product key cannot be used for a full installation. &nbsp;I thought I purchased
 the full capability of WIndows 7 Ultimate through the upgrade!?! &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any insight into resolving this activation issue is greatly appreciated.</div>

 on the same PC you can re-use the product key because it's still the same machine.&nbsp; The only key I have to activate the Win 7 Ultimate system when I boot up the VHD is the upgrade key from my Anytime Upgrade.&nbsp; And it doesn't work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
That is not the case, the Windows Anytime Upgrade key is not a full version, it is an 'Anytime Upgrade' which means it needs a base license from an existing edition of Windows 7 to work, in your case Windows 7 Professional. If you want to activate your VHD
 instance of Windows 7 Ultimate, you will need to purchase a full version Windows 7 Ultimate key.</p>
<p>Upgrading to Ultimate gives you the additional features and capabilities, but does not mean you can use the key to create additional instances of the operating system.

<h2>            Repeated Device connected-disconnected messages</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS - Windows 10 (most recent update).&nbsp; May 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I receive approximately 1,000&nbsp; Device Connected / Device disconnected messages per day (Blue box would appear at the bottom of the screen).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for about a month. I have not connected a device in weeks and it happens during regular computer work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often the messages come in a pair - the first would say "Device Connected and then would be followed by Device Disconnected. Both messages (the pair) would appear within 1 second one after the other.&nbsp; Sometimes they appear 6 times within 3 seconds which
 is crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we stop that?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone for anything that might help resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eric&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, <br />
briefly: <br />
- CompatOS uses another compression algorithm 4K XPRESS Huffman instead LZNT1 (NTFS compression), so compression is better,
<br />
- files compressed by CompactOS are not shown in blue, <br />
- compression may make reading and writing files slower due to it loads CPU more strongly.
<br />
Exact numbers of CPU load are not published, results of file compacting one may find in

            There is no sense to compress files already compressed, this just make computer slower. But CompactOS does not compress entire disk, it processes only Windows, and Program Files folders, and Store applications so one may apply NTFS compression to other folders.

            No you don't want to compress files twice. Often you will find that after the second 'compression' the file will be larger.

            I suspected they were two different processes and appreciate your clarifying that for me.&nbsp; Have already executed the file compression, but would like to now do the CompactOS as well.&nbsp; Advisable?

            32GB DEVICES ARE TOO SMALL …
<br />
<br />If you have a 32GB drive, you have my condolences (I just barely dodged that particular bullet myself). 
<br />
<br />MS says that Windows 10 only needs 20GB to install, making a 32GB drive appear adequate. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/minimum-hardware-requirements-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />
<br />But, in the “real world” that is not the case. MS and computer builders like to add “free sample” software (aka "crapware").  Over time, add some Windows updates, and system checkpoints and oops, you very quickly no longer have the 6-8GB of space required to do the major spring/fall updates.
<br />
<br />Go to this Feedback and upvote it and do ADD your comments:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Vgqfjb</a>
<br />
<br />MS has marked it “We’ve got it”, but that is not enough. They need to be “encouraged” to produce a publicly documented fix for the problem they have created. One option is to recreate a "small drive" version of the Win 10 install that installs core features then prompts you for additional requirements specific to your machine and usage.
<br />
<br />The wiki / article (next link) includes many tips and techniques you can use to free up space on your drive.
<br />
<br />Or, you can bite the bullet and do a clean install of 1709 Fall Creators Update, or even 1803 Spring Creators Update. In the long run, even with re-installing lost applications it may be faster that fritzing around trying to free up enough space.
<br />
<br />If you have this problem, please vote on this feedback to MS: <a href="https://aka.ms/Ilgpij" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/Ilgpij</a>  I am asking that they make repeat update failures a more urgent warning message.

            If you use both methods, only last will be applied. <br />
By default compacting and compressing seems give approximately same results. <br />
If you need a free space by all means even with degrading performance (unfortunately I even have no ideas how significant it can be, probably tens of percent) run a commands
<br />
compact /c /exe:lzx /s /f /i c:\Windows\*.* <br />
and <br />
compact /c /exe:lzx /s /f /i c:\"Program Files"\*.* <br />
This will re-compact all files in these directories with maximal compression.

<p>Thank you for your response and the info.&nbsp; Upgrading Win 7 Starter was not a consideration when I bought this tablet with the 32GB HD.&nbsp; However, the allure of a free Win 10 Home upgrade was too much to resist.&nbsp; I have moved a number of data files to the
 D: drive on the integrated 32G SD card.&nbsp; Now have 10GB of free space on the C: Drive, but 1803 still won't complete.&nbsp; Too bad I can't find a way to use that card as auxiliary storage to do the 1803 feature update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably the best thing for me to do with this machine is stop with the Feature updates, live with 1709, which is more than adequate for my needs, and only do the Quality updates from now on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will most likely do the CompactOS implementation to give Quicken and Chrome a little more room to operate.&nbsp; Quicken, another piece of bloated, patched up, error prone, legacy software that needs to be rewritten, but it works for me. C'est la vie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to find a way to get WU to stop telling me about and trying to load 1803.&nbsp; Just slows down my machine, consumes resources only to then fail to install once again.&nbsp; Do you know of such a command, procedure or hack that would do this?</p>

<p>Clean install of Win 10?&nbsp; Now that's a thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this Win 10 Home is a FREE upgrade from the original Win 7 Starter, I do not have any MSFT installation media for Win 10 Home, nor for Win 7 Starter, for that matter.&nbsp; Any Product Code I could find probably points to Win 7 Starter.&nbsp; How would I go
 about getting the installation media to do a clean install of Win 10?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Windows RT came pre-installed and require an installation media to recover the device, you may have to contact the Asus support for further assistance. Please refer the link below to contact ASUS support.</p>

<h2>            Sony Vaio Function Keys for pcg71312l not working, unknown driver in devices list</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated to Win 8 on a vaio pcg71312l. I formatted my hard drive, starting the computer fresh with Win 8. Everything is working great, though I noticed that I no longer have the Sony preinstalled software (of course), but also that Sony no longer offers
 drivers/software support for this model. This wouldn't be a problem except that I have no function key accessibility except for volume, i.e. I can't change monitor brightness, switch screens, magnify, and most importantly, put the computer to sleep using fn
 + f keys, making it a hassle to do so. I tried updating keyboard drivers through device manager: no luck. Also, within my device list, there's an unknown driver showing up, nonfunctional, which has the following hardware ids:</p>
<p>ACPI\VEN_SNY&amp;DEV_5001<br />
ACPI\SNY5001<br />
*SNY5001<br />
I can't update or retrieve drivers for this because I have no idea what it is (though I'm betting based on the two bing results for those values that it is proprietary sony drivers I can't access).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to get these drivers? Or would that conflict with the new OS, as some people who have updated vaios without a wipe seem to have experienced with sony drivers? Is there a convenient work around to assign fn keys?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dishonored Knife of Dunwall Disk Unreadable</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody, not sure if this is the right place to ask a question, but I would really appreciate it if anyone could help.</p>
<p>I have a French Xbox 360, the location on my account is set to the US, have an English version of Dishonored and purchased the Knife of Dunwall code in France. I can play the normal version of Dishonored fine, but whenever I try to play the DLC I get a "Disk
 is Unreadable" message right after the loading screen which then boots me back to the Xbox dashboard.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated, thanks in advance!</p>

<p>It could be a region problem as that has happened to me as well. I had my US account in Ireland. To avoid these problems I created a silver account here in Ireland and then downloaded dlc etc from that account and then played them with my US account.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, try deleting it and clearing your system cache and marketplace cache and then re-download it. Below you will see how to do both.<br />
<br />
<strong>Clear your system cache<br />
<br />
</strong>The system cache contains temporary files that are used by the Xbox 360 console. Clearing the system cache may fix this problem. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your Xbox 360 system cache</a>.
</li><li>Restart your console. </li><li>Try to buy or download the item again<br />
<br />
If you get the same error code, try the next solution.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution 3: Delete the Marketplace System Data file<br />
<br />
</strong>The Xbox 360 console also stores temporary files for the Xbox Games store. You may be able to resolve this issue if you delete the Marketplace System Data file.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
<br />
To delete the Marketplace System Data file, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>System</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Storage</b>&nbsp;and then select your primary storage device. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>System Items</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Marketplace System Data</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Delete</b>. </li><li>Restart your console. </li><li>Try to buy or download the item again. </li></ol>

<p>Hey there Creeper,<br />
<br />
I believe what Brandiesel means is to create a free account that has the same region as your physical location so that it won't get blocked by region locks and use that account to purchase and download region locked content so that you don't encounter these
 issues.<br />
<br />
When you purchase and download DLC or a Game on Demand with one account, you can play that content with any other account on the original console it is downloaded to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, we<strong> highly recommend</strong> having your account region and your physical region match up so that you don't run into region issues when trying to access content on Xbox LIVE.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No. If you are not physically located in a supported region, you will be unable to download that DLC. Even if the region is set to a supported region, Xbox Live will see the conflicting regions, and error on you.

<p>Really? If I made a new account with the location set to where I am, bought a DLC code again, downloaded the DLC with the new account, I could play it with my old account and avoid the error, couldn't I?</p>

            <p>Hey there Creeper!<br /><br />Sorry for the confusion. <strong>To clarify:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are in a <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Live Supported Region</a> and you have an account that is set to that Live supported region, you can purchase region locked DLCs in that region without issues.</li>
<li>Once digital content is purchased, it is bound to the account that originally purchased it as well as the console that it was originally purchased on.</li>
<li>So if you were to buy DLC on a silver account that is set to the same Live supported region that you're physically located in, you should be able to access it on other profiles (including your main one) provided that you're trying to play it on the same console that you purchased the DLC on.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>For example:</strong> If you make an account called CreeperSpook2 that is set to France. Then you purchase the Knife of Dunwall DLC on console 1 with your CreeperSpook2 account, you should be able to access the Knife of Dunwall DLC on console 1 with CreeperSpook.<br /><br />All that being said, however, <strong>we always recommend that you have your account region set to the same region that you're physically located. That prevents region lock issues like this from ever becoming an issue in the first place.</strong><br /><br />I hope that helps clear things up.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 screen freeze</h2>
                    <p>Having installed Windows 10, obviously I need to go into Windows 10 to use the laptop (Asus K55 series). When I go into Windows 10 the screen freezes, the cursor freezes or disappears and the laptop is completely unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone can tell me (1) how I can un-freeze the screen so I can use the laptop and (2) how I can delete the garbage Windows 10 system and return to Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any useful guidance.</p>

<p>Beyond the obvious (bodyparts...racist words, yadda yadda) What else is considered bad by the 3arch standards?</p>
<p>I can see the swastika. Unless your a ww2 vet who served in the german army, since many of them (like my grandfather) served in places like Africa and had no clue as to the horros that were happening. (he told me many times he heard things but thought it
 was propaganda lies).but since I dont think any of them would play cod then it would have to&nbsp;kids trying for attention or recists.</p>
<p>Do things like the rebel flag get you banned (hey...im origonaly from&nbsp;the south).</p>
<p>Just whats the standard?&nbsp;</p>

<p>no racial slurs, and as you stated no body parts. &nbsp; Curse words are allowed but to an extent &nbsp;(only certain words). and im pretty sure they frown upon people using there emblems to promote/advertise drug use/abuse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that just keep a clean mindset and keep your head out of the gutter and you can actually make some pretty kickass ACCEPTIBLE emblems</p>

<p>and the rebel flag im sorry but its not racist and the war was not becuase of there flag it was becuase of the separate beliefs the North and the South had on how the country should be run, So in my opinion rebel flag is acceptable hell its part of some

<p>IMO, the Swastika will and should warrant a ban. &nbsp;The Confederate Flag should not. &nbsp;No one in the 21st century can look at a swastika and not associate it with genocide. &nbsp;On the other hand a lot of people can and do look at the rebel flag and associate it
 with Constitutionalism and opposition to a rampant Federal government before they associate it with slavery. &nbsp;</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, with rampant childish "troll " emblems, I doubt something even slightly off color would raise an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>for example although people will frown at it, the rebel flag will probably be fine. The swastica wont.

    <title>Finding Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panther13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finding Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1</h2>
                    <p>I'm re-installing XP (Home Edition) on an old computer, using the original CDs, supplied by the manufacturer. I get hung up at the point where I am asked to insert the Service Pack 1 disc. For some reason, this disc got separated from the rest somewhere
 along the way. Shouldn't be a problem, but I can't find any place from which to d/l SP1 (on the Microsoft website or elsewhere).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many Service Pack versions available (SP1 for Windows XP Office Edition, Service Pack 1a, SP 2, SP 3) but not the original SP1. All (even the SP1a version) are lacking a file "asms" (or something similar - I'm writing that by memory). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, SP1 (the simple, garden-variety one) is essential in order to get to the next steps. Cannot build a house without a foundation...</p>
<p>Any reason why SP1 is not provided anywhere? Or am I looking in the wrong places?</p>
<p>Suggestions as to where I can find "Windows XP Home Edition Service Pack 1" would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Not only should you not need XP service pack 1 in the normal course of things, you shouldn't be asked to insert it.&nbsp; This sounds as if you are using some manufacturer-supplied CDs to restore the computer to its "fresh from the factory" condition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the state of your computer at this point?&nbsp; That is, when the process stops because you don't have the next CD, is the system stable running XP with no service packs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, XP service pack 1a (which is no longer available, AFAIK, from an "official" Microsoft source) is identical to XP service pack 1 but for the
<strong>removal</strong> of the "Microsoft Java Virtual Machine," which was Microsoft's version of Java.&nbsp; Shortly after the release of sp1, Microsoft settled a patent infringement suit with Sun (the creator of Java) and part of the settlement required removal
 of the MSJVM from sp1, hence sp1a.&nbsp; Thus, if you are getting some message about a
<strong>missing</strong> file if you use an SP1a CD, something else is going on, e.g., the "Service Pack 1" CD that is being requested is not a Microsoft product but something put together by your computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft no longer provides XP sp1 for download because XP Gold (no service packs) can be directly updated to service pack 2.&nbsp; The procedure for getting XP Gold fully updated can be found here (but this is a very old post, so some of the links no longer
 work) --&gt; <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/microsoft.public.windowsupdate/4-jCtXsbshs/HBI-0476Wj8J" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/microsoft.public.windowsupdate/4-jCtXsbshs/HBI-0476Wj8J</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, there is no such thing as "<span>SP1 for Windows XP Office Edition</span>," so don't try to use that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that the file named xpsp1_en_x86.exe here is a legitimate version of XP sp1, but I have no information whatsoever about the reliability of this site or what the file actually is.&nbsp; For all I know, it could be infested with malware.&nbsp; Moreover,
 I really doubt that it will help you, even if the file really is a good copy of the official XP sp1 file, because your description of your problem sounds as if you need something else.&nbsp; --&gt;

            <p>Dear LemP -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your response, and for all of the background info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds as if you are using some manufacturer-supplied CDs to restore the computer to its "fresh from the factory" condition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Yes, I am attempting to use the Operating System disc provided by Gateway at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the state of your computer at this point?&nbsp; That is, when the process stops because you don't have the next CD, is the system stable running XP with no service packs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- At this point, all aspects of the computer are fine and functional (mechanically). The reason for re-installing Windows XP is that XP was previously completely removed from this machine, and was replaced with the Ubuntu (Linux) OS. Prior to that (some
 time ago), the computer was running XP (with all appropriate Service Packs) without incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, XP service pack 1a (which is no longer available, AFAIK, from an "official" Microsoft source) is identical to XP service pack 1 but for the&nbsp;<strong>removal</strong>&nbsp;of the "Microsoft Java Virtual Machine," which was Microsoft's version of Java.&nbsp; Shortly
 after the release of sp1, Microsoft settled a patent infringement suit with Sun (the creator of Java) and part of the settlement required removal of the MSJVM from sp1, hence sp1a.&nbsp; Thus, if you are getting some message about a&nbsp;<strong>missing</strong>&nbsp;file
 if you use an SP1a CD, something else is going on, e.g., the "Service Pack 1" CD that is being requested is not a Microsoft product but something put together by your computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I am starting to get the distinct feeling that the issue lies within the fact that the restoration CD was provided by Gateway and not by Microsoft directly - and that makes all the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, there is no such thing as "<span>SP1 for Windows XP Office Edition</span>," so don't try to use that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Copy that.. thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;- I'll look into the hyperlink you provided. Thanks for the lead.</p>

            <p>If I recall correctly, Gateway used to provide actual Windows installation media rather than the more typical "restore to factory conditions" sets that became common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I asked about the current state of your computer, I wasn't referring to the hardware but to what state your use of the Gateway media has resulted in.&nbsp; That is, when you are prompted to install a SP1 CD, what happens if you cancel out of the process
 ... if you can?&nbsp; What is the actual text of the message prompting for the CD that you don't have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask because if you've managed to install Windows to some functional point, you can then download the necessary files to update to sp3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You realize, of course, that even if you were able to get XP sp3 installed it would be unsupported by Microsoft and thus increasingly vulnerable to malware.&nbsp; Microsoft support for Windows XP stopped on April 8, 2014.</p>

            <p>This machine is about 10 years old. At the time of purchase, Gateway provided separate Operating System, Drivers, Applications, Works (and Works Suite), as well as other Software (non-Microsoft) discs.</p>
<p>And at that time, and for a while - these may have in fact been sufficient to re-install XP (to factory specs) had the need arisen.</p>
<p>Ten years after-the-fact.. not so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not going to be able to re-install XP, given what has transpired since then. And to address your question re ability to install Windows to some functional point - unfortunately no. Windows had been completely dismantled on this machine, so I was starting
 from square one.</p>
<p>I do realise Microsoft have long since distanced themselves from the XP OS - there are some sources (such as avast! Antivirus) that will support XP to some degree. This was just an exercise in keeping a perfectly functional and dependable computer from becoming
 a glorified paperweight... and extending it's service life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind of like putting a new engine or transmission in a Pinto to keep it going against the long odds. It's actually kinda fun when it goes to plan.</p>
<p>Just as an FYI - during the installation, I am prompted to "insert the Windows Service Pack 1" disc - and when I do, I am advised that the "asms" file is missing - even when I endeavoured using the Windows XP Update Service Pack 1 (Office Version). Just
 wanted to see what would happen with that.. and it never proceeded beyond the "asms" message - which appeared instantaneously after the prompt to insert the Windows XP Service Pack 1 appeared. This is also the case using SP1a, SP2, and SP3... i.e. the installation
 falls at the first hurdle because of the "asms" (or lack thereof) file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all or your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>Thank you, Les, for this information and for the links. &nbsp;I have long since decided it isn't worth the effort to pursue this issue - and have moved on using a different Operating System totally, for this machine (which functions just fine and accomplishes
 all I set out to do).</p>
<p>I know it's a bad word in these parts, so I'll just tell you the OS rhymes with Linux. &nbsp;:p</p>
<p>I don't think this is what Microsoft had in mind when they abandoned this "ancient" OS (XP) ... but you reap what you sow - and Microsoft have essentially lost a customer for any future purchases. A simple thing like supplying existing software (mind you,
 nothing major or ongoing updates are not expected) should not be too much for which to ask.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, massive thanks, all, once again for all the input.</p>

            <p>For informational purposes, you should know that there's absolutely no need to download or install XP service pack 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, despite the warnings, someone wants to continue to use XP and needs to do a fresh installation of XP, all that's needed is sp 2 and/or sp 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Service Pack 2 can be installed on a system that either has XP with no service packs or XP sp 1.</p>
<p>Service Pack 3 can be installed on a system that has either service pack 1 or service pack 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, if you have a CD with no service packs, install it, then install sp 2, then install sp 3.</p>
<p>If your installation CD includes sp 1 or sp 2, install it and then install sp 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several details involved in the installation of these service packs, but there's no need to go into them here.</p>

            <p>Also good to know - thanks. That is not made clear or apparent (or simply even hinted at) anywhere during the (re)installation process of XP (in such an instance as this). Just the brick wall, and that's it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, XP is not imperative (for me - although I understand the need for some to keep it afloat in order to run certain software)... but this lesson is a good one (by way of preparation) for what may come down the road after the impending
<em>now you see it, now you don't</em> re Windows 7, and etc.</p>
<p>I still like the suggested idea of archiving certain files for the purpose of maintaining OSs that have been unceremoniously retired.</p>
<p>I also understand (if not agree with) Microsoft's desire to "gently" guide their users toward purchasing new Systems every (insert always seemingly short) period of time here.. pressing ever onward and upward (?).
</p>
<p>Not necessarily calling MS (by itself) out on this one. It's the nature of the beastie everywhere anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have synced my Surface PRO to One Drive and noticed it was draining the battery, so I turned the Sync off. Since turning the Sync off, I cannot find a whole folder worth of files which were on my hard drive.</p>
<p>I have searched both the Recycle Bin of my hard drive and OneDrive and I cannot find the files anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, these files are very important!</p>

            Hello Ryan, my name is Alexander. I'm an Independent Advisor and I'm happy to assist you! 
<br />
<br />Please try the following troubleshooting methods.
<br />
<br />Method 1: Check the settings.
<br />Go to the Settings from the start menu.
<br />Tap on System -&gt; click on ‘Project to this PC’ (on the left pane of the window.)
<br />You should turn on ‘Projecting to this PC’ feature because it is turned off by default. To do it, select ‘Available Everywhere on Secure Networks’ from the list. Please ignore if you get a warning message in red.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Check Firewall.
<br />Go to the search box in the taskbar to enter in ‘allow firewall’.
<br />Click on ‘Allow an app through Windows Firewall’ from the results.
<br />Find ‘Name’ to select Wireless Display and ensure that ‘Private and Public’ are selected. Then, click on OK.
<br />
<br />In case you cannot select anything in the ‘Allowed apps and features’, you are not signed in as an administrator.
<br />Go to the ‘Change Settings,’ enter your administrator password, and click on Yes.
<br />Your administrator password is the same you used to set up your Windows. After that, ensure that ‘Private and Public’ are selected and click on OK.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, follow the support article ‘Fix connections to wireless displays or docks.'
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4012820/windows-10-fix-connections-wireless-displays-docks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/401282...</a>
<br />
<br />Start the Connect app and check the text on the screen, it will inform you if your Windows 10 device supports it.
<br />
<br />Best regards, 
<br />Alexander B.

<h2>            Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 Doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Play</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought THPS3 and when i go to fire it up it gets stuck at the white original xbox logo. i can hear the sounds of the ads and the menus and such and i can interact with the game however the white xbox logo appears to be stuck as no picture is shown
 at all except the white xbox logo itself, I've tried other original xbox games and they work fine. I am using the new halo reach xbox with a 120gb HDD, Any support with fixing this problem would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>According to the backwards compatibility list there are some notes on how the resolution needs to be set. I'm not sure if it'll fix the problem or not, but it's worth a shot -- Console must be set to 480p/standard def mode. 720p and 1080i only displays Xbox
 loading screen with game sounds. VGA output works fine as well at various resolutions.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was your Windows 10 install on a new PC or have you done an upgrade? </p>
<p>Which app are you using to open the images, is it the default Photo app?</p>
<p>Are the files that will open jpg or a different format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the picture files located all on the same HDD or different ones and/or different locations e.g one folder all images get that error message but a different folder or HDD location doesn't?&nbsp; Just wanting to gauge if this maybe permissions related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried opening the pictures with Windows Photo Gallery or Paint or another photo app you may have installed, worth a test to see if anything else opens them up ok. (right click a file and choose Open With then choose from the list)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure Windows is up to date, run Check for Updates in Settings and also do this with the built in apps so open Store and click your user icon and then Downloads and Updates.</p>
<p>
