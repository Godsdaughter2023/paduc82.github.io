<h2>            Windows 10 reset failures.  Computer won&#39;t boot now and getting frustrated.</h2>
                    <p>I'm aware this has been a problem before but I've not found a solution yet that has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ex's daughter has a windows 10 laptop that she managed to load with Malware.&nbsp; After 3 days of fighting with it all, and managing to neutralize all but 2 (one was Karma Ransomware, and the other I have no idea but all her web browsers were completely hijacked).&nbsp;
 I finally gave up and got permission to do a full reset.&nbsp; No problem, I've done this on my own PC with windows 10 before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First it simply refused all various attempts.&nbsp; I researched and bought a flash drive to reset in that fashion.&nbsp; It still failed only now it refuses to do anything at all if the flash drive is not present, in which case it just asks how I feel like resetting
 this time, both options still fail between 50% and 60% completion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a few points I've received the option "A configuration change was requested to clear this computer's TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
</p>
<p>WARNING: Clearing erases information stored on the TPM. You will lose all created keys and access to data encrypted by these keys."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have said both no and yes and the results have been the same.&nbsp; Failed reset around 50%-60% and no way to reboot the computer to the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge there are no cds or any other sort of media that came with the computer (it doesn't even HAVE a cd drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm frankly out of ideas at this point.&nbsp; The computer isn't dead but it's trapped in this weird purgatory and I don't have any idea how to fix it.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Virtual Wi-fi adapter and WAN miniports. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george-uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Virtual Wi-fi adapter and WAN miniports.</h2>
                    <p>This virtual device was installed as part of a Win 10 automatic update. To cut a long-ish story short, it took a few hours for me to discover why the wi-fi would no longer connect on my Lenovo G50 laptop (Intel Dual-band Wireless-AC 3160). No error messages
 are generated. Also a new network connection, designated by an alphanumeric, appeared in the Network &amp; Sharing Centre. To restore connectivity I had to remove the Vrtual Adapter (which restored connection to the wireless network but with no internet access)
 and then re-install the Intel Driver to restore connection to the internet. Things were fine for a couple of weeks until the whole lot was re-installed by a subsequent update. It's now becoming a regular task to uninstall the virtual components and restore
 the original configuration. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know if there is a way to prevent this update from being re-installed without disabling automatic updates altogether. Thanks in advance for any ideas.</p>

<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this

<p>Here's the story</p>
<p>Wife turned on computer then told me the screen went blank (then buggers off to the pub!!).</p>
<p>I log in and computer slooowly starts up eventually Microsoft screen pops up and tells me it had to shut down abruptly because of&nbsp; a stop error also known as a blue screen error.</p>
<p>It tells me to do check and download any updates/device drivers</p>
<p>scan for viruses</p>
<p>check hard disk for errors</p>
<p>So I check for updates on the Windows Update website, click on the recommended update button and am told website has encountered a problem and cannot display the page I am trying to view.</p>

    <title>Cannot reinstall XPS services and Viewer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot reinstall XPS services and Viewer</h2>
                    <p>While troubleshooting why Send to OneNote Printer did not work, I discovered the XPS printer had a problem. I opened Devices and Printers, right clicked on XPS printer, and choose properties. It immediately reports that the driver is not installed, would
 I like to install it. I click yes, and it fails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To address this I tried the following</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a clean boot - Still would not install driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc /SCANNOW - it found problems it could not fix so I ran </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">DISM</span></strong>.exe /Online /<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)">Cleanup</span></strong></em>-image /Restorehealth and it reported it fixed things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I ran sfc /SCANNOW and it said there were no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still would not install driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted XPS and tried to reinstall - now it says it cannot install driver listed under Microsoft printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Programs and Features - Windows Features - unchecked xps services and viewer, restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Windows Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back to Programs and Features - Windows Features - rechecked the xps services and viewer and it fails to install these two features with xxxx902 error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looked that up and followed the DISM and SFC recommendations - still will not reinstall XPS services or viewer. Looked at CBS log in Windows\logs and see entries for problems but cannot conclude what is the problem from what I am reading. HUGE log. Lots
 to read. Really need a parser to help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran Windows update - no updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know what do try next.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing a detailed information on your issue. I appreciate the step-by-step troubleshooting and the pains you took to resolve your issue. However, there are a few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause and check your
 system health, in order to fix the issue permanently. But before providing troubleshooting steps we need some more information.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any security software installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Was it working before? If yes, did you make any changes prior to the issue?</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>The XPS Document Writer allows you to create .xps files using any program that you can print from in Windows. Print to the XPS Document Writer when you want to create, send, and share or publish documents that you do not want other people to modify, or when
 you want to print a document or display it online exactly as it appears on your screen. It's also a good idea to create an XPS document for files that contain graphics or illustrations that might otherwise display differently in print than online or on computers
 with different monitors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>update Microsoft XPS Document Writer driver </strong>
under printer in device manager and see if it helps you to fix the issue. You may refer to the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe
 driver you shouldn't install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Download and install drivers</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also check by making it as default printer and see if it helps. To set or change the default printer you may refer to the steps provided below.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the <strong>right edge of the screen</strong>, and then tap
<strong><span>Search</span></strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span><strong>Devices and Printers</strong></span> in the <strong>search box</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Devices and Printers</span>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Press and hold or <strong>right-click </strong>the printer (<strong>Microsoft XPS Document Writer</strong>) you want to use, and then tap or click
<span>Set as <strong>default printer</strong></span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope the information provided is helpful. Do let us know if you have any more concern related to Windows. We will be more than happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <span>Hi WoodyPea,<br />
<br />
<b><u>Method 1<br />
</u></b>I would suggest you to run media player settings troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter</a><br />
<br />
<b><u>Method 2 <br />
</u></b>I would suggest you to make sure that Windows media player is set as default.<br />
Make sure you uninstall all the codecs if there are any installed.<br />

<br />
Have you found a solution?&nbsp; I'm having the same problem...exactly the same sound you describe.&nbsp; And I have already run the "fix it" to correct settings; I am reluctant to get rid of my codecs as I had this computer set up specially because I use it mainly for
 videos and movies.&nbsp; The reason I even want to use the Media Player is because its colors are so vibrant compared to VLC, which of course plays absolutely everything but its picture does not compare to&nbsp;Media Player.

            I have also been experiencing this same problem for about 2 weeks now. If anyone or microsoft could come up with an answer for this that would be great. I have already run troubleshooting for windows media player settings and for audio. I don't want to
 delete codecs that I use for other programs as well.<br />

<h2>            D-ban &#40;nuke&#41; system and then rebooting system on windows xp</h2>
                    
<p>my computer isnt working properly at all.&nbsp; I have read the forum and come across a recommendation to run the D-ban program which 'nukes' the sytem.&nbsp; I want to do this to clear my computer altogether but I am not sure what will be left after I clear computer.</p>
<p>I have a windows advantage kit and then all the other original disks which came with my computer.&nbsp; When I nuke system will all my hardware (disc rewriters) etc still work so that I can just put the windows advantage kit in to reload windows.&nbsp; I have a disc
 player and a disc player/burner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I had a copy of office 2007 but I cant find it anywhere.&nbsp; I have run a copy off my computer and I have got the user code number written down.&nbsp; If I reload the copy I have burnt will it still work or will it look like a pirate copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cant afford to go to a computer shop to sort out but I'm frightened of running the nuke program and then not being able to get computer up again afterwards.&nbsp; I have tried system restore and it doesnt do any good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer is seven years old but will be perfectly adequate for me if I can get it to work properly.&nbsp; it is running windows XP service pack 3 with trend microsoft pc cilling 2010 anti virus.&nbsp; it isnt showing any viruses I think it just needs taking back to
 its original settings to get rid of all rubbish on it.&nbsp; I have taken copies of all the files that I need.</p>

<p>Download this program,restart your system in safe mode with networking and run it.It is a good program for detecting and removing bugs from the system.If it rectifies the problem go to system restore and turn it off.It will tell you all the restore points
 will be deleted and that is what you want because restore will hold any bugs that are in there.Once it has deleted anything that is in there turn it back on.PS.To start in safe mode with networking,hold the f8 key when you start the system then select it.This
 will load the essentials and stop any bug from running.</p>

            You don't have to be in safe mode.You can run it in regular login.Just click the icon on your desktop.It is just that running it in safe mode insures there are only basic system programs running and not hindering the program while it runs but it will still
 work.

<p>my computer isnt working properly at all.&nbsp; I have read the forum and come across a recommendation to run the D-ban program which 'nukes' the sytem.&nbsp; I want to do this to clear my computer altogether but I am not sure what will be left after I clear computer.</p>
<p>I have a windows advantage kit and then all the other original disks which came with my computer.&nbsp; When I nuke system will all my hardware (disc rewriters) etc still work so that I can just put the windows advantage kit in to reload windows.&nbsp; I have a disc
 player and a disc player/burner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I had a copy of office 2007 but I cant find it anywhere.&nbsp; I have run a copy off my computer and I have got the user code number written down.&nbsp; If I reload the copy I have burnt will it still work or will it look like a pirate copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cant afford to go to a computer shop to sort out but I'm frightened of running the nuke program and then not being able to get computer up again afterwards.&nbsp; I have tried system restore and it doesnt do any good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer is seven years old but will be perfectly adequate for me if I can get it to work properly.&nbsp; it is running windows XP service pack 3 with trend microsoft pc cilling 2010 anti virus.&nbsp; it isnt showing any viruses I think it just needs taking back to
 its original settings to get rid of all rubbish on it.&nbsp; I have taken copies of all the files that I need.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer your actual question, if you run DBAN there will be NOTHING left.&nbsp; It will be as if you took your hard drive, threw it away, and replaced it with a brand-new empty hard drive.&nbsp; If "all of the other disks" that came with your computer include all
 of the necessary drivers for your hardware, then you will be able to install that hardware and make it work.&nbsp; Otherwise, you'll have to download the drivers (before you run DBAN) either from the computer manufacturer or the mfrs of each hardware item.</p>
<p>Unless the copy of Office 2007 that you "ran off" your computer is an iso file (i.e., a CD/DVD image), you won't be able to reinstall Office.&nbsp; Whether you have the correct product key isn't the issue; the point is that copying the contents of C:\Program
 Files\Microsoft Office\Office12 (or something similar) isn't sufficient to install Office.</p>
<p>To get to Safe Mode, restart the computer and immediately start tapping F8.&nbsp; When you get to the black and white menu, use your up/down arrow keys to select Safe Mode and press Enter. Your mouse won't work on that screen.</p>

<p><span>Hi subq:</span></p>
<p><span>Darik's Boot and Nuke will completely erase ALL PARTITIONS, including HIDDEN SYSTEM REINSTALL partition. Because it uses INT13 [direct access to the hard drive sectors] method, all sectors will be overwritten
 by zero default value, or USDoD-3 wiping routine.</span></p>
<p><span>As far as I can tell, you will never be able to install XP again if you do this method. Because your SYSTEM REINSTALLATION cd\DVD does not contain five files, two of them are important for licensing OS disks:
 NTLDR.dll, NTOSKRNL.exe.</span></p>
<p><span>If you could, make a drive backup with DriveXML or other imaging programs [Norton Ghost, Acronis Disk Manager, Paragon Hard Drive Manager, etc].</span></p>
<p><span>When you say 7 years old, what is CPU/RAM numbers?<br />
<br />
Again, my guess would be your XP may never feel or run like old XP, due to crapload of changes in SP3, and post-SP3.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you do install, keep it simple with a firewall and anti-V/S/M. I would not install Office or any other applications, except -- may be TurboTax or financial programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Even LinuxOS could be considered as atrocity on such old computer. Note that I am talking of Ubuntu 10 or contemporary workstation. Damn Small&nbsp;or Puppy Linux is excluded.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could make firewall/router with Linux-based distros such as Untangle, IPcop, Vyatta, and IPwall.<br />
<br />
Because Linux will use ~90% of RAM available, you might find not enough RAM starting at 1GB. So if you could put say 2+ GB RAM, you have a decent family firewall in a Bridge mode so that all computers are protected (on wireless network). I would try Untangle
 or Vyatta.</span></p>

<p>Let's see if understand....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) You've successfully imported your favorites</p>
<p>2) You can see your favorites in the vertical favorites "pane" (that appears on the right hand side)</p>
<p>3) You have enabled the Favorites Bar (the horizontal thing at the top)</p>
<p>4) ...and now you want to know how to get things to appear in the horizontal Favorites Bar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then all you need to do is open the vertical favorites pane and "drag-n-drop" the favorites onto&nbsp;the folder called "Favorites Bar".&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom Line:&nbsp; You control the contents of the Favorites Bar by adding/removing favorites in a *folder* called "Favorites Bar" that exists in the Favorites pane.</p>

It said that that tag was&nbsp;already taken and I&nbsp;remembered&nbsp;that I&nbsp;had created gfwl account before. Since I&nbsp;don't remember any login information ( or if it has any since it was created through game in steam ),&nbsp;is it possible to merge it with my current one or delete that one so that I'm able to change my current gamertag? Or is there a place where I&nbsp;can try to log in to it directly without Microsoft account?</p>

<h2>            wifi connection keeps dropping</h2>
                    Hey there, I've been having some problems with my dell inspiron 15r laptop lately. It runs on windows 8 and I am using a d-link router. Pretty much ever since i bought it I have been experiencing some strange wifi connection problems. Most days my laptop
 will randomly start dropping connection for a short time, while still saying its connected to my network with full bars. When trying to use the troubleshooter i get various results, such as "windows could not automatically detect this network's proxy settings"
 or "the default gateway is not available". Some days my connection will be stuck on "identifying" as well, giving me no access to my internet whatsoever. I know it is a problem with my computer as my Ipod can connect to my network just fine. If anyone could
 help me out that would be awesome. :)<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Do not assume it is the computer (even&nbsp;though it well might be) just because the iPod<br />
will connect as it still could be the router. Have you tried another computer with that<br />
router?<br />

===============================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Left&nbsp;Side click Manage <br />
Wireless Networks - Right Click the Networks - Remove Networks - <br />
REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect&nbsp;To - to logon on to Network.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Just because a Mac or iPod or any other device connects does not mean it is not the router<br />
for a newer version of Windows. In fact the odds are the router needs new firmware.<br />
<br />
Check with both D-Link and Dell as previously suggested.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is almost 100% and error with the driver or hardware issue. Among the possible causes<br />
are :<br />
<br />
1. the network device itself (usually on the motherboard on a laptop)<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;a power related problem - check the power adapter connections and plug it directly into<br />
a wall socket - could be some other device is pulling too much power so be sure to remove<br />
all external devices as a test - and you may need to disable internal devices (such as the
<br />
camera) in device manager to see if that helps.<br />
<br />
3. the device driver has an issue.<br />
<br />
All of those need to be handled by Dell Support and their forums :<br />
<br />

<br />
If nothing works the only real option is to try an external adapter (best would be a USB
<br />
hooked to a USB Powered Hub since the laptop already has a probably power issue).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            <p>Hi Arun</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really know what a 'clean boot' is and what potential problems it may cause me so was reluctant to try it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Launch Startup Repair doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    I have a Dell inspirion one running win 7. Everything I try comes back to launch startup repair which stops at a blue screen and large cursor. I can't get to command prompt to try anything. No matter what I choose, I end up at blue screen. At one point
 I did get to reboot system assessment and got SATA disk read, seek and verify block errors, lots of errors! Is there anything else I can try?

<br />
</span></p>
<ol>

            <p>The only changes would be installing Comcast' s Constant Guard which includes Norton AV and allowing a Norton tech remote access to fix a problem just over a week ago. Also, Windows update.</p>
<p>The blue screen is not the "death" screen, just a blank blue Windows screen with a few lines, leaves and a bird. This is the screen I end at no matter what option I choose after pressing F8, I have tried every option on that menu.</p>
<p>Error codes received during Preboot System Assessment:</p>
<p>0F00:1344 and many block errors</p>
<p>0F00:0444</p>
<p>0F00:1A44 many block errors</p>
<p>0F00:075D</p>
<p>0F00:065D</p>
<p>0F00:0244 many block errors</p>
<p>Method 1-nothing to disconnect, printer, etc. wireless</p>
<p>Method 2-tried numerous times and always end at blank win screen</p>
<p>Method 3-I don't have a win 7 disc and stupidly did not create one or even do a backup :( this pc did not come with a disc but maybe I can get one from Best Buy, where I purchased it.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi RougeFox22
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What happens if you sign into <a href="http://www.office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com/myaccount</a>
<br />
<br />Did you try renew through that page?
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://Office.com/renew" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Office.com/renew</a>.
<br />
<br />Choose the subscription you want to renew and then choose one of the following:
<br />
<br />    Renew now to pay now for a full year of Office 365.
<br />
<br />    Renew with a monthly subscription for $X.XX per month to pay for a month at a time.
<br />
<br />Review your shopping cart and choose Checkout.
<br />
<br />On the next page, sign in with the Microsoft account that you use with Office 365.
<br />
<br />Review your order and then choose Renew subscription.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, you need to contact support to check on your account:

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Unfortunately that suggestion didnt work and I am not getting anywhere with the Chat Bot. I try and talk to someone and it redirects me to the subscription page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please would someone from support be able to look at my account or give me an email address where I can speak to someone? I'm getting quite frustrated as I am actually trying to give Microsoft money and have had this problem for over a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant purchase a new subscription as I keep getting the 'try again later' error every time I do it, all the work arounds on other forums have not worked and when I have managed to get somewhere with getting a subscription up it seems to be stuck in the
 past as it says my last payment will be taken in February 2019 and that I have one week of subscription left.</p>

    <title>Grub rescue, can&#39;t boot into windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harrisonsdesk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grub rescue, can&#39;t boot into windows</h2>
                    Hi, I was on Windows 7 when I decided it was time to get rid of Ubuntu for a bit. So I went and deleted the partition including the Linux swap partition and I extended my E drive. So I have my C - Windows drive and E - Storage.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then rebooted and to my surprise windows 7 didn't start up and it came ip with grub rescue, I have looked online with my iPod to find solutions, I had found some answers and they seemed to work with everyone else... Didn't work for me though, the bit
 that didn't work was where I had to type insmod normal or just any other insmod...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Ububtu live CD wont boot up but will try again tomorrow. I don't have my recovery disk and can't access my recovery partition because grub handled it. So now my only hope is to delete the grub rescue from inside itself or try other commands not to
 do with insmod.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help</div>
<div>Harrison</div>

                    <p>I had trouble with the family feature. I was sent a request to give permission on an xbox game on a pc (which I recognised as my other account that for some reason is set to child, and I was the one to 'ask by email'). However once I gave permission (as
 confirmed below) it still haven't started and continues to make me ask for permission and I have given it multiple times.</p>

<h2>            Intermittent problem with inking - journal stops inking - handwriting panel works&#33;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>I'm experiencing a problem when running Windows Journal and using the pen to ink on the page. &nbsp;It seems very random as to when it happens but the ink
 just stops writing. &nbsp;In the event viewer there is an error stating<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>"the size of the buffer is invalid for the specified operation"</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and this comes from WISPTIS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The handwriting used to then stop in the<span>&nbsp;</span><em><span>handwriting input panel</span></em><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span>too,
 however this has been resolved by recently copying WISPTIS.exe to the SysWoW64 folder in C:\windows (from the System32 directory) The inking function now only stops in Journal and in Office and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>continues
 to work in handwriting input panel!</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When the issue arises, I close journal, re-open journal, an error is displayed<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>"unable
 to initialize inking components"</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and the application cannot be opened until restarting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm currently running a 64 bit Windows 7 Enterprise touchscreen/pen enabled tablet PC (HP Elitebook 2760p). &nbsp;The drivers are fully up to date/recommended installed
 - I've updated them running the HP provided SSM tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have 64bit Office 2010 installed (fully patched as of 25/02/2014). &nbsp;The OS is fully patched too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have already attempted a clean boot, journal repair, tablet tools removal and reinstall. &nbsp;None of which resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone could shed any light on this issue or have any ideas of what to test next I would be truly appreciative. &nbsp;My thoughts are that it could be driver related
 but when I have previously attempted updating the HID drivers and Virtual HID drivers the whole thing went a bit pear-shaped!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any advice is appreciated. &nbsp;Any further information required please post and I will respond ASAP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>The problem still persists. &nbsp;I think it is something driver related still, a series of events which happened (detailed below) lead me to believe this if anyone has any ideas i would appreciate hearing them.</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The user took his laptop out of the docking station and put into portrait (autorotation enabled)</span></li><li><span>He was working ok in windows journal for a time.</span></li><li><span>Outlook was open at this point in time, writing in the input panel&nbsp;and then the the usual error occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Using the inking input panel in a new email this was&nbsp;<strong>not writing</strong>&nbsp;with pen, however the same&nbsp;<strong>input panel keyboard works with the pen.</strong></span></li><li><span>Opened Microsoft Onenote, the message "Tablet drivers are not installed on the system. You must install; them to enable Tablet features" is displayed – unable to write and the pen buttons
 are greyed out.</span></li><li><strong><span>Go back to the Windows Journal (in the existing opened doc) and handwriting works!!!!!</span></strong></li><li><span>Create a&nbsp;<strong>new Windows Journal</strong>&nbsp;doc and&nbsp;<strong>handwriting doesn't work</strong>!&nbsp; Also crucially<strong>,
<p>Any advice on this...</p>

    <title>Thinkpad R500 card reader will not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kh55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thinkpad R500 card reader will not work</h2>
                    <p>The problem happens with a Thinkpad R500 running 32-bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The R500 has a built-in card reader, however, that reader no longer works properly .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several times I've installed drivers for the card reader. Each time, the reader briefly works, then fails to operate the next time the R500 is used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checking the knowledge base and Levovo online support turns up no cause, explanation, or solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The card reader has been activated in the R500's BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SFC/scannow shows no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
