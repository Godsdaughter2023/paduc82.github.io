            When you are reported, data is grabbed and sent to Enforcement, then an actual person reviews it before making a judgement and issue the relevant suspension. You get the chance to do a case review at https://enforcement.xbox,com Enforcements are not always
 instant and can take several weeks in some cases to come through, so what you think might be what you got a suspension for, could actually relate to something else. You can check at the Enforcement site to see a rough guide as to what you did. If you did a
 case review they sometimes will say what you did that violated the code of conduct. There is no false reporting, infact false reporting can earn the person doing so a suspension.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have a Skype account, then you already have a Skype ID/Name. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To find you Skype ID/Name, tap or click your profile picture and your Skype Name will be displayed in your profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong></p>
<p>Your<em> customize Skype Name&nbsp;</em>is the username you created when you first joined Skype.</p>
<p>Your <em>system generated Skype Name </em>will be in the form of <em><strong>live:firstpartofemail
</strong></em>(account created using an email address).</p>
<p>Your <em>system generated Skype Name </em>will be in the form of <em><strong>live:alphanumericcharacters
</strong></em>(account created using a phone number).</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 is a joke - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#40;donny&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is a joke</h2>
                    So about a year ago windows 10 decided to become a recommended update and installed automatically on my computer when I was at school even though I already knew it was terrible. Ever since I was forced to install windows 10 my computer has become slow.
 100% disk usage for no reason other then features that have been added that NO ONE uses. I can't even go back to windows 7 anymore because I have switched mother boards and the windows 7 key was connected to the old MB. There is a old saying "if it ain't broken
 don't fix it." Hats off to you Microsoft for making the worst windows in existence.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some corruptions in apps.</span></p>

<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you
 install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot.
 Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still
 exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></span></p>

<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section

    <title>Cannot chat with XBox support or request call back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> binraixbox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot chat with XBox support or request call back</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to download Rainbow Six Vegas 2 as it is a free game this month for Xbox Live. It wasn't able to do so and it gave me an error code. It said I should change the region I have to an actual region I am. I made account back in a day, when Estonia wasn't
 on the list, and I was in Finland, like most pople here. Nowadays most are using an UK account, which is a smart idea.<br />
So I went to change the region and it actually had Estonia now, so I changed the region into Estonia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I cannot access Xbox Live at all! None! Only thing on Xbox 360 now is saying is: Xbox Live is not available in your region! And It won't let me change it back to Finland or UK, because i get a warning that I can only change region once in THREE MONTHS!
 Are you kidding me? I have running subscriptions and we run the biggest videogaming websites and channels in Estonia, so it is not possible, that we won't have Xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot OF COURSE contact anyone in support, because it won't let me enter my name (which is required) and YES, i have entered ALL MY persional information. You have more information about me than my bank. Yet, I still cannot contact any support.</p>
<p>I want access to Xbox Live again and I want it now - this is our work and we depend on it. We still write about it, but considering how unpopular Xbox already is, nobody is suprsised how&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> up the system is. Regions
 and region lock in 2016...really?</p>
<p>Anyhow, I have running subscription and a lot of games we cannot access now, since Xbox Live is not supported suddenly - worked fine til now. Someone tell me how to contact someone, who can fix this
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong>.</p>
<p>Goal here - to use the Xbox Live Gold again and to be able to actually get the promised FREE games with GOLD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>When you migrate your region, it does warn you that you cannot change it for 3 months. There is no way around that.
</p>
<p>The games with gold also state that they may not be available in all regions. Since you live in a region that is not supported you will have issues downloading a lot of region locked games (which are region locked by the publishers and not Microsoft).</p>

<p>I pray somebody see this from Xbox1. In the middle of the best game of Destiny I ever had I got disconnected. It said I had to hook back up to Live and gave me the option. I, of course hit the A button and nothing, nada, no joy! Well thinking it was an internet
 problem I check that out. Its ok! Next I go to xbox services and there it started. Its when I found out customer service was customer service in name only. After hours of no responses, loop back to where I just came from and singing in endlessly I gave up.
 I've gone and jerked my xbox out of my living room and pulled my Credit Card out of Microsoft altogether. I will now use every means at my disposal to stop ANYONE from buying an Xbox. If I'm in a store and see someone looking I will go over and tell them this
 story. Facebook, Amazon prime and every other social media will be hearing this story. Enjoy the last dime you will EVER get out of me. Maybe, just maybe you will answer the phone next time...... oh yea even that's impossible, well maybe an email..... oh yea
 not possible....... just know I have a mission now........ If I stop 3 people that a $1000 bucks out of your pocket!</p>
<p>cya, at every store, kiosk and place I can find you sell this product!</p>

<p>I know, but the issue was that the error said to change the region and now I am
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong>. This is MS&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> "rules" and other thing like that, so no wonder eveybody is using pirated games on their consoles. Have anyone ever had any isse like that on Playstation?`NO</p>
<p>I want to play it, to make videos and promote the console gaming, but MS is making it really hard and I don't understand it. So there is no way to contact them? At all? For real?</p>
<p>Well, this is going to make a great story. Good things is, that I cannot use the Xbox 360 games on Xbox One before I have downloaded them on Xbox 360, which I cannot do. Well done, MS. Next time, when you have a meeting and see the new records Sony is breaking,
 there is no need to look far for reason.</p>
<p>I want to contant you - &nbsp;I cannot.</p>
<p>You have regions - really? Same game on PS have no region.</p>
<p>I followed your succestions and it got me into trouble and I will lose money. I am smarter now and we will keep the Xbox usage at minimum possible level, with as low hype as we can. I am getting a pretty good understanding, why there is so much hate for
 Xbox out there...bring me back to the end of Sega days....</p>
<p>Someone give me information on how to contact with support - if they acually have any. I imagine they are quite buys if stuff is broken.</p>
<p>I just want to contact and then we'll see, how it goes. Anyhow, this is a lesson and we will milk this "news" as hard as we can - we need something good out of this loss.

<p><span>Hi LeoLab,<br />
<br />
- By "stick note", are you referring to sticky notes?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click "Start", type the following in the Start search box and hit Enter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>%AppData%\Microsoft\Sticky Notes\</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click the StickyNotes.snt file and select “Restore previous versions”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Previous-versions-of-files-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>Previous
 versions of files: frequently asked questions</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the file in notepad. The notes you’re looking for would be here in plain text format. Search for the content of the notes for better results.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> if you do not have any previous versions of the file,

    <title>Remote Deskop Connection - An internal error has occurred. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billstewartng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Deskop Connection - An internal error has occurred.</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;use Windows 7 Professional to remote into a Windows Server 7 and a Windows Server 4 over a VPN link.&nbsp; This has worked successfully for several years, then the other day it stopped working for both servers (using&nbsp;two separate computers).&nbsp; It would say "Connecting"
 for about 10 seconds, then put up the error message "An Internal error has occurred".&nbsp; I thought at first that something had been changed on the remote (servers) end, but their IT department assured me they had made no configuration change, either to the server
 or the various routers.&nbsp; I had not updated either of the Windows 7 computers for about a month before the error started occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the course of the investigation I came up with a possible solution on this website.&nbsp; It said to go to the RDC program and under the "experience" tab to unclick the "Reconnect if the connection is dropped" option.&nbsp; This had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being there, I decided to try other options.&nbsp; Changing the connection speed options had no effect.&nbsp; However, when I deselected the "Consistent bitmap caching" option, all of a sudden it started working.&nbsp; Selecting the option again causes the error!&nbsp; So I
 leave it off!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:&nbsp; Does anyone know why this option would cause a failure all of a sudden, when I had worked before?</p>

            <p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not a virus or infection - just a difficult program to remove (or so it seems).&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's start with some basic options and see if "simple" does the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, download Revo (the free version): <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>.&nbsp; Install it and check for Spotify (or anything that looks like it's Spotify).&nbsp; Use the Advanced mode to uninstall it from the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work (or you can't find it), then download Autoruns <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902</a>&nbsp;and install it and run it and click on the Everything Tab.&nbsp; Now look for any entries (there may be more than one, so check the whole list) that indicate Spotify (especially in Startup programs).&nbsp;
 If found, uncheck the box to prevent them from running at Startup.&nbsp; Once done, reboot and that will probably resolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, check your browser and try no add-ons mode (if it has one - you can find it for IE in Start / All Programs / Accessories) or check the add-ons for any that relate to Spotify in any way and disable and/or delete them.&nbsp; Then if you found
 any, reboot and see if the problem persists.&nbsp; You'll need to do this for any browser you have installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, please explain further what you mean by the "Spotify link".&nbsp; Is it a shortcut or something in the taskbar or a running program or what?&nbsp; Where is it located?&nbsp; If you right click on it and click on properties, does it say anything about where it is
 coming from (a specific location)?&nbsp; Does the link even work at all if you right click it or left click it?&nbsp; Is it working (by which I mean, is Spotify actually running or is the problem just the annoyance of the link appearing)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem persists, please try a clean boot to see if the problem persists.&nbsp; If not, we can resolve it.&nbsp;
<span>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7)
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article.
 Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution
 is not going to work. If using XP, see <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>That's enough for now.&nbsp; We can try other things if these don't work, but let's keep it to just this for now and then, if the problem persists, please answer the above questions and explain
 what happened with each procedure you tried and provide anything else that might be helpful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Complete freeze on startup, unless in safe mode&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys first post!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey all, i've been recently having a very strange problem which has got me really stunted, i've googled for solutions, but no useful results have been churned up, on startup, everything seems fine boots as normal, but as soon as I hit the desktop, i can
 click onto the start button once then the computer will completely freeze up, unable to click any desktop items&nbsp;or start buttons alike, unable access control panel eventually i have to result in a forced restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when i go into safe mode, everything is fine! I've got suspicians it may be the new AVG 2013 update as ever since that update I've been having problems! But i'm hesitant to disable this as it's crucial to keeping my system clean from virus's! I've also
 tested to see if any components 'overheating' may of caused such an issue and all results conclude, no components are overheating. I have also gone into device manager to see if any drivers are outdated and they've all turned up just fine. So simply I'm stuck!
 Oh and I might add, i've also used system restore (Which caused more problems then the no problems it solved) and that has also not sorted the problem!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anybody has any sugguestions, i'd greatly appreciate them! </p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>

            <p>Hi Tom, thanks for your quick reply!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've followed your advice and searched thoroughly through the event logs in system and application folders and there were a few minor errors, but soon found out that they were completely unrelated to the crashes i've been having.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found one error which seems to repeat itself each time the computer starts up which reads as the following -
</p>
<p>The WinRing0_1_2_0 service failed to start due to the following error: </p>
<p>The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched around for a&nbsp;solution to this problem and no useful results have come up, i've also conducted a malware scan to make sure no malware is causing this issue and that come up as clean, I also ran a memory test to see if that was causing any problems,
 that also turned out to be ok. Whilst looking in the application logs I saw no problems relating to AVG, so I think it's pretty safe to rule AVG out now.</p>
<p>The only clue seems to be this error which i cannot find the answers for!</p>
<p>Thanks again for your replies!</p>

            <p>If you do a Search for winring, is it found? Have you uninstalled any software recently, before the SFC problem started?<br />Look in Services (Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services) and see if WinRing is listed there. If so, double-click on it and select Disabled from the drop-down list under Start-up Type.<br />If it's not listed in Services, run MSCONFIG either from Command Prompt or Administrative Tools &gt; System Configuration. Click on the Startup tab and remove the checkmark next to it. That will eliminate WinRing as a possible cause, although I'm not convinced that's where the problem lies.</p><p>Have you ran CHKDSK /R recently?

            <p>I've completed a checkdisk and that did it's stuff, unfortunately it didn't find anything truely irregular and the problem is persisting, I will check inside the tower to see if any dust is building up, though i'm holding it off for the time as doing that
 will involve me taking out every single power cable to get it out in order to do that!</p>
<p>But there has been a development! Tonight i've had a bad time with crashes, took me half an hour to get on! But then i looked in the error log again and this error is flooding the system logs
</p>
<p>The Computer Browser service depends on the Server service which failed to start because of the following error:
</p>
<p>The dependency service or group failed to start.</p>
<p>I've google'd this problem and it has been associated with crashing, though no straight forward solution has come up, some random forums have been saying that it's something to do with the windows installation and needs a system restore. I've done a system
 restore and it didn't sort any problems and the only alternative solutions i've come across apart from that is a full re-format, which I definately want to avoid as I have heaps of important data!</p>

            <p>Before you go much further, I would advise backing up all of your data now to an external HDD. Something is going on, and it seems to be getting worse daily :-( Don't want to lose all of your stuff.</p><p>The Server service depends on the Security Accounts Manager (which depends on Remote Procedure Call(RPC), which in turn depends on DCOM Server Process Launcher and RPC Endpoint Mapper) and Server SMB 1.xxx Driver (which depends on Server SMB 2.xxx Driver, which in turn depends on SRVNET). If any of those aren't running, you'll get the error.</p><p>If any aren't running, then we can start there. It's sounding more and more like an eminent hardware failure, or a malware infestation of some sort. If you have any external devices plugged in that aren't truly necessary (like a printer, external drives, etc.), unplug them, reboot, and see if your errors return.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

            <p>Right ahead of you Tom! I managed to back up all my data as soon as problems started occuring on my external HDD, I've had some progress since!</p>
<p>I'm currently going through the Microsoft Clean Boot procedure. I now know that no services are causing the crashes, which I saw as some good news! I then slowly started enabling the startup programs and turned on the first 10, then there were crashes again!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've now started to run through these programs one by one to see what one or maybe multiple programs are causing the crashes. I'm reserving the idea that this may be a hardware failure as currently my printer is playing up also!
</p>
<p>I'll edit this post and notify you of my results, hopefully it'll be good news!</p>
<p>Edit: Good news! I've started up my computer this morning and there has been no crashes! I slowly went through the startup applications in msconfig yesterday and must of turned off the application causing me problems. I'm slowly turning on the rest of my
 applications to make sure no more applications are causing trouble!</p>

            <p>Your quite right, there was&nbsp;a labtec camera driver application that was uninstalled but for some reason still remained on the computer starting up, there was also a few bogus applications like ''Freecorder toolbar'' and ''Free Download Manager'' that were
 completely useless programs but still starting up without me knowing!</p>
<p>Through disabling these applications through msconfig&nbsp;and uninstalling them fully using Revo's Uninstaller, which also uninstalls any registry keys that may be left over by the uninstallation (Don't worry it backs up registry each time it makes an uninstallation
 just incase anything goes wrong with removing the registry keys!) I've managed to fix this boot problem!
</p>
<p>So I will say this problem is fully and completely fixed, I'm staying aware throughout the rest of the week to make sure the problem doesn't occur again!

            <p>Yeah, I hope it stays fixed as well, this problem was really odd and had me stunted for a while.</p>
<p>Thanks again Tom! Ever since Lavasoft Anti-Spyware decided to turn into a full-on anti-virus program I've been looking for an alternative spyware remover! I already have malware bytes which I used to scan the system at the first stages the problem arised.</p>
<p>Yeah I'm also fully aware of the dangers of toolbars, but unfortunately I'm not the only one who uses this computer and I always warn my family to look at installations carefully, especially for toolbars and they never listen! So problems like this arise!
 Frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But thanks again Tom and again your help solved the problem i've been having to find another spyware program!</p>

    <title>Online Passes&#58; The New Trend - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isaacclarkesnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online Passes&#58; The New Trend</h2>
                    
<p>It seems more and more games are going to start having online passes. I was fine with them when they came free with the game new, such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Dead Space 2. But now it seems like they're taking it a step further, and making you pay
 for the online pass, with the additional purchase of of the game. Look at LA Noire and Mortal Combat: 2011. Both of them featured pass style deals where you buy a pass for a big hefty fee, but you get all of the DLC for a lesser price than paying for each
 one separately. This is where I get confused. Why can't they just do away with the stupid gimmick of "buy now, pay less!". Why can't they just make all of the DLC cheaper?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like this will become the norm. What is everyones take on this?</p>

            <p><b>Personally I think the idea of an online pass to play a game is nothing more than a money-grab... Especially since you're already paying for the internet, and for xbox users, paying for the ability to play online at all.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The way I see it, if I have bought the game, I should be given access to all parts of that game, both offline and online. If you want to charge money for DLC, that's one thing... because that's technically an addition to the game itself I guess. </b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>If you're going to charge people to play online, then you better reduce the cost of the game at release, because it's less valuable than if it had online play included.<br /></b></p>

<p>Well actually, I'm more talking about the newer type of online pass, the "Buy it now! Buy it now!" pack that gives you all of the DLC for a moderate price decrease. I'm not one to buy DLC, I've actually yet to do so since I've gotten my xbox a couple years
 ago, but I do know that all of the DLC is not worth it. Some of it is half-hearted and half made, look at call of duty's map packs. Looking at these DLC passes makes me want to buy DLC even less because if I either buy a couple separately or buy all of them,
 I would feel ripped off.</p>

<p>If you would read, this is more about the DLC online passes, not the ones required to play online that come with the game. These new ones aren't even coming with the game! When I bought Battlefield: Bad Company 2 new I got all of the maps for free. I was
 fine with this. When I bought Dead Space 2 new, I got to play online for free. I was fine with this. But now I buy the game new, but they make me pay for the damn pass now, which should just be included with the games, like they've been doing previously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the next step. They wave all of this free DLC in our face when we buy it new, now we buy it new and we no longer get the pass anymore. After this, I'm sure that you will have to buy a pass to play online even if you
<i>do </i>buy the game new</p>

<p>You don't have to buy anything. This isn't like online MP passes where if you don't buy new, or pay the price, you are denied access to entire game modes within the game. This is like going to Sam's Club. You buy in bulk and save some cash in the long run.
 Or buy each piece individually and pay more in the long run. This may be new for games, but this has been the way of the world for many decades now. Not quite sure what your problem is.</p>

<p>I started noticing these passes as well OP. Personally I would never buy one of them just in case I lose interest in the game before the DLC comes out or maybe I just don't want it.</p>
<p>I am a little confused though, you said that these passes were included in the new game but now they aren't? So before the DLC was free? I ask because I have never gotten a game that included DLC with the purchase of the game.</p>

<p>ROFL</p>
<p>I can't help but laugh at this.</p>
<p>Not at you OP. But this whole idea</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I have been saying this ever since the "new" online pass system started, and people defended it. Saying "Well don't buy it use"</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>"The companies are losing money out due to used sales"</p>
<p>I knew something like this would probably happen.</p>
<p>First they started charging us for added content. That's fine</p>
<p>Then they started charging us for content that was ALREADY on the disk. Not cool</p>
<p>Then they started making incomplete games and released DLC right after release and charged us for that content.</p>
<p>Then they started to complain about how they are losing out on money due to the used sales market (Which was clearly a lie, because you can find out what their yearly profits are, and see that they are still profiting, not losing out on money)</p>
<p>Everyone on here was defending them, and I just said well they are going to keep finding ways to get our money, and it looks like they have</p>
<p>The only way it will ever stop is when people stop paying for it.</p>
<p>Will it? Probably not. Because people just don't care how they spend their money, so long as there are suckers out there willing to pay, these companies will just keep on finding ways into our wallets.</p>

<h2>            Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</h2>
                    <p>My PC has developed a really annoying problem where it will randomly freeze, then the screen will momentarily turn blank, and the system starts responding again. I also have problems with Chrome and Firefox where the browser page just turns white before
 being restored back to normal.&nbsp; Oddly I can move the mouse around when this happens, but not click on anything...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look in the System event log I see the following that co-insides with the blips:</p>
<p>"<em>Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figure this is related to the display driver ( I have an NVidia GeForce 660 GTX).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the driver (in safe mode using DDU).&nbsp; I've re-installed the driver.&nbsp; The problems still persists.&nbsp; I've also re-seated the graphics card and used and alternate PCI-e slot, but the problem still persists.&nbsp; I've reverted to on-board graphics,
 and things are stable, albeit at a lower resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Window's Driver Verifier resulted in my machine not being able to boot into windows.&nbsp; I have the minidump files, but I don't know what to do with them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels like a driver problem, rather than failed hardware, but I don't know how to prove it either way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a way to resolve this?</p>

<h2>            Windows detected hard disk problem - disable in Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Samsung Laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every time I restart the machine windows gives me the "Windows detected a Hard Disk Problem"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a fresh install of Windows so it can't be malware.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I believe the HD to be fine so I want to disable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Looked and found a solution that uses gpedit.msc which isn't part of Windows 7 Home Premium so I downloaded and installed it and it does work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My only problem now is all instructions to disable this error relate to the following path local computer policy-computer configuration-administrative templates-system-troubleshooting and diagnostics-disk diagnostic-disk diagnostic: configure execution
 level</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Only problem is I don't appear to have system troubleshooting folder, and I can't seem to find the necessary setting otherwise.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can this error be disabled in Windows 7 Home Premium??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Richard</div>
</div>
                </div>

Electronic devices do not work on faith. They use facts. If your foot hurts then popping a pain killer won't help. If Windows reports a disk problem then disabling the error message is a bad idea. Much better to perform a thorough disk check, e.g. using this
 console command:
<div><br />
<div>chkdsk.exe /R C:</div>

            Appreciate that buddy but when the computer has just installed Windows from scratch plus a tonne of updates without issue you kinda think the drive might be OK.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've also read that this can be related to SMART disk checking being misinterpreted.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Please find below the report. Like I say the machine is working fine unless this report tells you otherwise. If I could just turn this error off it would probably do me its only used for web browsing.</div>

You're still running on faith. Please take the time to run chkdsk.exe. All other options are pointless until you've covered the very basics. The test you ran only checked the file system but not the disk itself. You MUST use the command I gave you in my first
 reply.

            Thanks Guys. To be honest with you this isn't my laptop its a friends and they only use it for web browsing so if the HD turns out to be faulty ill just replace it when it no longer works. They won't loose any data.
<div><br />
<div>Ill post those things but do you know a way to prevent this message just as a quick fix? If you need to see this info to tell me how to disable then ill do it but if this error can be disabled like it can in other versions of windows 7 I'd love to know
 how.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks once again&nbsp;</div>

I'm afraid your answer is not the solution either. The OP does not want to fix the problem - he wants to hide the symptoms. Why else would he refuse to run a thorough dskchk?

<p>A trick that often works for software that doesn't cləanly UNinstall is to...install it again!</p>
<p>When its installer runs, it (re)crəates the necessary Registry entries, plus any subsidiary files that the unsuccessful uninstall may have messed up.</p>

<p>After the rəinstall, follow the instructions, including the removal tool, in the proper order.</p>

<p>so since I already bought the map packs state side and now am in Japan all the points I used were wasted? Is that pretty much what your saying? I mean is there anyway to donwload the map packs now?</p>

<p>So you literally just moved to Japan after the last map pack came out, or you moved and then attempted to download the content? I guess a better question would have been "Where were you physically when you attempted to download the content?".</p>

<p>What's happening is you are trying to download US content outside of the US. On certain items (like these map packs) they are region locked, meaning if you are in Japan, you can only download the Japanese content and only if you have a Japanese account.
 I'm sorry for the confusion here. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be because of some applications running in the background. So, I suggest you to perform a Clean Boot.

            The Clean Boot didn't help. &nbsp;Although this time the screensaver comes on it only last about a minute and then the screen goes blank and when I try to get back to the screen, the static starts again.

<h2>            File d3dx11_43 missing</h2>
                    I've been trying to fix this for a day or so now and nothing I've done has helped. I got skyrim for my new computer, and I can't run certain things on it without this certain file, but I can't seem to find it at all. When I try to reinstall direct x with
 the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer, it just tells me its already been installed and has no reason to update. (I need Direct x 9, but I have 11. Apparently, that's the solution that is supposed to help but my game still won't work without it.
<br />
<br />
I've asked people, looked over forum posts, and I'm not getting anything yet. In fact, I dont have dll file 43 for 9x, 10x, or 11x.
<br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Since you've reinstalled DirextX already to no avail - I suggest you update your graphics card drivers as that may solve the issue.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />
