<h2>            I keep losing my wireless internet connection windows 8</h2>
                    I would like to know if anyone could give me a straight answer to why I keep losing my wireless connection in widows 8. I have all the drivers updated and the only way to reconnect is to reset my modem. This happens on both my HP desktop PC and my Toshiba
 Laptop I just purchased. I've had the problem since day 1 on my laptop, "Windows 8 OS 64-bit" and had the problem a lot on my HP desktop since upgrading it to Windows 8 64-bit. Toshiba says it will be an easy fix using some setting but seeing as they want
 to charge me even though I just bought it, so I figured maybe Microsoft could actually give a straight answer since their seems to be a lot of people with this problem.<br />

            <p>Hi Gatlin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you keep losing Wireless Internet connection with Windows 8,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer the questions given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Who is your Internet service provider?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you try connecting it wired?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue might arise due to the Third party Antivirus programs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Boot in Safe mode with Networking.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode with Networking and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Click the link and follow the steps “<b>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</b>”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if you face the same issue in safe mode. If the issue doesn’t persists in safe mode, the place the computer in clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try boot the computer in safe mode and then try shutting down the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: <span>Disable third-party Security Software</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On your Computer screen Task Bar next to System Clock..</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>You will see the third-party Security Software Icon.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

I am also losing my wireless connection(s) 



Randomly dropped connections on 3 different installs on 3 different motherboards with 2 different network adapter cards. 



Sometimes it would drop on reboot. 



Sometimes whenever it wanted to with no perceptible rhyme or reason. 



Checked drivers....good..... should be...... I didn't change anything. 



Also tried to manually connect through network  and sharing center.....still nothing. 



Icon shows network availability and strength which is adequate every time. 



 A LAN cable would connect every time. 



Is win 8.1 trying to update behind my back even though I do everything I can to disable your  



spyware ****....I mean updates and security patches? 



Software and machines trying to be intuitive or autonomous is almost always a trash experience  



for the end user in my opinion.   I really don't even think you corporate sucks even care one bit you 



just want to grip every shiny little nickel you can.  I don't think you'll ev

            <p>Hello Ms/Mr Gatlin:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem we are having is that Windows 8 is a complete disaster (filling your screen with blank space is a "feature," but where do the "windows" go?) and Microsoft is having a terrible time getting companies to switch of Win7. I was the exec for support
 for about 13,000 PC's and 8,000 Macs in my last job, and we offered free Macs to people who'd give up their windows machines. Obviously you know why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my knowledge, Microsoft has not acknowledged the problem officially or even promised a work-around or patch. The thing is, it's not "the internet" that's the problem, Macs, Air Books, iPhones and their tablets work just fine. It's only the Microsoft products
 with the problem, so much so that buying thousands of Macs was cheaper than dealing with people we were trying to support on a useless OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how Ballmer et al look themselves in the mirror before they go on stage and announce Microsoft's exciting new plans and the new future of connectivity Microsoft would bring in (I am laughing out loud but Microsoft people say this stuff) with
 the NEXT OS, leaving no resources to fix Sys 8 or 8.1 or force customers off os7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Microsoft has a vision. They always do. It just doesn't include computers that work very well. If you really want a laugh, compare a Surface tablet with an iPad someday. OMG&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess this isn't helpful at all, and I apologize for this, but I will tell you I replaced two very high performance Windows machines and 2 again, very high performance Windows laptops with Macs across the board, even though I've not been a big Mac fan.
 I changed my mind! &nbsp;Good luck</p>

            Hi Bruce
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Please try the steps recommended below to uninstall printer software 
<br />
<br />Option 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter - <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_printer10</a>
<br />
<br />If you are using an HP Printer, use the HP Print and Scan Doctor:
<br />HP Print and Scan Doctor - HP Support
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer
<br />A. Uninstall the Printer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features / Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers
<br />Reinstall the Printer driver
<br />Reboot the computer 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software13/COL61230/mp-147816-1/OJ4650_Full_WebPack_1122.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softlib/software13/COL61...</a>
<br />
<br />        Open the Services window (Windows key + R, type services.msc, press enter).
<br />        Select Print Spooler and click the Stop icon, if it is not stopped already.
<br />        Navigate to C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS and open this file. You may need to show hidden files or enter an administrator's password.
<br />        Delete all contents inside the folder. Do not delete the PRINTERS folder itself. Note that this will remove all current print jobs, so make sure no one on your network is using the printer.
<br />        Return to the Services window, select Print Spooler, and click Start.

            Hi Bruce.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Printer Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC. 
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.   
<br />
<br />3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-uninstall-printer-driver-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/101274-unin...</a>
<br />
<br />4)  Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete  Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.   
<br />
<br />5) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot.
<br />
<br />6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.   
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Fix: DVD Drive Not Detected In Windows 8/10<br />
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.intowindows.com/fix-dvd-drive-not-detected-in-windows-8/</span></a>
<br />
<br />
=====================<br />
<br />
If needed let's test the CD/DVD drive to see if it works at all &nbsp;:<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all (you will need to make these on <br />
another computer&nbsp;since your's will not start - XP, Vista,&nbsp;7,&nbsp;8/8.1 , or 10<br />
or even running&nbsp;Linux&nbsp;does not matter).&nbsp;You could also try booting with <br />
another Windows disk&nbsp;- any OS though do not use&nbsp;it to try to ANY&nbsp;repairs <br />
unless it is absolutely the same&nbsp;version of Windows on your system - just <br />
boot to see if the drive&nbsp;works. You can even&nbsp;make a Windows 10 DVD boot<br />
disc&nbsp;by running the Windows Media Creation tool&nbsp;(on any computer) -<br />
<br />
Windows Media Creation Tool (make 32 or 64 both disk same as the OS<br />
version you are running.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set <br />
the boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Or ry booting to a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are <br />
not some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

            Anytime Upgrade is a retail license, you can transfer it to another computer. It can only be used on one computer at a time.<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>For an Anytime Upgrade key to work on the other computer it must have the same version of Windows 7 - example: if you bought a Home Premium to Professional Anytime Upgrade
 the new computer would also need to currently have Home Premium.</span></p>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Anytime Upgrade Using An Already Purchased Retail Key</span></p>
<p>
<span>In Windows 7, type Anytime Upgrade in the Search programs and files box in the Start menu and click on the Windows Anytime Upgrade icon. From there, you can enter your retail&nbsp; Windows 7 Home Premium/Professional/Ultimate
 product key and perform a simple upgrade. All programs and files will stay on the computer, no disk is needed and it takes about 10 minutes.

<h2>            diskpart error&#58; Virtual Disk Service error&#58; The object is not found.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a computer with a recovery partition.<br />
<br />
Now I want to use standard Windows tools like diskpart &amp; gimagex to<br />
create a WIM from that recovery partition.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately in the disk management GUI I can n ot assign a driver <br />
letter to this disk.<br />
<br />
Therefore I tried to make this partition "non hidden":<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diskpart&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select vol 5<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attribute vol clear hidden<br />
<br />
==&gt; On other volumes this works fine. But not on that recovery partition.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I receive the following error: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtual Disk Service error:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object is not found.<br />
<br />
============================================================================<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. What is the reason therefore?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. How can I solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your help.

            Older utilities cannot run on windows 10. Ask HP if there is an updated version for win 10.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) It happens when i select any date from July 15th 2017 onwards in all views. So for example if i am in "1-day view" and scroll from July 14th to July 15th the message appears at the top. If i continue scrolling forward through days, it stays there, if
 i scroll back to July 14th, the message disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) no</p>
<p>
</p><p>c) it is my hotmail account&nbsp; - the same one that i am logging into this forum with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've inserted an image for you to see the message i am referring to - what does it mean?

            <p>I removed my email account from Calendar which removed all events. I added it back in which added all events back. I then scrolled to July but the message appears again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It now occurs when i move to July 20th and disappears when i move back to July 19th so the date on which this occurs moves on a day each day, and therefore it is stays at 175 days in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info, I can still see all the events in the calendar after July 20th and as far as I can remember there are no events missing, so what does this message mean?</p>

<p>
</p><p>a table that says Google events are only synced 3 months in the past and 6 months in the future. &nbsp;(Apart from recurring events, which are show outside that time range.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link also says that these ranges cannot be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, then I consider it to be a serious flaw in the MS Calendar app, which for me makes it unreliable and unusable. &nbsp;I am sure I am not alone in planning my events more than 6 months into the future.</p>

            <p>Interesting, but i don't have a google account linked to calendar, it is a hotmail account which according to that article should show all future events.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error now occurs from July 27 onwards, so it is still occurring from 175 days in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info i also have a couple of calendars of sports fixture dates that I have imported from a file. One of them is showing events in the calendar correctly after the date where the message occurs, the other does not contain any events past May 2017. So
 neither of these can be responsible for the message.</p>

            <p>This really is annoying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't understand why MS would think it's okay to allow a user to schedule an event 6 month out, but not show it.</p>
<p>Or why MS would think it's okay to tell a user that in order to see all of of their scheduled events, they need to use a competitors Calendar app. &nbsp;IE: Google Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calendar let's me add an event 6 month out from today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it has been added (even though the Calendar app doesn't display it), because it appears on my Google Calendar on my phone as soon as I have added it in the Win 10 Calendar app.</p>
<p>So, I know things are syncing correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sure would be nice if MS would fix this on some "patch Tuesday".</p>

<h2>            Blank screen in Microsoft Solitaire Collection. missing screen elements in Minesweeper</h2>
                    
<p>I updated the Microsoft Solitaire Collection from the store several days ago, and now when I try to play one of the card games (for example, I click on Klondike) it takes me to a black screen.&nbsp; The only thing that isn't just black is the mouse pointer.&nbsp;
 I can hear the cards being dealt, but I can't see anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related to this, I also updated the Minesweeper game, and that doesn't give me a black screen but the screen is missing a lot of the necessary things to play the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled both games from the store, I've rebooted the PC, I've checked Windows Update to ensure I have the latest graphics driver installed.&nbsp; I still have the issues.</p>

            <p>Hey FungiUg - That's no good! There's an extra step in uninstalling/reinstalling that I'd like you to try if you haven't already:<br /><br />&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="left">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" align="left">
<p>1) Right click on the app’s tile</p>
<p>2) Select “Uninstall” and confirm</p>
<p>3) From the Metro UI, type “WSReset.exe” and press enter</p>
<p>4) After you see a confirmation the store cache has been reset, reinstall the app</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p />
<p><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Let us know if this changes anything! If not, we'll go from there :) &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for that. &nbsp;I did as you suggested (I'd already tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but hadn't done the "WSReset.exe" step in the middle). &nbsp;Sadly, no change: Solitaire still gives me a black screen when I click on any of the first three games. &nbsp;What's
 interesting is that for the last two games, it gives me *most* of the screen, similarly to Minesweeper.</p>

<p>Exactly the same problem here on my Desktop using an Nvidia graphics card, but Klondike functions normally on my Sony Vaio laptop.</p>
<p>Any solution in sight?</p>

<p>I never did get a resolution. &nbsp;I've gone through several upgrades, and they still do it.</p>
<p>I did discover if you play with the cards set to a theme other than "classic", the Solitaire collection works. &nbsp;Minesweeper still blanks parts of the screen though.</p>

    <title>Troubleshooter says device does not have bluetooth when it clearly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pomelo123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Troubleshooter says device does not have bluetooth when it clearly does.</h2>
                    <p>One day the bluetooth functionality of my desktop PC suddenly disappeared. It stopped connecting to my speaker, and when I restarted my PC and ran the troubleshooter, it told me my device does not have bluetooth capability and needs an adapter.</p>
<p>However, I know this is not true because I've been using bluetooth on this PC for a year now, and it's had no problems.</p>
<p>Why is this happening, and how can I fix my bluetooth?</p>

            Hi Akhilesh, please try this:
<br />
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chkdsk C: /f
<br />
<br />When that completes, restart your PC, if that file still exists, try deleting that again . . .

<h2>            Banned from Communicating yet i&#39;m not banned&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently came off a ban yesterday morning at 3:30am UK time. I am apparently still banned from communications as i cannot join party's or send messages. Every time i log in it says "Due to a suspension you're currently banned from communications". I spoke to a Xbox Ambassador, he told me it shouldn't be like, and that i should contact xbox support directly on the phone. I then clicked the option for them to "Call me back", and i ended up speaking to 4 different people as 3 of them put the phone down on me.&nbsp;The 4th person was trying to assist me and half way through giving my details and her sorting it out the call apparently "Failed". So i'm sat here STILL banned from all communications and i don't have a clue why. My Enforcement History list has no expiry date on my last ban so it is 100% unbanned. Can someone please try to help me or guide me for what to do next, cus this is getting beyond a joke.</p>

<h2>            Long Start-Up Times &#40;5 minutes or longer&#41;, plus other issues</h2>
                    <p>Since updating to Windows 8 (from 7) 2 days ago, I am experiencing extremely long start-up times.&nbsp; At times, the screen goes black and appears the computer has frozen.&nbsp; If I wait a few minutes, the screen goes on to the next segment of start-up.&nbsp; There is
 a very long time between power-up and the first screen (the photo with time).&nbsp; Then, when moving from there to log-in, there is another long lapse of time (again with the black screen issue).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried updating drivers, removing unnecessary software ... but to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the other challenges (not sure if they're all related to he same issue causing slow start times):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - keyboard is now missing key strokes as I type - completely leaving out letters (every 15th character or so).</p>
<p>2 - NTrig Applet message of failure - even though I updated the drivers.</p>
<p>3 - ATI Catalyst Control Center says it needs updating, but evidently there is not a compatible update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find it very frustrating and disappointing.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using an HP TouchSmart Tx2z-1000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>password numeric code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            password numeric code</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: right">I purcha</div>
I purchased a computer from my brother-in-law &amp; he forgot to remove himself as the administrator. &nbsp;He gave me &nbsp;his password which I put in incorrectly too many times &amp; it blocked me out. &nbsp;I choose the option..I know my password but can't get in. &nbsp;They sent
 a numeric number to him and he sent it to me. &nbsp;It allowed me in but told me I needed to change the password. &nbsp;I changed it but forgot to save it so it doesn't work anymore. &nbsp;I was allowed to add my Microsoft account but I can't remove him as the administrator.
 &nbsp;Would the best solution be for him to change his password and then send it to me so I can change from a standard account to administrator? &nbsp;What else do I need to do? &nbsp;Thank you. &nbsp;

<h2>            Sound Distortion in Samsung Laptop</h2>
                    I recently got a new laptop (pre-installed with windows 7), I am experiencing d a very odd lag. My sound would lag and make this awful screeching static sound both on speaker and headset.<br />
<br />
I do have ubuntu installed and the sound works perfectly fine there but when I boot windows 7 , it's all mess.<br />
<br />
I have tried all the basic audio playback troubleshoot, updated all the drivers from manufacturer and clean boot.<br />
It just keeps getting worse and worse.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            mpminisigstub.exe attempting to create file mpsigstub.exe</h2>
                    I've been receiving this alert from my firewall (Comodo Firewall) for a few days now, it says its signed by microsoft and is trustworthy, yet when I try and check the properties of the mpminisigstub.exe I am prompted that I do not have the authority to
 do that, yet when checking mpsigstub.exe I can check the properties.<br />
This is a bit concerning to me, because within the last couple weeks I've attempted to download some iffy files from the net, which both MSE and Comodo caught and cleaned/blocked.&nbsp; Yet I'm not sure if some of them got to the svchost.exe and was allowed to get
 through my firewall, (I've assigned svchost.exe as trusted for recieving updates to windows).<br />
Is this normal?&nbsp; May I safely allow this operation?<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks and please excuse any computer illiteracy I may have used.<br />

<p><span>Hi Gavee,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you receive?</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft does publish the files Mpminisigstub.exe</span><span><span> and MPSigStub.exe, which
 assists in updating signatures. However, the best bet is to check <span>
if&nbsp;they are properly signed by Microsoft.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>:

            Hello Ajay, and thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
I apologize for the lateness of my reply, I had to wait a couple days till I was prompted by my firewall of the mpsigstub.exe.&nbsp; Now this prompt was a bit different than my original post, this was MPsigstub.exe was trying to modify the C:\Windows\System32\MPsigstub.exe,
 now when I attempt to check the properties of MPsigstub.exe I am prompted with this message; "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permission to access the item".&nbsp; That was the same message that came up
 for my original post when I tried to check the properties of mpminisigstub.exe.<br />
So, I've blocked it till some resolution I guess can come out of this discussion we are having here.&nbsp; I read the reference link you posted, was very informative, yet it's just the "permission to access the item" prompt that is concerning to me, whether some
 malware or what not has concealed itself with some form of trickery.<br />
<br />
Thanks

<h2>            Unable to Add or Connect a BT device under W7 Pro 64 bit.</h2>
                    On my Dell XPS 1640 running W7 Pro, 64 bit with an internal Dell BT 370 card, I have been unable to associate any BT devices. On isolated occasions, the BT devices have shown up in the BT device dialog box but will not connect. In those instances there
 are no services shown under the Services tab of the device properties (the BT service is running under services). Most of the time, the Add A Device finds nothing and will not even see a BT device. The same internal BT card worked find when I was running Vista
 Pro 32 bit installed before the upgrade. <br />
<br />
In another thread, Todd asked me to post information for the BT Hub from the System Event viewer. There are a number of entries called Information and a couple of entries called Errors. Below are two exemplar entires:<br />

<br />
Any assistance on this would be appreciated. Dell has told me it's a MS problem. I have installed the Dell BT drivers for W7 from the Dell web site (I also tried the older Vista drivers as well as the drivers for an older BT model card).<br />
<br />
Thanks again for any thoughts.

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Do let us know the version of the driver you have installed. Are you getting any exclamation or
 cross marks for your installed driver in device manager? </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The issue does seem with the Bluetooth drivers installed on your computer. I would request you
 to check after installing the drivers you used with vista in vista compatibility mode in windows 7 and then check –</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To run the Program Compatibility troubleshooter -</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search
 box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows&nbsp;and select Vista compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>

            Thank you for your reply. I have tried a number of different drivers. The latest Dell driver for my BT 370 card for W7 64 bit and the newest Widdcom driver (version 6.2.0.900) for W7. If I uninstall the driver via the Control panel, nothing will show up
 in device manager as a BT device. There won't even be a category. I will uninstall the current driver I have loaded adn tyr the Vista 32 bit driver in compatibility mode to see if it works. The troubleshooting link you posted doesn't apply to me because nothing
 gets loaded or shows up in the Device screen. I can not get W7 to find anything.
<br />
<br />
BTW, the troubleshooter says it does not work on an msi program and that is what the driver is, isn't it? Not sure how to get the driver to run in compatibility mode?

            OK, I tried all the steps above and nothing is working. The Add a Device finds absolutely nothing. The driver installed and the BT card shows up in Device Manager as properly installed. I installed the Vista driver under compatibility mode but I am not
 sure how effective that is as the troubleshooter guide says compatibility mode does not run with a msi file. SO basically I am back to square one.
<br />
<br />
I guess there are no generic drivers for this as when I uninstall the Dell/Widcomm drivers and reboot, nothing is detected in device manager.
<br />
<br />
I am open to any other ideas. Thanks.

<p>This hardware is "invisible" to plug and play in Windows until the Widcomm/Dell software package is installed, which isn't a standard implementation.&nbsp; if the software&nbsp;package says it's for 64 bit Windows 7, Dell or Broadcom should be the people to investigate
 this, but I'll try to help.&nbsp; Take a look at the logging instructions I put in this thread:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/a156b107-0269-4489-b3cc-d0222cadb3a7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7hardware/thread/a156b107-0269-4489-b3cc-d0222cadb3a7/</a>&nbsp;and I will try to get a look at the problem.<br />
<br />
Just turn on tracing, reboot, turn on bluetooth visibility for some device you want to pair with, then search for Bluetooth devices for 15 to 20 seconds.&nbsp; I don't need any more logging than that to determine if the Windows drivers are able to find anything
 at all, or if this may be a hardware problem.&nbsp; Then run the turn off tracing command, gather the Bluetooth_Traces folder on your desktop into a zip file (right click, send to compressed folder) and share it in your sky drive or some other public location.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Todd, I ran the logger, although it might have been longer than you asked for. Sorry I didn't see that part. I uploaded it to my SkyDrive account. it located here:<br />

Anyting you can let me know would be appreciated. A device was never found.<br />

<p>Thank you very much for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually not my computer, I am just helping someone with this. In May this year, they had some kind of intruder via RDP that was running some "RDPForcer" program. We changed password and changed the RDP port to something else. Perhaps this intrusion
 has something to do with the security rollups suddenly not installing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to the answers on your questions:</p>
1a) Around 2012<br />
1b) Lenovo<br />
1c) No<br />
1d) No<br />
2) Microsoft Security Essentials is active. There's also Mcafee Security Scan Plus installed - but it's not active. I will remove it.<br />
3) McAfee and Norton have been installed<br />
4) No<br />
5a) KB4014504 is installed.<br />
5b) Yes, KB4022168 is an optional update.<br />
6) Java version installed: Version 8 Update 121<br />
7) Yes, version 26,0,0,131 is installed.<br />
8a) December 4th 2013<br />
8b) 11.0.9600.18449 (KB3185319)<br />
9) Firefox 48.0.2 and Google Chrome 59.0.3071.115 is installed.<br />
10) No (nothing like this installed on the computer at this moment, don't know about the past, but I think not)
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you again.</p>

<p>This is a Consumer-specific, peer-to-peer support forum. I'm not sure I can help you fix someone else's computer. Ideally, you'd be posting in the appropriate Win7 IT Pro-specific forum =&gt;
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/home?category=w7itpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/home?category=w7itpro</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I can offer you some tips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The last time a critical security update for Win7 was installed on the computer-in-question was on or shortly after 13 September 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the owner&nbsp;had never run&nbsp;the Norton Removal Tool as well as&nbsp;the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool by the time Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) was installed, chances are MSE is not installed or working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Chances are (99.99%) the HP computer came with a Norton free-trial preinstalled. Doesn't matter if it was never used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Norton and McAfee applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Over the years we've learned that sometimes it's too late for the Norton and/or McAfee removal tools to "come to the rescue." This may be another one of those times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. The computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All business &amp; personal data should be considered at-risk, if not already compromised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were tasked with fixing the computer, I'd format the HDD &amp; then do a clean install of Windows.</p>

    <title>Ori and the blind forest - Xbox &#34;unavailable&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ori and the blind forest - Xbox &#34;unavailable&#34;</h2>
                    Hi everyone. Really hoping someone can help me.<br />
<br />
"Ori and the blind forest" was availible for XBOX. I purchased it on the way home tonight.<br />
It was discontinued and left for Windows PC, and I was unclear that had happened. It was the windows version that I accidentaly paid for.
<br />
I thought I was paying for the XBOX version. <br />
The game still works for anyone who bought it for the Xbox- it hasn't been globally shut down, in some way.<br />
<br />
Is there anything we can do to gain access to the Xbox version, seeing as I have paid for it, and that is what is advertised on the Microsoft store?<br />
Is there a code I could redeem that can change the order, seeing as the game is still viable on Xbox?<br />
<br />
I can start contact with anyone else, proove payment, show that the Microsoft store has it displayed with "Xbox" in the item image.<br />
This seems unfair, and any help would be really appreciated.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Game compatibility is to the discretion of the developer, whether or not they will bring back the Xbox version of the game would be on their end. Unfortunately there would not be any way to access the version for Xbox. If the purchase for the game ended
 up being for Windows 10 and you're on the Xbox One platform, try requesting a refund for the game since there is no way to play it. Check out our:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Request a Refund </a>form; There, our refund specialists are ready to take your request and help as much as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, thanks again!</p>

            I believe this is temporary while they change SKUs as Ori comes to Game Pass. I'd give it 24 hours and see if the new Definitive Edition skus come up in your purchase list.&nbsp;

            Hi again, and thank you for the advice.<br />
<br />
I waited while out of town, just to see what would happen, and the issue is still an issue; I own a copy of the game, advertised and available for Xbox, but I'm simply unable to download it, remotely or directly.<br />
It's as if I bought a PC only copy, as it's available on the Microsoft/Xbox store right now, during the Black Friday sales.<br />
I'm confused, is all, and doubt I'll get a refund.

    <title>Bluetooth Suddenly Stopped Working - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth Suddenly Stopped Working - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Bluetooth suddenly stopped working in the middle of listening. Up until today, it worked flawlessly. Now, the toggle button has disappeared, the Bluetooth tile has disappeared from the notifications panel, and I can't remove/add any devices I previously
 connected to. I have tried running the troubleshooter on, both, the hardware and the Bluetooth. The Bluetooth troubleshooting tells me that my computer is not Bluetooth compatible, which is impossible because just a few minutes ago and the previous 11 months,
 the computer has provided Bluetooth flawlessly. I have downloaded the latest Bluetooth drivers and installed them to my computer, still not Bluetooth. I have restarted my computer several times, still no Bluetooth. I have opened up device manager, showed the
 hidden devices, and updated all of the drivers that could possibly be related to Bluetooth, and none of them needed updating. I have turned "Bluetooth Support Services" on and to automatic, from manual, in the Services window, and still not Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current laptop's model is Lenovo Flex 5 1470, running Windows 10 Home version 1803.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help? At a loss for what to do next.</p>

            Hi MCha,<br />
<br />
Noting the troubleshooting you've completed on your end, one of the suggested methods in your computer's make and model support site is to make sure that Bluetooth is enabled.<br />
<br />
When Bluetooth is not turned on, it may not show up in the Control Panel or Device Manager. To enable the Bluetooth radio, press the key or button to enable your wireless adapter. This key may be the,
<strong><em>F8 </em></strong>or press <em><strong>Fn+F5</strong></em> <em>(or F5)</em>. Check if your device has a Bluetooth hardware switch.<br />
<br />
It was also stated that when the Bluetooth toggle is missing from Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Airplane mode, it is possible that the installed drivers are corrupted.
<em><strong>Uninstall </strong></em>the current driver, then <strong><em>restart </em>
</strong>your computer. Upon restart, Windows will automatically install the nearest driver that is compatible or the generic driver for your Bluetooth.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If no changes were made prior to this issue, the last suggested option was to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
perform a system restore</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If restore didn't sort the issue, then you'd need to have your laptop serviced for a possible hardware issue or ask for assistance from Lenovo support for BIOS updates.<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have other concerns.<br />
<br />
All the best!<br />

    <title>Weird right-click bug - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weird right-click bug</h2>
                    Over the past week or two I've encountered this weird bug on my PC whenever I right-click on a file or folder (though rebooting the computer does fix the issue but it always comes back) that doesn't allow me to see the submenu and options for the object..
 I'm not so sure what causes it but I haven't found any malware that might through a virus scan as far as I can tell at least. It's not a major problem since rebooting is quick enough but it is kind of annoying all the same. It also seems to extend to the start
 menu but my browser windows are unaffected.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ffa0094-5be4-48f2-9aff-2cde4190c820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ffa0094-5be4-48f2-9aff-2cde4190c820" /></a>

</span></span></p>
<p>The following link has some info and a download to ShellExView which you can use to selectively disable third party context menu handlers to find out a problematic one:</p>

<p>You could try disabling all non-Microsoft context menu handlers and then, if the problem resolves, re-enable them one at a time to see which one was the problem.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of in regards to prior changes is an update that was done on april 22nd but it did turn out that I had another update available after a manual search that I've now downloaded. I'll have to wait and see if there's any improvement

<p>We recommend performing a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean</a><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> boot</a> to check if any third party software is causing an issue, as clean boot is performed to start Windows by using
 a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</p>

            A reset didn't seem to help either, nor did disabling third-party extensions through Shell Extension Manager as per auggy's suggestion earlier.

<p>Funnily enough I've now had the computer on for a couple of days at whch point the issue by all rights should have reappeared which it has not. The only thing that's different is that I haven't had Microsoft Edge open this whole time, this is either a strange
 coincidence or something within the browser that caused the problem. I could try to open it and see if that has any effect now that I'm fairly confident the problem will stay gone if I leave it as is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update: Less than a day after I turned on Microsoft Edge the problem returned. This could still be a coincidence but I think something's off here.</p>
