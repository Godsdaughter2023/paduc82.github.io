<p>Yes, you should stay away from it. Any crapware installed - with or without your knowledge or consent - from "SlimWare Utilities Inc" you may wish to remove ASAP.</p>

<p>You should 'always' get your Driver Software from your Computer or Hardware Manufacturer, not through third-party programs or via Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer or Hardware Manufacturer's website &gt; Driver and Software Support Section &gt; look up your Computer or Hardware Model number &gt; then your Operating System &gt; locate the correct Drivers &gt; download and install them yourself.</p>

<h2>            Stop Windows 10 from installing Chinese &#40;PRC&#41; handwriting</h2>
                    <p>I had my windows 10 updated to Version 10.0.17763.475. Afte that, it continues trying to install Chinese (PRC) handwriting and I cannot stop it from doing so. I even changed my language settings to avoid the handwriting feature. I don't need this handwriting
 feature and How can I disable this notifications?</p>

<p><span>Hi Galvin,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how annoying it must be for you. For us to isolate the issue and to assist you better, we’d like to know more information on this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you using a metered connection?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We can try a few steps and check if we can fix this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Check if metered connection is turned on.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might be due to a metered connection. A metered connection is an internet connection that has a data limit associated with it. If metered connection is on, some updates or some optional feature won’t be installed automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are using a metered connection, I’d suggest you to turn off the metered connection until the Chinese (PRC) feature finish installing and check. Refer this article on
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028458/windows-metered-connections-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, follow method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Remove and Add the Chinese language pack.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer this article on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4496404/windows-10-manage-the-input-and-display-language#input_language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Remove extra language packs or keyboard languages</strong> section and <strong>
Add a keyboard</strong> section to remove and add Chinese language.</span></p>

<p>Hi Naveen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to replace Chinese (PRC) language package to Chinese Singapore language package, it doesn't help. once i install any Chinese language package, the system will automatically start to install the handwriting package and even&nbsp; though I choose not
 to install it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no metered connections, that's not an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is two issues here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I don't want to download the Chinese handwriting feature while the system automatically download and I cannot stop it.</p>
<p>2. The Chinese handwriting feature download is problematic. The error I received is below</p>

<h2>            Prints Okay But Won&#39;t Scan in newly installed Windows 10</h2>
                    Using my Brother DCP 7020 I am able to print but I am unable to scan.&nbsp; My printer is shown as compatible with MS10, and it shows up in the "New Scan" box.&nbsp; However, when I click "scan" a message comes up that "A problem prevented the document from being
 scanned...".&nbsp; I can't tell what that problem is.&nbsp; Any idea?

<p>Only now today i see that the pc was freezing/stuck/hanging and i needed to shut it down and restart it on my own.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The kernel power event ID 41 error occurs when the computer is shut down, or it restarts unexpectedly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are scenarios that causes event 41. Which of these 3 scenarios are you experiencing:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Scenario 1: The computer restarts, and there is a Stop error BugcheckCode in the event data.</li><li>Scenario 2: The computer is shut down by pressing and holding the power button.</li><li>Scenario 3: The system randomly restarts and no Stop error BugcheckCode is listed, or the computer is completely unresponsive (hard hang).</li></ul>

<h2>            Dictation not working.</h2>
                    When dictating into a document, the dictation box pops up. I do not want to use the dictation box. When I go back to my document, it says in the dragonbar that I can dictate and use voice commands, but then my voice command is not transcribed into the
 document where I want it.

<h2>            Your display could not connect</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Today I updraged from Win 8.1 to Win 10 and now I can't connect to my SmartTV through miracast. The TV is listed in devices, and whenever I try to connect, it downloads some software (as if it were a new device) and then I get the error message "Something
 went wrong. Your display could not connect". Until yesterday, with 8.1, everything was sooth sailing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help fixing this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This problem may arise due to absence of latest drivers for your PC and the latest firmware for your wireless display or Miracast adapter. I suggest you to follow the below given methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to run<strong> </strong>the <strong>Hardware and Devices
</strong>troubleshooter and check if it helps<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type troubleshooting in the search bar.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>View all</strong> on the top left corner.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click<strong> </strong>on<strong> Hardware and Devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check if issue persists.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may also update all the drivers from Device Manager manually and check if this helps.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand all drivers one by one.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></li></ul>

            <p>Parth Patel, thank you for your prompt reply. Unfortunately, neither method solved the problem. The troubleshooter fixed something with my hardware, apparently, but still no connection through Miracast; all device software was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the article, but it did not fix the issue (I can confirm that both my TV and my laptop are connected to the same Wifi, and both devices support Miracast -- I had been using it frequently until I upgraded to Win 10 on Sunday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other advice you could offer?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't follow your instructions unfortunately. I opened the Device Manager and found my TV listed under Miracast Display Services. I can go to Proporties and Uninstall the Driver, but then can't find it again to move on to point 2. And anyhow, under Properties
 I can't find a Compatibility tab.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is how can I back up the whole system including the installed&nbsp;programs and their installation data.</p>
<p>I want to make it clear,&nbsp; backing up personal data like my documents or my music (except program/games data folders)
<strong>isn't</strong> the case.</p>
<p>I just want to backup the system (including drivers, register and other releated files)&nbsp;and it's&nbsp;installed programs.</p>
<p>I tried to backup the whole drive.</p>
<p>The problem I encountered with is "Windows Backup failed while trying to read from the shadow copy on one of the volumes being backed up".</p>
<p>In other words I want to know which folders to backup and which not to (without get this error again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gratefully,</p>
<p>Guy.</p>

    <title>Headphone jack not picking up headphones - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Headphone jack not picking up headphones</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>I'm currently having a problem with my laptops headphone jack. When I plug in the headphones it doesn't seem to pick them up and continues to play though the internal speakers, no sound through the headphones at all. I have tried to set my headphones as
 my default device but i doesn't give me the option to do so (the option is grayed out), also coming up as disconnected even though they are plugged in. I have tried resetting my laptop, but that didn't help either, I have also tried several pairs of headphones
 and with the same result. I have also updated my driver but that also didn't help. It worked perfectly fine up until a few days ago. I've also only had this laptop for about 3 months and haven't dropped it. I have checked for viruses and bug but came up clean.</p>
<p>My laptop is a Dell Latitude E6430 with &nbsp;windows 7 and core i5, if i am correct the driver is a microsoft driver (Realtek refused to load).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Paola Gar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only update I have done before the problem occurred was the usual update when it prompted me to do it when it would switch off (the one where i would press shut down and it would tell me not to switch off or unplug my laptop before it was complete),
 and other than that I have done no other updates. I have reset it to a time before the update but that was after the problem occurred.</p>
<p>I have tried the troubleshooting but it only came up with "External Device Unplugged" even when it was plugged in.</p>

<p>In that case, we recommend that you try to update your laptop's audio driver again. There is a possibility that there is an issue with your laptop's audio driver that's why it's not detecting your headphone. To do this, refer to the article below:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If Windows is unable to find a driver for your device, you may visit your device manufacturer's website. Once you have the updated driver, check the article again and follow the steps under
<strong>To download and update a driver yourself</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>This is a question you should ask Cannon support:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Forum:&nbsp; http://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Printer-Multifunction-Support/bd-p/faxing</li><li>Your model seems to be sold in the UK/Europe, so this is UK support: <a href="https://www.canon.co.uk/support/consumer_products/contact_support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.canon.co.uk/support/consumer_products/contact_support/</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you have replaced the black ink cartridge AND run one or two normal cleaning cycles and one "deep cleaning" cycle AND printed the nozzle check pattern and you still can't print black, the problem likely is a clogged print head.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read through the long thread here (<a href="http://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Printer-Multifunction-Support/printer-not-printing-black/td-p/100692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Printer-Multifunction-Support/printer-not-printing-black/td-p/100692</a>).&nbsp;
 Although it deals with different models of Canon printers, I expect the problem will be the same, although the model numbers for the ink cartridges and the specific directions for performing the nozzle check and running cleaning cycles likely will be different.&nbsp;
 For directions specific to your printer, see your User Guide (<a href="http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/1/0300025221/02/TS5000ser_OnlineManual_Win_EN_V02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/1/0300025221/02/TS5000ser_OnlineManual_Win_EN_V02.pdf)</a>.&nbsp;
 There seem to be two solutions mentioned in that thread:&nbsp; change the paper type setting or recycle the printer and buy a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd rather not throw away your printer, perhaps the suggestions in this article will help:&nbsp;

</p><p>What gives? If windows creates these 100mb partitions itself during install why isn't everyone else having this problem?</p>

            <p>I had this same problem trying to upgrade Win7 on a 256GB SSD.&nbsp; I didn't want to mess with resizing partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fix: (described below) only took an extra two hours. Now I'm all updated, all programs and data accounted for and working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Western Digital website and downloaded the free Acronis True Image program they give you to clone your hard drive to another drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Cloned the 256 GB SSD to a 600GB Western Digital Raptor.</p>
<p>Step 2: Disconnect SSD and booted to the 600GB Western Digital Raptor</p>
<p>Step 3: Got to control panel, open windows update, and start upgrade to Windows 10. (Now it works)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After update completed and Windows 10 activated...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Samsung website and downloaded the Samsung Data Migration tool. (Samsung's tool to clone your hard drive to the Samsung SSD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4: Cloned the 600GB (UPDATED) Western Digital Raptor back to the 256GB Samsung SSD.</p>
<p>Step 5: Disconnect the 600GB Western Digital Raptor and boot to SSD. (upgrade finished - everything working)</p>

<p>no, its almost impossible for the xbox system to overload your routers processor, causing a reboot. try going to your routers Admin Log and see if theres anything in there regarding the reset. also, is it limited to destiny on the xbox&gt;? or any game on the
 xbox.</p>

    <title>How to Disable Skydrive and Windows Picture Gallery when sending - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> average joe in canada  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Disable Skydrive and Windows Picture Gallery when sending pictures via Right Click &#62; email process</h2>
                    <p>Somehow in the last week I have lost the ability to send pictures via Windows live email client. Prior to this week I would select a few pictures I wanted to email, then right click&gt;email and I could choose the size of the pictures. The pics would then be
 added to my email as attachments and I would hit send.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However when I do the exact same process as I have been doing for the last 3 years soemthing has changed.&nbsp; After I right click and select e-mail the mail client opens up and a small window appears prompting me to log into windows live and there some mention
 of skydrive and picture gallery. I don't have an account, I don't want to use skydrive or picture gallery. If I close that window without logging in and hit send in the email window the email fails to send and gets stuck in my outbox.&nbsp; The mail client will
 tell me when I try shutting down the client that I have unsent mail and so I want to send it. When I say yes nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking to return my laptop to the original way it used to send pictures via the right click method as it allows me to resize pictures for those with small displays plus it is a very fast method of sending pics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Windows Live Mail 2011. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks alot for the help!</p>

<br />
You must have, because you have to have one to be able to post your question here.<br />
<br />
If you were able to right-click on an image file and successfully use <em>Send to &gt; Mail recipient</em>, you must have been signed in in Windows Live Mail with a Microsoft Account. It doesn't work otherwise. Open Windows Live Mail and use the right-most button
 on the <em>Home </em>tab of the ribbon to sign in with a Microsoft Account. You can use the same one you used here. Then try
<em>Send to &gt; Mail recipient </em>again. You will see a message compose window with a 'photo album' in the body of the message. Click on a picture; you can click the paperclip on the&nbsp;<em>Format</em> tab that appears to remove the photo album and to attach the
 files in the traditional way.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
If you use the <em>Attach files </em>dialogue to reduce the size of the image file, the smaller file will be passed to Windows Live Mail for transmission, either to SkyDrive or as an attachment to the message as I explained earlier. You don't need to make further
 adjustments to size in the message compose window.

            <p>Regardless of whether I have a hotmail account or not, prior to last week I&nbsp; never had to log into anything to send my pictures which I could resize via the right click send to method.&nbsp; I want to return my system to the way it was previously.&nbsp; I have had
 other advice which was to install Live Mail 2009 which never forces you to log into anything and functions as my old method did.&nbsp; Is 2009 available for download somewhere? I have searched the Microsoft site and have not found the specific 2009 file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't want skydrive or windows gallery features just like I did one week ago with my live mail</p>

<p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/efc479b4-f383-4eb9-b507-fff6e970e373" title="Robert B.(2)">

<p>　</p>
<p>Thank you for posting here in the Microsoft Account forums and we apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I understand you attach HD images by using right click options while in the image gallery however Windows Live Mail only gives you original, large and medium sizes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail was not meant to edit images therefor it can only give you as much options when you need to attach an image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to preserve the quality of the images, we recommend you use a photo editing software to shrink its size before attaching.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Let us know if you have questions or need further assistance.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Roland</p>

<p>We appreciate the update and we apologize for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that this reply was on 02/15/14, we are not sure if this was addressed but we'd like to informed you that there were changes to the features of Windows Live Mail. 2009 is no longer available however the 2011 version was designed based on the newer
 features, services and security protocols. This is why it asks you to login when you attach from the image gallery.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>however if you think this feature is still beneficial, our Microsoft Product team would be glad to hear it from you. You can send a feedback through

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the drives , it didn`t help. I think that they are using Intel GPU, maybe that might be the problem, i tried to update it from website but it didnt let me ( redirected me to ASUS), but nVidia is updated. As i mentioned before it happens only when
 its on Extend, when it on Clone or Use only 2nd i works fine.</p>

    <title>Massive OneDrive problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darrenc1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Massive OneDrive problem</h2>
                    <p>OK, my music collection is giving me horrible grief with the new way OneDrive works. &nbsp;Currently, my entire music collection is being simultaneously duplicated down and back up and OneDrive refuses to allow me to stop this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My music collection consists of 25,088 files spread across 6559 sub-folders. &nbsp;When I upgraded to Windows 10, my music folder in OneDrive immediately appeared with a big red X on it. &nbsp;I figured I would just get to it later and see what was up with it, but
 I started getting notices that music files couldn't be merged. &nbsp;Upon investigating, I see that OneDrive is renaming all my local files by appending the computer name onto the end of the file name (from filename.mp3 to filename-computername.mp3). &nbsp;It's then
 downloading the copy from OneDrive and also uploading the newly renamed copy to OneDrive. &nbsp;The result is that every one of my music files are being duplicated both locally and on OneDrive. &nbsp;Only the music folder is doing this, and my guess is that it's simply
 something to do with the fact that local files have been accessed many times since they were originally sync'd (though obviously, they haven't been actually modified).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the real kicker is that I can't find a way to stop this. &nbsp;And I'm not talking prevent it - I'm talking actually just stop the process to allow me to regroup and figure out a plan - unless I completely kill OneDrive. &nbsp;If I uncheck the music folder from
 the list of folders to sync, it says it can't complete my request because it hasn't finished yet and has unresolved errors. &nbsp;What it reports as errors are all the duplicate files. &nbsp;The stated resolution in 'view sync problems' is to delete the local file and
 download a new copy if they're really the same (or rename the file if it's actually different and I want to keep both - which is what OneDrive is doing automatically and I need to stop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, despite the fact that there are over 25,000 of them in more than 6500 folders, I decided to try the delete option. &nbsp;Then, lo &amp; behold, OneDrive is deleting the file locally AND in the cloud - despite the fact that this is the stated resolution and it
 should trigger OneDrive to download the file again, not delete it from the cloud. &nbsp;So in reality, it is claiming the files to be different and unmergable, yet simultaneously deleting the cloud version by the same name even though it claims the cloud version
 is a different file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allowing this to simply run its course is just not an option. &nbsp;My internet is DSL, so I have slow upload speeds and OneDrive brings my entire internet (up and down) to a halt while it's uploading. &nbsp;The original upload of these files took turning my entire
 internet over to OneDrive all night every night for about 3 months. &nbsp;Before I would go through that again, I would just stop syncing my music to the cloud - but it refuses to let me stop syncing it until it finishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or suggestions on how to salvage this short of moving all my music to an external drive and just wiping out my entire local music library (and thus wiping out my cloud library right along with it)?</p>

<p>I can stop OneDrive with no problem at all. &nbsp;That's currently what I'm having to do to get the syncing to stop. &nbsp;But that doesn't fix the problem - I can't just leave it permanently off as I still need it for other things (and ideally for streaming my music
 remotely as well). &nbsp;But turning it off doesn't fix it, and as soon as I start it back up it picks right back up where it left off. &nbsp;And while it's off, there is no way to make changes to the sync settings. &nbsp;Once I start it back up, it resumes syncing and still
 refuses to allow me to stop those folders from syncing, presumably until it finishes sometime in the not-too-near future.</p>

            If you have a portable hard drive on hand... can you just move ALL the files from your OneDrive folder to the portable hard drive to back them up. Then you can delete them off your computer since you have them backed up on your portable hard drive. Then
 let OneDrive do it's syncing shenanigans and let it finish. Tell me if that makes any sense.&nbsp;

            <p>Yeah, that's what I was planning as a last resort if I couldn't find another way of clearing it out. &nbsp;The big problem with that option is that when I remove the local copy OneDrive also deletes the cloud copy since the folder is set to sync. &nbsp;That's why
 I was hoping for a way to force the sync to abort so that I could turn sync off on that folder. &nbsp;If I lose the cloud copy, there's really no good scenario for me to upload it all again from my local system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently starting up an Azure instance, and I'll sync that with my OneDrive and let that instance grab a copy of all the music files, then once I remove them locally and OneDrive deletes them all, I'll remove the sync option from my local system and
 get it all straightened out then use the Azure instance to copy all the music back to OneDrive. &nbsp;The bandwidth in Azure can move all the files in a few hours, rather than the few months it will take using my internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, though, I'll still be stuck with a local copy that I can't automatically sync to OneDrive without triggering this duplication problem all over again. &nbsp;That kinda sucks, as every new song I ever acquire will then have to be manually uploaded via
 the web interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <strong>really dislike</strong> the way OneDrive works now, and I'm seriously considering the possibility of using that Azure instance to send my music to Google Play instead of back to OneDrive.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 lags unless a monitor is hooked up HDMI</h2>
                    <p>I have a Gigabyte P37 with windows 10, I7, 1070GPU, 4k Screen, and 2 SSD.&nbsp; Windows is laggy and windows explorer can lag 2 seconds while navigating files. However; If I hook up a TV to the HDMI port everything works like all my other PCs no lag and runs
 way faster than the other 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also manifests while opening games Doom without monitor 2 min before the game launches; Doom with monitor loads almost instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be some sort of HDCP issue?</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How long have you been having that issue with your laptop?</li><li>Did it come with Windows pre-installed?</li><li>Have you done or received any updates on it prior to the issue?</li><li>Does it act like that only when it's connected to a network? </li><li>When you say HDCP, were you referring to DHCP?</li></ul>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking some time! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the issue since I bought it last November but there were larger issues with how windows was handling the 4k screen resolution which overshadowed this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was pre-installed but there was&nbsp;no bloatware so I didn't feel the need do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the windows updates are current and it looks like the last update helped with some other issues but not this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No difference when it is on or off network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HDCP not DHCP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HDCP (High Definition Copyright Protection) is my current line of thinking since the problem goes away when I have an HDCP 2.2 television hooked up to the HDMI port on the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
