<h2>            Music Library folder says &#39;unresponsive&#39; in Windows Media Player.</h2>
                    OT: Hi, I have a Dell laptop running windows 7 Enterprise, and organize my music in Windows Media Player.
<br />
Hi,<br />
I have a Dell laptop running Windows 7 Enterprise.<br />
I organize my music in Windows Media Player, download from Amazon, using their download tool.<br />
<br />
A few days ago, I downloaded a few songs, and now, less than half my music is in Win Media Player, and when I click Organize, then Music, it shows 2 locations:<br />
C::\Users\User\ Downloads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it states next to this&nbsp; Unresponsive<br />
C::\User\User\Music&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it states&nbsp; Default save location&nbsp;&nbsp; Unresponsive<br />
<br />
I ran Media Player Troubleshoot, and it stated I have a corrupt file.<br />
<br />
Also, I have not updated to Service Pack 1, as I'm not sure it's worth it, and, since I purchased this computer from a private party, am concerned that it may ask for Windows Authentification, which I don't think I have, even though I'm fairly sure it's legit.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />

            Thanks Vjay,<br />
I've followed a couple of the procedures so far, but no luck yet.<br />
When I ran the System File Checker, it didn't find any bad files.<br />
<br />
I'll run SP1 and attempt them again.<br />
<br />
You help is appreciated.<br />

<p>This is an interesting issue, bldxbox1. As long as their are 800 points in the account they should be able to change the gamertag. Can you tell me exactly what the error messaging says when attempting to do so? I'm specifically interested to know if you
 see any numerical error codes at any point during the process.</p>

            Could you post the details of the error logs I mentioned in my earlier reply? 
<br />
<br />Also, could you try disconnecting any non-essential hardware that might be attached to your system; keeping only mouse and keyboard attached?
<br />
<br />If you can open the system unit, try swapping out memory modules then try booting the system.
<br />
<br />If your motherboard supports onboard graphics, try connecting to that and remove any video add in cards.

    <title>IIS&#47;PHP Install on Win Server 2008R2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larryb22  say:</h3>
<h2>            IIS&#47;PHP Install on Win Server 2008R2</h2>
                    <p>&lt;p&gt;I am trying to build a webserver with PHP support. I am trying to install PHP 5.5.15 (NTS)&amp;nbsp;on Windows Server 2008 R2, using IIS 7.5. I have installed all available service packs/updates to Server 2008. I have downloaded the Windows msi&amp;nbsp;installer
 from from php.net for php. While I am very Windows networking compliant (MCSE, 20 yrs experience), I am an extreme novice when it comes to php and am not a programmer. I am having three (3) problems - 1) I am not sure I have installed php, or installed it
 correctly. How do I tell? I have installed CGI and related services/features on Server 2008. 2) When I double click win-cgi nothing happens, so that's why I think I may not have installed php, or installed it properly. I am trying to execute an open source
 php script that creates a social networking/dating website. I have edited the php.ini file as directed by the script install instructions, but when I attempt to execute the script, I get the third 3) problem&amp;nbsp;with the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have 4 error(s):</p>
<p>1) Please install "PDO" PHP extension with MySQL driver.</p>
<p>2) Please install "GD" graphics PHP extension.</p>
<p>3) Please install "cURL" PHP library.</p>
<p>4) Please install the "mbstring" PHP extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have placed the php files in a folder called "PHP55" and confirmed the files are in the folder. I am running MySQL server v5.6. Please help. I don't know what is missing or what I am doing wrong. If I had had hair, I wouldn't. I would have pulled it all
 out by now. So all that remains is deciding which temple to point the gun at. I believe the resolution is simple, just not sure how to resolve it. Please post your questions/replies here, or reply directly to:&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 Thank you very much for your help.</p>

                    <p>Old title: "NEW" bug in Windows 10, MS would you kindly take care of it EVER?</p>
<p>Did you know that there are too many users who experience and hate that ugly 8-bit</p>

<p>It cannot be re-positioned or hidden by any means available within OS.</p>

            <p>Very unhelpful answer, This stupid black box has only just started coming on my screen in this last week, never seen it before. I am not adjusting the volume by keys, I am using the mouse. And the volume box comes up every time I just move my mouse.</p>
<p>Surely this isn't intended?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot believe anybody wants this box popping up all the time, and the ability to turn it off is a must.</p>
<p>Please how do I get rid of this total annoyance?</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft supportperson,<br />
<br />
You wrote the following lines in one of the many threads about this workhour wrecking annoyance:<br />
</p>
<blockquote>I understand your requirement in this regard.<br />
<p>The feature which you have addressed is as per the design. </p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We always welcome feedback from our&nbsp;customers to improve your experience.
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Keep us posted if you require any assistance.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Could you pretty please make this statement one of you guys made TRUE ?<br />
I've now been added to the ever growing group of irritated users having this Pop-Up as per Design Featured BUG :-(<br />
<br />
This Pop-Up *steals Focus* which is bad enough, but somewhere in the bios pipeline a bug has been introduced which keeps intermittently wnking open volume 100%, and the bug keeps pushing the "volume Up button" impertinmently, wrecking lots of working hours
 for lots of people on Win10<br />
<br />
So give the growing disgruntled userbase a patch to kill the Volume OSD, including the keyboard activation of it.<br />
<br />
AND POST THE SOLUTION IN EVERY THREAD ABOUT THIS PROBLEM...<br />
Because since the aniversary update hundreds of people are like me searching themselves silly to get their systems operating again, my Vaio n-Trig Pen clicks are no longer accepted in Photoshop if that silly useless Volume Pop-Up rears its ugly head.<br />
<br />
Can i write Microsoft a bill for lost working hours, including two sleepless nights now, trying every possible driver for the Realtek built in Audio and Terratec USB (C-Media the most used USB sounddock solution) and keyboard drivers, including gazillion reboots/safemode
 endeavors, 3th party app's to no avail...<br />
<br />
And yes even the update microsoft pushed out this day, DID NOT HELP...<br />
<br />
Because itit looked like it was solved, but after an hour or so, it suddenly pops up its ugly head in the most irritating place, blocking the menu of all applications so you cant even save your work...<br />
<br />
At least place it at the BOTTOM of the screen, so it does not interrupt the workflow.
<br />
<br />
Because it ruined three working days and two nights by now :-(<br />
<br />
Sincerely hoping for the better, i salute you,<br />
Ernst H. Anepool from South Limburg<br />
<br />
P.S. Not to speak about the Tandberg Precision HD Camera used for Skyping her colleages on my wifes PC which no longer works since the last update !<br />
It gives all kind of gibberish in the video window than hangs up her system, including keyboard stuck so one cannot even kill skype via Ctl Alt Del !</p>

Thank you for your reply which was helpful but unfortunately unsuccessful in resolving my problem.</p>
<p>You asked how I believe my CD drive has been removed, the fact is that it does now show up when I go into my computer - the only drives listed are my C: drive and printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The verysion of Windows XP is just the basic and the service pack is 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed your instructions on using the Device Manager but was unsuccessful in getting my CD drive working again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On commencing Device Manager I did not get the opton Start&gt;Run&gt;devmgmt.msc&gt;OK</p>
<p>The category I selected was Disk Drives and when expanded this brough up </p>
<p>WDC WD8000BB - 75 HCO which when highlighted a screen appeared with a red cross over it in the tool bar.&nbsp; When going into properties it brough up a screen which stated that the device was working correctly.&nbsp; This is obviously not the case as I cannot use
 CDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then went on to the Kb/314060 help note and carried out the Microsoft fix.&nbsp; This told me that the Device was not found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if you have any other suggestions but anything you can think of&nbsp;to be of help would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Seymours</p>

I'm not sure what you mean by "carried out the Microsoft fix," but if you used the "Microsoft FixIt" button, go instead to the "Let me fix it myself" section and follow the instructions under Windows XP.<br />
If you get to Step 4 and do not see "Upper Filters" or "Lower Filters" in the right pane, stop, exit the Registry Editor without making any changes and report back here.
<br />
<br />
I assume that when you say that your printer is shown in My Computer that your printer must have a built-in media reader (Compact Flash, SD card, etc.).&nbsp; Is that correct?<br />
<br />

This is just a miscommunication.&nbsp; Clicking Start, then clicking Run, then typing "devmgmt.msc" (without the quotes) into the "Open" box and then clicking OK is one method of starting Device Manager.&nbsp; There are several other methods, and you chose one of them.<br />

I don't know why you selected "Disk Drives." I asked you to select the category for

Hi, thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I apologise for the delay in responding back to you which has been due to work commitments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have now tried the "Let me fix it myself" section with once again no success.&nbsp; I followed the instructions on the kb/314060 and rightly or wrongly deleted my lower filters - upper filters were not&nbsp;listed.&nbsp;I went straight to the section on Windows XP and
 did not see the section prior to taking this action on saving a copy of the registry and when I went in to restore to a previous date, this could not be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no category in my devise manager on the left hand side for CD/DVD drives.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only query mark I could find was under NETWORK ADPATERS and the subject of Uknown Device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just&nbsp;for information, I have a shortcut icon on my desktop to my CD Drive, this has a red question mark on it and when clicked the following message appears:</p>
<p>"The item 'D;\' that this refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if any of the above makes sense to you but I don't know what my next step is.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can only think to revert back to factory settings and hope this will solve the problem but how do I save programmes especially the Microsoft Office 2007 suites updates, the windows XP updates and security updates, updates for Windows Internet and Windows
 SP Service Pack 3.&nbsp; I am concerned that if I revert back to factory settings I will lose all these updates as Windows XP was not original installed on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would I be able to save the programmes along with my documents on a USB?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you can help me further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Seymours</p>

<br />
I assume that you have rebooted your computer at least once after the CD drive problem started and before looking in Device Manager.&nbsp; If that assumption is not correct, please turn the computer off, turn it back on, and then look in Device Manager.<br />
<br />
If there is no category in Device Manage for CD/DVD drives, that sounds like a hardware problem: either the CD drive has died, the power supply output to the drive has failed, or -- most likely -- the power and/or data connections to the drive have become loose.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Checking the physical connections to the CD drive isn't difficult, but it does require opening your computer case -- which means that certain precautions need to be taken.&nbsp; If you are uncomfortable opening your computer -- and there's no shame in admitting
 that this isn't your "cup of tea" -- take it a local independent (not a BigBoxUSA or geeksquad type of place) computer repair shop.<br />
<br />

If the problem is hardware-related, resetting your computer to "fresh from the factory" state will
<b>not</b> fix the problem.&nbsp; And doing so <b><u>will</u> </b>remove any programs you installed after you bought the computer and all of your data.&nbsp; You will go back to whatever version of Windows was installed when the computer was purchased.<br />
<br />
Although you can back-up your data (documents, music, pictures, etc.) to some external storage device, you would have to reinstall -- from original installation media -- Windows XP as well as all application programs (e.g., Microsoft Office 2007).&nbsp; If you originally
 had Windows 98 rather than Windows 95, it's possible that you could bypass re-installing some application programs that came pre-installed when you bought the computer.<br />
<br />
You would also have to download and install all Windows updates that came later than whatever version of Windows XP for which you have an installation CD (including service packs, newer versions of Internet Explorer, and post-sp3 security updates).<br />
<br />
As you can surmise from the two previous paragraphs, reverting to factory settings is a fairly drastic step, and one that I strongly suggest that you
<b>not </b>take -- at least not yet.&nbsp; Let's try one more diagnostic effort.<br />
<br />
A.&nbsp; Is there a CD drive still physically installed in the computer?&nbsp; If so, press the Eject button on the front of the drive. Does the drive open when you press the Eject button?<br />
<br />
B.&nbsp; Assuming that you are using your computer to post questions and answers here, after you answer the questions from A above, leave the "Reply" window open and do the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Click Start, then click Run. Type the following in the Open box and then click OK<br />

<p>I assume that you have rebooted your computer at least once after the CD drive problem started and before looking in Device Manager.&nbsp; If that assumption is not correct, please turn the computer off, turn it back on, and then look in Device Manager.<br />

            I'm sorry, but I think we're close to the end of what can be done through a support forum like this.<br />
<br />
It appears that the CD drive has power but that there is another hardware problem, possibly the drive itself, possibly the data cable, or possibly the motherboard of the computer.<br />
<br />
As I was looking for something that would show you how to check the data cable connections, I found the
Service Manual for your Dell Dimension 3100.&nbsp; The manual describes a few more diagnostic tools.<br />
<br />
At page 7, the manual describes 4 diagnostic lights on the front panel.&nbsp; If lights 1, 2, and 3 (but not 4) are lit, this may indicate a problem with the data cable connections.<br />
<br />
Your computer may have a hardware diagnostic routine installed.&nbsp; Starting at page 5 of the manual are instructions.&nbsp; There seem to be two alternate methods for starting this routine:<br />
<br />
Turn on (or restart) your computer.<br />
<ul>
<li>When the DELL™ logo appears, press &lt;F12&gt; immediately. Select Diagnostics from the boot menu and press &lt;Enter&gt;.</li></ul>
NOTE: If you wait too long and the operating system logo appears, continue to wait until you see the Microsoft® Windows® desktop. Then shut down your computer and try again.
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the &lt;Fn&gt; key while powering the computer on.</li></ul>
NOTE: If you see a message stating that no diagnostics utility partition has been found, run the Dell Diagnostics from the ResourceCD [you won't be able to do this if the problem with the CD drive is, in fact, hardware-related; instructions for attempting it
 -- if you have the Dell Resource CD -- follow on page 5 of the manual]<br />
<br />
If you are able to get the Dell Diagnostic Routine to run, run a test on the CD drive.<br />
<br />
If you decide that you want to check "inside the box," first read the first 13 pages of the Service Manual.&nbsp; Instructions for removing/installing the CD drive start at page 31.&nbsp; The data cable is the wide flat cable (#1 in the picture).&nbsp; The power connection
 is the smaller connector (#2 in the picture).<br />
<br />
As far as the "Problem device" is concerned, as near as I can determine, that appears to be related to AOL software.&nbsp; If you've ever installed, uninstalled, and then reinstalled AOL software, that might explain it.&nbsp; Your "problems with AVG PC Tune-up" may also
 have caused this. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about it at this point (although there is a small possibility that it is malware-related), but if you do take the computer to a local repair shop, be sure to mention it.&nbsp; I'm quite sure that it does not relate to the problem with your CD drive.<br />

            <p>Thank you once again for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very grateful for&nbsp;all the help you have given me and agree with you that I need to seek the help of a local repair shop and hope they can sort out the many problems I have since installing the AVG PC Tune Up - the problem with my CD drive was only one
 of many.</p>

I had this same issue as well. What I did was remove the AVG PC Tuner from Add/Remove programs in the Control Panel. My error code was (code 19). I did a back up my registry keys as mentioned through create a restore point. Then click Start type Run in Search...Type
 Regedit and in the Edit tab click Find and type AVG PC Tuner click enter delete then F3 and delete all entries that include these names the Registry finder will locate them all for you to delete. Pay special attention as to NOT delete anything else. Close
 the Registry window - Reboot and Voila! The cd/dvd rom is back and ready to go.<br />
Hope this helps :)<br />

            Microsoft Edge can already natively open and view PDF files and there is no known Adobe Reader add on for Microsoft Edge.
<br />
<br />You can download the Adobe Reader app to separately open and view PDF files. Learn more:

            The thing is I did not have anything open or trying to open in a PDF format.&nbsp; I was simply attempting to have a little gaming time with MSN free on line games.&nbsp; I already have Adobe Acrobat Pro DC AND Adobe Reader on my computer however I did some checking
 on the compatibility mode of these and see that they are set to Win 8.&nbsp; Could that be part of the problem?

<h2>            Internal Storage Does Not Show Even Though Phone Is Connected By USB</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is the Asus Q304UA 2 in 1 and my phone is an iPhone 6s.</p>
<p>When I go to File Explorer, I'm able to see the iPhone device but it doesn't show my internal storage on my phone. Even though it says I have a lot of internal storage filled.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do, I can't access my files and I need to be able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internal storage is there, but when I click on the internal storage folder, it's empty. And also, my internal storage bar shows up as a red color. Not sure if that's correct.</p>

    <title>Refund failed not getting any support from customer service - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Refund failed not getting any support from customer service</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son accidentally purchased Fortnite standard founders pack for 42.79 on December 10th. I requested a refund that same day and received an email on the 11th of December to expect my refund within 3-5 business days. That clearly was not that case as I found
 out on the 17th of December that my refund failed. I contacted support to which they informed me that I need to call in to customer support to escalate this issue which I did. It is now January 14th I have not received my refund and I do not have the product
 that was miss purchased by my 4 year old son. I keep calling in several times a week and I keep getting told different times to wait whether it be 48hr, 72hrs, and even weeks. The support team has also informed me that the escalation team have not made any
 updates to my problem and never set the proper expectations for how long I need to wait to get my refund. I am currently in a dilemma where the only way I will see my money is if I do a charge back but in the process have my Microsoft account banned that has
 over a $1000 dollars of digital games purchased and I am unsure what to do, I feel like I have been robbed but not only that have received terrible customer service from the standard call center employees to their so called "supervisors". I would&nbsp; like someone
 to investigate this issue as I can't do a charge back since I will be punished and the call center employees are not helpful at all. The reference number to this case is&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed - PII)</strong></p>

 received an email regarding the refund request, you should respond to this on the matter.&nbsp; It will be better than keep ringing.

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have read through your post and understand that this concerns a purchase made by your son accidentally on your account and that you have been unable to get this item refunded, already speaking with multiple support agents and supervisors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, our forums community does not have the necessary tools for investigating this matter, and when it comes to refunds it would be best to continue requesting the refund through our
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/payment-and-purchases/request-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">refund request webform</a></strong> as this is currently the way to get money back on a digital item purchased through the Microsoft
 store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the form and try requesting the refund once again, and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying and keeping us updated. Super sorry to hear that the return process has been a frustrating one for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the refund was initially approved, the proper amount of time that it normally takes for a refund to process is 3-10 business days, meaning that is the allotted time for those funds to be sent from Microsoft to the financial institution that issued
 you your card. From there, the amount of time that it takes to be credited to your account would be set by the financial institution itself. You may wish to reach out to them to see if there is any further information that they may provide for an expected
 return of those funds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have done your due diligence in contacting Xbox Support and if your case was escalated but you have not heard anything further, it is best to request a call back and reference the case ID you were provided so that the agent that you're speaking with
 can look into it to see if there has been any progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, apologies for the wait and we wish you the best!</p>
        </p>

 from a last good configuration point and the start up repair pops up again. If someone could please help it would be greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Xbox live purchases not working.</h2>
                    
<p>PC error code-</p>
<p><span>Your payment instrument could not be authorized. Please contact your provider, or try a different payment option.</span></p>
<p><span>XBOX error code-</span></p>
<p><span>Can't authorize the selected payment option. Please select a different payment option or add a new one.</span></p>

<p><span>I get these error codes whether using my debit card or paypal account. Both of these payment options functioned before. Based on my research this apparently has something to do with Microsofts anti fraud something or other and that support would tell
 me that there is nothing wrong with my account. I called support anyways, very helpful guy told me nothing is wrong with my account and that it has to be on the other end. REALLY!?!?! Paypal, Visa and my bank are all obviously the ones at fault. It couldn't
 be the one common factor- XBOX live. My cards and paypal all function on other sites and at physical locations where I use them. SO please fix my problem with the least amount of trouble possible. Thousands of dollars of mine have gone to you and your solution
 is "well.... we don't know... here's 800 points. But you still can't make purchases. HAVE A NICE DAY."&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvience. I've had this problem with BofA and WaMu (Washington Mutual, hella old I know). It is the bank. They have their own fraud protection especially against online purchases and charges. Banks work differently between each other and
 sites work differently as well. Just because 1 site allows charges, doesn't mean all will. I mean some gas stations won't take my bank card BofA for credit charges. Just call your bank; otherwise, get prepaid xbox cards</p>

<p>Its not the bank. And its not PayPal. And why would both of them stop working within minutes of each other? If anyone has an answer to that I'll stop feeling like you're all trying to insult my intelligence.

<p>Who says we're trying to insult your intelligence? We're trying to help you. If you feel that way, we're not going to get anywhere.</p>
<p>Anyways, have you tried taking the cards out of your Xbox Live account and putting them back in? Do they have any money on them, and if they do, is the amounts enough to how many points you want? (ex. You want 800 points, they cost $10, but you only have
 $7)</p>
<p>Here's a link to managing your payment options on Xbox Live, just in case:</p>

<p>Sorry I was pretty mad at customer support. Anyways, the cards and accounts have more than enough money. My bank accounts and PayPal have no blocks on them. But as I pointed out before hand- the connection in all this, the thing not working is Xbox live.
 I've made sure the addresses on all my accounts match, the phone numbers match. The error has to be in Xbox lives system somewhere, I've exhausted every other possibility. And again, the accounts work everywhere else, and were working with Xbox just a few
 days ago. </p>

<p>i believe I have figured it out. I think it has something to do with the connection between myself and the end goal of making a purchase. As in the actual internet connection. I don't think there's anything anyone can do. Support told me that purchases weren't
 even showing up as denied. So after I was able to buy some points and then it stopped working again I decided to just retry the purchase over and over. Guess what? It went through on about the 10 attempt. So I guess I'm gonna call the internet company and
 see what's going on over there. Thanks again for the help, and sorry for being short or rude with anyone.

<p>Hey there Aphid thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us.</p>

    <title>Gamertag Case - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gamertag Case</h2>
                    
<p>I posted this in the Enforcement section but didn't get any emails/response and it never got approved or it least it isn't showing up.. This was 2-3 days ago.. Thankfully I have it saved since it took me some time to write.</p>
<p>I don't know under which sub category should I post my issue so I'm just going to post it here. Although I don't quite understand why I have to post my personal problems on a forum where the whole world can see. I'll try to write down the situation as detailed
 as possible, so that whoever reviews this will have a clear understanding of what my problem is and what's been going on.</p>
<p>Longer than 2 weeks ago, I called up Xbox Customer Support because I couldn't change my Gamertag on my Xbox One (or 360) to "Abraham Lincoln". Yes that's Abraham Lincoln the 16th President of the United States. I went on change "Set my Gamertag" and "Make
 my own" and when I entered "Abraham Lincoln", the screen was loading for around 15-20 seconds and went back to step one. I looked up whether the Gamertag was attached to another account but it wasn't (and later on the support team confirmed this as well and
 said that it is available but I'm just not allowed to change my Gamertag to it).</p>
<p>I call up Xbox Customer Support and tell them my situation. The Agent on the phone tells me to do a couple of steps on my Xbox to reset the console,delete the cache what-not. I do all the steps she asks me to do. But obviously it isn't working out. So she
 puts me on hold and tells me that the Gamertag is "invalid", I didn't accept her if I could speak to an other Agent or if she could open up a case for me. Eventually she put me through to another Agent who told me the same thing and said that he opened a case
 for me and the "Escalation Team" will write back to me. The next day I get an email from the same Agent "Mandy" and he says in his email: "I would like to confirm that we have received a response from the escalation department. They have confirmed that some
 gamertags are not public or cannot be used. I hope this now resolves your query." At this point I didn't understand his email, since I thought "I" was going to receive an email from the escalation team telling me why I cannot have it if I can't at all. Because
 I was unhappy with his email, I called up Microsoft support again...</p>
<p>The Agent on the phone put me on hold a thousand times. He said he doesn't understand why I can't change it to Abraham Lincoln and he speak to the Technical Team and they said that they don't understand why I cannot change it to that gamertag. He said and
 this is a direct quote "I'd change it for you if I could even the Technical Team wanted to change it for you but we can't". A couple of days later I call back to see what's going on, because I didn't trust the agent before did send my case up to the Advocacy
 Team, he was being a bit unfriendly towards me. So I talk to another agent called "Chip" now Chip tells me he completely understands my situation and will try to help me out any way he can. In fact he put me on hold to talk to the "Rangers" who can apparently
 explain why I can't have it or change my gamertag for me to it. He couldn't reach them so he said he will try later and he'll send me an email. He did send me an email which said:</p>
<p>I have reached the advocacy team and we have determened that that name is violationg the code of conduct. And that is why you can not claim that name, and why no one can claim that name.</p>
<p>Here is the paragraf that shows the statement:</p>
<p>Communications &amp; User Created Content</p>
<p>Do not create a Gamertag, profile content, Avatar content, in-game content, videos or any other content that may offend other users. This includes, without limitation, anything related to or suggestive of:<br />
Profane words or phrases<br />
Topics or content of a sexual nature<br />
Hate speech<br />
Illegal drugs or controlled substances<br />
Illegal activities<br />
Controversial religious topics<br />
Notorious people or organisations<br />
Sensitive current or historical events<br />
Any "sound-alike" or "lookalike" words, phrases, or puns</p>
<p>He said that I can reply to his email to call me back, so I sent him an email that I still don't understand their decision and I would like him to call me back. Chip never called back..<br />
I called Xbox Customer Support again, this time I believe I talked to "Luke". Luke said to me that he can see that the case is still open, and he can see the replies I sent as well. He never gave me an answer why the agent never called me back. I believe I
 waited another 3-4 days and called again. He said that I should wait to hear back from the Advocacy Team and he is happy to open a case again and send that up as well just in case I'll get a reply faster or a reply at all. He also said that I should wait till
 the 22nd of March and if I don't get any reply call back then. I said ok and waited for the email from the Advocacy Team.
<br />
Finally, yesterday night I received an email from "Cue" who is from the Advocacy Team. I didn't reply to the email yet because I was in Hospital the day before and I had to rest. In his email he says:</p>
<p>"My name is Cue with the Xbox Customer Care and Advocacy Team. I want to thank you for taking the time to reach out to us regarding your gamertag inquiry. I sincerely apologize for any inconveniences that this may have caused you. Allow me to take a moment
 to explain the results of my investigation of your pre-paid card issue.</p>
<p>I was able to find out that highly coveted historical figures and or names are taken out of circulation for high risk and or security reasons. Again I apologize as I understand that you really had your heart set on obtaining "Abraham Lincoln" as your gamertag."</p>
<p>Now the first thing that caught my eye was the sentence "Allow me to take a moment to explain the results of my investigation of your pre-paid card issue." What pre-paid card? I thought at first that his email was just all scripted and he looked into my
 case a bit, saw that it's blocked because it violates this and that and decided to say you can't have it and goodbye. But all this time I was looking for a proper explanation "why" I can't have said gamertag. I wasn't happy with what looked like his scripted
 answer, so I sent him back a long email explaining how I feel about this and why I think it is unfair that I can't have this gamertag when it isn't used by anyone. To this he just replied:</p>
<p>"It's Cue again and I am contacting you in reference to your gamertag inquiry. I again apologize for the inconvenience of not being allowed to obtain "Abraham Lincoln" as a gamertag. You can refer any further concerns to our customer forums at the link below:</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/default.aspx</p>
<p>I hope you understand that we value your loyalty to the Xbox LIVE service and we hope that you can continue to enjoy the unique Xbox LIVE experience."</p>
<p>Again this felt very scripted and kind of "un-human". I replied to his email again but haven't gotten any reply yet, I asked why I should write my problem on an open forum and who can further assist me on here? Who has the authority to explain or change
 things for me? Before I began writing this, I called up Customer Support again and the lady was desperate to help me but she couldn't. She flagged my case again and told me to write on here because the Admins on the forums are really helpful and they are from
 the Advocacy Team as well. I also told her why I think the decision was unfair. So now I'm going to write the questions I asked previously from the Advocacy team and they decided not to reply but to seek from answers here! I'm really interested if I can be
 further assisted or given fair and proper answers, I got really frustrated today.</p>
<p>Ok so here is why I think it does not violate the code of conduct and I should be allowed to have it. I did some research on this, hoping someone might consider what I have to say.</p>
<p>It isn't a current event or historical event, however he is linked to a historical event and was a political figure. Both Abraham and Lincoln can be a given birth name. Abraham is a Jewish birth name meaning "father of many", while Lincoln is just a given
 surename used by many. Lincoln is a county in England and is also the name of the car company in America. So harmless birth names. I am not trying to impersonate him, that would be impossible since Abraham Lincoln the President died in 1865. He was born and
 died in 1800 so 19th century. He died a 149 years ago. No one survived from his era. He was a political figure but such a long time ago, the laws he might have created completely changed since. He was looked up upon he wasn't someone like Hitler or his army
 who killed millions or Stalin. He isn't a hated person. But why are we attaching this name to a historical figure when both names can be legally a given birth name? Why would it be a high risk if I had this gamertag? What risks?? If it's such a high risk then
 someone tell me this. Why are there gamer picture packs that have him in it? As a matter of fact my Xbox 360 gamer picture is Abraham Lincoln himself. So I can have his face but not "his" name? Why are there games on Xbox Live available to buy that have him
 in it as a playable character or they mention or write about him? The free games with gold that Microsoft gave away this month has him in it as well. Why is it that you can buy or watch movies on Xbox Live that are titled after his name or are about him? How
 is anything about him allowed to be distributed throughout Xbox Live to over 30 million people when he posses such a "high risk"?</p>
<p>I looked up some historical people's name on Xbox Live to see if they are used by someone. Now I don't know if any of them on this list are banned or not I just looked them up for confirmation and to help build my case.</p>
<p>Ghandi - 11 years old account, George Bush - UK silver account over 5000Gamerscore, Barack Obama - silver account, Che Guevara - owned by a Canadian 11 year old account with over 19000 Gamerscore (interesting I believe Che was a big political figure and
 he was executed in the 60s), Stalin - 11 years old account, Putin - 9 years old account, John F Kennedy - 2 years old, Communism - 2 year old over 2000 gamerscore he recently played (I'm not sure why this gamertag is allowed?), Jesus Christ (to me this is
 questionable as well), Ronald Reagan and other previous US Presidents or linked to profiles as well such as John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe Andrew Jackson, Bill Clinton etc I couldn't be bothered to look them all up because the list
 is ridiculous. And of course there are many other political peoples names out there as well, but who are we to decide which one is important enough to not be available to anyone. What I found also funny was how I was told actually to change my gamertag to
 Abrah4m Lincoln, so swap the letter "a" to the number "4". Now you can clearly see that it would still read Abraham Lincoln, so how come it wouldn't pose such high risks?? I saw a person who's gamertag was Prawnstar and he was banned because he used a vulgar
 word or similar (basically his gamertag was close to Pornstar) but he had completely different letters so how come he got banned? What I'm saying here is that agents want me to change my name to Abrah4m Lincoln which looks very similar to Abraham Lincoln almost
 identical and Abraham Lincoln is apparently banned, so they want me to chnage my gamertag to that and get myself banned because I'm linked to a political figure or how does this work?</p>
<p>So if I can't have this gamertag which isn't used by anyone but someone decided I and nobody should have it explain to me why? Don't just say it's invalid or code of conduct. I clearly stated some good and valid facts. I highly feel as a long time customer
 I am not being helped and being mistreated. Why would it be such a pain for anyone if I had this gamertag? Would people really care? I hope to get an answer back to my questions since I took the time to write this post as well. At least get this case investigated
 again I have enough money on my Microsoft Account for my gamertag to be changed to Abraham Lincoln. I'm also sorry if I said anything inappropriate out of my frustration.</p>

    <title>USB Code 48 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alabama office user  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Code 48</h2>
                    <p>Windows10 Pro.&nbsp; ASUS 990FX Motherboard.</p>
<p>After a windows update and reboot, all of the USB ports stopped working.&nbsp; (Luckily I had an old keyboard with a PS2 connector.)&nbsp; The devices are disabled before the log-in page appears.&nbsp; Device manager show all of the USB related items are turned off with
 Code 48 being the reason.&nbsp; I clicked on Update Driver and it reported that I had the most current drivers.&nbsp; Window Update also reported the same thing.&nbsp; In Safe Mode, all of the USB ports are on and device manager shows everything is normal.&nbsp; I tried to do
 a recovery to an earlier date but found that Windows 10 had turned off the setting of recovery points so that option is gone.&nbsp; Short of reverting back to Windows 7, is there anything I can do?&nbsp; Can I disable the disabling of drivers by Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>

            Go to start-&gt;all programs-&gt;widows virtual pc&gt; widows virtual pc, select windows xp mode, right click, settings. Navigate to Hard Disk 1, browse the virtual hard disk file, move it to the desired location, and set it to point to that path. you can
 do the same with the parent disk, that is also located under this menu item, but that's roughly only 1.2 gigs in size.<br />

<h2>            Explorer fails to start. </h2>
                    Over this last week my computer has been trying to install Microsoft office 2007 updates, when it gets to a certin point it fails and gives error code 646. and it just says unknown error. i have tryed restarting the computer several times and tryed installing
 it over and over again. it never can download the updates. Then i restarted the computer and as soon as it gets to the point where its supposed to load up explorer it brings up an error that says "explorer failed and had to be shut down, please see windows
 help and support for a fix... yada yada yada".. I can go in to task manager and manualy start explorer and everything works just fine but then i restart the computer again and it keeps saying explorer failed. Please help. Thanks! :)

Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not have a<br />
Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will
<br />
sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
