<h2>            Install Latest Drivers error message</h2>
                    Hey so on my computer when I load up WWE2K15 on STEAM all I get is an error message saying "Install Latest Drivers" But I already did install the latest drivers! Anyone know how to fix this? I'm trying to create an ICW INVASION Universe Mode Series.

    <title>Problem reseting password - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem reseting password</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to receive emails to reset the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email provider told me that Microsoft emails are being blocked because of a configuration issue on Microsoft account:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>Currently, the domain accountprotection.microsoft.com has CNAME record pointing to another domain.<br />
That domain has MX records - this is a supported configuration. <br />
RFC 2821 specifies that this is right to configure the domain that way (section 3.6 and section 5):<br />
<a href="https://url.emailprotection.link/?aR0XDQYVtl75_TNfAdxivR1JjKMpOfy7eFRaboUD6kctOOXmdwxQsAb8dxfY6R_mBFQGan1JkT58z2UFcxG0LrA~~" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2821</a>
<br />
However, when we look up the domain accountprotection.microsoft.com is pointing to mail.msa.msidentity.com.<br />
We can see that the MX records are resolved in only a few places:<br />
<a href="https://url.emailprotection.link/?aFu6OQ9WqlsCgMHWvbbnnig_yYSvQ2jFqGpOahoKo0m-9fQSzxse2OHbwXB9xy7iW-3NwoRM8H4ZfQtWHb_UZ_A~~" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.whatsmydns.net/#MX/mail.msa.msidentity.com</a>
<br />
And the servers that were resolved actually were different in different attempts. This indicates issues with nameservers for this domain.<br />
When our System Administrators checked the resolution, our servers were unable to find MX or A records.<br />
That is why the delivery failed. We suggest forwarding this information to Microsoft support - it looks like the domain mail.msa.msidentity.com has nameserver issues.<br />
Since Microsoft is the owner of this domain, only they can resolve it.</span></p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideia of how Microsoft could address this?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Madden 12 freezing...</h2>
                    Anytime I connect to Xbox live while I am playing madden it freezes. It doesn't do it with any other game. I have deleted almost all my files hoping one was corrupted. I have I also cleared the cache on all my storage devices. I have also reset my Internet
 but nothing helps. I can use Xbox live just not while playing madden. Please help. Thanks

<p>Step 1: Go through your whole console and look for any yellow explanation points, check all your video folders also, like Netflix, HBO Go, ect. Usually these are the corrupted ones.</p>
<p>Step 2: Copy your Game Information to a USB Drive, delete it fully then try it.</p>
<p>Step 3: Could be a damaged disk, is this a new game? If it is return it and get a new Disk, my brother had the same problem with a couple of his titles, it's a rare happening, like one out of a million but a bad disk does get out.</p>

<p>Are you playing the game from the DVD, or have you installed it to your Hard Drive? If you have not, try installing the game to your hard drive and play it from that, see if that fixes your issue. If it won't install, then that would also point to a bad
 point on the game DVD, so try cleaning the DVD disk with a soft cloth.</p>

<p>The disk isn't brand new I have had it a while but I take very good care of my games. I downloaded the game to a USB no issue and I didn't find any damaged files. Another thing I have noticed is that I only have this problem in the evening however that is
 when I play the most. </p>

<p>If you play your XBOX Console for more than 5 hours, you may have Disc Drive issue(s) regarding the heat of the Console and the motherboard. Check if your Disc Drive and your Madden 12 Disc are both: Clean of any dust/irritants which may interfere with the

<p><span>1) Data Impact</span></p>
<p><span>2) Network Impact</span></p>
<p><span>3) Hardware Impact</span></p>
<p><span>4) Licensing Impact</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 1)"><strong><span>This type of issue can be caused by several things. As most have highlighted, this can be related to Corrupt, Incomplete, Partial or Unknown files. To check for these file types...</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>1) From the Xbox dashboard, go to the Settings Hub, then select System</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select Storage</span></p>
<p><span>3) Highlight your hard drive or memory unit, then press Y for Device Options</span></p>
<p><span>4) Select Clear System Cache &amp; agree to the necessary maintenance (which will not impact your gamerscore, achievements or epic ninja avatar props)</span></p>
<p><span>5) Select All Devices, or your Hard Drive/Memory Unit</span></p>
<p><span>6) Select Games and Apps</span></p>
<p><span>7) Find the Madden folder</span></p>
<p><span>8) Delete the Madden Title Update</span></p>
<p><span>9) Press B twice and select System Items</span></p>
<p><span>10) If listed, delete the Marketplace System Data file, If multiple files exist on multiple drives, delete all occurrences (Do you own Madden DLC? If so these steps are recommended)</span></p>
<p><span>11) Press B then X to obtain additional Deletion Suggestions (Review for any corrupt, incomplete, partial or unknown files - delete and replace if detected)</span></p>
<p><span>12) Make sure that all related Madden title content is distributed to the same storage device. (having multiple save files on multiple memory devices...just messy and invites ninjas)</span></p>

<h2>            Surface 2 has heavy packet loss on WPA2 Enterprise PEAP network at work, is fine with every other Wifi network I try</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I am having a very frustrating problem with my Surface 2 (ARM modem) at work. It is my personal Surface 2 so I cannot get support from IT, and the problem is only affecting my Surface 2. Basically, when I connect to our internal corporate Wifi network which
 uses WPA 2 Enterprise [Encryption type AES, Protected EAP] 802.11n, I get bursts of intense packet loss which lasts several seconds (even a minute or two). It is making use of the network unusable, which basically prevents me from using my Surface in meetings
 at work, destroying a key use case for me. <br />
<br />
I have 2 other machines connected to this same internal Wifi network, a Dell Latitude running Windows 7 and a MacBook Pro running OSX Mavericks on my desk. Neither of them is seeing the same packet loss on this network, only the Surface. Both of the other machines
 are working fine. Signal strength is about 74%. I have been running pings on all 3 and using all 3 at the same time, and again, the Surface is the only one that drops off and has the packet loss.
<br />
<br />
Other networks in the same building that use WPA2 Personal (also 802.11n) are fine on my Surface, no packet loss, I can use them normally. My Wifi network at home also works fine.
<br />
<br />
I have tried fiddling around: <br />
<ul>
<li>Uninstalled network driver and re-installed. <br />
</li><li>Tried disabling IPv6 on the Wifi adapter for my Surface. <br />
</li><li>Tried disabling packet coalescing (why not) <br />
</li><li>Tried deleting the network and re-adding it <br />
</li></ul>
Nothing fixes the issue. I can always connect, but I always get these bursts of packet loss. The bursts can last for a minute or two, then there are stretches where it works, only to drop out again. The fact that the Surface 2 doesn't support Ethernet over
 USB means I am basically stuck if I cannot get this working. Please don't suggest I reach out to my IT department, they won't support a non-work tablet, though they are fine with me using it if it works. I am _this_ close to throwing my Surface 2 into a vat
 of boiling pitch and going to the Apple store to get an iPad. Thanks, // Chris

<p>Hi Buddhafish,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;When do you get the error message?<br />
•&nbsp;Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</p>
<p>There is a possibility that some third party program installed on the computer is causing the error message on the computer.<br />
I would suggest that you perform the clean boot procedure and check if it works.</p>
<p><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p><br />
Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong><br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
•&nbsp;Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the <strong>Normal Startup option</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you run SFC scan on the computer would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</p>
<p>For more information refer the below link.<br />
<strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong><br />

    <title>File recovery on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don2175  say:</h3>
<h2>            File recovery on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Two Questions on "Working with files and folders." &nbsp;Existing Lenovo laptop configured with Windows 8.1 for over 12 months and the below incidents happened on 12/21/2015:</p>
<ol>
<li>Q1: &nbsp;Without my input, a file named "2014 Schedule.ods" was changed to "2014%20Schedule.xls_0.ods" and moved from the folder called "Schedules" to its parent folder, "Document" folder. &nbsp;Alternation to 6 other files with the insertion of "%20" and .xls_0"
 and move to "Document" folder also happened. &nbsp;What caused this, and how can it be prevented in the future? &nbsp;I did check that the anti-virus program was current and ran, and also talked to the Help Desk, where no virus with this symptom has been reported.</li><li>Q2: &nbsp;All the files within the "Schedules" folder disappeared, except for the above 7 files, where name was changed and moved to the "Document" Folder. &nbsp;I've looked in the Recycle Bin to recover these, but these missing files were not present. &nbsp;Any advise
 on what happened and where to go to recover these? &nbsp;I also tried to "unhide" files as well, but that yielded none of the missing files.</li></ol>

<h2>            speech recognition for data entry&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can windows 10 speech recognition be used for data entry of model numbers etc e.g. something like 768GTHI87, where each character is spoken separately and will be a mixture of letters, numbers and some special characters such as dashes and forward slashes
 etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i will be entering the data into fields on a web page. Does windows 10 speech recognition support direct entry into fields on a web page?</p>

            Just my own opinion, but there's no way a speech-to-text will come anywhere near the speed and accuracy of a (pro) data-entry person, if you have large amounts of data to enter.

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; There was a problem resetting your PC. Unable to reinstall Windows. Missing hard drive.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a Samsung Notebook 9 Pro which I bought back in January, several months in and all of my browsers started crashing. I ran multiple spyware and anti virus scans however that didn't seem to be the issue. I downloaded several different browsers and
 the same problem came up. I then decided on reimaging the device since that usually resolves a lot of issues. I don't have much experience with Windows 10 but I reimaged a lot of Windows 7 and XP stations in the past. I went through the recovery menu and each
 time that I tried to reset my Windows install I would receive a "There was a problem resetting your PC" error. After some research online, I found out that it's a common issue with devices that come with Windows 10 preinstalled. The directions then mentioned
 to create a recovery USB and run the install from there. Once I created the recovery USB I went into BIOS and changed the boot order to USB from hard drive and ran the refresh. Several minutes later the same error message came up. When I went back into BIOS,
 it didn't let me change the boot order back to my hard drive. It only showed the USB disk that was there. I have tried running the "Recover from a drive" option, one thing I noticed was when I went into "Troubleshoot" &gt; "Advanced Options" &gt; "System Image Recovery"
 my C Drive changed to the letter W for some reason. I was able to see my recovery folders in there but I wasn't able to do anything with them. If anyone has any advice on this, it would be really appreciated. Also my command prompt reads as x:\windows\system32,
 it doesn't recognize the C drive at all. I am also not able to boot back into Windows so I am stuck in bios and the recovery menu.&nbsp;<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Always boot the media using the BIOS Boot Menu key which on Samsung is normally F12, by powering up the PC while pressing that key, then choose the media as a UEFI device if offered.  Setting the flash media first to boot in UEFI firmware or BIOS will cause it to restart install during the restarts during install, and will displace the Windows Boot Manager which must always remain set first to Boot for the modern UEFI firmware.
<br />
<br />A major reason Reset will fail is due to choking on  the factory bloatware which corrupts Windows and causes endless issues.  In WIndows 10 developers created a Fresh Start which reinstalls Windows but leaves out this bloatware, so it will sometimes work when Reset won't:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then I would cut my losses and actually save time by doing the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 is the web address for the scrabble site that you are trying to connect to?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Does
 this happen with the particular website or all the websites?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Were
 you able to connect to this website ever before?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to re-register the file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Start and type Run in the search field, select run</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 ‘regsvr32 msvcr71.dll’ in the Run dialog box and click ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Running the System File Checker…</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In
 the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>You
 should see the following on-screen messages:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verification % complete.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Once
 the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>…found no integrity violations</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>…found corruption but repaired it</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>…found corruption that it could not repair.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can check out this article that will give you information on 'How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker
 (SFC.exe) program generates in Windows </span></span></p>

<p><b>From: </b>Andrew McLaren&lt;MVP&gt;</p>
<p>You cannot do this for Windows as a whole (and even if you did, users could just use a Print-Screen instead, to pass on restricted data). But you can do it for specific applications: the key technology is
 Windows Rights Management Services ("RMS"). See <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/rightsmgmt/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/technologies/rightsmgmt/default.mspx</a>
</p>
<p>If you have an application which can take part in an RMS infrastructure, then you can indeed configure policies to selectively permit or prevent cut-n-paste, etc, to specific users and groups; or disallow
 cut-n-paste altogether, in that application.</p>
<p>Microsoft Office is the most common app which can plug into RMS. Once it is all set up, it is extremely effective ... you really want to cut-n-paste confidential info from that juicy email or Word document;
 but dammit, you just can't! You also cannot forward protected emails, etc.</p>
<p>There is a public SDK, so anyone can write an application which subscribes to RMS and restrict access to the app's data. However if you have a legacy application (ie, an already-existing application) which
 you cannot re-engineer, then I think you are kind of stuck. You may need to approach the security question from a non-computer perspective, such as HR policies, etc.</p>
<p>You might also take a look at Software Restriction Policies ("SRP"), a similar security feature in Windows. SRP won't stop users from cutting and pasting, as such; but it does let you create a very controlled
 environment. You can stop users from doing many things you don't want them to. See:</p>

<h2>            GPT Protective Partition. How to read data &#47; recover hard drive that is in this state.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I've had a hard drive of mine, a WD Red Network Attached Storage drive, suddenly convert to GPT Protective Partition.</p>
<p>I have no idea what has caused this and no idea how to reverse it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been online and scoured the internet for solutions, software that can read the partition, but it seems as if few people are having this issue on a Windows 10 PC. Some forums say people are trying to read a GPT disk on windows xp and it shows up as GPT
 Protective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all of my data on the hard drive so erasure is not an option, several programs I am using can scan the drive and reveal some files and data intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has a solution, or knows any program able to read a GPT Protective Partition, please contact me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Causticlasagne.</p>

            Hey CausticLasagne,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for the sutiation you are in. I'll try to help with whatever I can.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Posting your system specs may be useful. What is the size of the drive?<br />
How do you see your drive in Disk Management? A screenshot could be useful too. Here's a link with
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=KePLej" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
tips on how to get there</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd try updating the OS and drivers and see if there's any difference in the drive's behavior if you connect it to a different SATA port or with a different SATA cable. I'd also test and see if the drive is recognized in a different computer (externally or
 internally).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd try testing it with <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=5AQYYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic</a> and see if the drive passes both the quick and the extended tests.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you don't have any data that you would like to get, I'd check this link on <a href="http://www.disk-partition.com/gpt-mbr/gpt-protective-partition.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how to delete such a partition</a>. &nbsp;Have in mind that it does erase fully the whole drive!<br />
<br />
Post back with some more info :)<br />

            Did the drive come with the enclosure as a whole product or was it placed there before that? What is the enclosure's brand and model?&nbsp;<br />
If the enclosure features hardware encryption or some other function that prevents the drive from being recognized outside of the enclosure (such as the WD My Book and WD My Passport series) you would need to put the drive back in the enclosure in order to
 get your data.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Did you test the drive with any diagnostic tools? It would be useful to see the results and the drive's S.M.A.R.T. status.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>The drive did come in an enclosure like an external drive, and I removed it from it's case and mounted it as an internal disk in my PC. There was no encryption of any kind and the disk worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've diagnosed the drive with the WD tools, but they did not help. I think that this is a windows issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at my last post and see what it says in disk manager. Windows 10 is supposed to be able to read GPT Protective partitions, but it's not for some reason. I think that the partition table is stuffed or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, mounting the drive back into an enclosure shows the drive as RAW in disk manager because the drive enclosure modifies the data transfer rate or something.</p>

            Reformatting drives that came in enclosures is fine but generally you can't read data that was put on the drive while it was in the enclosure and then remove the drive to get the data simply because of the encryption.&nbsp;<br />
If the drive appears as a RAW format inside the enclosure you may be able to get the data using third-party tools which sadnly I cannot recommend as a Western Digital representative. Many people have luck with them but have in mind that you are doing this at
 your own risk.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'd contact MS's support regarding the protective MBR question. :)<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 upgrade error DRIVER_VIOLATION - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 upgrade error DRIVER_VIOLATION</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 8 without any problems. I want to upgrade to Windows 8.1 through Windows Store App.<br />
<br />
The process normally flows until the time of restart, when I got the BSOD with this words:<br />
<br />
" :( &nbsp;Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info and then we'll restart for you. (0% complete)<br />
If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: DRIVER_VIOLATION "<br />
<br />
<br />
And the system restarts with old version (Windows 8) with a message:<br />
<br />
"Unable to upgrade to Windows 8.1&nbsp;<br />
Unable to complete the upgrade to Windows 8.1. We restored your previous version of Windows on this PC.&nbsp;<br />
Error code: 0xC1900101 - 0x20017 "<br />
<br />
<br />
And this also happens when I try to install Windows using a Windows 8.1 media. On the media boot, I get this error.

            Same error code, but different message text when trying to upgrade 7 Pro to 10 Pro from USB created with media creation tool. &nbsp;After a black error screen on the first reboot. &nbsp;Didn't get any text re:DRIVER_VIOLATION, instead it said "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The
 installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation." &nbsp;Any chance this error in the older upgrade sheds any light on the current problem ?</span>

<h2>            My Windows Tablet froze while I was doing homework&#63; Please help.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so my school issued windows tablet (MODEL: <strong>HP Pro Tablet 10 EE G1</strong>) just froze
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">randomly</span> when I was working in PowerPoint doing homework.. It wasnt turning off until it finally did (I turned it off, held the power button). I had been saving my powerpoint every once in a while so i thought
 it was safe.. Right when it turned off it said "<em>Sorry y</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>our PC ran into a problem. This problem caused your PC to restart</em>".. So I said whatever, I had saved the file every once in a while..
 When it turned back on, it was like I had just gotten a NEW tablet.. It took me to the desktop (P.S. the tablet runs Windows 8) and nothing was there.. My Recycle Bin had stuff that I had deleted and my WiFi was recognized.. but there werent any of my word
 documents or powerpoints that were saved on my desktop... Please help, because this is the second time.. Oh and none of my slides in the start menu were the way they were before.. Thanks!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time and effort.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue generally occur due to user account corruption.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to go to the system drive (by default C: drive) and check the users folders and check if there is any other account is created due to corruption. If happen so, try to create a new user account and transfer you files to new user account:<br />

            <p><span>Hi Abhijeet,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Which services are you referring to?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you say you can open Hotmail/Outlook.com from another internet connection, is the ISP provider which you have is same or different?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Are you using any proxy connection?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Since you mentioned you can open Hotmail from another internet connection. The issue is not related to Outlook.com it could be either with your ISP provider or due to changes in Windows settings.</span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: If you have enabled any proxy connection on the computer, I would suggest you to disable it and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may follow the steps to do so:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Open Internet Explorer on the desktop.<br />
b) Click on Tools icon option on the top right corner.<br />
c) Select Internet Option from the list.<br />
d) Click on Connection tab.<br />
e) Click on LAN Settings.<br />
f) Uncheck the box which says “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN".<br />
g) Click on OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Also refer this article: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-view-some-websites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-view-some-websites</span></a></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to Follow the troubleshooting steps from this article and check if it helps:
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>You cannot log in to or connect to secured Web sites in Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813444</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control
 settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> I would suggest you to temporarily disable Antivirus security software installed on your computer and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Important Note:</strong> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. <br />
If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h2>            Huge empty D drive and nearly full small C &#40;OS&#41; Drive - how do I start using all that empty space&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just got a new laptop with a 500G hard drive which came already partitioned into a 58G C (OS) drive and a 397G D drive. I've just discovered that all the files I've transfered or created are going into the C drive folders while D remains completely empty!</p>
<p>What do I need to do firstly to get D drive into action and secondly to move the relevant folders I'm already filling&nbsp;(my music etc)&nbsp;across from C to D?</p>
<p>Apologies in advance for my complete lack of technical know-how!</p>

<br />
<br />
Nothing. It's already in action--just empty.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; and secondly to move the relevant folders I'm already filling (my music etc) across from C to D?
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do not attempt to move anything that's part of the operating system,<br />
but anything that's your data (like music) just move it there.<br />
<br />
Do you not know how to move files or folders from one place to<br />
another? There are many ways, but here's one I like:<br />
<br />
Open Computer, and navigate to the folder or files you want to move.<br />
Open Computer a second time, and this time navigate to the place you<br />
want to move the data to.<br />
<br />
You now have two instances of Computer open, one showing the "from"<br />
place, the other the "to" place. In the "from" Computer window, select<br />
the files or folders you want to move. Then *right*-drag (using the<br />
right mouse button) those files or folders to the "to" Computer<br />
window.<br />
<br />
When you release the right mouse button, you will be asked whether you<br />
want to copy, move, or create a shortcut. Choose "move."<br />
