    <title>About microsoft serial ballpoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vivien2013  say:</h3>
<h2>            About microsoft serial ballpoint</h2>
                    <p>Windows7 had been installed in computer. I installed&nbsp;a software which can communicate with one type of panel through RS232 port.&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that after connecting panel with my computer. Windows7 recognizes "Miscrosoft serail ballpoint". This ballpiont
 will use one COM of my computer. So the computer can not communiate with panel. </p>
<p>There is one solution is that: Disable "miscrosoft serial ballpoint", then restart computer. The communication is well. But I need another way to disable it. Can you tell me how to disable it by coding using c++? The coding steps are:</p>
<p>(1) Find whether Windows7 recognizes "Miscrosoft serail ballpoint"?</p>
<p>(2) Whether ball point uses a com ID?</p>
<p>(3) If com id has been used, how to disable "Miscrosoft serail ballpoint"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>Thank you very much! </p>

    <title>&#91;Reward&#93; A sound mystery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rzroka7  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Reward&#93; A sound mystery</h2>
                    This is a mystery that I've been dealing with for a whole year. I don't remember how it started, but my sound reversed one day. I don't notice it when listening to music because it doesn't matter, but for games I need to wear my headphones backwards to
 hear sound accurately. I tried resetting windows completely, I didn't save a single file and the issue persisted. I rebuilt my entire computer without a single mutual piece of hardware, the problem persisted. The only thing that stayed consistent was the copy
 of windows I used, but when I first installed windows on my first computer, the sound was perfectly fine for years (it started as windows 8 and was fine after I upgraded to 10). I tried using my brother's computer with the same headphones, same game, and the
 sound is fine on his computer so I know I'm not crazy. For every pair of headphones I buy, I need to make sure they're comfortable backwards because that's how I am forced to wear them. I've tried USB headphones, 3.5mm headphones

            I have tried updating the drivers in the past, the issue kept persisting. I ran the troubleshooter and it said "windows configured to never update drivers" after troubleshooting, and I clicked "fix issues". I updated the sound driver after restarting,
 restarted again but nothing changed.

<h2>            Should I uninstall this program</h2>
                    <p>my computer has the Microsoft visual C++ Redristributable programs, but they are repeated in a way. I have the 2008 the 2010 and 2012 so I was wondering if deleting the two earlier ones was an option or if I had to keep them in order for the 2012 one to
 work&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i mean is it just like an update therefore erasing the earlier ones makes the third on stop working</p>
<p>
</p><p>and lastly what is this program really for</p>

</p><p>From an MS download link - <em>"</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>The Visual C++ Redistributable Packages install runtime components of Visual C++ libraries that are required to run applications developed using Visual Studio
 2012 on a computer that does not have Visual Studio 2012 installed. These packages install runtime components of the C Runtime (CRT), Standard C++, ATL, MFC, C++ AMP, and OpenMP libraries."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some extra info here -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-microsoft-visual-c-redistributable</a> with links to further articles
 at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In short, if you have programs installed that were written with Visual C++ and you don't have the full/complete visual C++ installed, then you need the smaller redistributable installed to correctly run the program. If you have in the past installed a program
 that needed the 2008 version then that program probably installed the 2008 version with it, and will ( usually ) require it to be there to run correctly. Ditto for 2010 and 2012.</p>

</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if there are no Bluetooth drivers installed or if they are corrupted. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter to troubleshoot the device:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> to launch the Start screen.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the new window, click <strong>View all</strong> on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the list of options, click on <strong>Hardware and devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to start the Bluetooth service and set it to Automatic:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to the Start screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “<strong>Services.msc</strong>” without quotes and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on <strong>Bluetooth support service</strong> and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Set the <strong>Startup type</strong> as
<strong>Automatic</strong> and then click <strong>Start</strong> under <strong>Service status</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if you have installed all the updates on the computer. There are chances that you might get Bluetooth drivers through update:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to the <strong>Start</strong> screen.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “<strong>Windows update</strong>” without quotes and click on it from the list of results.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>Check for updates</strong> on the left pane in the new window.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also install the Bluetooth drivers by downloading it from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the results. If you need further assistance, we’re here to help.</span></p>

    <title>Gaming Apps open in small window on upper left corner of the screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lynellabbott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gaming Apps open in small window on upper left corner of the screen</h2>
                    <p>I just bought this hp envy Windows 10 strictly for games as my video card on my Toshiba Windows 7 computer failed to launch my Big Fish games.&nbsp; Otherwise, the Toshiba works great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now with this Windows 10 computer several games (not all) that I am reinstalling from my Windows 7 computer&nbsp; are launching in the upper left corner of the screen in a very tiny window.&nbsp; As well, some games have tiny cursors...and I mean tiny.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me fix this problem.&nbsp; I would prefer a global fix, and not have to address it with each of the 100 or so games I own.&nbsp; Setting the resolution down to 1920x1080 from the recommended 3840x2160 did not work.&nbsp; As well, disabling the display scaling
 for high DPI settings by right clicking on the app, going to Properties etc. did not work as the next step says to go to "Compatibility" which I could not find in the dialog box.&nbsp; I also right clicked on the app and clicked on "Open File Location."&nbsp; It, too,
 did not have a "Compatibility" tab for me to click on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Lynell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several possibilities that cause this issue. It could be due to outdated operating system version, computer driver related, compatibility concern or it could also be app issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify which version and build of Windows 10 do you have on your device? To check that, simply type "<strong>winver</strong>" on the search field or Cortana, then hit on
<strong>Enter </strong>key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As our initial troubleshooting procedures, we suggest that you run the <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows App Troubleshooter</a></strong> and check if this resolves the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">try updating the drivers</a></strong> in your Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are keen on hearing back from you.</p>

<p>Hello Lawrence Lib.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; We are almost there!</p>
<p>My Windows Version is 1709 (OS Build 16299.192)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the&nbsp; Windows App Troubleshooter link and got a message from the Windows Store Apps that the ws cache may be damaged; so I ran the repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two games were repaired and are working properly (so far!)&nbsp; In all, I have reinstalled about 13 games and only one is still opening (after deleting and reinstalling) in the upper left corner with a tiny window, even after running the repair.&nbsp; &nbsp;One game has
 been re-positioned to the middle of the screen and its window size is only slightly larger than when it was off to the upper left corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did update a couple of drivers but to be honest,at this point I can't remember which ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any further suggestions you may have about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>You're very much welcome, Lynell. It's great to know that there are improvements with the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>We suggest that you continue to run the repair until there are no more apps or programs to be repaired, but if the repair tool for apps has nothing left to repair, we suggest that you reset the Windows Store cache to eliminate corrupted components which
 can cause issues in the future downloads. To do that, simply press the <strong>Windows key
</strong>and <strong>R </strong>at the same time to open the <strong>Run </strong>
dialog box, then type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>. The Store app will open automatically, as well as an empty command prompt window. Once the command prompt window closes on its own, that means the Store cache has been reset.
 Using this command doesn't affect any account settings or delete any installed apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting the Windows Store cache, try running the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker tool</a></strong>
 to scan and completely repair corrupted system components in your Windows operating system.

<br />
Most reliable clocks are those that require no electricity of any sort.&nbsp; Sure - you have to wind them up - but that causes you to think about it that much more - emphasizing again when you need to be waking up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Beyond that - no - there is no built in feature of the Windows operating system that is
<u>for</u> waking someone up from sleep.&nbsp; You could use a scheduled task that plays a sound, MP3 file, etc. at a given time each day, I suppose.

            Hi momofvcr,<br />
<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Did you make any hardware or software changes to the computer lately? </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Are you using any M-Audio device? </li></ul>
<br />
That seems to be a common error while using an M- Audio device. I would recommend you to update the drivers for this device in the Device Manager.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong> You can check in the Device Manager if an M-Audio device is listed there:<br />
1. Click on start and go to Control panel and then click on System and Maintenance.<br />
2. Now click on device manager.<br />
3. Go to sound, video, and game controllers in the device manager<br />
4. Right-click on the M-Audio device and choose update driver. <br />
5. Try updating the drivers automatically and check if it does not find any driver, download the driver manually from the manufacturers website and install it manually.<br />
<br />
For more information on updating drivers refer to the following article:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<br />
<br />
You may also check the following thread if you are using M-Audi device.<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong> <br />
If this does not help in resolving the issue, perform a clean boot troubleshooting to find the conflicting software.<br />

            Hi Lori_Photo,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
From the information provided, it may be that the system needs the Raid controller driver installed in order to view the hard drives.&nbsp; If you have a hardware vendor, their website probably has the correct Raid controller for your system revision, you would
 want to obtain the HARD DRIVE revision of that driver and extract it out to a USB key or CD/DVD to insert as you are being prompted during the boot for chkdsk.<br />
<br />
Verify that is the case, if you are under warranty, this may be something that you will have confirmed information on through your hardware vendor.&nbsp; They may have a different process or be able to direct you to a different disk.<br />
<br />
Please keep us advised if further suggestions are needed.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

    <title>BCCode 1a blue screen error in Windows XP computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daverosenbleeth  say:</h3>
<h2>            BCCode 1a blue screen error in Windows XP computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: BSOD's on XP Pro.</p>
<p>I have recently started getting BSOD's on a computer running XP Pro that has had no hardware or driver changes or updates for quite some time.</p>
<p>After re-booting I get the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;BCCode 1a BCP1: 00000780 BCP2: C06D 4250 BCP3: 81CA9898 BCP4: 000004CD OSver:5_1_2600 SP3_0 Product 256_1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On line it suggests incompatable drivers but the only change recently has been to Anti-virus and the problem predates this.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happens on startup and other times when in different programs or even idle.</p>
<p>The computer is a Dell Vostro that is just a couple years old.</p>

            Yeah - that doesn't make too much sense.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You can see you are running SP3 from the information you did provide and it makes even less sense since the hotfixes in that KB article from the Microsoft Support Engineer are already included with SP3.&nbsp; But, it is a link to a KB article.<br />
<br />
If/when it crashes again follow this procedure to either look at your own crash dump files for clues or upload them to your SkyDrive so somebody can help you look at them.&nbsp; It is just a copy/paste that I would send to anybody that needs help with a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If you have some crash dumps already accumulated on your system from before the new video card they should still be on your system if you want to look at them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?
<div><br />
<div>Does your system seem to boot okay and then crash or does it not boot at all?</div>
<br />
<div>Can you make the system crash any time you want? &nbsp;For example, would you say that there is any particular system activity that coincides with the crashes (like watching videos, playing games, etc.).</div>
<div><br />
The next time your system crashes, provide more information about what you see.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that information too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now provide more information about your system and information from the most recent crashes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</div>
<div><br />
<div>msinfo32</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Download BlueScreenView from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your crash dump files. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the
 same (start with that&nbsp;driver).</div>
<div><br />
<div>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.<br />
<br />
Sometimes BlueScreenView will implicate XP files as the cause of the crash (ntoskrl.exe, win32k.sys, hal.dll etc.) but they are probably not the real cause of the crash (BSV does the best it can).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You would have to either gather up some more example crashes and look through them, or find some where XP files are not the "cause" or you could upload your crash dump files to your
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a> and somebody with the Windows debugging tools can help take a look at them in more detail.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt.
<br />
<br />
Open BSOD.txt with a text editor Notepad, WordPad, etc.), select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and paste the text from the clipboard (Ctrl-V) back here in your next reply.
<div><br />
<br />
<div>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</div>

<div>Send the BleuScreenView information from the last 5 memory dumps (if you don't have 5 memory dumps yet, send the most recent ones you have).</div>
<div><br />
<div>While you are waiting, please do this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>

<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div><br />
Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it is easiest to just upload the memory dump files from your most recent crashes to your SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing file).&nbsp;&nbsp; Then somebody that already has the Windows debugging tools can take a closer look at things and figure
 out what is going on.<br />
<br />
The memory dump files from the recent crashes and BSODs are usually in this folder:<br />
<br />
<br />
The files will be named something like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to upload the most recent ones...&nbsp; maybe 5-10 of the most recent crash dump files ought to be enough if you have that many.&nbsp; If you do not have that many, send what you do have.<br />
<br />
Getting started with SkyDrive:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/skydrive-get-started</a><br />
<br />
After you get your files uploaded and are looking at them on your SkyDrive, you need to "share" your folders/files so others can see them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that tells you how to do that:<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-skydrive-change-access-permissions-faq</a><br />
<br />
Then choose the "Get a link" button.&nbsp; When you click that, a window will open that contains the link to your SkyDrive files.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Upgraded to Windows 10, computer doesn&#39;t wake up from &#34;sleep&#34; mode</h2>
                    My power settings have my laptop (HP Pavilion) going to sleep after 2 hours, or when I close the lid.&nbsp;I updated to Windows 10 yesterday and now, when the computer goes to sleep, it doesn't wake up when I press anything or move the mousepad. The same thing
 happens when I put it to sleep by closing the lid. When I open it back up two seconds later, the computer won't come out of sleep mode no matter what I touch. I have to hold down the power button and do a hard restart to get back to business.&nbsp;Anyone know what
 the problem is?

<p>Me too. I have altered the power settings (as mentioned on another post) and hope that helps.</p>
<p>I clicked on battery icon and then power settings. Changed when laptop goes to sleep when plugged in to "Never"</p>

            Anyone know how to fix this problem? I've changed all the sleep settings to "Never" also, just for the meantime until I figure this out, but I don't want to have to leave my laptop "on" all the time. It's a waste of energy and it's not good for the hardware
 to never let it cool down.

            I too have an HP Pavilion and have been forced to set the POWER Management sleep settings to NEVER as it requires a hard restart using the power button. &nbsp;Nothing else will wake up the PC. &nbsp;I've noticed on other forums where it was an issue in the Technical
 Preview edition and it looked like MS fixed it, yet here we are with the latest release and it's still broken. &nbsp;I've noticed my laptop is a little more sluggish now with Win 10. &nbsp;I haven't added any new programs or changed my antivirus software. &nbsp;Also a couple
 of times I have been notified that my Antivirus (TrendMicro) was OFF. &nbsp;I turned it back on, but not sure what would cause it to turn off. &nbsp;Is the a site to see current WIN10 issues being addressed by MS? &nbsp;Would be good to know that they are working on it or
 not. &nbsp;I upgraded from 8.1.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem with a Dell XPS 17, I found that if you remove the Intel HD3000 graphics driver the computer wakes up from sleep, the problem is that Windows reinstall the driver and the problem returns.</p>
<p>I have post a video on youtube with my problem</p>

            <p>I had this exact issue with my Pavilion 15 and had it resolved by HP support. Strangely enough, it's a graphics driver issue. All you have to do is update the graphics drivers yourself and you should be good to go!</p>

<h2>            installing older versions of .NET framework and Visual C&#43;&#43; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After I upgraded my PC to Windows 10 , some of&nbsp;my oldish (Windows 7&amp;8) games no longer run properly and the "compatibilty mode" isn't at all helpful . I&nbsp;received advice that this may be a problem arising from "missing" older files&nbsp;, namely &nbsp;MS.Net 4.0 and
 VC++ 2012 . Can I install these much older versions&nbsp;my new Win10 PC ? Is it advisible to do that ?
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance .</p>

            <p>I don't think it will harm your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.net frameworks come in various versions, all put into separate folders. Thus you can have .net 2.0, 3.5, and 4.0 installed at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerning VC++, I think it's the same. In my case VC++ 2008 installed into a separate folder and did no harm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally if a component is considered obsolete, it is not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's about the same when a game wants to install "old" directx 9.0. If the version installed on the PC is newer, the one on the game disk is not installed.</p>

<div>[quote]<strong>When Will GTA Online Be Launched?</strong></div>
GTA Online or Grand Theft Auto Online, the multiplayer component to GTA 5, will launch two weeks after GTA 5 on October 1, 2013.
GTA Online will be free for everyone who bought a copy of the game.
The events of GTA Online take place BEFORE the events of GTA 5.

<div>[quote]<strong>What Are Crews?</strong></div>
'Crews', which have been recently seen in Max Payne 3, will also be used in GTA 5. The 'Crew' mechanic makes use of Rockstar's Social Club, which has been in use since the release of Red Dead Redemption. By creating
 a 'Crew' in a game such as Max Payne 3, players will be able to port across their character between the two games.&nbsp;<br />

<div>[quote]<strong>Any Missions And Activities?</strong></div>
Missions in GTA Online will come in many forms. There will be the typical missions involving meeting up with friends at a specific location to accomplish the goal of the mission. There will also be some more interesting
 missions, including those created by the community. A creator tool will be implemented, with more features promised than the ones that will be offered at launch, to construct your own missions for others to accomplish.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Players will be able to participate in numerous activities while playing GTA Online. These include going to a country club to play Tennis and Golf, get tattoos done, and doing Yoga.[/quote]
<p>[quote]</p>
<p><strong>How About The Players?</strong></p>
Missions are crazy with several modes, such as Cops and Crooks mode (CnC mode), which supports up to 32 players. Cop modes are interesting as there are several side missions, such as checking license plates with a police scanner
 and making arrests for stolen vehicles.
Players with a lower rank will be assigned to do low-level missions, also known as fetch quests. On-the-fly missions can be launched with little to no organization. With multiplayers such a feat can be possible, and lets face it,
 its just fun. Such a mission assigns each member n a multiplayer group a part in a robbery or heist, which will give a better chance of making off with a huge booty.[/quote]
<p>[quote]</p>

A file pulled from Rockstars website seems to show that GTA Online players will be able to buy in-game cash with real money. A Reddit user found and analysed an XML file from Rockstars website, which seems to show
 virtual items available for purchase in Grand Theft Auto 5s online component. These items seem to include cash packs in denominations of $100,000, $200,000, $500,000 and $1.25 million.[/quote]

One of the new features in Grand Theft Auto V is the addition of the&nbsp;<strong>stock market</strong>. It works just like the stock markets do in real life with the goal being to buy low and sell high, with one exception, you can
 influence the price of the stock prices. Throughout the game you given assassination missions which will have you kill important people for various companies in order to drop their stock price while their competitors stock price sky rocket.

<p><strong>Very nicely done! I do have a question though. With the stock market if you go and blow up a rival trucks or planes etc how long does it take to take effect on the stock market? I destroyed FlyUS planes for hours and it didn't make AirEmu go up at
 all! AirEmu went down and I lost lot of money... I made sure to destroy flyUS planes only! I found that the stock market in single player is random for me&nbsp;and the only way you can effect it is through Lesters missions. This is my 4th play through.

Hey there HASH,
At first thanks for your feedback! I appreciate it =)
Second, to answer your question:
<span>If the stock price of a rival drops, it will increase the price of other. What you need to do is invest in one company and then destroy its rival to increase the value of your stock leading to profit.</span>
FlyUS is a competitor in the Stock Market and has AirEmu as rival. So what you will have to do is invest in FlyUs and destroy as much AirEmu planes as you can. This should double your money easily.
Hope this helped =)

SamxBroski

Hey again HASH,
It seems that the stocks vary a lot. I suggest that you try investing in some other companies.
<strong>Example:</strong>
Invest a million in Burgershot and shoot some people at the Up 'n Atom.
See if this works for you =)

<p>Just to add to this IGN has confirmed that if you invest into taco bomb then go destroy tons of chucken bells trucks etc it does not effect the stock market. same with destroying flyus or AirEMU. the only thing that effects it is doing missions.

<p>I have spent multiple hours destroying Coolbeans, Burgershot, Tacobomb, Flyus, Logger, and Gopostal with no significant results. In most cases the rival stock dropped or didn't move at all.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I think the whole manipulating the market idea is either,</p>
<p>1: Just a theory someone thought up that became a rumor, or</p>
<p>2: It's supposed to work and Rockstar needs to patch it.</p>

<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>I think that the whole 'investing' still is one big mystery.</p>
<p>I invested a lot in AirEMU and destroyed some planes from FlyUS and it definitely got the stocks up. It wasn't much but it was going up.</p>

<h2>            Display adaptor Missing from Device Manager multiple blue screen crashes</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All</p>
<p>I have strange problem my graphic card went missing and its not detected by windows 7 64Bit Home Premium whole display adaptors tree is missing from device manager. Strangely system was still working crashing with blue screens often after windows loaded.
 I thought it could be graphic card problem so I replaced it with new graphic card but problem persists. Reinstaling graphic card drivers is not helping beecause system is not finding compatible devices.</p>
<p>I even updated bios as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My System is Intel Core Duo e7400&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 64bit Home premium 5gig ram</p>

                    when i try to start the service is keeps saying "The Task Scheduler Service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if not in use by other services or programs. I've tried SFC /scannow and deleting the regedit taskcache
 key, but neither worked. any other ways to correct this?

<p>first, the computer does update regularly but its hard to say if this started directly after one</p>
<p>
</p><p>second, the exact error message is "<span>The Task Scheduler Service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if not in use by other services or programs"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>third, Running the Task Scheduler program doesn't&nbsp;seem to have any effect, and the first thing to come up when i do is a message saying "Unable to connect to remote computer"</span></p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. If Task Scheduler will not start, we suggest that you restart it. The service might be disabled that's why the task will not run. Follow the steps below to troubleshoot Task Scheduler.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start menu</strong>.</li><li>Type Services in the Start Search box.</li><li>Right-Click <strong>Services</strong>, and select<strong> Run as Administrator.</strong></li><li>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the <strong>Task Scheduler Service</strong> and select <strong>Restart</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>And have you tried running the System File Checker scan as an Administrator. For more information check this

<p>If the issue still persist, we suggest that you perform clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows 10. Check the article and follow the instructions given.</p>

ok, upon opening the regedit program, I found it was already on&nbsp;
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree</p>
but all the subfolders underneath, boot, logon, maintenance, and tasks were missing. there also appears to be a backup made but it wont import, saying there is an error accessing the registry&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have a question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend has an Xbox Live Gold account and me too. He has FIFA 19, but I don't have. Is it possible for us to play a match together (online), despite the fact that I don't have this game installed at my Xbox? I read that PlayStation has something like "Share
 Play". If it's possible on Xbox?&nbsp;</p>
