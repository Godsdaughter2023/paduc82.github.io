<h2>            I can&#39;t change my default sound output</h2>
                    <p>My PC was working fine until I updated it yesterday. I tried to reset it to the earlier version but this didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that the headphone slot on the front of my PC won't work anymore. It's named "Headphones" in the settings.</p>
<p>The sound slot that works is the one on the back of my PC. It's called "Digital Output."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my Headphones slot to work as it's the one I need for these headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go into the settings of playback devices it shows that "Headphones" is Standard device for communication. And "Digital Output" is standard device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to change Headphones to make it the default device, it won't let me. When I disable Digital Output, my sound stops working and a red icon with a cross comes up on my sound icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make it so that it lets me choose my standard device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, I've already tried these things:</p>
<p>- Made sure the headphones work</p>
<p>- Made sure they were properly plugged in</p>
<p>- Updated all drivers for sound</p>
<p>- Uninstalled the device</p>
<p>- Restarted my PC multiple times</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone knows how to solve this issue!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Why I can&#39;t recover my password&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    I'm logged into my skype on my mobile, but I don't remember my password. I tried to recover it, but it's impossible! On my mobile, I opened my microsoft account and checked the email, but the password recovery continues giving me only my old email, which
 doesn't exist any more! I tried to pass it through "don't remember anything" couple of times, filling all the questions, including 3 contacts (and I'm sure about everything, as I have my skype in fron of me), but every time it's saying the same -&nbsp; it can't
 be recovered! What I'm expected to do now to recover my password?&nbsp;

<h2>            USB Sound Adapter&#47;Turtle Beach Amigo II</h2>
                    I have a USB Sound Adapter (Sound Card) cause my laptop doesn't play sounds. However, the Turtle Beach USB Sound card worked fine this morning before I went to work. When I came home the sound is much, much lower than it should be and the vocal parts of
 music are almost unhearable. Can anyone give me tips on how to fix this?&nbsp;

            Hi May.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.
<br />
<br />Let us know if there's anything else.  
<br />
<br />If not then you can mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.

    <title>Important Update to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Important Update to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having a quick chat with Mister Sconnie about this season's tier rewards, it was discovered that there was an update to the conditions of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, post E3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to convert to Ultimate, ANY Xbox Live Gold or Xbox Game Pass code redeemed
<strong><em>after</em></strong> the current £1/$1/€1 offer ends, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>will be added to your Ultimate subscription</em></span>, up to a collective maximum of 36 months (this is made up from both current Gold and Game Pass subscriptions, plus the 1 month purchased, via upgrading). This information can be found on this Xbox
 Support page, in case you would like further re-assurance. :)</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>"<strong>With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, can I still redeem codes for Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Yes. These codes will automatically convert to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a ratio based on the ERP (Estimated Retail Price) of those codes. Conversion rates are subject to change.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens to my prepaid months of Xbox Live Gold and/or Xbox Game Pass when I sign up for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>When you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, we’ll apply any prepaid time you have on Xbox Live Gold and/or Xbox Game Pass toward the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate plan, up to
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">a maximum of 36 months</span></strong>. Prepaid time conversion rates are subject to change.</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the pinned post, please read through that page carefully, in regards to cancellations, exchange rate changes, turning off auto-renewal and any other questions you may have, as it may be updated in coming days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>When it comes to adding Gold or Game Pass with an active Game Pass Ultimate subscription, I think the following part is important to point out too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>With Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, can I still redeem codes for Xbox Live Gold and Xbox Game Pass?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Yes. These codes will automatically convert to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at a ratio based on the ERP (Estimated Retail Price) of those codes. Conversion rates are subject to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conversions are on the site. </p>

            <p>Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?</p>
<p>If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle</p>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</p>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 - Upgrade Unsuccessful -Reboot Loop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Upgrade Unsuccessful -Reboot Loop</h2>
                    Hello, I purchased Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit. I am attempting to upgrade from Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit. On the last step of the upgrade (transferring files/programs/etc), my laptop rebooted and came to a screen telling me the upgrade was unsuccessful
 and my previous OS files would now be restored. My laptop is now in what seems to be a loop of restarting and trying to restore the files.
<br />
<br />
Each copy of Windows I have are genuine (not pirated or anything), and I ran the Windows 7 Upgrade Compatibility Advisor and received no warnings from it before attempting to upgrade. My laptop meets the minimum requirements for upgrade.
<br />
<br />
Please help me out.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose your language settings and hit "Next"<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Repair Your Computer" link at the bottom of the screen. This will launch Windows RE.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Do not click on “Install Now”</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Choose the OS to repair, and take note of the Drive Letter assigned to the operating System.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see “Windows 7” and D:\ (the drive letter may be different)<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Next and you should see a list of the recovery tools<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Command Prompt”<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will see “X:\Sources” in white on a black background, you can type commands here</p>
<p>Once you have booted into WinRE please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Type "cd c:\users" at the command prompt. <br />
2. Type "dir /s /p", and look for the words "<strong>is too long</strong>".&nbsp; <br />
3. If you don't see "<strong>is too long</strong>" on the first page, press a key to get the next page
<br />
4. Look on the second page for "<strong>is too long</strong>".<br />
5. Continue to press a key to advance in pages until you find all the strings "<strong>is too long</strong>". (This may take quite a few pages to get to the end)</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You may see more than 1 entry that has "<strong>is too long</strong>", please take a note of each entry as we will need the folder names in later steps.</p>
<p>Once you have identified all the folders with "<strong>is too long</strong>" we will need to move them into a temp location.</p>
<p>7. Type "move" followed by the path of the folder, then the name of the temporary location to move to:</p>
<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong>&nbsp; MOVE C:\USERS\BOB\DOCUMENTS\DOCUMENTS C:\TEMP</p>
<p>8. Once all the invalid folders have been moved, repeat step 1 and 2 to verify that there are no other folders with "<strong>is too long</strong>"<br />
9. Once completed, restart the computer and <strong>you should be able to successfully boot into Vista</strong>.<br />
<br />
10. Once back into a working Vista, open "Computer" and navigate to C:\Users and open your username folder.<br />
11. Right click on each folder one by one and choose "Properties".<br />
12. Click on the Location tab and confirm that the path shown is correctly displaying the path for this folder.</p>
<p>Example: The properties / location of C:\Users\BOB\Documents should have the same correct path listed on the location tab "C:\Users\BOB\Documents".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
13. If any folder's location is not correct, click on "Restore Defaults" and repeat<br />
14. Once all the folders have been corrected, please reboot the computer and retry the upgrade process again.<br />
<br />
I have unlocked this thread, please let me know if you see success with the above steps.<br />

<p>Do you have any third party antivirus installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, then I would have you uninstall the same and check.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 - no mapping between account manes and security IDs was done.</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 and didn't like my user name so I changed it - not the greatest move. Now I get "No mapping between account names and security IDs was done".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found instructions for other versions of windows but windows 10. I have created a new user id but it didn't create a folder in the users folder so I can't copy the files across.&nbsp; I tried creating a new folder but I just get the error message again.</p>
<p>

    <title>Blank Screen when unplugged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ebdent88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank Screen when unplugged</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS x555l laptop running Windows 10, which has all the appropriate updates since I bought the laptop in 2015 and installed Windows 10 as a free download when it was made available.&nbsp; My problem is that when I am on battery power, the screen immediately
 goes blank (black).&nbsp; If I plug the cord back in, it immediately comes back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my Power Options and my screen is set to Full Brightness on AC Power and on Battery Power.&nbsp; I even installed a brand new battery and made sure it was at full charge, yet the problem persists.&nbsp; It's very discouraging to have a laptop that I
 can't use in a potable environment simply because the screen goes blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if this might be a driver problem, and if I might need to download and/or reinstall a new one.&nbsp; I'm very frustrated with this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi EB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go into Device Manager, find the Battery Device, choose the ACPI Device, from Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not choose Unisntall, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            So that confirms it is a hardware problem as suspected.
<br />
<br />Are you using OEM battery replacements, or did this occur with the original factory battery?  There are endless problems with OEM batteries and chargers.  It's very hard to get a good one even if spec'd precisely. 
<br />
<br />If the battery is charging here then it appears to be a battery problem.  Check the manufacturer's Support web page for your full model number to  see if there is a battery issue or recall for it.   Remember you have a full one year warranty for PC and parts replacement or repair so I'd use it if still available.  
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you might need to replace the battery. However I will tell you that most OEM after-market batteries and chargers have problems so I would only buy the official manufacturer's battery from the PC maker to be sure.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>This happened with the original, factory installed battery as well as with a brand new battery.&nbsp; Additionally, after one of the Windows updates, my laptop would frequently drop my Internet connection.&nbsp; After resetting my laptop and reinstalling Windows,
 I no longer have that problem, but all my laptop issues have arisen due to Windows updates.&nbsp; It may be time to consider switching to a Mac as I have too many problems with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the driver for the battery and reinstalled upon restarting the computer.&nbsp; I have tried everything you previously suggested, but the problem persists.&nbsp; From reading online forums, this seems to be a problem for other users of other brand

<p>

            If you reinstalled WIndows and the problem immediately occurred then it's almost certainly a hardware problem, so I'm not sure why you're blaming it on Windows.  But we can pursue it further.
<br />
<br />What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to compare with the install you did.  
<br />
<br />If you complete an install of the quality above and still have the problem, then there's no question it is a hardware issue as suspected.

<p>I had an IT guy remotely take control of my laptop and he tried everything he coukd think of, including your recommendations, without success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He also told me people are saying that the Asus powergear settings are not compatible with windows 8.1 or 10 and ultimately that’s the issue. &nbsp;Since the laptop ran perfectly fine with the installed (with new laptop) Windows 8 and only started having this
 problem with subsequent upgrades of Windows, I assume the problem is related to those newer versions of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether it’s Asus fault for having insufficient hardware or Windows fault for siftware that Asus can’t run properly, it doesn’t really matter. &nbsp;I’m ultimately the one who is left to deal with the problem. &nbsp;Either I work plugged in, or I buy a new laptop.
 &nbsp;Both “solutions” suck for a 3 year old product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’d go back to the installed new Windows 8 if I could, but no longer have the original product key or recovery media for that version of Windows. &nbsp;However you slice it, I’m the one that’s inconvenienced.</p>

            When was the last Clean Install?  
<br />
<br />The WIndows 8 Product Key comes from the factory embedded in the BIOS, can be read by installing ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> and looking for OEM-BIOS key in the list.  
<br />
<br />I can help you reinstall Windows 8.1, but I would try a Clean Install of 10 first since that resolves these kinds of problems for almost everyone, and if it's factory software causing it then you'll have the best chance to try without it.  
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

 the case that my OS and settings need to be reinstalled?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Next, I need to back up the files (pics, docs, videos etc) I have saved on my ASUS Laptop to each of my external hard drives (</span><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Seagate

 options: System Image, Backup and Restore and File History. I have read online about the difference between all of these but am still highly confused! I don't understand what the differences are and whether these duplicate each other...even though I have read
 about them online I am still confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">What
 I have done so far: On each of my external hard drives with Windows 10 I created a System Image of my current laptop (Control Panel, Backup and Restore, Create a System Image), next did Backup and Restore (Control Panel, Backup and Restore, Backup Now) and
 now am doing File History Control Panel, Backup and Restore, File History, Turn On). I don't understand if these are all doing different things or if they are duplicating my backups. Based on what I can see/understand I can't access individual files (ie-individual
 picutres, documents, etc) in System Image or Backup and Restore, which leads me to believe is why I need File History? Lastly, if I use the software that came with my Seagate external hard drive what would it be duplicating from the steps I already did on
 Windows above? &nbsp;Isn't there a way to save everything I need without having to run 3 separate processes (</span><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">&nbsp;System Image,
 Backup and Restore and File History) on each of my external drives?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p><span>I know how this concerns you and will help you out with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can use File History to back up the files on your PC in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the OneDrive files available offline on your PC. Over time, File History
 builds a history of your files. You'll first need to set up a File History drive and turn File History on. For more info, see Set up a drive for File History. If your original files are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore them. You can also browse and
 restore different versions of your files. For more info, see Restore files or folders using File History.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can get to System Image Backup from the File History page under Control Panel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Just go to Start and type "System Image Backup" or "File History" and select System Image Backup at the bottom left.</span></p>

    <title>HDMI not working properly after clean reinstall of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peteradkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI not working properly after clean reinstall of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My&nbsp; Dell Latitude 3450 laptop crashed during the last Windows update and the OS got corrupt, and so I clean reinstalled Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have had problems with my HDMI connection to my TV. I can get a picture and audio, but every five seconds or so the image goes black and the audio cuts, and then reappears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the graphic driver (Intel HD Graphics 5500) and uninstalled and manually reinstalled the driver from the Intel website. Neither of these options did anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what to try next?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the problem is not with the TV or HDMI cable as I have connected to it with a different laptop.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><span>What is the EXACT text of the error messages (including any codes) and how do they appear?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning searchindexer.exe (Start / Control Panel / Administrative
 Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 This is important - it may give us a vaulable clue as to why the service is suddenly stopping for no apparent reason.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To restoart the service go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services and scroll to&nbsp;Windows Search and make sure it is set on Automatic
 (change it if it isn't).&nbsp; If the serviced is Started then stop it and then restart it.&nbsp; If the service is stopped then just start it.&nbsp; That should hold you until the next time the service decides to stop.&nbsp; I'm not sure what's causing this behavior but the
 above procedures may shed some light on the matter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good
 maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your system is slow and sluggish, here are some suggestions to make it faster and save some space at the same time:</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of
 various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software
 solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop).</span></p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands
 of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span>.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster (though perhaps not
 so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using
</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;(which also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of
 normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but
 probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span>&nbsp;is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts
 on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I would also suggest downloading
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.<br />
<br />
</span></span>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least help identify your problem and that the latter procedures will help with the slowness/sluggishness.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Keyboard and mousepad not working &#40;Code 19&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I have a Toshiba Satellite&nbsp;laptop and the mousepad and keyboard have just stopped working. They are both creating a Code 19. This seems to have happened after the laptop was Encrypted via Bestcrypt applcations. Perhaps you could help me with
 a solution on how to fix this. I have tried uninstalling and restarting and this does not seem to correct it. What is strange is the keyboard works to type in the password for the encryption when the laptop is booting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />
Claire</p>

            <p>Hi Claire,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the model no. of the Toshiba Satellite laptop?</li><li>Have you tried using any other mouse and keyboard with the system?</li><li>Has the issue started to occur recently?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>Code 19 occurs with the message "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged." This happens when some registry problem is detected. This can occur when more than one service is
 defined for a device, if there is a failure opening the service subkey, or if the driver name cannot be obtained from the service subkey. Refer to the section
<strong>Code 19 </strong>in the following article:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/310123#19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong>Code 19: Error codes in Device Manager in Windows
</strong></em></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Important: </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: KB 322756 <br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></strong></em></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The best option as of now is to attach some other keyboard or mouse with the laptop and check if that works. Detach any other external device connected to the system and then reboot the system to check if the peripherals work. If they work, then I would
 suggest you to try updating the drivers from the Toshiba website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as the issue seems to be existing after the Bestcrypt application, try uninstalling and reinstalling the application once you get the access to navigate using external mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. As of now, try the above steps and post back with the results, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Command prompt pops up about every hour and then disappears very quickly.</h2>
                    Hi so when I first got on my computer today I don't remember what exactly happened but I think I may have hit some keys on my keyboard that caused my command prompt to start up. It loaded up and I was able to do things to it but I didn't read anything
 in it and just shrugged it off as hitting a weird combination of keys so I closed it. And now for the rest of the day it's just been randomly popping up, mostly every hour or two. It pops up for less than a second and then disappears. I've searched online
 for tips and I've found one from here:&nbsp;https://malwaretips.com/threads/command-prompt-randomly-pops-up-and-disappears.61591/ and it says&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">C:\Program
 Files\DriverSetupUtility\FUB\FUB_Send.bat is the problem. I don't really know how to operate Task Scheduler so I don't know how to locate and delete this file, this is all assuming that this guy in question is the reason for this. I've run a malawarebytes
 scan and a rootkit scan and have found nothing. Any help would be appreciated, cheers.</span>

<p>- Open the task scheduler as administrator</p>
<p>- In the top left of the window you should see the 'library'. double-click it</p>
<p>- Open the folder 'Microsoft', then 'Office'</p>
<p>- In the next window you should find the tasks <strong>OfficeBackgroundTaskHandlerLogon
</strong>and&nbsp; <strong>OfficeBackgroundTaskHandlerRegistration</strong></p>
<p>- Check the time time of the <strong>....Registration</strong> -task to see if it fits with the time your command prompt starts and closes.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3f64364a-0394-4d77-835f-2ee8248f6b62" title="Maria4RyanCornell">

</p><p>There is no option for you to pin a group to your phone's home screen, but you can pin your group for it to be shown on top of your Chats tab inside the Skype application.
</p>
<ol>
<li>From the <strong>Chats</strong> screen, tap and hold on the group you want to manage.&nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>Pin Chat</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
