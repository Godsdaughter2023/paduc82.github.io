<h2>            Hyper-V Virtual Machine window size.</h2>
                    How can I make the hyper-v virtual machine guest operating system (XP Prof) to use all of my monitor screen? Right now it's just showing on about a 7x7 window.

            <p>Right-click the XP desktop to go to Properties and change it's screen resolution.</p>
<p>The VM window itself also has a full-screen mode that you probably already used, but it would show black around the XP desktop if its resolution wasn't turned up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi ch_hau,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>Try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Run SFC (system file checker) scan to find and fix missing or corrupt system files.<br />
a. Click Start, click Run, type cmd and click ok.<br />
b. On the command prompt, type sfc /scannow and hit enter.<br />
c. If prompted, enter the Windows XP CD to complete the scan.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The service pack version on the CD should match with the service pack version installed on the computer.<br />
d. Restart the computer and check the difference.</p>
<p><strong>See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Description of Windows XP SFC scan</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Check if any non Microsoft program is causing this issue<br />
a. <strong>See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a></strong><br />
b. If the issue does not persist. From the article, follow Method 1 and Method 2 to find out if any program is causing the issue.<br />
c. Once you've found the culprit i.e. the program that's causing the issue, then uninstall it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> From the article do not forget to follow "Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state"</p>

            If your system is running slow, even with simple tasks, you may have insufficient RAM, or have possibly contracted malware that is slowing down your system. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Checking for Malware would be my first recommendation. &nbsp;Removing these programs and preventing them from returning can be an immense help.</div>

            Checking for malware first is always a good idea, like the other contributors suggest.&nbsp; It does not make sense to troubleshoot a system that is afflicted with malicious software.<br />
<br />
If you still have issues, then I would do this:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more gory details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Keeps on switching between the desktop and start screen.</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today, I switched on my laptop and went on the start screen. Everything was ok at first. But when I went onto the desktop, the screen suddenly went green, which is the same colour of my start screen background. The taskbar was still there at the
 bottom and then suddenly it went back to the desktop, it then loaded a few of the thumbnails on the desktop and the same thing happened again. I left my laptop on for about 20 minutes and it was still changing from the desktop to the green colour of the start
 screen, I cant select anything from the taskbar, it has the loading icon instead of the mouse when I try to hover over the task bar and when I try to move my mouse to the top right corner, I cannot select anything still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me? Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore&nbsp;might resolve your issue, but am not sure about the subscription of the Norton Antivirus. For that you need to check with the Nortan support forums. You can contact them on the link given below.</p>

            I did a system restore too and I was a bit nervous when it did the updates that I guessed caused the issue and it worked completely fine after the updates and it has been running smoothly ever since.

<p>
I am having the same NSIS Temp Folder Error and it &nbsp;is preventing me from downloading and installing various programs in Windows 8.1. I cannot load Firefox and IMVU. I also tried to download a fix and it would not install it either. I have been working on this
 issue for days. I even went so far as to refresh my laptop taking me to ground 0 and if I knew it was going to wipe out all my info I would have NOT done it. I was using AVG but now it has reverted to Norton</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your description, I understand that you are getting NSIS error while installing any program on your computer and your issue still persists even after performing refresh on your Windows 8 computer. I will certainly help you with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I recommend you to uninstall all the security software from your computer followed by the scanning of your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Uninstall anti-virus and then perform the troubleshooting steps which I have suggested in my previous post.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><strong><span>Disclaimer:
</span></strong></em><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to
 temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Run a full computer scan with the
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 to make sure that the computer is free from virus.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing
 antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being
 downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting
 the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>After completing system scan please perform SFC scan followed by installing Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to perform
</span><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">SFC scan</span></span></a></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 and check if that helps. The <strong>sfc/scannow </strong>command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once SFC scan would be completed please perform DISM command from Method 3.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To resolve this problem, use the
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">System Update Readiness tool</span></span></strong></a><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
 Then, install the Windows update.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure that all the Windows Updates are installed on your computer as the issue may be occurring due to some missing security updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps to install available Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press <strong>Windows + C</strong>, type
<strong>Windows Update</strong> in the Search box, then click <strong>Windows Update</strong> in the results pane.</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. After the scan is complete, click
<strong>Review optional updates</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Click the check box next to the updates, then click&nbsp;<strong>Install updates</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>If prompted, review the license agreement, then click
<strong>I Accept</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the updates.
</span><span>If prompted, reboot your computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we‚Äôll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

<h3> dru4242  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have &#40;local&#41; money in my account - but when I purchased online it used my credit card.. why can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t this local money be simply re-applied&#63;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm extremely upset about the lack of help I was able to get from "customer support chat"... unreal. I "purchased" a game via the web site. I have over $60 in my "local" xbox account. However, when I purchased the game all the funds
 were from my credit card and there is "no" way to reapply/refund/credit/move the 'local' xbox account money to cover my purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just dumb, the customer service guy basically told me, you should have purchased the game from the xbox 360, then it would have used my xbox live account money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why can't I just get "refunded" my money I've already put into my account. THIS IS SO NONSENSICAL!!!! I can tell you one thing, I'LL NEVER BE BUYING ANYTHING FROM Microsoft/XBOX if this keeps up and I don't get some resolution to
 this! Such terrible customer service. Why would I ever put money into my account if I didn't want to use that first?!?!</p>
<p>My "reference" to my super "helpful" chat was: <strong>

<p>It's better to contact phone support in order to contact billing to receive a refund. 1-800-4my-xbox However, everything in the marketplace does state that there are no refunds so there is no guarantee they will give you one. Also, both the website and the
 console tell you what payment method you are using before you confirm the purchase. So you would have confirmed the fact that you were using your credit card.

<h2>            Setup incomplete because of a metered connection windows 10 &#47; Bluetooth Device &#47; LTE Connection</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Arc Bluetooth Mouse which was working verry well until today. Now the Bluetooth manager tells me that "Setup incomplete because of a metered connection". I'm using a LTE connection to work mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite strange that Windows 10 want to connect to the internet for a repairing of my bluetooth mouse since the mouse was installed (paired) and worked perfectly</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thanks for your assistance</p>

            <p>Guru,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the repeat of the "standard" Microsoft reply, which is to blame it on the other guy and to tell you to go get new drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest Bluetooth drivers for my system came out in October. My problem just started. Deleting and wiping out the drivers and then reinstalling them from the latest drivers offered by Acer. (I have a new Acer Predator with the 6th Gen i7 CPU etc) DID
 NOT FIX THE PROBLEM, as expected. I don't know what **** MS sneaked in to my system that has broken my Bluetooth but they need to own up to it and put an end to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a support engineer for Microsoft you should know the only correct answer is to ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. MICROSOFT MUST STOP ALL FORCED UPDATING PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will remove the reason people are setting ALL network connections to Metered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Make absolutely sure that Bluetooth settings, controls etc are NEVER EVER EVER mixed with WiFi. THEY ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ITEMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And they are DIFFERENT PIECES OF HARDWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My setting a
 WiFi connection to metered MUST NEVER EVER affect the Bluetooth. DUH, that is just common sense. This is a BUG or Design Defect, it can be nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it is way beyond time for MS to end the evil of forcing updates. It is why everyone, who has the knowledge to do so, is setting ALL their network connections to metered. It is the only way to gain control from Microjunk/Microspy/Microexploiter and I
 could go on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems here are all a result of bugs or design defects or intentional nefarious endeavors to steel your personal info, remove your anonymity, something that everyone should be required by law to maintain, sell it and put UNWANTED UNACCEPTABLE ads in
 front of you whether you want them or not!&nbsp; Why else would Microsoft allow a "Unique Advertiser ID" to even exist, let alone turn it on by default. HOW DISGUSTING. HOW EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to do that to the unsuspecting
 millions of users. HOW ABSOLUTELY EVIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the first thing Microsoft has to do is END FORCED UPDATES IMMEDIATELY!!!!!! The second is to tell me what to edit in the registry etc to tell the system that my Bluetooth IS NOT METERED, and IT MUST NOT GO TO THE INTERNET!!!!!! DUH!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to help from a real engineer with real usable answers, not caned useless "OBVIOUS" trouble shooting steps. (I got 30+ years in PC trouble shooting, I need meat in the answers) It is OK to mention them, as there are newbies and armatures looking
 for these answers, but DO NOT make that the only answer an expect it to be correct. A REAL ENGINEER would be looking at all the settings in the registry, the programming code logic that "decides" what is metered and what is not etc as that is where the REAL
 problem lies. Not in drivers that HAVE NOT CHANGED and that were working fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who will help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ralph</p>

            <p>What is the answer from Blue Tooth? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am unable to connect via bluetooth (windows 10) and I am configured for a metered internet connection (legit as I am using Xplornet Satellite).</p>
<p>I also agree that we should have more control over update downloads. Ironically, even with metered connection on, I still receive automatic updates. but, that's another problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much like to be able to connect my laptop to blue tooth devices (plural, hence not third party manufacturer dependent).

            <p>I had the same problem not being able to connect a bluetooth speaker to my laptop while on a metered WiFi connection. The way I solved this problem was relatively easy. I temporarily set the WiFi connection as not being metered, just for a few seconds in
 order to allow the bluetooth connection to be esatblished, and then put my WiFi connection back to being metered. My bluetooth connection kept alive even after setting the WiFi connection back to being metered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with other commenters in considering very inconveniencing the fact that in Windows 10 (excluding W10 Professional)&nbsp;one has to set the connection to being metered in order to stop unwanted or incorrectly scheduled Windows updates, particolarly on
 metered connections. <br />

    <title>Emprex Monitor LM2201 black screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emprex Monitor LM2201 black screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a 22" Emprex monitor that I have been using for many years w/o problem on my windows XP.</p>
<p><br />
I started having a strange problem on my PC. Normally when I touch the keyboard, it comes out of blank screen saver. When I touched the keyboard, screen would come for a second and then go blank. Doing it gain wouldn't help and it stays blank. Only when I power
 off/on the screen would come and stay on until screen saver kicks in. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought it was the keybaord, replaced the keyboard but save problem. I even reinstalled my graphic card hw/sf but no help.</p>
<p><br />
Finally I swaped the monitors with my other PC and the same problem is happending with the other PC that has this Emprex monitor.</p>
<p><br />
This confirmed to me that the problem is the the monitor.<br />
Any known issues and solutions will be highly helpful.<br />
Thanks</p>

    <title>Family Sharing Multiplayer Problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Family Sharing Multiplayer Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have a big problem. <br />
My brother and I each have a Xbox One in one house. Therefore, we have Family Sharing enabled, so he downloads the games and I can play them as well. The problem is this now:</p>
<p>Some games (such as Forza Horizon 2 or Project Spark) I just can not play online often, in Forza 2 Horizon I could just barely join a game and in Project Spark I'am also very often unable to join my brother (we are currently working on a game). Yesterday
 we tried to turn off family sharing since Project Spark is free anyway, we have tested it from time to time and each time it worked immediately.</p>
<p>I don't understand the whole, is this a bug or by design of Microsoft, as described above, the problem occurs frequently, but not always.</p>
<p>I hope I get some help here.</p>
<p>greeting <br />
NEXU5 97</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>(Sorry for my bad English, I'm from Germany)</p>

<p>I am assembling drivers etc preparatory to a clean installation of Win7 on an Intel DQ45CB, with Raid1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows usually asks me to press F6 to install RAID drivers from a floppy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my machine doesn't have a floppy drive. (I'm old enough to remember what a floppy drive was).</p>
<p>So how will I get Intel's "F6 driver diskette" drivers on to my system during the Win7 install?</p>
<p>Sorry if this sounds like a dumb question.</p>

<p>Well if the driver is supported in Windows 7, look into a USB flash drive as a substitute.</p>

<h3> robert h652  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovering information from Zip disks</h2>
                    <p>I need to recover some information stored on Iomega Zip disks.&nbsp; I am running windows 10 on a Dell Inspiron 3000, Processor - Intel Core i5-4460 CPU @3.20 GHz, 8.00 GB Ram, 64 bit operating system, X64 based processor.&nbsp; I have 2 old Iomega 250mb Zip drives:&nbsp;
 one (model # Z250P) uses a 26 pin parallel connection the other (model # Z250USBOCMBP) uses a usb powered connection.&nbsp; What do I need to get either of these Zip drives to work so I can recover the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that windows 10 no longer supports the Iomega Zip drives but I have read a number of posts where people have gotten them to work with windows 10.&nbsp; Some using the USB powered Zip drive said that they simply connected the drive and it worked.&nbsp; When
 I connect the USB drive my computer recognizes it but I get a driver error.&nbsp; I have tried a number of the solutions found on line and so far none have made a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I read some responses that a board with an additional port needs to be installed to use the Iomega parallel Zip drive model # Z250P.&nbsp; &nbsp;I do not really want to go this route but will if necessary.&nbsp; If this is the only solution what specific board/port would
 I need to add to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information that anyone can provide would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; The files I'm trying to recover have great sentimental value to a family member.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Robert,
<br />unfortunately Iomega Zip driver require special software and there is no Windows 10 version.
<br />You may try any expansion card .with LPT port (~$10-15 I suppose) and try to install Iomega drivers.
<br />But I think it would be simpler to find computer repair workshop having PC with older Windows and ask them to copy files to USB flash.

    <title>Black Ops Freezes on Loading Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hebrewhammer19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Ops Freezes on Loading Screen</h2>
                    
<p>COD has always worked fine on my network, then all of a sudden starting a week or so ago, every time I try to enter a game, it simply won't connect. &nbsp;I can join the lobby just fine, party up with friends, and choose a map, but as soon as the load bar finishes
 on the bottom of the screen to get into the actual game, a small circular loading looking thing pops up just to the right side of the bar and I never connect. &nbsp;According to my friends, it says I leave the game instantly as soon as they connect. &nbsp;Like I said,
 I have never had issues with Xbox live before at the same house with the same connection (I use plug-in not wireless), and the issue ONLY happens in COD.</p>
<p>Update: &nbsp;I tried one more time last night to see if something had changed and wasn't even able to join a party with friends (it just said the party no longer exists). &nbsp;Also, I am able to join games already in progress and then can play the entire game with
 no lag whatsoever, but when the next round starts, I am unable to connect again.</p>
<p>Any ideas what could possibly be going on?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have also been getting this problem.</p>
<p>I can play other games, or watch an entire movie on Netflix, etc. just fine, but whenever I put the CoD Black Ops game in, &nbsp;my system freezes. It freezes the controller/system to the point where even holding the power button down on the controller does nothing
 - I have to physically press the power button on the 360.</p>
<p>I lost my original Black Ops game and went to Gamestop to purchase a brand new one (as well as some DLC), and I didn't even open the package for a week (which I think is when the 'exchange' window cuts off for Gamestop games). But as soon as I opened it,
 I put the game in the system, and it loaded up the Treyarch entry-video... and then the screen flashed pink/purple and froze.
</p>
<p>I shut the system off, and tried again, and it froze once it got into the game where your character is sitting in the chair with the 'Single / Multiplayer / Zombie / etc.' tv is showing, after about 3 seconds. I tried again, and it only got to that screen
 for about a second, and froze.</p>
<p>I tried playing last night, and was able to get into the 'Multiplayer' mode, and got as far as setting up a class, but then it froze once more.
</p>
<p>I have uploaded the game to the system's hard drive, but nothing changes - it still freezes within a minute of playing the game at all.</p>
<p>Hope to hear some good news from you guys! (And good luck to others who have this issue.)</p>

<p>Well Fitzer, when&nbsp;I play on black ops xbox live or even private match,&nbsp;I can only seem to be able to load the game to about 95%&nbsp;or 98% through before a little spinning circle appears and&nbsp;I have to go back to the dashboard. I've been attempting many different
 solutions such as clearing cache, redownloading the annilation map pack (which&nbsp;I got the same day this all started), restarting my router, and making some space on my hard drive. By the way&nbsp;I have an older xbox with smaller memory . I found out that&nbsp;I can
 play wager match and some maps on core ( i dont play any other game types). But it seems that i cant play on firing range and nuketown. Since this started (about 4 days ago) ive been able to fix some of it, but those last two maps (which are my favorites),&nbsp;I
 cant seem to be able to play on. I guess&nbsp;I just need help finishing the problem.</p>
<p>-Thanks, and&nbsp;I hope this is enough information.</p>

<p>When you say you have to 'go back to the dashboard,' what do you mean specifically? Are the maps freezing? Are you returned to the dashboard automatically? As for the two maps you're having issues with, they are not in the DLC, correct? If this is the case,
 can you try deleting that DLC, to see if it makes any difference? Also, is your drive mostly full? If so, can you delete some content (to free up space), to see if that resolves the issue? Please let me know if either of these steps give you any results.

<h2>            How do I repair&#63; C&#58;&#92;Windows&#124;system32&#92;config&#92;systemprofile&#92;Desktop refers to allocation that is unavailable</h2>
                    <p>When logging on to Dell Inspiron Laptop (running Windows 7 64-bit operation system), I get following message:</p>
<p>C:\Windows|system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop refers to allocation that is unavailable. It could be on a hard drive on this computer, or on a network. Check to make sure that the disk is properly inserted or that you are connected to the Internet or your
 network, and then try again. If it still cannot be located, the information might have been moved to a different location.</p>
<p>Upon closing this pop-up message, I get a blank desktop with just recycle bin. I can still locate my desktop folders and files by going to Computer and using windows explorer to chase down through Users but have not been able to restore the desktop to what
 it was. Note that internet connection is limited as well.</p>
<p>I found a blog that suggested going in and copying the desktop folder from Users directory to the path above. I did try this and it did not work.</p>
<p>Please note that I am no longer able to connect to our home network. Not sure if this issue is related or not.</p>
<p>When I start in safe mode, I am able to see desktop items but functionality is limited.</p>
<p>I did try to do a system restore but that failed.</p>
<p>Have not yet tried safe mode with network. Should I?</p>
<p>Any suggestions before I restore back to factory settings?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I could not access config folder in normal operation mode so, as Sathish instructed, I copied desktop folder from User folder to System32/Config/Systemprofile while operating in Safe Mode. This failed to resolve my problem so I moved on to a restore. Unable
 to access system restore in normal operation so I attempted in safe mode. This too failed - error message 0x80071a91.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> slayer55524  say:</h3>
<h2>            360 starting to Die or failing&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A few weeks ago my 360 started acting weird such as slow gaming or performance issues.(such as lagging game or unbalanced registry in online and offline games) I know the basic way is to reset the cash in the drive which I did and it started working. Now
 my 360 barely can start yet alone attempt to send a message and now it can not start up up a game. (does not show disc read error just starts the game but never leaves dashboard) So I wanted to ask is there anything I can do or do I have the ability to replace
 my 360?</p>

Just to see try removing the HDD and see if the problems persist OP.<br />

As far as replacing it goes you could buy yourself a new one, but it might be better to see whats wrong with this one first. It might be something you can have fixed by MS.</em></p>

            <p>Hi chainblock,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting here. I understand that you are not able to open a photo in Photo Gallery.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To isolate first your issue, can you verify what file type are you trying to open in Photo Gallery (that you use for work) which led you to the error message you have stated above?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that there are specific picture and video files that can be shown in Photo Gallery. To know more regarding this, you may read on the article below, the file types are enumerated under

<p>Hiya, Eskimosound!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from Xbox Forum Support here to assist in the situation, it looks like the issue is trying to watch a movie and it won't play. Which movie was purchased, as well could we try doing a

Power Cycle </a>on the console and see if this helps resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
Happy gaming!</p>

<p>I would contact the support desk -&nbsp;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us</p>
<p>I know there's an issue with content and purchases at the moment, so it could be related to that and maybe the licenses didn't apply</p>

<p>I know this is a complete and utter waste of time...</p>
<p>I have bought a movie on Xbox and it wont play.</p>
<p>I'm getting the&nbsp;Error code 0xc101a3ff.</p>
<p>Anyone got a fix?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>OK as I thought, useless....</p>
<p>So Guy's what you do is...</p>
<p>And this is the easiest way..</p>
<p>On Xbox go to the Film and TV app...</p>
<p>Go to purchases, find your movie and DELETE it.</p>
<p>Then go to the Microsoft Store and search for your Movie/TV Program.</p>
<p>Click watch...and amazingly, yep, amazingly it will work.</p>
<p>You can then stop it and watch it through the Film and TV app purchases if you like or just carry on.</p>
<p>You do EXACTLY the same on Windows 10...</p>
<p>Man Alive I should work for Microsoft...</p>
