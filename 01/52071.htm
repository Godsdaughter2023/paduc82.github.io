            Hi, right click an empty part of your Desktop, choose View and uncheck 'Auto Arrange Icons'
<br />
<br />If your icons are still moving around, this is a known bug in Windows 10. On your Desktop, press the Ctrl Key and scroll down on your mouse wheel to make your icons slightly smaller and it should stop this behavior . . .

<h3> callie meyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change my profile picture on the People App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, I can't change the 'Me' profile picture that appears on the People App. I've already Googled this, and people say, "All you have to do is click on the "Me Tile" and then click it again to either take a picture or Browse for a picture, but
 for some reason, I can click on my picture once, but not twice. When I click on it once, it leads me to my profile page with my Facebook, notifications, etc.&nbsp; This is the part where some people say I can simply click on the silhouette picture and change it
 to what I want, but I can't click on it. Underneath though, it says "View Profile, More Details", so I clicked on this and all it did was show me some of my information. Even at this page, I can't click on the profile picture to change it and there is no "change
 profile picture" button that I can see. Any help would be much appreciated, as this is going to drive me insane until I figure this out!

<p>&nbsp;Arlen E: Is your device a laptop/computer or is it a tablet?&nbsp;<br />
Its a tablet but it is a fully functioning computer runs all programs so its a laptop the size of a tablet running Windows Pro 8.1
<br />
Arlen E: Alright. The reason we asked you for this is because the Kobo App is currently not working for Tablets running Windows 8 or above. The Kobo App has been removed from the Windows Store and you will only be able to use it if you have a computer/PC and
 you would have to download the software from the website hope this helps</p>

            Hi Silver.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it.  I will vote up the feedback with my MVP badge and also monitor and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />Just think of the Explorer's OneDrive folder as a normal folder to copy from and to.  If you don't want files kept in the cloud just empty the folder out.  
<br />
<br />I personally have had my User folders (Desktop, Documents, Pictures, etc) all moved into OneDrive for years without a problem.  It keeps them sync'd across all my devices which I do the same upon, plus I can sign into oneDrive on the internet to get to any of them I want.  I've never lost one.  Even if one should get deleted from the PC and its Recycle Bin, it stays in the OneDrive online Recycle Bin to retrieve. 
<br />
<br />This may not interest you but recently OneDrive added two new features and for some reason set them to default on smaller drives, further upsetting consumers.  So check if you have your Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders moved into OneDrive for what they call "Folder Protection" to make your own choice about having this as shown here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Also for smaller drives they have Files On Demand where OneDrive files are only kept in the cloud with a link on your PC to download them from there.  They keep changing my 128gb SSD to have this which I don't want, I assume Windows Updates to OneDrive.  So here's how to choose on that too:  <a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p>You don't copy and paste files from the cloud to your computer -&nbsp; you download files from the cloud to your computer, and from there you can move them to your thumb drive. Here's an illustration using OneDrive. Just click in the circle to select a file,

            Hi SilverParnell
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Open Windows File Explorer and navigate to your flash drive
<br />
<br />Open a Web browser, then log into OneDrive - <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/signin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/about/signin/</a>
<br />
<br />From the resulting page, drag any files you want into your USB Flash Drive
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Once you have all your files, if you want to get rid of OneDrive:
<br />
<br />Right click the OneDrive icon on the right hand side of your Taskbar and choose Settings 
<br />
<br />In settings, you will see 'Unlink this PC/My Account' select that option 
<br />
<br />OneDrive will no longer try to sync your files 
<br />
<br />Then depending on the version of OneDrive you have, you need to uninstall it . .. 
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter 
<br />Go to Programs and features, find OneDrive, select that and choose Uninstall
<br />
<br />If you do not find OneDrive in Control Panel: 
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu) 
<br />In the list of Apps, find OneDrive, select that and choose Uninstall

Games must begin within 15 minutes of scheduled start time (11 PM EST), or else team causing the delay may use a reschedule. A team is allotted 3 reschedules per season.<br />
Games are to be played 3 on 3, no exceptions.<br />
<br />
Players are required to take PG, either SG or SF, and either PF or C.<br />
A team cannot have both a user SG and user SF. A team cannot have both a user PF and a user C.<br />
Users are not allowed to match up vs AI.<br />
<br />
Disconnect rules<br />
If a player lags out in the 1st quarter, play out the quarter and take down the score differential. Play a new game and take team stats and player stats based on the new game and add the score differential when you calculate the score.<br />
<br />
If a player lags out in the 2nd quarter or at halftime, take down the heat check stats while doing your best to estimate turnovers, blocks, steals, and FG%. Make a new game and play another half, add the score heat check stats from that half to those of the
 first half and again do your best to estimate Bs, Ss, TOs, and FG%.<br />
<br />
If a player lags out in the 2nd half, play out the rest of the game but do not include that player's player stats at the end of the game.<br />
<br />
Statkeeping<br />
Winning team must input game stats. Both teams are responsible for player stats.<br />
<br />
Roster Protection and Size<br />
Minimum roster size is 6. Max is 10.<br />
<br />
Player Conduct<br />
Keep any disputes you have off the forums but do not keep them to yourself. Contact a league commissioner or opposing owner to work out the dispute through AIM, Xbox Live, or PMs on the website.<br />

            <p>this feature has been missing since windows 8. I too used the network map feature a lot. windows 8/8.1/10 still have the basic framework for the network map feature, but the feature itself is missing. if you right click on the icon for you router in devices
 and printers, and select 'network map' you get an explorer.exe error, "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs
 control panel."</p>
<p>
</p><p>to the best of my knowledge, there is no application in existence that will plug in to the API (or whatever) in explorer to give us the network map function. If I could program and code stuff, believe me, I would be first in line to create one, since no
 one else seems to have done so. </p>
<p>
</p><p>if I do find a program that does plug into the network map framework I will post it to my thread here:

<h2>            OneDrive Personal Missing &#39;Green Ticks&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Since the 12 July 2017 Windows 10 update the green ticks in the Onedrive Personal folder are missing while the Onedrive Business folder has the green ticks. I have tried the fixes in the community forum, I have tried unlinking and relinking the account.
 I have run a sfc. I applied the restore point from before the update. None of these have fixed the problem.

<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem on both my PCs since the windows update. </p>

            Thanks Joseph. &nbsp;Reset did not fix the problem . Office365 support eventually fixed the problem by completely uninstalling Onedrive and re - installing from office365 business portal. &nbsp;They did say that this was caused by the July update.&nbsp;

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the color code my calendars in the calendar app (green for personal, red for work, etc.) but lately when I go to change the colors of these calendars windows resets them to what it feels are better colors... This seems ridiculous, is there anything
 I can do to make it stop doing this? It seems like I should be able to choose the way I organize my calendar(with regard to color) without windows having a say.</p>

            Hello, I am sorry that the Calendar app isn't working properly. Try resetting the app entirely. Go into settings, then click on Apps and Features, then select the Calendar app, click on Advanced Options, and scroll down until you find the "Reset" button. Click that and restart. See if that fixes the problem. 
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

            Having this same problem. Started with one of the cumulative updates for 1803. Happens on both my machines (an HP desktop, ThinkPad laptop). One at least picks shades of blue for the different calendar, but the other picks magentas and pinks and it's really
 hard to look at! Have not tried reset yet as I don't want to have to go to the hassle of setting the calendars up again, but I may resort to it.

all </strong>calendars will change as soon as I add a new appointment or make an adjustment to an existing appointment, in any one of the calendars.

            This is definitely a bug that has been introduced fairly recently (Sept/Oct 2018) - after me being so glad I could finally use this app because not
<em>that</em> long ago, it started syncing colours properly from Google etc.<br />
Don't leave us stuck in the dark for ages again please MS!

<p>What happened with the latest calendar update? All the displays have changed colours, very bloody annoying when you have colour coded events etc. I understand the need for updates but why do they always change something that you get used to, someone’s idea
 of a joke maybe.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Emile</h2>
                    <p>We installed windows 10 a week ago. &nbsp;My wife's computer has two user profiles and 4 days ago her personal profile (administrator type) stopped working properly. &nbsp;Start menu won't open, also other things like notifications, network. &nbsp;It looks like it is trying
 to refresh the desktop every few seconds. &nbsp;I tried creating a new user account by copying all f her old user files (without ntuser.dat and ntuser.ini) to the new user account. &nbsp;Windows went through at least two hours of setting up apps and finally kept showing
 flashes of an incomplete taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>rebooting computer has not helped. &nbsp;Her other original account works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's stuck in loading the desktop and the problem is in one of the files I copied from the old account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find this file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any het.</p>

            I did create another new profile and copied old libraries and application data to new profile. &nbsp;This worked well for a week, then the start menu and task bar stopped working. &nbsp;I logged on using the profile that has always worked and reinstalled windows
 10 using ISO DVD. &nbsp;Everything is working fine now. &nbsp;I disabled one program that the corrupted profile had that the good profile did not have. &nbsp;This was program "Dropbox". &nbsp;I have no other reason to believe this is the problem though.

<p><span>UAC (User Account Control) usually prompts for administrator credentials only when the user is running a standard account and needs to run executable programs. You can try disabling
 UAC to reproduce the issue. However <br />
<br />
<strong><em>Note:</em></strong> We don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</span></p>

</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select the Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer check box to turn on UAC, or clear the check box to turn off UAC, and then click OK.</span></p>

            Do you have a System Restore point from before the StarDock installation <br />
attempt? I'd consider restoring to that point.<br />

<h2>            SMS support frome mobile operators into skype for android</h2>
                    What i did like with the old days with Hangouts was that i had support for both my Hangouts and Mobile SMS/MMS support into the app.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Today they removed it only like Facebook Messangers today some does support chat and mobile SMS/MMS support into the same app.&nbsp;<br />
Would like to see Skype add the sypport for SMS/MMS into Android so i get all my messages into one singel app today i need to open Android Messangers for that, Skype for that, etc would like to see everything in on&nbsp; place.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Would never send a SMS frome skype becouse for $9 /m i get unlimit SMS/MMS/Calls and 4GB 4G Surf, its just cheaper that any Skype plans out there.&nbsp;

<p>You can open file explorer and right click the folder and select 'Send to' and choose Desktop (create shortcut)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then once on the desktop, right click the shortcut and PIN to the Start Menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>again make another send to from the .. desktop, which will create shortcut2 and then drag it to the taskbar.

<p>

    <title>Why does copying system or user data go so slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alim2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does copying system or user data go so slow&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed many times that copying certain types of data takes a long time- I think it's mainly when copying system or user data. For example right now I had to send my laptop in for repair so I took the drive out of the computer and attached it with usb
 to my other computer. Also attached my backup drive. I had 2 partitions to back up- OS (windows 10) and a data drive. The data drive I backed up at about 70-110 MB/s. The OS partition is averaging about 2 MB/s. This is all from and to the same drives. Neither
 of them are close to being full. The source drive had 160gb of data on a 480gb drive and the destination drive had 970gb free of 1tb. I used robocopy to avoid long filename errors. Like I said I've seen this a lot when I copy complete user data from a system
 drive when I remove it and connect externally, then try to copy.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit- also I don't think it's my computer being slow (unless the data is archived so densely and so fragmented that it takes huge amounts of processing power to get the info for some reason). Source drive is an ssd 90/80 kiops 500/400 seq.destination drive
 unfragmented hdd. Computer processor is quad core 2.5-3.5ghz, 16gb Ram,&nbsp; ssd. I've also noticed same behaviour on other systems (i5-8250u, 16gb Ram, newer ssd) &amp; (i5-6200u 8gb ram ssd).</p>

<p>Copying data from one location to another, whether it's another drive or another location on the same drive, can take varying amounts of time depending on the file sizes and the quantity of files. For example 1GB of data in a single file will copy much faster
 than 1GB of data spread between 1,000 files (the same concept applies to transferring files over the internet). With that in mind, the files in the OS partition could be smaller on average compared to the files on the data partition, which is why you see such
 slower throughput on the OS partition. This isn't necessarily attributed to a slow computer, it's just the fundamentals of file systems.</p>

<p>Hi Carmen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Snipping tools are great in capturing the screen of your PC. It's normal for the screen to go gray when taking
<em><strong>rectangular</strong></em> or<em> free-form</em> snip. Checked if the <strong>
Show screen overlay </strong>is ticked under <strong>Options </strong>on the Snipping tool. If it's checked, we'd like to ask a few questions for better assistance:</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Have you recently installed any application?</li><li>Which anti-virus are you using?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you disable some recent programs that you've installed and antivirus running on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</span></span></p>

            <p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<h2>            Random Language Change</h2>
                    <p>I recently opened up Paint 3D on my SP4, and noticed that my entire Remix 3D sidebar changed into french. My windows language is English, my microsoft account automatically knows that I speak English, but in Remix 3D (this is only when I'm in Paint, not
 the browser) it changes to french. Is this a common problem? Am I just unlucky?</p>

<h2>            Win7 Desktop Icon Save and Restore</h2>
                    Hi. I wanted a program to save and restore my desktop icon layout. I found a reference to Layout.dll shell extension.
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/save-and-restore-desktop-icon-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/save-and-restore-desktop-icon-layout/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; I tought it looked like just what I wanted.&nbsp;I downloaded and installed it. It looked like everything went well, but the context menus are not there, so I apparently did something
 wrong. Does anybody here have any experience with Layout.dll that might help me get my install straightened out? Thamks.
