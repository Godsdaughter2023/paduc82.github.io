<h2>            Any Real Solutions to the Bubbles from Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The bubbles just keep coming back after performing "Troubleshooting" for Hardware Devices and even deleting the Touchscreen device driver.&nbsp; The problem with the second solution is that when you perform the restart the device driver is reloaded and after
 time the bubbles keep coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from all the posts this is a real issue for Microsoft that should be addressed quickly.&nbsp; I almost want to revert to Windows 8 until something is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft going to fix this or ignore it??</p>

            <p>Good Morning Keith!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 8 and 10 are pretty skittish. It sounds to me that the Windows tends to revert back to the original drivers as I have seen this happen at times. This will depend on where the original drivers came from. Whether it could be supplied automatically
 by Windows that was provided by Microsoft or Dell. This is slightly different in this case. If supplied by Windows, there is no way to delete it. If supplied by Dell when installed, it gives you the option to delete the driver so that Windows cannot be able
 to revert back to it. How to find out where the drivers came from is by clicking on 'Properties' of that drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, go into the 'Control Panel' and look for 'Device Manager' in the list. In the 'Device Manger', look for that driver which might be under 'Human Interface Devices'. Once you find that drivers, right-click on it and select 'Properties'. You will see all
 the tabs at the top. Click on the 'Driver' tab. Find out which company that supplied the drivers. If from Microsoft, This will give you the option to uninstall it, but won't give you the option to delete it by placing a check mark in the small white box. Instead,
 you can disable it by clicking on the 'Disable' button. Then re-install the driver provided by Dell. You might be lucky enough that if supplied by Microsoft, will allow you to delete it. If supplied by Dell, if it is an older drivers, simply click on the 'Uninstall'
 button, then the box pops up, you will notice it says 'Delete the driver software for this device'. Put a check mark in the box, then click on 'Ok'. Once uninstalled, it may ask you to restart your computer. Then install that Dell driver. That 'bubble' problem
 should definitely go away for good. If this keeps persisting, then there is no other way unless Microsoft would get their act together to redraw their supplied driver to prevent that 'bubble' issue from occurring&nbsp;or fix&nbsp;the cause of reverting back to the Microsoft
 supplied drivers by means of to allow you to delete it.&nbsp;This is mainly why Dell points to Microsoft for the failure.</p>

            Hi BenjaminCordor 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with Windows unable to update.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you hiding it.  There have been lots of issues being reported , unless there is a specific reason why you need to install this update.
<br />
<br />If you want to install the update, try using the update troubleshooter.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026726/windows-hide-windows-updates-or-driver-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402672...</a>
<br />
<br />As for the blue screen are you still getting it?
<br />
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi Benjamin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have had a similar problem for the last three weeks, after trawling the net I got nothing that fixed the problem and some of the possible fixes were very involved. It was just a few websites giving the old "HMM cant reach this page" etc</p>
<p>Then I remembered that windows has a HOSTS file from my days encountering something similar on windows 7, so I checked where it was located in windows Ten and found it. I copied it to my desk top and opened it. It was full of entries that I really felt shouldn't
 have been there, if you have ever seen a standard MS host file you'll understand what I mean. I got a clean example of what a standard host file should look like from MS website, deleted all the entries and copied the standard entries back into the file then
 I copied it back to the correct location. What do you know? it worked....this was so simple. I haven't encountered any issues so far and I'm happy with how my EDGE is performing. Now I don't want to miss lead anyone thinking it a cure all for DNS errors but
 it work for me. Incidentally the website that were getting errors were NHS Jobs, CWU union and uk pensions . gov. I needed these sites and it was getting close to imperative that I access them, every other website worked in my Fav's except these. I have created
 a short cut to the host file just to check and changes, my windows defender center reported no issues or virus threats so don't know what caused it to fill up. But it worked for me.</p>
<p>I hope this helps other PC users.</p>

    <title>Cannot install AMD APU PCIe Graphics Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot install AMD APU PCIe Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Troubleshooting AMD APU PCIe Graphics Card Installation</p>
<p>I am attempting to install an AMD ATI RADEON HD 3870 PCI Express Graphics Card into a PC with an AMD A8 5600K APU and an existing installation of Windows 8.1 Pro. I cannot get Windows to start properly in normal mode without it erroring and automatically
 restarting the PC. Windows will boot properly into Safe Mode (with Networking), but, of course I cannot install the graphics card drivers in Safe Mode to get the card working properly. Is there a workaround for this problem, a trick to this? I need to find
 a technical solution without having to reinstall Windows, as that would really be an extreme setback. Help!</p>

    <title>Random sounds playing on windows 7 computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gunslinger42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random sounds playing on windows 7 computer</h2>
                    I've just installed Windows 7 Professional on a brand new harddrive which had nothing on it before. I installed the newest graphics and sound drivers and some typical software (browser, instant messenger, etc). I also installed Microsoft Security Essentials
 and allowed it to update and do a scan just for the sake of it, everything was fine. However, at random intervals odd noises will play - the first one sounded similar to an alert noise so I had assumed it was the firewall or MSE blocking something (as I was
 browsing the web at the time) however I could find no detection or messages in either (or in the action center). A little while later I got another (different, but still vaguely alert-like) sound play, this time while I was not browsing the web. And then another,
 and another. There's no real pattern to it, but so far they've all sounded kind of like sound effects from the good ol' pinball game. Anyway, I've done yet another scan with Microsoft Security Essentials and found nothing.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what these sounds are or where they're coming from, any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Try a system restore from before the sounds were occurring. <br />
<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Start button <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next
</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps. <br />

            Since there is no way of knowing what you deleted you are asking a bit of an impossible question. Your best bet would be to either try going to a restore point before you started deleting items, or use your laptops restore partition and set it back to
 factory defaults.<br />

Hope this helps.<br />

 I don't know what it is should I uninstall it...like I said why would Toshiba be on a HP computer unless it came from my flash drive that I took my old Toshiba laptop pictures and my Norton and some more files and I installed them on my new HP...so maybe this
 Toshiba MQ01ABF050 came from my flash drive...all I want to know from Mircrosoft was if I could delete they gave this run around that I had to boot this and do this, like I know how to do that...and then they said they could no longer help cause the session
 ran out...Really.????..then they told me to contact HP or Toshiba..so contacted HP they said its was my hard drive, no how an that be...When its says also Window C, an Recovery D and its full..why it&nbsp;is full I don't know...so t

                    My desktop icons flicker when I open and app or even a folder or shortcut. This is a full updated version of Windows 10 that I installed today but have noticed it on previous 10 installs. If it's not an issue, I am cool with it. I have a high end graphics

            Hey Joe.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It is an issue and shouldn't happen.  It could be WIndows or even hardware.  Let's eliminate Windows first. 
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  For flickering you want to know you have the latest for everything.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with Seatools bootable Long Test: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />followed by a full Disk Check:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks, Greg. </p>
<p>
</p><p>HP just updated the chipset, BIOS, and firmware today and the latest Nvidia Quadro driver fully tested to function in their environment. It’s a brand new instsll of windows and I recently did an extensive, successful preboot diagnostic of the hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give your recommendations a shot. I shouldn’t have said flicker, it’s more like a one time blink. Not assuming that’s any better, just trying to be more specific.</p>

            Joe, can you clarify.  You'd said earlier it happens when you open a file browser which I took at File Explorer from within an app, so i gave you the step to reset File Explorer. 
<br />
<br />Are you saying now that it's occurring when you open a browser from an app?  
<br />
<br />Can you give an example of the app you're in and exactly what you're opening?       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I've narrowed it down to only happening the first time I try to open up a file from within an app. Every time after that, no refresh for that app's working session. If I close the app and open a file again for the first time, icon refresh....same for all
 of my apps, but it's only that first time I go to open the app. MS is trying to tell me to upgrade my video driver but HP just installed the one they recommend for my system yesterday.</p>

            Did you try resetting File Explorer which resolves many issues of others?
<br />
<br />Did the issue happen before HP updated your drivers?  I would try all other available display drivers from Windows Update, and from running the Nvidia Driver scan:  <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />
<br />Are you still running the HP Factory Install?  HP makes great hardware but the factory install is the worst in the industry, larded with bloatware like utilities that duplicate and cause issues with better versions built into Windows.  No enthusiast will run that install but prefer to Clean Install which compiles the best install possible that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:    <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You can also mitigate the HP bloatware and troubleshoot this issue at the same time by establishing a Clean Boot to turn off all of the horrendous loud of Startup Freeloaders that HP allows.  See Step 4 here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I notice that I already gave you all of these options in my first post.  Did you try any of them.  We often find out later that the skipped step was the fix.  Please do not skip any steps.  You can save a System Image backup and set System Restore points to be assured you can get back to the present state:

<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            probably an inactive profile has it. But you'll have to wait until the next gamertag "recycle" to claim that gamertag. Usually they are done every 5 years.

            Many advisors will tell you to disable Superfetch because a SSD doesn't need it while some say leave it on as it improves performance over time. I have an OCZ Agility 2 SSD and have my Superfetch enabled with excellent performance and actually do see better
 performance with Superfetch enabled.&nbsp;

<h2>            Humble indie supplement 18&#47;09</h2>
                    
<p>Hello and welcome to this weeks humble indie supplement, to answer that question before its asked did I not put one out last week as some sign of respect ?</p>
<p>No, I didn’t put one out because quite honestly there were about 3 games worth reviewing so I decided to leave it and do a bigger one this week.</p>
<p>So more rage filled than probably ever I’d say I’m ready to rip some terrible indie games a few new holes and give some others a bit of a boost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prices all in msp</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Primary Potions</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> From the horribly designed start screen to the reaction pictures that would make anime animators blush this game has its flaws, its a pretty basic game about mixing potions together to form other ones, all to fill orders, it’s probably
 1 step up from the old build a burger esc games, each time through giving you a rating which seems to be 99% dependent on time and not on if you *** up or not. In the games favour though it does have an option I wouldn’t have expected an option for colour
 blind gamers so well done to them for that. The game works with no huge flaws</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>Well it’s not a potion for immortality or eternal youth but it’s not a draft of creeping death or asphyxiation so for those mad over the build a burger games you might find a new home here. But for me I think I’ll just heal up and move one.
 (Did I overdo the harry Potter and dungeon crawler references ?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Kings Cup</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Oh indie developers when will you learn, the xbox is not designed to be at those kind of parties. Kings Cup the non copyright infringing name for the game more commonly called Ring of fire at most UK unis involves drawing cards out of
 the circle round the cup, each card having a different thing associated with it. I have played the real life version with a pack of cards a fair few times and as drinking games go it does its job and causes the place to get trashed when you play the spider
 card.</p>
<p>Now the issue here is the fact you have to have an xbox, and TV to play this version, so while the game may be cheap you’re putting expensive items in the line of fire and at a Uni party where ring of fire has been suggested, chances are thing might get
 broken.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>A fair if very misguided attempt to curb student drinking habits, go out and buy a pack of cards from pound land and save yourself the hassle of potentially buying a new 360 and TV after your flatmate spilt beer / was sick over them, or knocked
 them over while playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Play as you go</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> well just like the old game Action 52 Play as you go decides rather than have one game why not have more than one (in this case 3) and much like the games of Action 52 these games are dire, you know in fact I think they make the Action
 52 games look good, these games make Trailer Park King look like the height of technological development they are so basic and dire. You have your generic space shooter with different coloured ships that move differently and it seems embarrassingly easy to
 play to say the least. The second being a Simon Says esc pattern repeater game (which just looking at the how to play section bored me so I didn’t even fire it up). Then a break out variant using a syringe, pills and viruses which barely seems to work having
 a paddle thats so huge but no defined it bounces this way when it hits here areas. All these might seem worth something but it’s not as the game is plagued by loading screens. You start one of the games up, Loading, you start playing the game loading, you
 finish a level and loading, you quit the game to go back to the menu loading, seriously Duke Nukem Forever was less annoying with its loading than this, at least with Duke you could play a fair bit of the level before it had to load, this is 30 seconds to
 1 minute every damn 5 minutes.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>If you see play as you go coming, turn round and go the other way as this is a waste of your 80 Microsoft points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Hacotama</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> &nbsp;Well it’s another Avatar game, but when I looked at the screenshots I was all ready to play another game breaking the avatar game mould right open. Unfortunately this game just fails at that, as though the game works as such the developers
 have failed the give it the polish a 240MSP game needs for me to want it, the game feels slightly clunky and they’ve failed to set the game to adjust to different screen sizes so on my modest 28 inch non widescreen TV I was missing a good 2 inches of the screen
 meaning the tutorial instructions Read “Walk up to the ball and press this will let you push it” so I had no idea of vital controls. The game at its heart is a another space awareness game involving moving balls to the stars to finish levels, it’s not bad
 though not particularly good either.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>Hacotama was the noise I made when I realised the asking price on this game compared to the quality, if it were 80MSP I’d confidently recommend it, if it were 160 I’d say it’s worth a go but for 240MSP this is a definite miss rather than
 a hit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Happy</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well as its all of 2 days before the birthday of the ex who almost bankrupted me and broke up with me 1 week after I spent £350 on her on the verge of our 3 year anniversary the day before one of the most important things in my studies
 all by text while I was 300 miles away then blamed all our relationship problems on me basically equating me to nothing more than a disgusting slug, this game might seem like an Ironic review here. A game that claims to make people happy and without me having
 to consume my own body weight in alcohol to achieve it. Well sorry to say but it fails miserably. You play as a fat guy rolling through supposedly beautiful scenery like some kind of Sonic the hedgehog who missed 5 years of school thanks to being repeatedly
 dropped on his head. There’s power ups along the way such as the mushroom, which make you fart while in the air to get more height and the chilli which makes you far like a jet engine whizzing across the level, now as much of a fan of toilet humour as I am
 even this insanity failed to raise a smile. The goal of each level is to reach the cake at the end and the trial cuts you off after all of two levels with a nice message saying buy the real game and we’ll give some money to a charity, which charity is never
 specified but I find this a highly suspect tactic to sell what is probably the worst excuse for a plat former I’ve yet to play and not even emotional blackmail of making me think I’ve depriving a charity of money will make me buy this.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>I once had a charity campaigner stop me in the street, she was blonde about 5’5 and was stunningly beautiful collecting for an environmental charity, she asked how my day was, I said terrible I’d had a bad day, she then asked “What can I
 do to make you happy ?” now I won’t bore you with more of this story only say my answer wasn’t the perverted one you’d expect, however given the chance to go back in time I would say, in 3 weeks someone will try and release an indie game called Happy, make
 sure it’s never released. So stay clear of this game as your 80msp are better spent elsewhere, maybe on a charity avatar item as at least then you know what charity you’re giving too and you can guarantee the money will get there and not do a Father Ted.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> 2D Math Panic</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Learning, what’s this I smell is it an attempt to cross learning and education, why yes now give me my Kerosene and lighter fluid to burn this abomination lest is spread. Or at least that’s what I would normally say at this point, but
 in the case of this game it almost works, as I spent most of my GCSE revision time on my old steam powered Desktop playing GCSE revision games I thought if only a game like this existed for my Key stage sats or whatever they are now called this game almost
 makes itself worth having for the kids (if you do have kids and as I don’t it’s not worth it) it really helps improve the speed of your mental maths addition and subtraction aswell as claiming to also have multiplication on later on.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>This game + sats time or practice sats = this game wins. For everything else this game is unfortunately something that doesn’t quite add up or justify its worth to anyone but a select range, but then again as only a select range was the target
 this game does it well.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Aron’s journey in Dreamland</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> When I heard dreamland my interest was perked as my journey’s to dreamland seem to reflect the film Sucker Punch but with rather more adult content and boobs. Well Aron’s adventure seems to be a pretty basic plat former, with quite loose
 controls but jumps that fit this style, it plays well even if the tutorial does think you’re 8 and have never played a plat former before telling you the controls before you start then explaining them again in explicit detail, as well as advertising one of
 their other games and telling you how long the trial demo timer is (thanks for finally telling me that).</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>It plays well enough maybe even one of the better<b> </b>indie plat formers but for 240MSP Aron isn’t the only one in dreamland as I think the developers might be there too expecting that price.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Avatar Street Basketball 2</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> well it’s a trick shot basketball game, I don’t know what else I expected maybe I was hoping for cheesy basketball themed boss fights or something but alas this has nothing like that, it also lacks the feeling of fine power controls as
 it sometimes feels like the power is one above or below your last one randomly</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>Does what it does well really and with a nice style, justifies the 80msp price tag but not much more than that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Street Survival</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Welcome to street survival you play a stoned chav having to make his way home while tripping out of his mind and seeing the cars as monstrous demons blocking your path which you can shoot to get them out of the way, presumably causing
 a one man rampage through the town with a killing spree, you know I think I’ll stop that analogy there before I offend anyone else or get called unsympathetic about events etc etc, not that I am really sympathetic I just get fed up of messages telling me how
 and why I should care, I refused to care Jade Goody was dead even with my ex having a go at me for it. Now by my long rambling there you’ll probably realise this is one game I don’t want to write a review on, the main reason being there’s not a lot to review
 about this game, even the game itself tells you the game is just walking left to right dodging or shooting enemies and racking up points. Which would work if like a side scroller the screen moved at the same pace as you, but it doesn’t so you have to walk
 back then forward again constantly so the screen can catch up and you have a chance to kill the enemies who spawn just off screen before them can server you with a cheap death.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>not worth the 80msp asking price when you could go and play in traffic for free in reality (Please note playing in traffic is a very stupid thing to do, I in no way encourage this practice and if you do decide to do this you do so at your
 own risk though if you think it’s a good idea maybe for humanity it might be a good idea for you to do it)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Get to tha choppa twooo!!2</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A game that appears to be entirely composed of 4chan memes and probably has as much substance as most 4chan members (oooohhhh controversial) but on the bright side the game works it doesn’t really play dirty and unlike most avatar running
 games (this one doesn have avatars but still ) you don’t need to be a precog to know survive. That said the games trial did have one of the biggest two figure salutes, once you pass a certain score mark the game asks you to buy it, if you press no it kills
 you, that’s right it doesn’t let you in the chopper it doesn’t say no more playing and return to the menu it kills you then tries to say you messed up.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>Meh 80msp for a game with probably the entertainment value of extreme baby maker and an unlimited global high score leaderboard, some might like it its cheap and cherrful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Avalis Dungeon</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Now I’m a big fan of choose your own adventure games and boobs, well this game tries to combine the two, however unlike some more modern choose your own adventure games the turn back a page option is gone meaning lots of save and reloading
 continue points, then theres the boobs, or should that be lack of them, as most characters seem to have taken the sensible approach to armour except the witch, I want chainmail bikinis damn it.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>There’s two ways to sell a game for 240 MSP, make it good, or put plenty of near nudity in it, this game fails on both as there are better choose your own adventure games out there such as Epiphany in space and Trailer Park King and there’s
 better games with boobs out there like um trailer park king for example. This is another attempt to push an 80MSP game to sell for much more than it should</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Strategic combat</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I did at first think this was some kind of chess variant but now I’m not quite sure as it seems to work by its own hard to understand rules, to take a piece you must beat them in combat with each piece having different strength weapons
 meaning it’s not how good your strategy is but how well you play the top down shooter that matters, with soldiers with machine guns able to take out tanks and generals being given the noisy cricket from Men in Black and taking down everything. I would have
 rated this game highly if not for one game breaking problem. The Russian jets can’t fire. That’s right they drop area effect bombs which seem to randomly work meaning while the US jets can destroy the place with their two double machine guns the Russian jets
 are useless as you have to be point blank to use the bombs.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Its Broken and even when / if it’s fixed avoid it and buy dragon chess or something instead it will be more fun.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> President John America saves America</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Years ago I owned a game called power mad, a simple strategy game I got on disk from a car boot sale, this game is pretty much its spiritual successor. With amazing voice acting, a still funny over the top singing of the American National
 Anthem as the music for the title screen, funny over the top dialogue and characters and from what I saw a very good trading sim with only one minor problem and that was being unable to check prices and buy and sell at the same time (sounds much more of a
 problem that it really is as I think it gets fixed with a later unlock so might be deliberate). A running news feed in the game keeps you in touch with what the latest in demand items are both nationally and globally.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>This is the definition of a 240MSP game and the bench mark all others should be measured again for the 240MSP price tag, it’s perfectly priced and well worth every point of it. John America I salute thee and your fight against Ali barbar....Bin-laden....Hussain....Mcshalile
 and his suicide goats of terror.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> SEncounter</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well it’s an FPS game and from what I can gather those nasty *** are at it again with their secret experiments in Antarctica, as shooters go it has pretty much everything bar a regenerating shields, it brings back fond memories of the
 old 2.5D shooters of the past&nbsp; and is quite well done. The only think I can really fault are the sound effects which sound like the kind of think i could make at home with an iron bar and a comb.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>Probably the best FPS yet on the indie marketplace and despite this high accolade I have to wonder if it’s worth the price tag, I’d have to say yes but it mainly servers to show how complex and half decent looking FPS games can be made using
 the XNA system though this game is probably only a stepping stone not the true end result everyone is waiting for.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Call Me</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok being single can be tough..... wait I did this bit a few weeks back damn no filler tiem for a review. I like this game, there’s no denying it every other virtual dater game out there teaches you to be a total quantum singularity and
 to push Feminism back a good 50 years or so and not treat women as human beings, this one asks you to go in and answer as you then gives you a personality rating, the game also has lessons, not about how to pick up women but how to look at your and other girls
 personalities and find a match the fits you. This game builds confidence by telling you to be you and not telling you, “oh you’re a filthy little wretched slug how’s single life”, then spends the next 5 minutes calling you a virgin as an insult. The game even
 acknowledges its a bit of a stupid thing a dating sim by having answers like “what’s your favourite activity” include “Killing people”. Also credit for giving credit to the legendary Kevin Macleod the God of Royalty free music (Check out his totally awesome
 website for lots of music him and others have made and will let anyone use only asking that you give him credit for the music)</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>For 80MSP this game is good as it helps you figure out you and helps you date as you not as some Johnny Bravo esc character. I award this my title of Best Dating Sim ever on the indie marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Dead Pixels</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> As a big fan of one of the two grind house films and a fan of a certain film that spawned from that series I recognised the opening immediately and I’m still puzzled as to how someone managed to put those kind of effects and film ageing
 onto a video game and not be a professional company doing it. This game puts you in the role of a survivor (including co op play) with a variety of weapons at your disposal including shotguns, pistols , grenades I’ve ever heard of a flame thrower and a chainsaw
 about. You kill zombies and get money for ammo and health items, and can search / loot various abandoned buildings for ammo weapons and valuables to use.</p>
<p>It even has a trading element with various stores having various wanted weapons and items which pay top dollar, as well as the promise that at sales milestones the team will make and release free DLC.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>You’d have to be a brain dead zombie not to think this is worth the price, in fact I’d say this could have managed 240MSP and still sold as well. So snap this little wonder up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Pimp RPG</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A Phunky Phresh take on the RPG genre with an attempt at pushing indie game RPG graphics to the next level, even if it does seem to remind me of the FF7 graphics, the game plays fairly well with fights working except when the enemy defends
 constantly leaving you sitting there unable to attack with physical attacks, along the way in keeping with the style you get suitable items like a pimp cane knife, a shiv, pinstripe pants and with magic being similar with your ho allies having magic like throw
 da shoe and throw da pants even the quest system has for in progress “Jest doin it”</p>
<p>This truly is a great take on the RPG genre and does something to the best of my knowledge has never been done with the RPG genre</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>An original well made RPG game for 80MSP, I’d never have thought it possible. If FF7 defined RPG games in its time then A Pimp RPG redefines it for indie developers everywhere.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Angry Fish</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Angry Birds is a popular Iphone and Ipod app about saying the eggs stolen by a bunch of pigs by throwing the suicidal birds at the buildings there pigs are in. Hold on I own no item of Apple gear why am I........ Oh its Angry fish right
 I get it in the time honoured tradition of indie games this game rips off a more successful game to try and make a name for itself, and it doesn’t do a bad job at ripping it off, different fish with different powers, and equally stupid plot about cats going
 to the loo on the fish volley ball court so the fish climbing into a cannon to get revenge.</p>
<p><b>Verdict: </b>As rip offs go this isn’t bad for 80MSP, if you need more angry birds having finished angry brids and can’t wait for the Monty Python version (yes there’s one coming free to play) then this might well be the game to tide you over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Indie game of the week.</span></p>
<p>I decided to change it up this week and have the winner and to place the runners up 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup></p>
<p>Winner: Dead Pixels</p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>: A Pimp RPG</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup> President John America saves America</p>

<p>Did I buy anything: No my points are frozen till after Iron Brigade comes out but this week I i think i'm buying the top 3 and possibly Call me
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Indie game news</span></b></p>
<p>Yes a weird new section welcome to indie games news where I bring a few bits of news to you.</p>
<p>Firstly this week’s tops story: the fortress craft bans.</p>
<p>As yet there no word from MS or from the fortresscraft developer himself about the double downloads and possibility of this causing ban, indie developers have shown some concern over this possible issue but have vowed to continue to patch their games in
 the hopes the rumour of fortress craft leading to bans proves false, though there no word on how many will put the patches for peer review until this issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next story comes thanks to a tip off from Free Lance Games</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Blame Canada</span></b></p>
<p>Or more correctly blame MS as the New up and coming indie games list on the Canadian dashboard apparently has an error as MS has listed as a new up coming game their old favourite “I made a game with zombies” (I refuse to type it in the stupid txt spk way
 its officially written get over it). This has caused somewhat of a minor outrage amongst a few indie developers as clearly it’s not a new game and is potentially forcing other actual new games out.</p>
<p>MS are apparently working to fix this “mistake”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Indie games go mobile</span></b></p>
<p>Apparently in the pipeline or maybe already working are plans to put indie games on the windows 8 mobile phone thing, meaning you can now take some of your favourite indie games with you (assuming the developers submit their games again for the special W8
 indie games division and optimise it for the W8 phone specs)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Return to the trailer park</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Free Lance games recently tweeted that they are beginning work on another game and have hinted it may be the sequal to their top 10 best seller for over a month Trailer Park King, so here’s to more redneck humour and nearly bare breasts on the indie marketplace.
 Hurray. Hurray.</p>

<p>Just popped in to say I enjoy reading hobble's Indie thrads. Nice to read something decent on here every once in a while.<br />
<br />
In regards to Indie games, if they could find a way to attach maybe 50GS to each title, you'd probably see sales increase 50 fold.<br />
<br />
This is what gaming has become. There is no shame in this.</p>

<p>Just popped in to say I enjoy reading hobble's Indie thrads. Nice to read something decent on here every once in a while.<br />
<br />
In regards to Indie games, if they could find a way to attach maybe 50GS to each title, you'd probably see sales increase 50 fold.<br />
<br />
This is what gaming has become. There is no shame in this.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Glad you enjoy reading them :)</p>
<p><br />
you are right though even 50GS would increase the sales 50 fold. I do seem to remember one that had an unlockable gamerpic or something but nothing more than that. Though I have seen a few with Megaman 9 esc in built achievements, not worth gamerscore but they
 unlcok stuff in the game itself.</p>

<p>The thing is developers would just release games that give you 50G as you start. It will improve the sales, but not the game. It's a bit like the Avatar game with the easy 1000G If they did implement It, reviewers would have to make sure the achievements
 are fair</p>

<p>I have to agree with this, though there is apparently a peer review system for indie games the fact I've spotted some *** ups makes me wonder if the peer revew team is made up of the beta testers for left 4 dead 1 &amp; 2.</p>

            Go to Start and type control panel.
<br />From here search for backup and restore.
<br />Click the backup.
<br />Follow the wizard to run a backup of your files.
<br />I would recommend backup to an external USB drive if you think your machine is going to die.
<br />Then when you get a new PC you can just use this same utility to restore.
<br />

            I honestly don't recommend you use a DVD discs, they are prone to failure. At a minimum, borrow and external drive and use it to properly backup your files and do so manually.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />What you need to start this project?
<br />
<br />The first thing I recommend you do is invest in an external hard disk. I can't exhaust this enough; they are affordable and can store lots of data. You can probably get a 4TB drive for around $100.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, if you have a complex configuration, these instructions do not delve into the nuances of multiple partitions or drives with data scattered across them although the same rules can apply in regards to backup. If you do have folders for data such as documents, music, pictures and videos stored on other partitions or drives, then I would recommend you disconnect these data drives and upgrade only the system partition. You can always reattach your data drives after setup is complete.
<br />
<br />Turn on Show Hidden Files &amp; Folders
<br />
<br />You want your backup to be as thorough as possible. Within your User folder is a hidden directory called AppData. This folder stores important settings for the apps you use, such as custom directionaries for Microsoft Word, passwords for apps like Chrome, Outlook data files and mail folders for apps like Windows Mail.
<br />
<br />To turn on Hidden Files and folders, start by opening your user folder. Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Enabling Show hidden files and Folders
<br />
<br />Windows 8/8.1/10 - Click the View tab then click Options then click the View tab. Under Advanced settings &gt; Hidden files and folders select the radio box Show hidden files and folders.
<br />
<br />AppData folder is now visible.
<br />
<br />After completing the above steps, you should now see the AppData folder appear in your user folder.
<br />
<br />Next step is to simply select all the folder. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + A or
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10),
<br />
<br />Selected folders
<br />
<br />Open your External hard disk then create a new folder and call it backup or a unique name. Open it then press Ctrl + V or
<br />
<br />Click Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10),
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have multiple accounts
<br />
<br />If you have more than one account on your computer, log into each account and repeat the same steps. Make sure a unique folder is created for each account you backup manually.
<br />
<br />Remember other folders you might have
<br />
<br />If you store data in folders such as Public, remember to look in there too. The Public folder is located in C:\Users\Public
<br />
<br />NOTE: Some apps will keep their own data stores within their application folders, so make sure you browse and copy those over if necessary. Some users have a tendency to store files at the root of the hard disk, normally where the operating system is installed (Local Disk c:\). Also check there for any important files and move them to Documents folder.
<br />
<br />Restoration
<br />
<br />Once your backup is complete and you have your new computer setup  and is installed and running, the next step is to copy over your files and folders from the external hard disk. You can do this two ways, you can individually copy the contents of each folder into the respective folder on the new computer from the external drive. Here is what you can easily do.
<br />
<br />Connect and turn on your external hard disk.
<br />
<br />Browse the backup folder with your backed up folders.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + A or Click Home tab &gt; Select All (Windows 8/8.1/10)
<br />
<br />Open your User folder on the computer
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: %userprofile% then hit Enter on your keyboard.
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + V or Home tab &gt; Paste (Windows 8/8.1/10)
<br />
<br />You will be prompted if you want to replace the folders, click Yes.
<br />
<br />Depending on the amount of data, this can take a while.
<br />
<br />If you have other accounts, make sure the respective accounts have been created and logged into then repeat the same steps.
