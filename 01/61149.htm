<h2>            Thin Flashing White Line</h2>
                    Hi everyone, I have recently updated my computer. &nbsp;I dont know much about it computers other than they do what I need them to do. &nbsp;After the update i have this very thin white line at the top of my screen the flashes as it pleases with no rhyme or reason.
 &nbsp;It is usually in the top center but is occasionally in the upper left hand corner. &nbsp;My computer is the hp pavilion 15 and it had windows 8 when I got it but this summer I got windows 10. &nbsp;This mysterious white line is my only complaint. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            I am not dealing with an app. I have the AOL program loaded on my PC. Until the last update, it was working fine. Now the program won't even open. The only way it does if I restore the computer.....but I guess the update is installed over night....and
 then AOL does not open again.

            I have a similar problem - when I try to run AOL it&nbsp;keeps giving me an error message telling me to uninstall and reinstall the AOL software. I have done this several times but the problem keeps&nbsp;returning after a few hours. I have spoken to the AOL tech
 Support who say it is not a fault with&nbsp;AOL and that I have to pay a technician to come and look at it, to fix the problem with Windows 10. I think this all started when the Windows 10 update was loaded onto my computer. Surely Mircosoft should resolve this
 issue?

<p>Thanks for the reply, this problem has these duplicate files through out the computer, I am running Microsoft 10 Pro, ver 1803</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not all programs are affected, ex. if I go to C:\ and choose to view the files in "Acronis" a backup software program, I will see hundreds of duplicate files which have ex. "acronis_drive.config~A7H4T8DB"&nbsp; I will try to include a photo of what I see. Thanks
 for helping</p>

            Hi James, in general files with a tilde in the filename are temporary files and you are not meant to be seeing thme, they exist all over your PC and get cleaned up by Windows on a regular basis . . ..
<br />
<br />Do you have Hidden files and/or System files showing on your system?
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, turn off the option 'Hidden Files' if necessary
<br />
<br />Click the Options button on that ribbon
<br />
<br />On the resultign dialog, click the View Tab
<br />
<br />Scroll down and check the box marked 'Hide Protected System Files (recommended'
<br />
<br />Click apply and OK
<br />
<br />Can you still see those files with a tilde?

            These files are probably Acronis backup files, with "~a7h4t8db" referring to an entry in the Acronis file catalog. You should use Acronis tools to manage its backup files and/or retention period.

            They are definitely not Windows files. I still suspect that Acronis is behind them. Why not check an Acronis forum or send a note to the Acronis help desk?

<p>I have been trying to get Acronis to help for three or more months, they have settled into a pattern that asks me to do updates, and other feats that never lead anywhere except to have another tech ask the very exact sequence of questions and procedures,
 I have just told them not to bother wasting my time and only to contact if they can provide a solution, they undoubtedly know about the problem and have not been able to provide a solution,&nbsp; I am willing to try anything once but not this many times,&nbsp; I need
 a fresh approach to this problem, I have become discouraged and need someone's systematic approach to solving this duplicate, triplicate file problem.&nbsp; I have files on this computer from the 90's and really don't want to lose them, at least four computer data
 has been carried forward each time I updated the hardware and this is the first time a problem like this has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example, my next move is to completely remove Acronis products from my PC, I can always go to their site and re-install from there.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will wait for advice first.</p>

<p>I used to be a strong supporter of Acronis but lately I have moved over to Macrium Reflect (free version). It is an excellent product and it might meet your requirements.</p>
<p>

<li>Compile a list of all files whose name contains a tilde.</li><li>(optionally) delete some or all of these files.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Are you suggesting you could give me a script that can find and/or delete all the files on my PC that have a tilde in them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be leary of using such a script unless it came directly from Microsoft, but your suggestion on&nbsp;<span>Macrium Reflect is one I&nbsp; will try before removing Acronis from my PC.</span></p>

                    <p>This bugger keeps trying to&nbsp;install on my hard drive their executable and I just want to DELETE it, but I came to find out the hard way that there is no way I can do that from any of the traditional options I used to have in earlier versions of the Windows
 OS.</p>
<p>So I am just wondering if there is someone out there who has successfully tackled the REMOVAL of this bugger???</p>
<p>And if yes, how was it&nbsp;done step by step....Your help would be much appreciated......Thomas&nbsp;</p>

            <p>How about just a simple DELETE file from File Manager(yeah Microsoft...whatever happened to the simplicity of that???)&nbsp;or by drilling down to the right folder on the C:/ drive.....Those were the simple oldfashined ways....Now you can no longer do those things
 or at least it is not available in the same format....Not INTUITIVE at all...I dare say!!!</p>

I have no desire to repeat what you have already tried. If you tell me what you did then I'll tell you what else you could do. I bet that there are options that you have never heard of!

. . . because this is most likely a malware file that has removed the "Delete" option from its context menu.<br />
<ul>
<li>While in Windows Explorer, single-click the problem file, then press the Del key on your keyboard (you never mentioned this simple method).</li><li>Reboot into Safe Mode, then use Windows Explorer to delete&nbsp;C:\Users\Thomas Gyimesi\AppData\Local\Temp\Best Codec Pack803588.exe</li><li>Keep tapping F8 at boot time to boot into Repair Mode, then open a Command Prompt and type this command:<br />
del "Q:\Users\Thomas Gyimesi\AppData\Local\Temp\Best Codec Pack803588.exe"&nbsp;<br />

del "Q:\Users\Thomas Gyimesi\AppData\Local\Temp\Best Codec Pack803588.exe"</li></ul>
<div>You need to remember that the authors of malware use lots of tricks to prevent you from deleting their wares. You need to match or surpass their ingenuity.</div>

<h2>            Black screen in preview of Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7, Windows Movie Maker 12, I'm using a MP4 video file. In device manager, if I try to update my video drivers (Intel(R) HD graphics family and Radeon (TM) HD 6490M , it tells me that they are up to date.</p>
<p>I used MediaInfo and I clicked on the Web button to see that to update my codec, I had to install Quicktime, but the latest Quicktime was already installed.</p>
<p>So how can I fix that?</p>

            <p>Don't just rely on device manager to find you an updated driver.&nbsp; For the Intel HD graphics chip, go to the Intel website and find their driver update utility.&nbsp; For the Radeon HD 6490M, go to the AMD website and look for a similar update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run <strong>dxdiag </strong>and look at the <strong>Display </strong>tab for more details on the driver date and version.&nbsp; You'll probably see that driver date is more than a few months old and needs updating.</p>

            I am so new at this, I'm not even certain if I have the same issue. &nbsp;I created a file and as a project it's a wlmp file, but when I go to finalize it as a film, the conversion to MP4 takes an unusually long time and then the MP4 file comes up as a black
 screen, with perfect audio. &nbsp;Oddly enough, the file uploaded to YouTube--search "Isaac and Archibald" by Silvernotes or Andrew Silverman; it's 20 minutes long. &nbsp;The audio is perfect, and all you see is a black screen. &nbsp;This is ironic because YouTube no longer
 accepts uploads of audio only files. &nbsp;My desktop pc is windows 7 and probably out of date as I've had it a few years and bought it when it was a discontinued model. &nbsp;Thanks, Andrew Silverman

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here. I understand that you're also getting a black screen on your movie. Allow me to assist you with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">issue is usually caused by unsupported file types, outdated video drivers, or corrupted codecs. To troubleshoot this, we request you to follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Check that the files you are using are of a supported format - Some file formats are not supported by Movie Maker. You can read about the list of supported file types in this
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>article</strong></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files - Audio and video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Try running the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Microsoft FixIt</strong></a> tool for codecs.</li><li>Media info <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and
</span>whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at this
<a href="http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a>.</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: If you can't find the codec you need, you may convert the video to a supported format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Movie Maker project.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card
 with various software. To determine the version and video card driver date, kindly run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag):</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong><span>Start
</span></strong>button and type <strong><span>dxdiag
</span></strong>in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the <strong><span>Display
</span></strong>tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If your video card driver seems outdated, please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.</span></li></ol>
<p>Please get back to us for the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Marked as Cheater - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dominiczr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marked as Cheater</h2>
                    
<p>A little over a year ago my &nbsp;Live account was basically reset apparently due to cheating detected on my account. My gamerscore was reset and my gamer zone was set to "Cheater".</p>
<p>I have never directly cheated myself but I can admit that I have been around cheaters/hackers while playing which is probably how my account raised suspicion and eventually came to the state it is in now. After contacting Xbox support they told me that as
 long as I stay away from the cheating and anything else that would maintain the level of suspicion on my account my Gamer zone would change back to normal and my gamerscore would still stay reset. I was fine with that so I continued playing and have never
 been part of any cheating or even been around it for over a year now, but, my profile is still the same as it was the first day it was reset. You might be wondering why I have waited so long to bring up the issue but it is simply because after playing for
 a few months while being marked as "Cheater" my Xbox got the Red-Rings and I took a break from gaming for a bit but I have recently purchased a new Xbox 360 and like I said before, the problem is still there.</p>

<p>Here is some info from xbox.com on your issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Gamerscore resets</b></p>
<p>A gamerscore correction occurs on a player’s Xbox LIVE account when they gain achievements through avoiding gameplay and using external tools. Xbox LIVE is committed to keeping the service free of this type of behavior as it violates the Xbox LIVE Terms
 of Use. When abnormal achievement or gamerscore activity is found, Xbox LIVE modifies the gamerscore of players who meet specific and automated criteria.</p>
<p>An Xbox LIVE player who obtains their gamerscore in this abnormal way will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find their gamerscore reset to zero. </li><li>Be unable to regain all previously earned achievements. </li><li>Be labeled as a “cheater” for the community to view. </li></ul>
<p>Although players who are identified by these criteria will start from a zero gamerscore, they will still be able to gain achievements for future games. In other words, we give them another chance to earn future achievements by earning them as other “fair”
 players do. The original gamerscore correction remains permanent without any way to appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not worried about my gamerscore, I dont really care that it was reset. I am only really asking about my gamer zone.</p>
<p>After talking to multiple Xbox support agents on the phone they told me that as long as I stay away from cheating my gamer zone should change back to normal - which I have.</p>

<p>It WON'T go away. It's there for your account's lifetime, sadly. When other people view your profile from their console, it doesn't show you labeled as a cheater. It only shows that on Xbox.com and when you're viewing your own profile.</p>

                    Is there an easy way to convert music in my Windows Media Library&nbsp;on the 'WMA' format to 'MP3' &nbsp;format without having to re-rip all the CDs (to make the music&nbsp;easier to synch to an MP3 player?)&nbsp; If this is possible, will it automatically replace the old
 files with the newer versions? &nbsp;If not, is there any way to keep the new versions separate from the old versions&nbsp;to more easily to delete&nbsp;the unwanted versions?&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8 stuck in endless auto repair loop</h2>
                    When you switch on the PC it enters auto repair, the screen goes black, the repair fails and it re boots and starts the long cycle all over again. There are no menu options presented at any time and the PC will not boot up Windows 8 recovery or the installation
 disc. It reads the recovery media (USB or DVD) and then completely ignores it and goes through the cycle again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Where is the option to break out of the cycle and enter a command prompt or limited start up like on previous versions of Windows? How can Microsoft be so stupid?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone out there solved this problem as there are a large number of queries on the web, but no sensible replies.</div>

            <p>​Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to login to any other computer and create a Windows 8 installation disk. Using that disk you can perform the troubleshooting methods given below. You can create the installation disk form the steps given here.
<br />
<strong><br />
How to create installation media for a PC refresh or reset:</strong><br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072bc">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</font></a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also try to follow the same steps using bootable USB drive. You have to select USB as first boot device from BIOS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Booting to Recovery Environment with Windows 8 installation media</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is an alternate way to boot the PC and run recovery tools when something goes wrong with the Operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the steps given below. Insert the Windows 8 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.<br />
<br />
a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.<br />
b) Select the <strong>correct</strong> <strong>time</strong> and <strong>Keyboard</strong> type.
<br />
c) Click <strong>Repair</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>computer</strong> in the lower left corner.<br />
d) Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from <strong>Choose</strong> <strong>an</strong>
<strong>option</strong> <strong>screen</strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong> in <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>
<strong>screen</strong>.<br />
f) Click <strong>Automatic</strong> <strong>Repair</strong> from <strong>Advanced</strong>
<strong>Options</strong> <strong>screen</strong>.<br />
g) <strong>Next</strong>, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.<br />
h) Windows 8 will then look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Method 2: Perform System Restore from Advanced Options screen. <br />
</strong><br />
System Restore allows you to restore your computer to a previous state quickly and easily without losing any of your files or personal settings. Sometimes when you install programs or drivers, they may affect some of the system settings and prevent other programs
 from working correctly. You can use System Restore to revert these settings back to their previous state<br />
Follow the steps: <br />
<br />
<br />
a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.<br />
b) Select the <strong>correct</strong> <strong>time</strong> and <strong>Keyboard</strong> type.
<br />
c) Click <strong>Repair</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>computer</strong> in the lower left corner.<br />
d) Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from <strong>Choose</strong> an <strong>option</strong> screen.<br />
e) Click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong> in <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen.<br />
f) Select <strong>System</strong> <strong>Restore</strong>.<br />
<br />
After you perform System Restore your documents and files will always remain to their previous state.<br />
<br />
Write to us if you still face any issues. We will assist you further. <br />

h) Windows 8 will then look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Method 2: Perform System Restore from Advanced Options screen. <br />
</strong><br />
System Restore allows you to restore your computer to a previous state quickly and easily without losing any of your files or personal settings. Sometimes when you install programs or drivers, they may affect some of the system settings and prevent other programs
 from working correctly. You can use System Restore to revert these settings back to their previous state<br />
Follow the steps: <br />
<br />
<br />
a) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.<br />
b) Select the <strong>correct</strong> <strong>time</strong> and <strong>Keyboard</strong> type.
<br />
c) Click <strong>Repair</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>computer</strong> in the lower left corner.<br />
d) Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from <strong>Choose</strong> an <strong>option</strong> screen.<br />
e) Click <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong> in <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen.<br />
f) Select <strong>System</strong> <strong>Restore</strong>.<br />
<br />
After you perform System Restore your documents and files will always remain to their previous state.<br />
<br />

If only it was that easy. As I have said, I have both an installation disc/usb stick and a recovery disc, and they are all both read and ignored on booting up. The PC just reverts back to the continuous repair loop.
<div><br />
<div>Apparently there are 6 ways to get to the advanced options. 3 require a successful boot, the 2 above requires the PC to act on the boot discs/USB sticks it is presented with (not read and ignore) and the 6th requires the foresight of your PC manufacturer
 to provide a suitable BIOS. There is also a techy 7th which allows you to reinstate F8 to Windows 8, but that also requires a working PC, and the forsight and knowledge to do it before disaster strikes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What Microsoft has forgotten is that you need an escape route when the PC is not working. At least I can reinstate F8 when the PC is working, but that does not help me at all now.</div>

Sound like a problem with your BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. perhaps your (undisclosed) manufacturer provides a "fast boot" feature which thus disallows a switch of boot device?&nbsp;&nbsp; Then you may have to pull the CMOS battery and make it lose that feature (for example).&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise
 you&nbsp;should be able to boot from another device and see its UI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consult your user manual for less drastic methods of doing such a reset.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some manufacturers now provide a special power-on button to assist with this dilemma.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post your product number if you need help finding or &nbsp;interpreting your manual.</p>

            So am I to understand that if the 6/7 methods of getting to advanced options do not work there is as yet no solution for the Win 8 Auto Repair loop??
<div><br />
<div>Do I really have to go through all the hassle of sending my 1 day old laptop back because Microsoft have made a shoddy unstable os... again?!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edit:</div>
<div>I should add this is on an Asus K55VD-SX443H that came preloaded with Win 8.</div>
<div>Crashed while installing office 2010.</div>
<div>As no media was provided I have tried making a recovery disk on the only other Win 8 laptop I have access to, it said it was not the correct cd and wouldn't load from it.</div>
<div>I can get to the Bios but not to a command prompt.</div>

Are you having the same problem booting recovery media?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, if you only have 1 day invested in the machine why not use its built-in restore to factory settings option?&nbsp;&nbsp; According to an Asus KB article that would be done by pressing F9 while powering on.</p>

<div>The PC is an Acer Aspire X3200. I have tested the alternative boot media on other PC's and I can see them being read on the problem PC. For example, on boot to DVD/CD I get a screen message from the BIOS that states that the CD is being read, and I can
 see and hear it happening. In the case of the USB stick, one of the sticks I tried glows when it is being read, so I can see this happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I agree though that&nbsp;something (possibly the BIOS)&nbsp;is inhibiting the PC from acting on the alternative boot media. It is a strange BIOS though, which has 3&nbsp;possible&nbsp;settings for changing the boot sequence, and I have tried all of these. You can change the
 boot order in the usual way, you can also specify the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th boot device, and you can use F12 on boot to choose a boot device.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have not been able to find any information on this BIOS yet (Phoenix R01-B0) so any help would be&nbsp;appreciated.&nbsp;</div>

            I have just tried using a boot CD rather than a boot DVD and it worked, so perhaps my PC does not like booting from DVD's. Is there any way of getting something useful on a boot CD? Windows 8 recovery is small enough, but I cannot see how you get it on
 a CD. Is there anything else I can boot that would help me fix the PC (it was an AVG recovery disc I tried, but this does not appear to be very useful).

            I have now found that it is just Windows 8 boot discs that it does not like. In fact when I eject the Windows 8 recovery disc, it stops with an error that still does not enable me to break out of the loop.
<div><br />
<div>All I need is something none Windows 8 with disc utilities that I can boot.</div>

<div>The AVG recovery disc allows me to view files, but I do not know what to delete to stop the loop.</div>

                    <p>Windows Explorer says a file is open within a folder, so it will not let me change the folder name, but there is no file open.</p>
<p>I have shut down Word, Excel, etc and nothing is using the file.</p>
<p>It is really annoying as it does not say what file it thinks is open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes if I completely close Word (or whatever used the file last) it will then let me modify it in Explorer, but sometimes even that does not work.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear that you have not received your Beta code yet! Just to clarify, if you are referring to the codes that were sent out from Xbox Live Rewards,these codes should have been resent by email. If you still have not received your code, you will need to make a post in the&nbsp;<span>Xbox Live Rewards Forum</span>. If you did not originally receive your code from Xbox Live Rewards, you should be granted in-game access without receiving a code.

<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Looks like Cisco VPN is not supported for 64bit version of Vista<br />
<br />
Q. Does Cisco provide a VPN Client for Windows Vista?<br />
A. Cisco VPN Client Version 5 is available for 32-bit Windows Vista. There are no current plans to provide 64-bit support for the Cisco VPN Client but 64-bit support is available for the Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client. This client and release notes can be obtained
 from the ….<br />

<p>While I can't speak for the turnaround time of Xbox Support, you are correct that your account can be hacked, but not via Xbox LIVE itself.&nbsp; If your email password is weak someone can use a forcebot to crack it and then gain access to your account.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet, you'll also want to log into your email (if you can) and change the password.</p>

<p>Your account gets accessed by someone who has access to your info. This is the only way that an account gets access without permission by the owner. Regardless the outcome, the only way for your account to warrent an Unauthorized Investigation is either
 by unknowingly giving out your info or someone knows your email address then hacks into the account by trying to find the password (via hacking tools)</p>
<p>Hence why Xbox LIVE states not to give out your info to any one for any reason. Regardless.</p>

<p>That's not entirely fair.&nbsp; The individual who "hacks"/ deduces your login info is at fault. Though it is curious that the OP seems to know his "hacker," and what he intended to do with the account.

    <title>GWX folder does not exist - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerrywm  say:</h3>
<h2>            GWX folder does not exist</h2>
                    <p>I have successfully upgraded several computers to Windows 10 over the last week.&nbsp; I have one more computer to go.&nbsp; It's running Windows 7 ultimate (SP1, with all the latest updates).&nbsp; There is no 'update' icon in the tool bar.&nbsp; I've researched fixes for
 the problem.&nbsp; Every recommended fix involves going to the c:\windows\system32\gwx folder and running gwx.exe.&nbsp; Problem is, I do not have a gwx folder at all... Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a technical background, and I know how to go 'under the hood' as necessary to patch this up and getting it going.&nbsp; I just need to know where to find gwx.exe if it's possible to forcibly download it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, is there a way to simply bypass the whole gwx 'auto-upgrade' process and download Windows 10 directly and upgrade?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is that if Windows totally skipped installing gwx on this machine, there must be a reason.&nbsp; If this is a symptom of a larger problem on this machine, I'd like to get to the bottom of it.&nbsp; Again... legally licensed copy of 7 ultimate with no warnings
 about 'not genuine' or anything. And the only updates&nbsp; that Windows Update says are available are language packs, which I do not need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>Parth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter.&nbsp; Now I'm really confused.&nbsp;&nbsp; The troubleshooter says <strong>
"Unsupported version.&nbsp; The Get Windows 10 App is not available for this version of Windows."&nbsp;</strong> The web page lists Enterprise edition, Windows RT, and Windows 8.1 RT as not supported.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; That is not an 'enterprise' edition,
 is it?&nbsp;&nbsp; So all of the cheaper versions of Win7 get a free upgrade.&nbsp; But when I buy the most expensive top end Windows 7, I have to pay for Windows 10?&nbsp; Really??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I verified on system properties one more time.&nbsp; It says Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; Is it true that Windows 7 Ultimate is not eligible?</p>

            <p>I dug deeper into the trobleshooter report.&nbsp; It says I have Windows Version 6.1 (??)</p>
<p>

            <p>More googling and I discovered that in Microsoft's infinite wisdom, Windows 7 is listed internally as 6.1&nbsp; That makes a lot of sense....&nbsp; (??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is apparently not that I have ver 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp; But it still says right above the 6.1 version that Windows is not up to date.&nbsp; However, Windows Update clearly has a difference of opinion on that as you can see in the above screen cap.&nbsp; I guess the
 problem now is trying to get Windows Update and the troubleshooter to agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that in the past year or so I've had a few updates that came up as 'failed to install'.&nbsp; But after a reboot and subsequent updates, those failures apparently were resolved.&nbsp; If it turns out that an update did indeed permanently fail, and subsequent
 updates decided to ignore that fact, I'm in a huge mess since windows 10 is apparently now upset about some update that never happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I resolve this?</p>

            <p>I'm guessing by the lack of activity and 'me too' clicks on this thread that my situation with this computer is a rare and unique situation.&nbsp; Anytime I already know things are not working as designed as in this case for trying to upgrade, I'm not a big fan
 of trying to do an end-run around the problem since it has the potential of making things much worse.&nbsp; But I had to get this computer migrated some way.&nbsp; So I took the risk and ignored the 'not eligible' error and did the 'create media disk' option.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started
 first to just tell it to write to a USB.&nbsp; But then I decided to click the 'upgrade this computer' and see what happened. I guess 'format drive c and reinstall" is always still an option... :-(.&nbsp;&nbsp; The upgrade process started.&nbsp; The screen hung for a very long
 time on the 'determining compatibility for upgrade' or whatever the text was.&nbsp; Finally it passed that, and I started the full upgrade.&nbsp; It got to 45% and totally hung for several hours.&nbsp; There was a cancel option.&nbsp; But I figured the system would be dead at
 that point.&nbsp; Fortunately, after canceling, it did recover back to the Win7 desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For lack of any other viable options, I tried the upgrade process again, and left it for the night.&nbsp; When I checked this morning, the upgrade to 10 had completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, summary.... There is still no explanation for why it would not upgrade per the correct Win10 GWX process.&nbsp; Against my better judgement, I ignored the error and did the 'media disk' route.&nbsp; After a total hang and cancel, then retry, I finally got Windows
 10.&nbsp; I'm hoping I didn't bury a continuing problem that is going to bite me big time down the road.&nbsp; But for now, it's done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wishing my best to others that encounter this problem.&nbsp; Maybe you can get a real answer from Microsoft and what the real problem was.</p>

            Hi GioRgSaVv 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is a new feature introduced by Chrome which can be disabled easily, if you don't like it.
<br />
<br />Copy the below line and paste into address bar of Chrome
<br />chrome://flags
<br />In Search box at top, type Hardware and Enter
<br />Set Hardware Media Key Handling to Disabled
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi GioRgSaVv 
<br />
<br />Open Chrome
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chrome://flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />That will remove that for you . . .

<h2>            Sound only recording through one channel.</h2>
                    Until recently my audio was working fine but now its only recording the mic through the left channel. I've tried different microphones and both the front and the back inputs but it doesn't help. I know it's a problem with either windows or my drivers because
 when i use the same mics through steam chat or skype they play back fine and record both channels. None of the mics I've used are mono mics and i haven't set them to only record one channel. I've reinstalled my drivers but it doesn't help. I use realtek sound
 manager and use built in sound drivers from my xfx 7850 (amd hd drivers) and realtek. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Thanks for your help. I ended up just uninstalling &nbsp;realtek drivers and used amd and default windows ones and that seemed to work. It's a shame because the realtek sound manager was far better than windows default but it fixed the issue.&nbsp;

</p><p>1. Is there any apps I cannot block except for Microsoft Edge?</p>
<p>2. Can I block installing the 3rd party apps by using family safety?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>From what I've heard there are plenty of flashbacks through out the game to give you
<em><strong>key</strong> </em>information about the storyline. Now admittedly the entire saga's storyline is very complicated and gets a little confusing even when you've played through all 11 games. I would recommend you YouTube a story summary of the series
 if you are interested in playing the game and knowing fully the background plot. It is a really fun and engaging game. Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi, I'm currently playing through Kingdom Hearts 3 (maybe about halfway through right now) without having played all the previous entries.&nbsp; I agree 100% with the previous post, and would also add this- even having watched a few of the YouTube story summary
 videos, it's still confusing at times.&nbsp; That said, I do love Disney/Pixar, and each individual Disney/Pixar world I've visited so far essentially has its own little story that has been enjoyable and easy to follow, even if it is only slightly related to the
 greater narrative.&nbsp; Plus, the gameplay itself is quite fun.&nbsp; If you're a fan of Disney/Pixar movies, I would definitely recommend the game even without having played previous Kingdom Hearts games.&nbsp; If not, there's still great gameplay to enjoy, but the overall
 experience might not be quite as exciting.

            Mientras juegas el 3 hay unas mmeorias en ciertos puntos del juego que te dicen que fue lo que paso anteriormente pero mi recomendacion es que de alguna manera puedas jugar las versiones anteriores para que tengas un mejor entendimiento de todo...

    <title>Missing Graphics Drivers &#40;ATI Radeon&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing Graphics Drivers &#40;ATI Radeon&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok first off, i don't know what specific details you're looking for about my laptop (MSI) but I'd like to state my situation first and then answer any details that you require. &nbsp;While I was updating my graphics card, some things happened (I'm not sure what,
 because it happened a year ago) and windows can't detect the card. &nbsp;I checked the device manager and instead of displaying the graphics card, it displays "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" with a yellow triangle on the icon. &nbsp;I don't know what "type/model"
 of ATI Radeon I have because the sticker that's usually on the laptop that states what graphics card is installed, has been removed. &nbsp;I'll be glad to reply to any request for further details that you may need.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: right">Thank you for answering and taking the time to help me in advance.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">-Moe</p>
