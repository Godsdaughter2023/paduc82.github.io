            <p>Disabling a device is something only a service or app running in usermode can do. Disable operation requires an external agent. The OS doesn't ever disable the device on its own. OS can only fail the device if it's doesn't work. A failed device will have
 yellow ! in the device manager. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that you might have a rogue service that disables your keyboard. Look for 3rd party services running in the background and disable them.</p>

<h2>            Help please. Power outage during windows update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a power failure during windows update this week and have since been unable to run my laptop properly. I visited several forums and tried a few things and ended up doing a system restore. It said that it had worked but now my laptop starts up, but as
 soon as i try and do anything it just freezes and the cursor timer stays on the screen and nothing ever happens. I am now running it in safe mode so unable to try and perform the update again as it doesnt run in safe mode. Had a few error messages saying that
 the locale.dll file is missing when i tried to start up internet and in device manager it shows a yellow warning triangle next to Consumer IR device, microsoft ISATAP adapter #15 and microsoft ISATAP #4 (not sure if this is normal when running in safe mode)?
 Can someone please advise what to do or try next as I have been searching and try now for hours and losing the will to live!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in adavance</p>

<p>Do a Startup Repair&nbsp;using a Microsoft Vista DVD</p>
<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/</font></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to it:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"On a Windows Vista-based computer or on a Windows Server 2008-based computer, the Microsoft ISATAP adapter appears with a yellow exclamation mark next to it in Device Manager, and you also receive an error message"&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can safely ignore this error message. This error message does not indicate a problem with the adapter. The adapter will continue to work correctly.

    <title>HP Laptop Hard Drive Crashed. HP no longer makes recovery Disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffsbaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Laptop Hard Drive Crashed. HP no longer makes recovery Disk</h2>
                    <p>I have been helping fix computer problems for 20 years and this is the first time I have come across this problem. &nbsp;A customer has a bad hard drive on an HP dv7-3078nr Laptop. &nbsp;It is 6 years old. &nbsp;The HP laptop came with Windows 7 but of course HP did not
 include a Recovery Disc. &nbsp;Also the customer never made a Recovery Disc (I have never had a customer that did make a Recovery Disc). &nbsp;In the past I could always find a link on the "Software and Drivers" page for Ordering a Recovery Disc. &nbsp;This time the link
 was not there. &nbsp;Here is the Software and Drivers page for this model:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Pavilion-dv7-Entertainment-Notebook-PC-series/4011368/model/4057215/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/product/HP-Pavilion-dv7-Entertainment-Notebook-PC-series/4011368/model/4057215/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I called the HP Store and after going through all the prompts I finally asked for a Recovery Disc. &nbsp;The representative at HP told me that because the laptop is 6 years old they no longer make a Recovery Disc for it. &nbsp;I asked him what I am supposed to
 do since the hard drive is crashed. &nbsp;He said that I would have to buy a Retail version of Windows 7. &nbsp;I told him that it is very expensive and he said that the customer would have to pay for it and that the customer was supposed to have made a Recovery Disc
 when they unit was working. &nbsp;He said that HP no longer provides Recovery Discs after a computer is more than 4 years old!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, so after doing research I find out that I can't even download a Windows 7 ISO from Microsoft because they no longer provide one. &nbsp;They will only provide one at this link, &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recovery</a>&nbsp;if
 you have a RETAIL product key. &nbsp;But I only have the Product key from the bottom of the laptop which is an OEM product key from HP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there anyway I can get a version of Windows 7 for this laptop without forcing the customer to purchase a Retail version of Windows 7?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer ZigZag, but I did Google that of course and all the pages link to Microsoft's old way of being able to download it from Digital River which is no longer available.</p>

</p><p>However, the link points to options that are not available in this instance. &nbsp;The link basically has these options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Create Recovery Disc using Windows</p>
<p>(The hard drive is crashed and windows is not running, therefore does not work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Initiate reinstallation of Windows 7 using manufacturers Recovery Partition</p>
<p>(The hard drive is crashed, therefore does not work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;Contacting OEM for recovery media:</p>
<p>(As I stated HP said they no longer provide the Recovery media after a system is four years old.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Using Microsoft Software Recovery Page to download retail reinstall media</p>
<p>(Does not work with the product key from the HP laptop because it is OEM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Borrow the corresponding from a friend or family member</p>
<p>(I do not have this available to me. &nbsp;If I did then I would not be reaching out to the online community for help)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both Microsoft and HP should be ashamed for doing this to their customers.</p>

<p>Exactly the answer I received from HP and Microsoft support! Costs at least $99 from a reputable source. &nbsp;It is ridiculous that a customer has to pay for something they already paid for. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Chances are reasonably good that you can re-install using another Windows 7 Install disk.&nbsp; It does not necessarily have to be one from the OEM.&nbsp; Make certain the version matches the version of the activation code on the bottom of the PC.&nbsp; I have done this
 before with good results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could result in the need to download a bunch of drivers from HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do NOT put the activation code in during the install process.&nbsp; Once Windows is installed, check to see if you even need to enter one.&nbsp; Sometimes the code is stored in firmware and it will not even ask for one.&nbsp; If all else fails, call Microsoft for assistance
 and if that does not work, call HP.&nbsp; They should be able to give you a one-time activation code.</p>

            depends on how crashed the HDD is: <br />
HP have the recovery partition at the end of the disk not the beginning like some Mfg.
<br />
<br />
if the beginning of the HDD is crashed but the end of the disk is untouched <br />
you may be able to clone it with only the recovery partition, (see image below)<br />
<br />
the first thing to do is attach it to another system Via USB and see if the recovery partition is visible in disk management<br />
if the disk spins and you can see the recovery partition right click the other partitions and delete them,
<br />
note: - if the HDD is trashed beyond use, TigerDirect is still selling win 7 OEM System Builder media, which will work with the attached COA (If it's still readable)<br />
<br />
next step is to use an HDD of the exact same size as the original<br />
install that disk into the system and attach the failed disk to the&nbsp; system via USB<br />
<br />
use CloneZilla to clone disk to disk which will clone the recovery partition to the new disk,
<br />
<br />
next step is reboot the system and start the recovery process. <br />
as soon as it's done make the recovery media, <br />
once the recovery media is created test it to see if it works. <br />
<br />
below is an image of an HP OEM HDD that the beginning of the disk is crashed<br />
but the recovery partition is still in functioning order, <br />
this system shipped with vista,<br />
&nbsp; I cloned the HDD as is with no other partitions and the recovery function works on the new HDD.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9c3d49c-41cf-496f-ad9a-91d404a932dd" /><br />

<h2>            marvell avast 350N wireless-device cannot start.</h2>
                    So I have been having issues the last couple of weeks with my internet connection switching to limited and needing to reboot to have my connection back. Today the same thing happened but now it won't come back after restarting. In fact the network troubleshooting
 says that the the Marvell AVASTAR 350N wireless network contoller cannot start. &nbsp;I have seen that there have been issues with this network adapter but I cannot find anything specific to my issue. &nbsp;Please help, I need my internet for School!

            <p>Here is one option to help solve your limited connectivity issues. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, Check for your Windows updates to ensure you have brought in your firmware updates towards connectivity with your device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>open charms bar on the right, choose <strong>search</strong>. </p>
<p>In the <strong>search</strong> menu, type in <strong>update</strong> and tap on
<strong>settings underneath apps.</strong></p>
<p>on the left, find and choose <strong>check for updates</strong> and follow the update prompt when it completes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your updates are complete, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the network adapter drivers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>open search from the charms bar on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>type in the phrase device manager and tap on settings underneath apps on the right side.</p>
<p>choose device manager in the list. </p>
<p>Once the device manager is open, open network adapters in the list. </p>
<p>right click on marvell avastar adapter. </p>
<p>choose drivers tab and press uninstall. *note* uncheck the box when it asks to delete the files. DO NOT delete the files.
</p>
<p>Now that it is uninstalled, you will need to restart the device to have the drivers automatically reinstall.
</p>
<p>sign into your device and reconnect with your network</p>

<h2>            Problems with Xbox One S</h2>
                    <p>I was doing a heist&nbsp;on gta v earlier and my xbox just froze out of no where. i tried to go home and quit the game but that wouldnt work so i just turned it off. i tried to turn it back on but it wouldnt connect to hdmi and made popping noises like it was frying??? then i finally got it to turn on and the troubleshoot # came up&nbsp;</p><p>(E105 00000000 80070003)&nbsp;whenever i tried to factory reset or restart it would freeze. finally, it actually reset and there was a loading screen with “preparing xbox...” it loaded to 50% fairly quickly and then it just stops and continues making noises. i havent been playing for long periods of time, gotten the xbox wet, or dropped it. i bought it less than 2 weeks ago from Costco... im pretty sure i have a warranty but when i go to microsofts xbox warranty check the eligibility never loads. should i take it in or am i missing something and this is an easy fix?&nbsp;any comments are greatly&nbsp;appreciated. xxx</p>

Find the following HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Explorer\User Shell Folders

<p>
</p><p>In this configuration I have Windows 10 build 10586 running without a problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>This VM now wants to upgrade to build 16299.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that their are different requirements for the new build in terms of networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have assigned the undefined networking to private as suggested on the support forums, but still get a black screen after the upgrade with a revert to build 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On trying to create a new VM with the downloaded ISO it also fails.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Fatal Error trying to install Windows 7 service pack 1&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I tried to install a long list of about 11 Windows 7 Updates which included Windows 7 Service Pack 1 but it crashed my laptop saying there was a fatal error in application 355 of 'a large number' that I cant remember.&nbsp; The only way out was to do system restore
 (this took ages to find out as my laptop just kept freezing but eventually after switching it on several times it offered me this&nbsp;option) &nbsp;to before the updates were installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am now nervous to run any&nbsp; further updates (apparently there are now 16 available!! ) can anyone advise me, what went wrong and what I should do?</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>

            Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?<br />
<br />
If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.<br />
<br />
Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.<br />
<br />
* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle<br />
<br />
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Type CD\ and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Other solutions:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.<br />
<br />
2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.<br />
http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/<br />
<br />
3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in your
 off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.<br />
<br />
4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you have
 a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.<br />
<br />
5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced the
 issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which is based
 on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.<br />
<br />
6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Accept User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.<br />
<br />
7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Start<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.<br />

-------<br />

Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.<br />
<br />
Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.<br />
<br />
Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.<br />
<br />
As for those 16 updates, my recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such 5 at a time, exclude hardware/driver updates. Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time. Also, try installing the small
 updates first. Avoid installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates.<br />
<br />
Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience). Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).<br />
<br />
Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Proceed with installing the additional updates.<br />

<h2>            Refurbished Desktop with Windows 10 - Wireless Internet Solution&#63;</h2>
                    I recently purchased a refurbished Dell desktop computer for my home.&nbsp; We figured it was time for an upgrade after our old system (6+ years, VISTA operating system). With our old desktop we had a NETGEAR Wireless USB adapter to connect to the internet.&nbsp;
 I connected it to the new unit, but no internet connection. Troubleshooting message stated that I needed to connect an Ethernet cable. At first I thought that it didn't recognize the adapter, but finally located it.&nbsp; However, it apparently is so old (NETGEAR
 doesn't make them anymore, nor do they have any updated drivers), that it's incompatible with the system. So, I figure I need a new one.&nbsp; The issue is I'm scared to go out and buy one because just about EVERY site I've visited regarding the topic states that&nbsp;the
 companies have NO devices that are currently compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp; It's been several months since Windows 10 came out and there's nothing as far as I can tell.&nbsp; I'm kind of at a loss

 isn't possible for me right now because I can't connect to the internet.&nbsp; It just looks like either way I go, it looks like I'm taking a chance.</p>

    <title>Cannot Access Encrypted Files After Successfully Importing Encrypting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve_1208  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Access Encrypted Files After Successfully Importing Encrypting File System &#40;EFS&#41; Certificate</h2>
                    <p>I encrypted a folder and its contents on my Windows 10 system. &nbsp;I then successfully backed-up (export) my EFS certificate to a thumb drive and successfully imported the EFS certificate to a Windows 7 system. &nbsp;I confirmed the EFS certificate did in fact install
 on the Windows 7 system and is located in my Personal | Certificates folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I attempt to test the certificate by coping several of the encrypted files from my Windows 10 system to a USB drive and then attempting to open the files on my Windows 7 system, the file will not open. &nbsp;Windows as added a .PFILE file extension
 to each of the documents. &nbsp;It's my understanding the .PFILE indicates a protected file; which would be correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can open the files on the USB drive without any issues on my Windows 10 system. &nbsp;So, I'm confused why I can't open them on my Windows 7 system since I received successful confirmations on my both the export and import of the EFS certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Eeshwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the information you requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) I receive a message that Windows cannot open the file. &nbsp;The file name appears (e.g., TestDocument.docx.PFILE). &nbsp;Because the .PFILE is added, it's wants to know what program I want to use to open .PFILE files. &nbsp;I have two options (1) search the internet
 (2) select an installed program. &nbsp;As an example the file name TestDocument.docx appears as TestDocument.docs.PFILE on both Windows 7 systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) &nbsp;It occurs on all files. &nbsp;I tested Adobe Acrobat Document (.pdf), Text (txt), MS Excel (xlsx), MS Word (docx), MS PowerPoint (pptx), and Photo (jpg) files. &nbsp;In each case, when I open File Explore on the Windows 7 systems, I see the file name, file extension
 and .PFILE (e.g., TestDocument.pdf.PFILE). &nbsp;If I move the files back to the Windows 10 system, I see the file name and file extension (e.g., TestDocument.pdf); they open without an issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) &nbsp;Windows 7 Professional (32-bit). &nbsp;One has SP1, the other SP2. &nbsp;The Windows 10 systems in a 64-bit OS. I wonder if that could make a difference. &nbsp;I don't have any issues using the same files on any of the three systems as long as they are are not encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: &nbsp;I added a new user to my Windows 10 system and tried to open the EFS files. &nbsp;I received an error message: &nbsp;"There was an error opening this document: Access Denied". &nbsp;That's what I expected, I then imported the EFS certificate to the new user's profile
 and opened the files without any issues. &nbsp;This is exactly what I'm trying to do on my Windows 7 systems, but I can't the process to work on the EFS files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused by a corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting an error message when turning the Sync settings on?</li><li>Is the Sync settings button grayed out?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, we suggest disabling your antivirus software and see if you'll be able to sync your settings.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>have to</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the issue can be caused by a corrupted user profile, </span><span>you can also try creating a new user account and see if the issue will persist. Click on this

            <p><span>Hi Andrew,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you want to change your language settings. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before troubleshooting please answer the question: </span></p>
<p><span>Is your Operating system a single language pack OS? If it is a single language pack, we are sorry but you cannot change the language in the OS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly follow the steps below to change the regional language settings.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Start</strong> &gt;<strong> Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Time &amp; Language
</strong>&gt; <strong>Region and Language</strong>.</span></li><li><span>To change PC’s language option follow the steps</span>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the <strong>language</strong> and then click on<strong> Options</strong>. If your language is not available, go to<strong> language options
</strong>and click on <strong>Download</strong> (to download the language pack) once the pack is downloaded go back to the
<strong>Region &amp; language</strong>, select the <strong>Language</strong> and Click on
<strong>Set as primary</strong>.</span></li><li><span>You will get a notification, “</span><strong><span>Will be display language after next sign-in</span></strong><span>.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Sign out </strong>of Windows and sign back in, your new language will be set.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>To add a keyboard, click on <strong><span>Add a language</span></strong> and choose the keyboard language you want to add. To switch between keyboards, you can click the taskbar button and select the keyboard you want to use. You can use the keyboard
 shortcut <strong><span>Windows Key + Space </span></strong>to toggle between added keyboards.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You can also refer to the suggestion by “<strong>Rajith Rajeev</strong>” from the following link and check.</span></p>

                    Is there a fix for Microsoft Edge changing proxy settings on when they are set to off? I cannot even use other browsers. This can happen at any time, whether I am booting up Windows or on the internet using Firefox browser.

</p><p>When I started Windows 10 I could not connect to the internet and had to change proxy settings via Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the only user of this laptop and my account is set as Administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Firefox browser. Sometimes it will drop connection while using Firefox and I will have to open Edge to change the Proxy and VPN settings back to off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also sometimes drops my internet connection when starting/restarting Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now scanning for viruses per your suggestion and will let you know results</p>

Hi</p>
<p>It should work, even when run from the C: drive?</p>
<p>What happens when you type&nbsp; help.exe /?&nbsp; or&nbsp; Tree.com /?.</p>
<p>You might also want to try the commands from an elevated command prompt.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 install issue</h2>
                    Hello, so after doing a Windows 10 installation on a newly built pc it got to the end of the install and restarted.&nbsp; During the initial boot however it continues to say that "The computer restarted or encountered an unexpected error.&nbsp; Windows install cannot
 proceed. To install click Ok to restart the computer, and then restart the installation".&nbsp; The issue is that, after restarting it brings me right back to the message and I have no idea what to do.&nbsp; Not super tech savy but any help would be appreciated.

<p>Thanks for the detailed response, I ended up resolving the issue with a quick registry edit I found on Google.&nbsp; Apparently it's a semi common issue
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see “The computer restarted unexpectedly” error message press Shift + F10 on your keyboard. This should open Command Prompt.<br />
Enter regedit and press Enter to start Registry Editor.<br />
Once Registry Editor starts, navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\Status\ChildCompletion and double click the setup.exe in the right pane.<br />
Change the Value Data from 1 to 3 and click OK to save changes.<br />
Close Registry Editor and restart your computer.</p>

 and my friends list is completely gone. I know this because I do get online but only for a couple of minutes. I cannot start a party as it says I need to change the online settings, but they are all ok. I want to play GOW3 but it wont let me because of my
 online party settings.</p>
<p>IIs this all part of the process to sort out the fraud?</p>

<p>Here's what you need to do. First, call them and cancel the Live account. (You have to do this otherwise the next step won't work)</p>
<p>Now, as long as your account is secure you should be able to log in online and remove all forms of payment. This will get rid of that message and allow for you to communicate with friends, play games offline, ect.</p>
<p>Your friends list should show up shortly, I can't remember how long it took for mine to show up again but it was within the first few days. I'm able to send/receive messages, play offline. The only thing I can't do is play games over Live.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Keep in mind any achievements you get while playing offline won't transfer over once you go Live again. Just fair warning.</p>

<p>which is why i said "as long as your account is secure"....and how does the person who stole the account get off scot free? I'm not really seeing the connection there Slake</p>
<p>It's not verified about the achievements. it's what others have said in regards to being able to play offline.

 presents problems when I want to charge a device from one of the ports in that I have to keep the computer turned on. Does anyone know if this is a normal state or if it might be a fault? The ports are working normally in every way when the computer is on.</span>

 even my photos are on an sd card and I have no games or apps. I cant free up enough memory to update.The computer is only one year old Lenovo ideapad.&nbsp;

            Hi warrantychap1 
<br />
<br />Does your IdeaPad have a 32GB (29.1GB usable) SSD storage device or do you have more storage than that?
<br />
<br />If so, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p><span>Thanks for your reply and you are correct in that it is a 32GB SSD and I have only just over 3GB of space available. The computer seems to be a waste of time with such a miserable amount of memory available.</span></p>
<p><span>I will try your recommendation in a few days as I have spent almost all of today not to mention several earlier attempts trying different ways to get the computer updated.
</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t understand though why it wont recognise the 32GB memory stick as a usable storage space.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway thanks for your advice and I will have a go presently. </span>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows and all of its files can only be installed and run from the primary storage device, it can't run from both internal and external storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your device is a Lenovo with 32GB that's really bad from a company as big as them.&nbsp; Of course, HP have been doing this with their cheap HP Stream laptops as well.</p>
