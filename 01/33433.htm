    <title>Message From Edge When I Open Firefox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crepidula_fornicata  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message From Edge When I Open Firefox</h2>
                    <p>When I open Firefox on my Windows 10 PC, I get an obnoxious pop-up telling me that Edge is faster and advising me to switch. I do NOT like being marketed to and resent anyone tracking what browser I use. How do I get rid of this sort of pop-up from Microsoft?
 I've also gotten one nagging me to use Cortana. &nbsp;I use ad blockers for general browsing, but obviously Microsoft slides around them, I imagine by masking these pop-ups as "help" messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any insight. &nbsp;This might seem like a small problem, but it<em> is</em> aggravating.</p>

            Hi, thank you for the reply. &nbsp;Yes, pop-ups are blocked on Firefox. What's weird is that the pop-up occurs before Firefox even comes up. &nbsp;All I have to do is click on the Firefox icon and I get the pop-up. &nbsp;It's like Microsoft is waiting for me to click
 the icon to shame me into using Edge, LOL. &nbsp;I wish they'd give up!! &nbsp;:)

</p><p>Greg, The trials for the Malware and Adware have ended.&nbsp; I have not yet purchased, which is probably dumb.&nbsp; I am so fed up with the misrepresentations HP gave me with this computer.&nbsp; I am getting another one and giving this one to a friend who does not do
 much online.&nbsp; I was wondering if you could possibly answer some questions for me please.&nbsp; If I buy the protection, it will just be for this computer, right?&nbsp; Also, do I have to buy protection for each computer?&nbsp; If I get it for this computer, will it remain
 for this computer when I give it to my friend and she has different email info, etc?&nbsp; I guess the right question would be if it transfers to a new owner.&nbsp; I hope you don't mind me asking you about this.&nbsp; I have so little headache-free time and am often in
 a 'leftover' state when the pain eases.&nbsp; You make understanding things so much easier than trying to read website and glean the information needed.&nbsp; Thank you for your help and not making me feel dumb.&nbsp; Ann&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I have 'freezes' that are followed by prompts
 to 'stop script' and/or 'stop plugin.'&nbsp; I think they are related to Flashplayer crashes.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do to prevent these?&nbsp; I can't remember if they were happening before the trials expired.&nbsp; Thank you again.</p>

<p>Hi, Ann.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean by protection is anti-virus, I can answer those question for you:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>It depends on what kind of anti-virus package your are going to buy. There are anti-virus packages that is being offered in the market that can be installed to multiple PC and there are some that is good for one computer only.</li><li>Yes, you are correct! once the anti-virus is installed to a computer the license product of the anti-virus will be encrypted to the computer and it's not transferable to other PC.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding <strong>stop script</strong> and <strong>stop plugin</strong> that you are getting, it usually happens if a certain program experience a delay
</p>
<p>on receiving data or the program itself is not responding, we can prevent this issue by making sure that the particular program where you getting those popups are updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other queries.</p>

<p>Those are intended to be free on-demand scanners and I always give instructions to decline the free trial on Malwarebytes during install. To turn it off now see

<p>
</p><p><strong>There is no reason to buy the Malwarebytes Real Time protection unless you are getting infected regularly with only built-in Defender standing guard, since it is perfectly adequate.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As to AdwCleaner I've never heard of it charging or having any other than the free version.&nbsp; But it's been bought by Malwarebytes so it may soon have a paid vs free version.&nbsp; I would always insist on the free version when updating it's download - as it will
 have you do when it is outdated and you open to run it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have freezes while browsing the internet, try another browser - Edge, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc - to find one that doesn't cause the problem.&nbsp; Make sure there are no Add-Ons or Extensions enabled in Browser Settings or Options, you have
 the latest Flash Player.&nbsp; Run AdwCleaner to make sure you have no adware.</p>

    <title>After recent update, mouse pointer is inverted in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After recent update, mouse pointer is inverted in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Inverted mouse scrolling, Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 updated (either overnight, or while I was at work), and now my mouse is, yet again, inverted. This happens every time Windows updates, because why would you let me keep my settings? However, now the option to set scrolling to the normal up = up
 and down = down is no longer there. I've looked at other topics here, and I can answer before it's asked, there is no option to change it in my device's settings (and the driver is not what was updated).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, how do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using an msi laptop with an ELAN trackpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>After trying the two fixes you suggested, I found the option to remove reverse scrolling in the ELAN-specific options (of course, it's somewhat hidden and smaller than everything else on their option screen). Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was wondering if you could do me one more favour: I'm not sure where I can lodge a complaint to Microsoft about this most recent update. My mouse/trackpad scrolling wasn't the only thing that got reverted - all of my settings for default programs
 (from browser, to video player, and even music purchased off of iTunes) were reverted to the Windows defaults. I've been using Windows since 3.1, and I've never had that problem with Windows Update on any previous version since Update's introduction.</p>

<h2>            BSOD&#39;s  on WIndows 8.0.</h2>
                    Hello everyone.<br />
i builded my pc, 4-5months ago. I installed Win8.0 Pro and all was ok, but after 2months of work i started getting BSOD's. BSOD error message is every time different, and i don't know what to do and how to fix this problem.&nbsp; Last few ones:<br />
PFN_LIST_CORRUPT<br />
KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK<br />
MEMORY_MANAGEMENT<br />
IRQL_LESS_OR_EQUAL.<br />
<br />
So, i tried to find way how to fix that, read many guides about those&nbsp; errors - no luck, also i installed Win Debugger, but WinDbg every time say's memory.dmp is corrupted. No ideas why.&nbsp; So a small info how it happens:<br />
<br />
1) Sometimes i getting BSOD after Sleep mode. Logging after sleep, trying to start any program - Boom - BSOD or sometimes after 1-2hours after sleep mode.<br />
2) Sometimes, i just trying to play any game but after some time i getting game crash, if try to start this game again - game crashes again and again and again. Then - BSOD. Sometimes it takes 1-2hours. sometimes more. ah and one more thing - sometimes games
 saying: "Not enough Memory" o_O, but it's impossible cos Task manager says all is ok.<br />
3) Sometimes, i also getting BSOD after watching video on youtube. 1-2 sometimes 3 hours in youtube&nbsp; = BSOD. Of course error message every time is different.<br />
4) When i working&nbsp; in Visual Studio, with my projects i also getting BSOD after compile, or after debugging my program. More often it happens when i testing Servers.
<br />
5) And the last - Sometimes any program crashes randomly, i trying to start it again and getting crash. Few more tries - BSOD.<br />
<br />
Notice: When any program crashes, Windows starting lagging. Task manager Performance tab saying all is ok. and few more hours = BSOD. After reboot pc works perfectly for some time until any program will get a crash.<br />
<br />
What i already did:<br />
1) Tested RAM by memtest many times - no errors.<br />
2) Tested Performance by Sandra - no errors.<br />
3) Tested HDDs for bad sectors and errors by Wincheckdisk,WesternDigital tools, HDD-Scan.&nbsp; No bad sectors or erros.<br />
4) Tested all parts of my pc on different PC's. Works ok.<br />
5) Tried to reInstall windows. After sometime - again BSODs&nbsp; with different erros. (usually after windows installing, i installing Drivers, then programs (VisualStudio Pro 2012, Office 365, Notepad++, Navicat, MySQL server,CodeBlocks,NetBeans, 3Ds Max,Firefox,GPU
 Tweak and AMD Overdrive)<br />
6) Tried to use last versions of drivers and also tried to use old versions - No Luck.<br />
7) Tried to change BIOS. also - No luck.<br />
8) Tried to give my pc into Repair Shop - they cant find problem :(&nbsp; or they just lazy.<br />
9) Tried to fix problems with guides from http://answers.microsoft.com. But still getting BSODs.<br />
<br />
I created this message after one more bsod. Info from Windows Events:<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x00000139 (0x0000000000000003, 0xfffff88015cf73d0, 0xfffff88015cf7328, 0x0000000000000000). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 111713-27939-01.<br />
<br />
My version why this happens:&nbsp; It's looks like a Read&amp;Write memory error, seen this problem on windows 95-98 longer time ago. But in those times Windows Reinstalling helps every time. ^_^&nbsp; Crashes&nbsp; and BSODs&nbsp; happens often when program writing or reading memory
 very often. Like MMORPG games (TERA like example). But i dont know what to do with that :S
<br />
<br />
Help me Please to fix this problem.&nbsp; <br />
Tell me if u need to know something else. <br />
Biggest Thanks for any advices and help. \^^/<br />
<br />

I have seen these DMPS before and I believe I said 4 different types of memory corruption.&nbsp; Since you say you have run Memtest (how many passes?, what were the results?) You can go straight to driver verifier<strong>
<br />
<br />
In looking at your DMP files I notice you are OVERCLOCKING SUBSTANTIALLY.&nbsp; Your cpu max is 3200 you are running at 3800.&nbsp; You need to revert to stock before anything else.<br />
<br />

<div>
<div><strong><font color="#3665EE"><br />
</font></strong></div>
<div><i>If you are&nbsp;<b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">overclocking</a></b>&nbsp;(pushing the components beyond their design) you should revert to default at least until the crashing is solved. If you dont know what it is you probably
 are not overclocking.</i></div>
<br />
<strong>1-Memtest. (</strong><font color="#FF0000"><b>You can read more about running memtest</b></font>&nbsp;<b><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/bsod-memory-problems-test-easily-and-completely/21c3f63f-f570-4522-b2ef-ecc7b7ff6461">here</a>)</b><strong><br />
</strong>Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. Get it&nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></b><br />
Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
If a known good stick fails in one motherboard slot but not another it is probably the slot<em>.</em><br />

2-Driver verifier (<font color="#FF0000">for complete directions see our wiki</font><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">here</a>)</strong><br />
Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition.<br />
Most times it will&nbsp;crash and it will tell you what the driver is, but sometimes it will crash and won't tell you the driver.</div>
<div>Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Start</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and type in "<b>verifier</b>" (without the quotes) and press<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Enter</b><br />
Select "<b>Create</b><span>&nbsp;</span>custom settings (for code developers)" and click "<b>Next</b>"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
Select everything<span>&nbsp;</span><b>EXCEPT FOR</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Low Resource Simulation"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>For Win 8 dont check</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Concurrency stress test, and DDI compliance checking click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers<span>&nbsp;</span><b>NOT</b><span>&nbsp;</span>provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Finish" on the next page.<br />
<b><br />
Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.</b><br />
<b>Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b>If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<b>Edit: Also great analysis from ZZ determining the OC. You need to reset the BIOS to defaults ASAP (load optimized defaults, reset CMOS, whichever method you chose). After doing so, do not touch ANYTHING.... DRAM freq, etc... leave everything Auto.</b><br />
<br />
We have various bug checks from the attached DMP files:<br />
<br />
<u><b>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE (139)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the kernel has detected the corruption of a critical data structure.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 139, {<u><i><b>3</b></i></u>, fffff88015cf73d0, fffff88015cf7328, 0}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bug check is 3 which indicates that a LIST_ENTRY was corrupted.<br />
<br />
This type of bug check can be difficult to track down and indicates that an inconsistency has been introduced into a doubly-linked list (detected when an individual list entry element is added to or removed from the list). Unfortunately, the inconsistency is
 not necessarily detected at the time when the corruption occurred, so some detective work may be necessary to identify the root cause.<br />
<br />
<u><b>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</i><br />
<br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.<br />
<br />
<u><b>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.</i><br />
<br />
Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).<br />
<br />
Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.<br />
<br />
Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<u><b>PFN_LIST_CORRUPT (4e)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the page frame number (PFN) list is corrupted.</i><br />
<br />
This bug check is generally caused by one of two things (sometimes three):<br />
<br />
1. Faulty RAM.<br />
<br />
2. Faulty HDD.<br />
<br />
3. Device driver causing corruption (not as often likely as the first two when we see this bug check in the equation).<br />
<br />
<i><b>If we look at the call stack:</b></i><br />
<i><br />
STACK_TEXT:&nbsp; <br />
fffff880`0c5b5cc8 fffff803`44a0ddef : 00000000`0000004e 00000000`00000099 00000000`003b2463 00000000`00000002 : nt!KeBugCheckEx<br />
fffff880`0c5b5cd0 fffff803`449588ec : 00000000`00000000 fffffa80`088e2a60 00000000`00000000 fffffa80`092ce1d0 : nt!<b>MiBadShareCount</b>+0x4b<br />
fffff880`0c5b5d10 fffff803`4495d669 : fffffa80`0de3c940 fffff680`0028b700 fffff680`000581d2 fffffa80`11fdd2d0 : nt!<b>MiDeletePfnList</b>+0x5b1<br />
fffff880`0c5b5df0 00000000`00000000 : 00000000`00000000 00000000`00000000 00000000`00000000 00000000`00000000 : nt!<b>MiDeleteAddressesInWorkingSet</b>+0x39a</i><br />
<br />
Possibly indicates further possible memory issues, or again, possibly a device driver causing corruption.<br />
<br />
<u><b>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</b></u><br />
<br />
Overall, things we need to take care of to move forward software-wise before we worry about hardware. We need to be sure software is not the problem or we'll be running in circles, so let's do that:<br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>** In one of the old *50 dumps, we can see:<br />
<i><br />
Could not read faulting driver name<br />
*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <b>AppleCharger.sys</b><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <b>AppleCharger.sys</b><br />
Probably caused by : <b>AppleCharger.sys</b> ( AppleCharger+29ab )</i><br />
<br />
^^ This is the GIGABYTE On/Off Charge driver. See here for details - <a href="http://www.gigabyte.us/MicroSite/185/on-off-charge.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gigabyte.us/MicroSite/185/on-off-charge.htm</a><br />
<br />
This driver is known to cause BSOD's on Win 7 and especially 8 based systems. I cannot seem to find it on the latest DMP in the modules list. Have you already removed this software? If not, remove it ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>2. </b>In your loaded drivers list, dtsoftbus01.sys is listed which is the Daemon Tools driver. Daemon Tools is a very popular cause of BSOD's in 7/8 based systems. Please uninstall Daemon Tools. Alternative imaging programs are: MagicISO, Power ISO, etc.<br />
<br />
<b>3. <i>gdrv.sys Thu Mar 12 23:22:29 <u>2009</u></i></b><br />
<br />
^^ Gigabyte Easy Saver - mobo power utility driver. Uninstall this ASAP as it's very buggy software and has been known to cause BSOD's.<br />
<br />
<b>4. <i>MS2Filter.sys - Thu Sep 23 05:29:54 <u>2010</u></i></b><br />
<br />
^^ Thermaltake mouse driver. Have you checked to be sure you have the absolute latest driver? If not, do so ASAP.<br />
<br />
<b>5. <i>vsflt53.sys - Tue Apr 12 07:31:35 2011</i></b><br />
<br />
^^ Acronis Virtual Disk Storage Filter. Known to be a cause of BSOD's, I'd recommend removal ASAP. There have been reports in the past of this driver still remaining after Acronis removal. After you remove Acronis, navigate go C:\Windows\System32\Drivers and
 look for <b><i>vsflt53.sys<br />
<br />
</i></b>If it's still there, rename it to <b><i>vsflt53.old </i></b>and restart the system to stop the driver from loading.<br />
<br />
<b>6. </b>If after all of the above you're still crashing, let's go ahead and enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            Hello again,<br />
Thanks ZigZag3143 and&nbsp; Patrick Barker for reply and help!<br />
<br />
To ZigZag3143:<br />
1) You said i'm overclocking - i'm not sure about that, i didn't do any actions for overclock. Also processor have a Mark on box:&nbsp; "AMD FX Six-Core 3.8 Ghz" and also cpu temperature is too low, so i'm sure it's not overclocking o_O<br />
2) About memtest. I was busy with work, so my pc was on memtest loop for at least 24-30hours, in results i didnt seen any error reports. But if u want i can do a few more tests and send to u a screen photo.<br />
<br />
To Patrick Barker:<br />
1) about&nbsp; GIGABYTE On/Off Charge.&nbsp; Deleted this thing after first blue screen, but also if its a problem with AppleCharger.sys - BSOD message will say it. ^^ Had problem with this driver before.<br />
2) Deleted Gigabyte Easy Saver right now. ^^<br />
3) Yeah, i'm using last versions of all Thermaltake drivers.<br />
4) I have Acronis Tools, but i installed them more later than BSODS started to annoy me ^^ but sure i will remove them to fix problem.<br />
<br />
And to you both:<br />
I used driver verifier like you recommended. And got following result:<br />
BSOD after restart. Well it seems it's problem some driver or drivers. &gt;_&gt;&nbsp; Any ways, how to detect what driver gives this problem (except delete them all ^^)?<br />
<br />

            Two things:<br />
<br />
(As I already said) In your loaded drivers list, dtsoftbus01.sys is listed which is the Daemon Tools driver. Daemon Tools is a very popular cause of BSOD's in 7/8 based systems. Please uninstall Daemon Tools. Alternative imaging programs are: MagicISO, Power
 ISO, etc.<br />
<br />
and also, sptd,.sys is listed and loaded as well which is the SCSI Pass Through Direct Host - Daemon Tools (known
<span>BSOD</span> issues with Win and especially 8). Remove this driver ASAP -

            Heya again.<br />
<br />
I deleted many drivers, cleared my system and now i doesnt have BSOD with verifier after restarting...<br />
But after 2-3hours i getting blue screen with SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION.<br />
<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x000000c1 (0xfffff98058dcafc0, 0xfffff98058dca56b, 0x00000000006b4038, 0x0000000000000032). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 111813-41683-01.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Thanks for the update.<br />
<br />
Good work on the drivers, I do see all problematic ones are gone from the loaded modules list.<br />
<br />
<u><b>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (1a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred.</i><br />
<br />
BugCheck 1A, {<u><i><b>403</b></i></u>, fffff68000282768, 871000029c75b84f, fffff680000793ca}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bug check is 403 which indicates that the page table and PFNs are out of sync . This is probably a hardware error.<br />
<br />
We have two other bug checks as well:<br />
<br />
<u><b>DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION (c4)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This is the general bug check code for fatal errors found by Driver Verifier.</i><br />
<br />
A device driver attempting to corrupt the system has been caught.&nbsp; This is<br />
because the driver was specified in the registry as being suspect (by the<br />
administrator) and the kernel has enabled substantial checking of this driver.<br />
If the driver attempts to corrupt the system, bugchecks 0xC4, 0xC1 and 0xA will<br />
be among the most commonly seen crashes.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the dump does not show the driver that's 'causing' this, I believe it's because it's in a deadlock or there's a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
<u><b>SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION (c1)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the driver wrote to an invalid section of the special pool.</i><br />
<br />
Same as above with the *C4.<br />
<br />
Okay, there are a few things I would like for you to do at this point and it's very important you do them as I say and don't make any adjustments for absolute best troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
<b>1. </b>Reset the CMOS or Load Optimized Defaults in the BIOS and DON'T CHANGE ANY SETTINGS AFTERWARDS -
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</a><br />
<br />
<b>2. </b>I have a feeling that this may be causing issues - <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/docs/dokan-readme/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://dokan-dev.net/en/docs/dokan-readme</a><br />
<br />
Is there any way you could uninstall this software without there being any issues? I've never seen this software so I am not sure of the repercussions.<br />
<br />
<b>3. </b>If you're still crashing all of the above, let's go ahead and run a Memtest. Even though you've run it, I'd like for you to run it for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours) after clearing the CMOS:<br />
<br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

            You're doing great so far, thank you for the cooperation. It'll help very much in ultimately finding the culprit.<br />
<br />
Let's run hard disk diagnostics now. Start with a chkdsk to check for bad sectors (attach log afterwards). After you run chkdsk, run Seatools in Windows + DOS:<br />
<br />
There are various ways to run Chkdsk~</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 1:</b></u><br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
chkdsk x: /r<br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
chkdsk c: /r<br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 2:</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you'd like to get a log file that contains the chkdsk results, do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />
<br />
Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />
<br />
This will output a .txt file on your Desktop containing the results of the chkdsk.<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>If chkdsk turns out okay, run Seatools</b></u></span> -<br />
<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />

            Heya, thanks ^^<br />
<br />
So, i did a checkdisk scan, and of course checkdisk didnt find anything.<br />
Also i did a scan by Seagate Tools in Dos Mode and in GUI(Windows) and yeah nothing was founded.<br />
And i did one more scan by HDD Scan program, very nice and easy program to scan ur HDD for a bad sectors and "problem" blocks.&nbsp; You can download and find FAQ on HDDScan website. Link below:<br />
http://hddscan.com<br />
<br />
But HDD scan found only 1 500ms block, 0 bads, all others blocks is ok. So it seems my HDD is ok.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what to do now? &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks for Help.

<h2>            Xbox one left trigger rumble not working&#47;weak&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>So it seems to me that the left trigger is significantly weaker than the right when it comes to rumble, also in some occasions the left triggers rumble stops working altogether (tested in Forza 5). The way I tested to see whether it was weaker is I
 swapped the gas and brake functions on the triggers and with my controller at least it was VERY obvious that the left one was very weak. Anyone else have this issue?</span></p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue with one of two XB1 controllers. The left trigger on one of them isn't vibrating. Took the controller apart to see if the motor is displaced or damaged but all seems ok. Will test deeper with multimeter and see what are the readings of the faulty motor against the same readings on the healthy one. Let me know if anyone finds a solution for this issue without buying a new controller. Mail me at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</p>

                    After all the install problems and 3 days of getting windows 8 running and only enjoying about 3 hours of use. I now have the new improved BSOD. Very slick and again not very informative.&nbsp;
<div>Tried all of windows recovery options refresh, reinstall, safe mode ( can't access it), cmd, all of it and no fix.&nbsp;<br />
<div>0xc000021a. Well did some research and winlogon.exe might be problem tried all suggestions nothing I have no disk to reinstall from windows 8 never have me the option to make an ISO or USB so I'm out of luck&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any possible solution to this 4-5 day ordeal?&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I understand the issue, system crash with blue screen of death and you receive error code 0xc000021a. Please let me know if this is not correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did&nbsp;you purchase Windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;you download link through email,&nbsp;you can use the link to burn the ISO to the disk. After that you may try performing&nbsp;automatic repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To perform Automatic repair on Windows 8 computer follow these steps:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a)
<b>Insert the media </b>such as (USB or DVD) and
<b>restart </b>the computer.<br />
b)<b> Press F12 key </b>(typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers)and
<b>choose the drive </b>that you inserted the <b>installation media </b>into.<br />
c) Once the <b>Windows Setup window </b>appears, follow these steps:<br />
d) Click <b>Next </b>and select <b>Repair your computer.<br />
</b>e) You will then see a<b> blue screen </b>and an <b>option to choose.
</b></span></p>
<p><span>e) Choose the option
<b>Troubleshoot </b>and select <b>Advanced </b>options<b>.<br />
</b>f) You may<b> choose Automatic Repair </b>from<b> Advanced boot </b>option<b>.</b></span></p>
<p><span><br />

            <p>well the only fix is is to install from disc. got machine working. I suspect the Nvidia video driver offered as an optional windows&nbsp;update is the culprit, and I can't understand why system restore isn't enabled at start. this time I enabled it.
</p>
<p>my problem previously was that win8 pro download never gave me an option to make an iso or usb.&nbsp; Always thought that some how I screwed it up, but I didn't. I tried to&nbsp;download on a&nbsp;different pc (xp machine) same thing no option for iso download. I was convinced
 that some how when I purchased win8 I must have selected the wrong option at that time. so in a futile attempt to get this going, I downloaded software again this time on Vista machine, guess what? I got the option to download the ISO file. my conclusion so
 far is that XP machines don't get ISO option???</p>
<p>This has been a very unpleasant experience.</p>
<p>1) I should have had the option to download iso file ( to prevent taking 11 days to get my machine back and running</p>
<p>2) why isn't system restore automatically enabled? ( would have prevented this whole mess)</p>
<p>3) maybe MS should have the upgrade advisor prep the system for win8 upgrade?(maybe assist in backing up files and disable known software and basically prep the system for upgrade)</p>
<p>4) after all this upgrade drama.... I don't care for metro! not sold on it. it's like 2 OS' in 1. Metro apps suck! it's not intuitive! it looks slick but not intuitive. I hope this works for Microsoft. I think to win customers is to make easy for them and
 it should just work! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And thanks to all that tried helping me!</p>

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
The issue can be caused by hardware such as hard drive or cabling issues among many.<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop <br />
and Start Screen.<br />
<br />
The link below&nbsp;is for Windows 7 however it will also provide useful information when
<br />
working with Windows 8&nbsp;though you will need to translate a few Windows 7 commands
<br />
into those for Windows 8. <br />
<br />
<strong>Translate these to Windows 8 methods (there is little real difference) :</strong><br />

<br />
=============<br />
<br />
<strong>STOP: 0xC000021A<br />
<br />
</strong>Can be a difficult problem to solve and you may indeed need technical help from a real computer
<br />
shop (one that does its own in-house service) or the System Maker's Support.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xC000021A: STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED<br />
</strong></p>
<p>The STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED bug check has a value of 0xC000021A. This means that an error has occurred in a crucial user-mode subsystem.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows
 cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.</p>
<p>Mismatched system files can also cause this error. This can occur if you have restored your hard disk from a backup. Some backup programs might skip restoring system files that they determine are in use.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p>Running the kernel debugger is not useful in this situation because the actual error occurred in a user-mode process.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving an error in a user-mode device driver, system service, or third-party application:</strong> Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the
 installation of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software should be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update.
</p>
<p>If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time. If this does not resolve the error, try manually removing the offending
 software. If the system partition is formatted with file allocation table (FAT), use an MS-DOS startup disk to gain access to the computer's hard disk. If the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename
 or delete the faulty software. If the faulty software is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery Console in order to access the file. If a newly installed piece if hardware is suspected, remove
 it to see if this resolves the issue.</p>
<p>Try running the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair any errors that it detects.
</p>
<p><strong>Resolving a mismatched system file problem:</strong> If you have recently restored your hard disk from a backup, check if there is an updated version of the Backup/Restore program available from the manufacturer. Make sure the latest Windows Service
 Pack is installed. <br />

=======================================================<br />
<br />
You may need to thoroughly check the hard drive for errors (be sure to inspect the cable<br />
as best you can).<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for RootKits which can survive a format and installation of Windows.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
After checking the drive for RootKits inspect the drive and cabling. Then thoroughly<br />
check the hard drive for errors using the <strong>Advanced Methods</strong> and the<strong> Manufactuter's<br />
Diagnostic Utilities</strong>.<br />
<br />
These are much more efficient methods to check the disk. <strong>&lt;- Advanced <br />
Methods.</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the&nbsp;Windows 8 disk (boot from it) :<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />

            I am also having the same problem. I have been perfectly working on windows from last one and a half month, but suddenly it started hanging and crashed suddenly two days back. It again worked again fine after that, but system&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;showed me error
 of error in disks and wanted me to restart. i chose to restart later and then it shut downed properly.
<div><br />
<div>But when i started it after two hours, system crashed with error 0xc000021a. It automatically started system repair and repaired disk errors for over an hour and in the end repairing failed. I have tried refreshing,, resetting, entering safe mode and all
 other options but all failed. I only have iso in my system and it just don't boots up.</div>

            Like many others in the forums, I suddenly ran into this Stop code and none of the startup options fix the error. Booting with install media does not help as I cannot perform an in-place upgrade. I have pulled the hard drive from the computer and attached
 it to a working Win7 machine with a DriveWire (USB adapter) and the drive itself is accessible, and I was able to delete temp files and work with the contents of the drive, so it's not a drive failure.
<div><br />
<div>I'm fairly disappointed in the limited range of Microsoft responses. None of the automatic fixes work, and the stop code itself - along with the "new and improved" BSOD - are less than helpful. Perhaps I should have made a system image before this occurred,
 but at this stage that won't help and hindsight is always 20/20.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>FYI, there is no "last known good" available in the startup options screen, so I can't try that either. System File Checker refuses to start and complains that a service cannot start.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can save my data by connecting to the drive to a different PC, but if I have to reinstall it will NOT be Windows 8 and I will NOT be installing it on any other machines until Blue comes around and some of these egregious errors are fixed. Dumbing it
 down for the user didn't help at all, and in fact is less than useless for a system admin. I'm really looking forward to a true fix, or some type of diagnostic that will help resolve the problem.&nbsp;</div>

            I beta tested Windows 8 on three different systems and have been using version 8.1 since its release. My system is a HP G71-340us Laptop and has been working flawlessly since I upgraded to 8.1
<div><br />
<div>I do not have another system running Win 8.1 to download and create start-up media to try and resolve my situation on the HP. At this point the laptop Will Not Reboot, it just goes to the BSOD with continual loops at trying to restart. At no time does
 it give me any option to access the cmd or run windows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Neither the Win/F8, F8, Win/F12 or F12 have any effect on the booting and continual BSOD on my HP!&nbsp;</div>
<div>At this point I am going to remove the hard-drive and inspect it while connected to another system to see if there is a means for me to recover my documents and programme materials.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I own Windows 7 Professional 64/32 Bit Software and presume this is what will be reinstalled on my HP Laptop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I presumed Microsoft had not became "Mickey-Soft" with Windows 8/8.1 but my current experience is tending to point me to another conclusion.<br />
<div><br />
<div>There must be a manner in which those who have purchased Windows 8/8.1 have some recourse regarding this kind of failure. This echos of Microsoft's release of Dos 4.0 decades ago.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Having exactly the same issue after installing some updates on my Windows 8 virtual machine (VMware Workstation 9). System Restore works, putting updates breaks the system again. I hoped to get from Windows 8 to 8.1 Update, but it seems like a reinstall
 of fresh 8.1. </p>

            Hi MadhanKumar4 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Looks like this is an expected behavior as I have noticed this in other apps like Skype also where system sound keeps playing.
<br />
<br />But surprising thing is that there is no option to control this in Voice Recorder application. I would recommend that you submit this as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub
<br />
<br />Windows Key+F
<br />Submit your feedback  
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />
<br />That is the Surface Dial on-screen control . . .
<br />
<br />I think you will find settings for that as follows:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Devices - Wheel

            Thank you for the assist! I have the dial installed but never use it, so didn't think of it. Followed your trail, did a troubleshoot, and the system made a fix. Looks like it's gone. I really appreciate the help. Have a great day.

<h2>            Windows has recovered from an unexpected shutdown - BCCode 116</h2>
                    I purchased a brand new HP Computer h8-1214 two months ago. And the computer sometimes restarts unexpectedly. It usually happens at night when the computer is idle. It's a very annoying thing since it closes all the programs. This is what it displays:<br />

            Arya,<br />
<br />
The computer is brand new and I have not made any hardware changes/additions to it. I did however, as you might suspect, installed an array of necessary software such as Photoshop and other things a CG Artist might need.<br />
<br />
I've updated all the drivers weeks ago, but a new video driver for ATI came out after that so I've updated it and we'll see how it works.<br />
<br />
What are the chances it's a video driver issue?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you try the steps provided on july 25, 2012?<br />
<br />
This can be also a video driver issue which may be causing some display problems, which may cause the unexpected shutdown.<br />
<br />
Keep us updated about the status of the issue.

I disabled automatic restart (as per your Method 1) and then updated the video drivers. The computer was doing fine and then, after leaving it idle for a few hours, I came back and then it crashed again. This time I got a blue screen. I took a picture if you
 want to take a look.<br />

When I restarted the computer, this came up: <br />

Thanks for responding. I cannot find the xml file even after I unhid folders and files. But I have managed to upload the dump file here:<br />

Please let me know if that helps. My computer's make and model is HP Pavilion HPE h8-1214. It is brand new and I haven't made any changes to the hardware.
<br />
<br />
My BIOS version date is AMI Ang_716, 4/5/2012<br />
<br />
Windows 7 64bit<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
I ended up calling HP Tech support and they walked me through uninstalling the display drivers for the AMD Radeon HD 7450 installed and then reinstalling them with the default drivers, and then updating them from the Device Manager window. I don't know if this
 changes anything as I have already updated the driver on July 25 from the amd website when it was recommended by Arya, but the computer still crashed.<br />
<br />
The crash usually happens when the computer is idle and when both my monitors are off. I would usually leave the computer on when I have errands to run and when I return home, turn on my monitor I have this BCCode 116 error waiting for me.<br />

            <p>I think you need to pass the problem back to HP as a warranty claim. This link explains the kind of problem you have:<br />

<p>I had a problem for several months similar to yours. It was almost certainly resolved by updated graphics drivers.</p>

            Gerry,<br />
<br />
I read the link you referred to and the drivers the guy wanted were the April 2012 drivers which I have. Device Manager tells me my display driver (Radeon HD 7450) version is 8.960.11.1000, which is dated 4/25/2012.<br />
<br />
I'm currently trying to replicate the blue screen problem again to see if what the HP tech and I did (please refer to previous post) helped any.<br />
<br />
Also, when you said you almost had the same problem which you solved by updating your graphics driver, did you mean you updated your drivers solely, or did you also update AMD/ATI Catalyst DIsplay Suite?<br />

<p>Your AMD Radeon drivers are much older than they appear.The point in the link was that they were complaining about having to rely on HP for updated drivers. This means that there is a delay between AMD releasing updated drivers and you being able to get
 them from HP.</p>
<p>Earlier this year there was a spate of complaints from users who were getting Bug Check Code 116 errors. I was also seeing one of these errors every 2 or 3 days. For me these stopped on 28 June. Shortly after 28 June I received an updated AMD/ATI Catalyst
 DIsplay Suite. No more errors. For several months I was looking for a solution to my 116 problem and it was apparent that many others had the same problem. These reports stopped appearing shortly after the 28 June.</p>
<p>My situation is different to yours. My computer is not a branded computer. The graphics card was purchased separately from the computer so I can go directly to AMD / ATI for drivers. You cannot unless you change the graphics card. This why I suggest you
 complain to HP.</p>

            Gerry,<br />
<br />
I misinterpreted the link you referenced. Sorry about that. You said there was a 'delay' between HP and AMD when it came to providing updated drivers. If it were only a delay issue, wouldn't I simply be able to visit the AMD website, and download the latest
 drivers, which according to this link<br />
<br />
http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/radeonaiw_vista64.aspx<br />
<br />
is the 06/28/2012 driver package that you spoke of. Would it be a good idea for me to do that, or is there something really different about my graphics card even though they're the same model number?<br />
<br />
Why can't I go the the AMD website to download these drivers and need to change graphics card entirely instead? I'm sorry Gerry, I'm not understanding that part, but I'm glad you're helping me though.<br />

<h2>            Super Street Fighter Update issue</h2>
                    
<p>Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition will be released today (hopefully) however there WAS a small (4mb) update yesterday in preperation for its arrival.</p>
<p>However I have a small problem. I have the SSFIV on demand and it isn't updating!? If I put the disc in the machine this update will automatically appear but not for the OD version? Does this mean that On Demand games can't be updated? I realised there was
 a problem when I noticed there was nobody online, so I put the disc in and VOILLA! updates and the online community is there!! I'd be a little (LOT) gutted if I can't update my OD version as I'd hoped.</p>
<p>Please advise</p>

            Hi Beth.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you opened the DVD drive in File Explorer to try to view them?  What happens exactly?  
<br />
<br />Will the disks work in another PC and how are you accessing them there exactly?
<br />
<br />Try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-drive-not-working-missing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-dvd-cd-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />Did the DVD drive work in that PC before?  If so this might have been caused by Windows Update.  Did you receive Windows Updates recently?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Update History.  You can try uninstalling any affecting Updates there.
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />See if the problem returns with the Update reinstalling and if so uninstall it and block it using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />To attempt to repair this, go to Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Under DVD Device, click on Driver tab, first try Update Driver &gt; Automatically.  If that fails see if Roll Back is available.  If not choose  Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Disk Management, scroll down to find the DVD drive.  Does it have a drive letter?  If not right click to issue a drive letter so it shows up in File Explorer, save and exit.
<br />
<br />Run Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />FYI there is no DVD player in Windows 10, they want you to buy one from the store.  There are better free options here:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

            Hello my name is Bradford, and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community, and I'll help you with accessing the files stored on your discs. 
<br />
<br />The issue might be that the files are in a format that is not standard to Windows. 
<br />
<br />According to the study published by the NHI, there are five or six formats that have been standardizing to the medical industry for XRay and CT Scan data. 
<br />
<br />Please see the picture attached for the formats. 
<br />
<br />However, at the link below, you can download free reader software that would allow viewing the data of several medical data formats. 
<br />
<br />Link for MicroCicom Reader:
<br /><code><a href="http://www.microdicom.com/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microdicom.com/downloads.html</a></code>
<br />
<br />If there is anything else I can answer for you, please let me know.

<br />
<p>In addition to <em>Mike's</em> comments...</p>
<p>Is the wireless printer already connected to your home wireless network?</p>
<p>If so have you installed the manufacturers software for the wireless printer on your Win 7 computer.</p>
<p>As an <u><em>example</em></u>...</p>
<p>When I installed my HP J4680 AiO (fax/print/scan) device I did these steps...</p>
<ol>
<li>Created an ad hoc connection between the J4680 and my Win 7 laptop.</li><li>Configured the J4680 manually with my network SSID, encryption type and encryption key.
<u>I did steps 1 and 2 because my 63-character random ASCII encryption key contains characters not available in the front panel wireless network control on the J4680</u>. If you use an encryption key without special characters you should be able to simply configure
 the wireless network settings from the printers front panel.</li><li>Installed the HP supplied software including drivers on my Win 7 laptop. The HP software went out and found the J4680 on my network.</li></ol>

<h2>            Synaptics WBDI has a driver problem but troubleshooter can&#39;t find the problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a lenovo Yoga 520, and recently my screen stopped working (unresponsive with touch or pen).</p>
<p>I went to Windows defender security to identify the problem, windows updates are all up to date but there seems to be a problem with the health and performance of the computer. I check the report and says there's a device driver problem, I run the troubleshoot
 and too issues come up: ''Synaptics WBDI has a driver problem'' and '' I dont see my device listed'', when i try to detect problems in any of the options, troubleshooting cant identify the problem.</p>
<p>Im still under warranty, but would like to know what are my options now. I need this problem fixed asap as I have projects in the process.</p>

<br />

<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />In the Search box, type calibrate.
<br />
<br />Touch or click Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input in the list of programs.
<br />
<br />Touch or click the Calibrate button.
<br />
<br />You will be asked to touch the crosshair on the screen each time it moves across or down the screen.
<br />
<br />Touch or click Yes to save the calibration data.
<br />
<br />Touch or click OK.
<br />
<br />If you have the Lenovo's "Write It" app installed, remove it then try again.

<h2>            Appeared a lot of bugs in the Build 17763 Insider Fast dan Slow Ring</h2>
                    <p>
I've Updated to build 17763 on September 20, yesterday. But after using build 8 days, a few bugs suddenly appears. Whereas before smoothly without problem.<br />
<br />
</p><ol>
<li>When opening an application in the Start Menu no one wants to open.&nbsp;</li><li>When opening an application more than 4, and then a few applications on the minimize and opened again, the application does not want to open. crash &gt; not responding &gt; and eventually result in a Blank PC not endless and should in turn off forced and sometimes
 the Desktop does not respond at all but when you try to open the application in the taskbar that can click and open.</li><li>When want to upload images or anything Windows Explorer Window does not respond to open, even when uploading the image below I have trouble.</li><li>My PC also works very hard and fast heat is not as usual.</li><li>CPU Usage I always between 80-100% when applications are open a little.</li><li>Some other issues still surrounding the&nbsp; "Not Responding".</li></ol>
<p>I've been trying to figure out what causes the problem but I found out in Hours, minutes and seconds the problem i.e. svchost.exe_wuauserv error.&nbsp;To prove whether a PC or my Windows Build broken I tried installing Windows 8.1 Pro and Ubuntu Gnome the 18.04
 through normal just yet even went very smooth.<br />
I also can't open the App Hub Feedback to report this problem!😔😰<br />

<h3> fezzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-enabling remove message confirmation popup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago I have disabled the popup that appears when you right click on a message and select Remove Message.</p>
<p>But since I did that I have a few times misclicked when trying to edit message and instead removed them which wouldn't happen if had the confirmation popups enabled.</p>
<p>So I'm looking for a way to re-enable the popup, I've looked everywhere in the settings and couldn't find anything, nor did google search help, can anyone please point me in the right direction? I've seen option to disable Skype Cookies but it's not explained
 anywhere what information do they actually store and I don't really want to disable them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
