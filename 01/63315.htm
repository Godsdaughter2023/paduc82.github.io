<h2>            how to setup dell 966 to windows 7 laptop wireless</h2>
                    I have tried all I know to do to setup my HPg7 Laptop to my Dell 966 printer so I may print wireless. It finally said that I was successful but when I print, I get the message that communication cannot be made to printer. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
 Surely I am doing something wrong.<br />
Thanks much.....<br />

            Please download the latest <strong>Windows 7 driver for Dell 966 Printer </strong>
from the manufacturer's website.<br />
<br />
Please select the correct system (Windows 7/Vista).<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Important Note:</strong> Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.<br />
<br />
Also install the firmware update (if any) for your printer. <br />
<br />
After downloading, I suggest that you remove the existed driver in Windows 7/Vista, and then install the<strong>latest driver</strong> .<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Remove printer</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Click the "Start" button, type PRINTER in the search box and press Enter.<br />
<br />
2. Find the icons which are related to Dell 966 Printer, and delete them.<br />
<br />
3. Right-click on the blank part of the window, and choose "Run as administrator"-&gt;"Server Properties".<br />
<br />
4. On the Drivers tab, select the listed printer and click the Remove button. Please then select Remove driver and driver package.<br />
<br />
5. Open Start menu, input APPWIZ.CPL in the Search box and press ENTER to launch "Programs and Features".<br />
<br />
6. Try to remove all related printer software.<br />
<br />
7. Reinstall the latest driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
After installing the driver, please follow the steps below </strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Add a shared printer<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, click Control Panel and double click Printers.<br />
<br />
2. On Keyboard press Alt, then click File-&gt;Run as administrator-&gt;Add Printer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>When UAC window pops up, click Continue to go on.</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
3. Select "Add a local printer".<br />
<br />
4. Select "Create a new port". Choose "Local Port" as the type of the port.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. In the box "Enter a port name", type the address as the following format.<br />
<br />
<br />
\\[IP address of the host computer]\[The Share Name of the printer]<br />
<br />
<br />
Then click Next.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Follow the instruction to finish the installation. During installing, choose the correct driver in the driver list.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I suggest that you try to directly connect the printer to the computer and check if the printing works.<br />

<p>Народ помогите!</p>
<p>Возможность играть в Онлайн появилась как-то разок давненько. Сыграл гонку и выкинуло. Больше войти в Онлайн не получалось. Три дня назад снова появился значок. Зашел, поиграл эти выходные, а сегодня опять не пускает. Пишет, что у профиля нет разрешения
 на вход, при том соединение с Лайвом нормальное. Как исправить ситуацию? Может нужно заплатить за ГТА ОЛ или купить статус Голд?</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t install games on windows 10 stops at updating component registration problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't install a game using the msi file. The DVD will run dor endless hours and still shows 'updating component registration'</p>
<p>I know that there was the same Problem with Windows 7 but that was solved with de-installing two security Patches. Unfortunately I can't remember which ones and I don't know where (or if) they can be found on Windows 10 also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone knws how to solve this (copying the game to the PC didn't work) let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards,</p>
<p>Gabriele</p>

            you have to directly search for Troubleshooting History. All items is just to say that when you open the control panel you have all items! Not to search it! Try and put Troubleshooting History in the search bar as soon as you open the control panel!

    <title>Laptop Keyboard and Trackpad Random Disconnect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eddieseunghunhan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop Keyboard and Trackpad Random Disconnect</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am in need of some help with my laptop that is behaving very weirdly.</p>
<p>The issue seems a little complex, and I've tried every avenue of solutions I know to no avail...</p>
<p>It would be great if you could help in any way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This began happening approximately 4 days ago</p>
<p>My laptop's keyboard and trackpad stops working<del> randomly</del></p>
<p>If I plug in a USB Mouse and Keyboard (not wireless), then those work fine.</p>
<p>If I close my laptop (put it to sleep) and wake it back up, then the keyboard and trackpad works again.</p>
<p>Before randomly disabling itself again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can <del>often</del> recreate the issue if I type quickly (and I'm not particularly a fast typer)</p>
<p>And sometimes, if I keep trying to use the trackpad and/or keyboard, it begins to work again</p>
<p>When it does, it inputs ALL the keys that I pressed up till that point.</p>
<p>(However, this is not a lag issue as the USB Mouse and Keyboard works just fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to Reset Your Computer with the boot drive.</p>
<p>I have tried clean wiping my computer through school IT.</p>
<p>All my drivers are up to date, and all my windows updates are up to date.</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling my drivers, as well as getting drivers from manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>The problem still persists, and my school IT has suggested in scrapping the laptop.</p>
<p>Even if I have no programs installed (except for the very basic ones), the problem still exists.<br />
</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions on what I could try? Or should I scrap my laptop as the IT guys suggested?</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer specifications:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Company: Samsung</p>
<p>Model Code: NT910S3L-M14B</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Celeron 1.6 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 4.00 GB</p>
<p>Keyboards: Standard PS/2 Keyboard [what the Device Manager says, at least]</p>
<p>Mice: ELAN PS/2 Port Input Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Education, 64-bit operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have posted this same question on Samsung forums today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: After much trial, I can confidently say that the error is NOT random - it only occurs if I type really fast.</p>

 your Windows 10 operating system. This will help us isolate any incompatibility issues between the version of your Photos app and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try resetting the app and see how it goes. To do this simply go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>System</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.
 Look for the Photos and click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced options</strong>. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Reset</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and follow through. Once the reset is done, restart your PC, and try the app once again.</p>

    <title>Hulu and CBS app won&#39;t load at all on Xbox 1S - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hulu and CBS app won&#39;t load at all on Xbox 1S</h2>
                    <p>When I first installed the Hulu app on my new Xbox 1S it worked fine for the first couple of weeks. Then one day when I tried to launch the app it gave an error message saying "app took too long to load" and to wait 30 seconds and try loading it again, and
 said if that didn't work then restart the console. I did both of those steps multiple times on different days, but the exact same error message came up. Two times I tried uninstalling the app all together, restarting the console, then installing it again,
 but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing is wrong with my Hulu account---I also have the app on my Roku so I tried it and had no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every few days I've been trying these steps but no luck. Today I tried launching the CBS app for the first time (installed a week or two ago, never used) but got the exact same message as I have been getting for Hulu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been quite frustrated because I watch Hulu alot but so far figured I could manage switching to the Roku for it but if this issue is spreading to other apps this is unacceptable! Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(went through the steps for Customer Support for Xbox...chatted with virtual assistant and it said I supposedly had the option to "speak with a person" about this issue but gave no options other then waiting on a phone call from them)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            How do I set a program to open maximized&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7 and Windows 8.1, I can right-click on a program&nbsp;icon, choose Properties, then under the Shortcut tab,&nbsp;I can&nbsp;set the program to Run: Maximized. How do I do this in Windows 10? (I'm specifically asking because a program I use, SAS 9.4, always
 opens in less than full screen and it's annoying to have to maximize it every time I run it.)</p>

            <p>It works the same way on Windows 10, at least for desktop applications, but the trick is you are going to have to locate the actual shortcut not the entry on the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Start Menu right click on the program icon and select "Open file location".&nbsp; Once you are there it works the same as you are use to.</p>

                    <p>Hours wasted with online "Microsoft" technical support. &nbsp;Don't waste you money. &nbsp;They told me get the Assure plan and they would fix any problems I may have with my computer. &nbsp;Such an untruth, after 3 plus hours on phone my printer and scanner not working.
 I just called to get the scanner working so i could scan PDF's again. &nbsp;But they were unable to figure out how to work the printer. Crazy waste of time, they are supposed to send my payment back. &nbsp;Such a waste of energy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is quite a lie. I can hook up a 10 year old Scanner or Printer to OS X and with not to much effort get it to work</p>
<p>Same can be said for Windows XP or Linux, but not for Windows 10.</p>
<p>See the problem is a Microsoft created problem. </p>
<p>Microsoft hates any driver not installed by Microsoft and certified by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>(Also Generic Drivers do not exist according to Microsoft.)</p>
<p>Example is a Driver from Windows 7 will run and load and use drivers, but not in Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing wrong with your device, it is 100% Microsoft that has decided you have to buy a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to give you an analogy Microsoft has decided to stop making the same gas for your car, even though there</p>
<p>was nothing wrong with your car,&nbsp;MS just added a new ingredient that renders your car inoperable on purpose!</p>
<p>This is the crux of what has been done to you, not your fault.</p>

<p>Unlike you I started working with computers in 1976 when the mouse later showed up on a Mac in 1984!</p>
<p>****&nbsp;some computers used did not have lower case yet.</p>
<p>We used a Roneo to transmit a picture in @ symbols of Criminals that had to be layered in rows&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>I know Firmware and Software since I have been writing it since 1976 on a Teletype Model 43 for my first programs.</p>
<p>I laid on my back for a weekend soldering in magnetic loops to upgrade 96 bits for a whopping 12 bytes of memory!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes Microsoft can make Drivers backward Compatible, but they chose not to do so and this is a fact.</p>
<p>As I have written drivers for devices I know how Firmware and a OS work. </p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

            Hi Oli.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.

<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Taking screenshots with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. angry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taking screenshots with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>It seems as though Windows 10 has taken yet another step backwards, in Win 8 I was able to press the Windows key and prt sc buttons together and the screen shot would be saved to the screenshots folder in my pictures folder, easy and quick. &nbsp;I just took
 a screenshot in Windows 10, went to my screenshots folder and nothing. &nbsp;I know it took the screen dimmed as it used to when I pressed the buttons, then I remembered the long and cumbersome method you had to use in Win 7, where you had to open Paint, paste
 and then name and save the file to a location, so I tried that and sure enough there it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Microsoft for making Win 10 even worse and slower, now where's ProgMan?</p>

Capturing screen contents - the PrntScrn key, Win-Shift-S, the Snipping tool and Screenshots - Wiki</a>]</p>
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Setting&nbsp;and checking the Screenshots folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; In Windows 10, the key combination WindowsKey+PrntScrn sends a png picture of your screen to your Screenshots folder.&nbsp; When this happens, the screen momentarily dims slightly to tell you that you are doing it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If your PrntScrn key has two jobs then you&nbsp;may need to press the Fn key as well&nbsp;-&gt; Fn-WinKey-PrntScrn.&nbsp; Normally, the keyboard maker will have indicated this by labelling PrntScrn in blue and the Fn key in blue but if there is any doubt your computer
 manual ought to explain this.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshots produces a whole screen picture:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=82bf0b30-f372-413c-b1e8-b5798641f919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/875a8d70-bc0f-4601-add5-ff6e61f1718e" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p><em>Pictures quality reduced for ease of posting [the originals can be blown up to double&nbsp;normal size before degradation becomes apparent]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a second monitor set up in Extended desktop mode then Screenshots will capture them both:-</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=abd697de-290d-432c-9a97-34c4e0cdd370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ece3637-19c9-4cb6-bde8-ebb244eedcf5" style="margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; The Screenshots&nbsp;folder is not created until the first time that you use this key combination.&nbsp; The folder is created at</p>
<p>%UserProfile%\Pictures\Screenshots</p>
<p>[you can paste this entry into the File explorer address bar to get straight to it]</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">3&nbsp; Relocating the Screenshots folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.1&nbsp; If you right-click on the Screenshots folder, select Properties &amp; select the Location tab then you can relocate it to&nbsp;another folder&nbsp;if you want to.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.2&nbsp; A &nbsp;dialog box appears&nbsp;and it&nbsp;asks&nbsp;whether or not&nbsp;you&nbsp;want to move the contents of the current Screenshots folder to the new location.&nbsp; If you choose to do so then the original folder is removed in the process. If you choose not to move its existing
 contents then they and the existing Screenshots folder itself remain where they are but they no longer have any significance to the system - new screenshots will be sent to the new location.</p>
<p>3.3&nbsp; I normally have mine set to dump the screenshots on my Desktop because that is my general clearing house for work in progress.&nbsp; So, I entered D:\Desktop [%UserProfile%\Desktop] as my new location.</p>
<p>3.4&nbsp; Because I have chosen to use a folder that is itself a relocatable user folder, Windows will no longer help me to relocate it again [it cannot cope with multiple user folders being set to the same folder path].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.5&nbsp; Had I chosen to relocate it to D:\Desktop\Dumps or another unique folder then I could change my mind later on and repeat step 3.1 to relocate it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">4&nbsp; Working in the Registry - Preparations</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.1&nbsp; If you have had problems with user folder relocations then you can check in the Registry to find out where the system has set this folder.&nbsp; The same procedure can also be used&nbsp;for your other user folders.</p>
<p>4.2&nbsp; It is also possible to alter the setting directly in the Registry.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4.3&nbsp; Naturally, all the usual warnings about editing the Registry apply - you can destroy your system if you make a mistake.&nbsp; There are guides&nbsp;in the forum about&nbsp;what to do before editing the Registry - search within the Windows section of the forum for
<em>Edit Registry </em>or <em>RegEdit </em>or <em>regedt32</em> [this is the current name of the utility that is used to edit it but most people just refer to it using its old name of RegEdit].</p>
<p>4.4&nbsp; Personally, before editing the Registry, I make a new System image and I check that my Recovery drive or installation disk still works [that it can still boot the computer].&nbsp; If it all went horribly wrong, I could boot from the Recovery drive &amp; restore
 the system image so I could have the system back in its previous state within twenty minutes.</p>
<p>4.5&nbsp; In addition, go to C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em> to check what the <em>YourUserName</em> folder name is.&nbsp; This is the user name you are going to be looking for in the Registry.&nbsp; It is straightforward for local accounts but might not be obvious if the
 user account was initially created as an MSAccount rather than a local one.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">5&nbsp; Working in the Registry - ProfileList</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.1&nbsp; Run %windir%\System32\regedt32.exe [normally at C:\Windows\System32\regedt32.exe] and give it Admin permission to proceed</p>
<p>5.2&nbsp; You will notice that there is a section in the Registry called HKey_Current_User but I will be referring to the section HKey_Users instead.&nbsp; The reason for this is that, as far as the Registry is concerned, the Current user is the Admin who gave permission
 to use RegEdit and not the user who wanted to do so.&nbsp; For this reason, you first need to identify the reference number for your user account [its UserProfile "GUID"].</p>
<p>5.3&nbsp; Find you own user profile at</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</p>
<p>&nbsp;[<em>getting there is just like working down through folders in File explorer but it is much easier to get lost along the way</em>]</p>
<p>5.4&nbsp; The short entries S-1-5-18 to -20 are for system entries.&nbsp; You can look but don't touch.</p>
<p>5.5&nbsp; The longer entries S-1-5-21-nnnnnnnnnnn-1001, S-1-5-21-nnnnnnnnnnn-1002, etc are for the users you created on this computer.&nbsp; You can look but don't touch.</p>
<p>5.6&nbsp; In the left-hand pane, click on each of these longer entries to find out which shows, in its right-hand pane, the entry C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em> and then note the full entry so you can make sure you are looking at the correct section of the Registry
 later on.&nbsp; Notice that it is the last four digits [1001, 1002, etc] that distinguish one user account from another.</p>
<p>5.7&nbsp; To help you get back to&nbsp;the ProfileList later on, click on the RegEdit menu item Favorites then select Add to Favorites.&nbsp; It will suggest the name ProfileList so accept that as it is descriptive of the entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">6&nbsp; Working in the Registry - UserShellFolders</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.1&nbsp; Select the Registry section HKey_Users and work down into your user profile's entry at
</p>
<p>HKey_Users\<em>TheFullEntryNotedInStep5.4Above</em>\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</p>
<p>6.2&nbsp; The section you are in is shown in the Status bar at the bottom of the window.&nbsp; If the Status bar is&nbsp; not shown then click on the View menu and select Status bar.&nbsp; Double-check that the last four digits [1001, 1002, etc] of the
<em>TheFullEntryNotedInStep5.4Above</em> are what you intended.&nbsp; If you made a mistake then get to the right place so you do not accidentally alter another user profile's settings.</p>
<p>6.3&nbsp; Look in the right-hand pane, there should be many entries that make sense.&nbsp; You'll see, for example, the entry called&nbsp;<em>Personal
</em>&amp; it will have the path to your own Documents folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.4&nbsp; The right-hand pane also has some entries that are called by long serial numbers [GUIDs].&nbsp; Look for the one called
</p>
<p>{B7BEDE81-DF94-4682-A7D8-57A52620B86F}</p>
<p>6.5&nbsp; The value shown on that line is the path to your Screenshots folder.&nbsp; It might be, for example, %UserProfile%\Pictures\Screenshots.&nbsp; If you have relocated the Screenshots folder it will show the path you have relocated it to.&nbsp; Mine, for example, is
 D:\Desktop.&nbsp; In fact, several entries in mine show D:\Desktop because I have found it convenient to relocate several user folders to my Desktop.</p>
<p>6.6&nbsp; If you want to change the entry [to relocate the Screenshots folder], then double-click on
</p>
<p>{B7BEDE81-DF94-4682-A7D8-57A52620B86F}</p>
<p>and, in the lower part of the "Edit string" dialog box that appears, type in the full path to the folder you want to use for your screenshots.&nbsp; I might, for example, enter
<em>D:\Desktop</em> or <em>D:\Desktop\Dumps</em>.&nbsp; Then click on OK and have a final check that you have typed in the path correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>6.7&nbsp; Before leaving, add this location to RegEdit's Favorites to help you get back here later on.</p>
<p>6.8&nbsp; Just to help you with any future tasks to do with user folders, look in the left-hand pane several lines up from UserShellFolders and you will see an entry ShellFolders.&nbsp; You might need to work in there in the future.&nbsp; Not all entries from UserShellFolders
 appear in ShellFolders [and vice versa].&nbsp; You might wish to add ShellFolders to RegEdit's Favorites as well.&nbsp; I do not understand the difference between UserShellFolders&nbsp;and ShellFolders; I just work in the one that has the entry that I want to alter.</p>
<p>6.9&nbsp; Leave RegEdit by clicking on the <em>File </em>menu then <em>Exit</em>.</p>
<p>6.10&nbsp;&nbsp;The change&nbsp;should have taken effect immediately [you do not need to reboot].&nbsp; Use File explorer to get to your new Screenshots folder then take a screenshot to make sure it is being saved there correctly.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span><span>Nyasaboy</span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span>Wireless mouse 5000 &amp; wireless keyboard 3000 V2.0 both are compatible with Windows 7 so I would like to know the&nbsp;<strong>exact&nbsp;</strong><strong>error
 message</strong> which you got when you tried to install the driver updates for the wireless mouse &amp; keyboard?</span></p>
<p><span>For now, you may uninstall the drivers for the keyboard &amp; mouse from device manager and reboot the computer which will install the
 default drivers for keyboard &amp; mouse and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In device manager, expand the mouse &amp; keyboard listed in the device list.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right click on the driver &gt; click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Reboot the computer .The drivers will get installed automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also follow this link and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Automatic Updates killing my internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troy hobson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic Updates killing my internet</h2>
                    <p>I live in Australia and for any of you who don't know what that means, the majority of Australians make do with absolutely **** bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since M$ arbitrarily decided that&nbsp;Win 10&nbsp;would download updates when it wants without giving us any say in the matter, I have lost count of the number of times I die or get completely DCd in a game, or am unable to do any browsing or checking emails or,
 generally, do ANYTHING on the net while automatic updates are downloading because it chews up all of the bandwidth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to keep on updates. I work in IT and appreciate the reason for them! But unless something can be done to change the way they're delivered or give us some kind of control over conditions under which it will download (I.e. only when internet connection
 is idle or at a specific time of day) then I will just set our home network as metered and never do them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please someone, anyone, I need some ideas...</p>

<p>and for those who are going to tell you</p>

<p>it's pretty obvious that the windows updates </p>
<p>is part of &nbsp;the core elements of windows 10 spyware you cannot turn off</p>
<p>because if everyone can actually turn that off</p>
<p>then nobody will get their windows updates ((( DUH..!!)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is free</p>
<p>because you are the product</p>
<p>and microsoft is using your computer </p>
<p>and internet connection to make windows 10 works by any means</p>
<p>it's that what you call free? give me a break..!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>bottom line</p>
<p>collecting information to make windows 10 better is fine</p>
<p>but when microsoft begin to make a full exact copy of your hard drive</p>
<p>and using your internet bandwidth in order to spread their windows updates to other users</p>
<p>well that it's not ok anymore..!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>because'';;;;;;;</p>
<p>Microsoft didn't buy me a computer</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't pay for the maintenance of my computer</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't pay for my internet connection&nbsp;</p>
<p>so how it's ok to allow microsoft to acting like&nbsp;</p>
<p>they own things that are not belong to them by any means???</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>it's your computer</p>
<p>it''s your internet connection</p>
<p>it's your problem</p>
<p>if you want to be the microsoft guinea slave pig </p>
<p>then go install THE FREE WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I learn pretty fast that windows 7 is forever...!!</p>
<p>because </p>
<p>IT'S MY DAMN COMPUTER&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT'S MY DAMN INTERNET CONNECTION THAT I PAY EVERY **** MONTH</p>
<p>SO MICROSOFT **** THEMSELVES UP WITH WINDOWS 10</p>
<p>AND WHEN THERE IS NOT MORE COMPUTERS OR ELECTRONICS DEVICES</p>
<p>THAT I CAN BUY WITHOUT DEALING WITH WINDOWS 10 ?!</p>
<p>THEN I DON'T BUY ANYTHING..!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>but that is just my personal opinion</p>
<p>I can't stop the people to choose too be a **** digital slave..!!</p>
<p>if they don't care about themselves&nbsp;</p>
<p>then why I should care about them?</p>
<p>I just let the sheep people eat up their own grass&nbsp;</p>

<p>IE11 in windows 10 is not the same version that is on the Surface RT, even though they are both IE11. Guess that is the difference. TD must expect the newest IE11 that the RT can not support.</p>

            Hi Laura, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Is your laptop connected to the organization domain network?
<br />As the first step, I recommend that you try enabling inheritance for that particular folder and check if it helps.
<br />
<br />- Go to the file location and right click on the folder
<br />- At the bottom of the context menu, tap on Properties
<br />- Tap on the Security tab, then click on Advanced. If you are asked for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
<br />- Now check if the inheritance is disabled. if not, please Enable it.
<br />- Click on ‘Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from the object.’
<br />- Click on Apply and ok.

    <title>Windows 10 has messed up all my file associations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silvanet_1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 has messed up all my file associations</h2>
                    <p>Damn you Microsoft again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is it with Microsoft constantly doing something so completely stupid and unwanted by anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure this was their latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly I click on a file that had an app associated with it and I get a dialog box saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a98d762a-00df-4fef-8511-08e920aa2202?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a98d762a-00df-4fef-8511-08e920aa2202?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case the file is a .jpg. It also happens if I click on .jpeg extension files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite aware that often newly installed programs want to reset file associations, but they're also considerate enough to give you the option to keep your settings intact. Microsoft apparently feels it doesn't owe its customers any such consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have to do this, but I went to Settings and saw that Microsoft has changed default apps as it sees fit without asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Microsoft changed the default app that is supposed to handle .jpg and .jpeg files to its own Photo Viewer, and it says it "Recommends" that app for Windows 10. It's done the same for the default Music Player and Video Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't let you change those settings. You can't select any app you want. On the select an app dialog, it only shows a limited number of apps without any option to browse to the program you had already chosen previously or any program you choose. The
 only option to choose outside the limited selection options is to go to the Microsoft App Store, where of course not every third party program is listed. They simply have shut down your ability to select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you select one of their limited choices (not the "recommended" one), let's say for arguments sake I want to change Photo handler app from Photos to the Windows Photo Viewer which is on the list. I'm doing this from a User account with full control
 Administrator permissions. I click to change. Windows displays no error. It just jumps out of Settings completely. If I go back and open it (again, I shouldn't have to do this), it did not apply the change. It tyrannically sticks with its "recommendation."
 That's not a recommendation at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So next I tried to change the file association by file type. I chose the .jpg extension type. Suggestion to Microsoft: the types list is very long. Why don't you geniuses put a small search dialog box at the top of the list. I swear, what sort of knuckleheads
 do you have leading your programming teams?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The change association selection option dialog is again the limited list one with no option to browse to a program installed on your computer, just as it was with the default app selection options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, mind you, I am connected to the Internet. I am signed in to my Microsoft account as I am drafting this question and doing all these settings change attempts. Choosing the Microsoft Store Apps selection "Look for an app in the store" option then gives
 you the most ridiculous response:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Damn you Microsoft again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is it with Microsoft constantly doing something so completely stupid and unwanted by anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure this was their latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly I click on a file that had an app associated with it and I get a dialog box saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a98d762a-00df-4fef-8511-08e920aa2202?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a98d762a-00df-4fef-8511-08e920aa2202?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case the file is a .jpg. It also happens if I click on .jpeg extension files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite aware that often newly installed programs want to reset file associations, but they're also considerate enough to give you the option to keep your settings intact. Microsoft apparently feels it doesn't owe its customers any such consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shouldn't have to do this, but I went to Settings and saw that Microsoft has changed default apps as it sees fit without asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that Microsoft changed the default app that is supposed to handle .jpg and .jpeg files to its own Photo Viewer, and it says it "Recommends" that app for Windows 10. It's done the same for the default Music Player and Video Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't let you change those settings. You can't select any app you want. On the select an app dialog, it only shows a limited number of apps without any option to browse to the program you had already chosen previously or any program you choose. The
 only option to choose outside the limited selection options is to go to the Microsoft App Store, where of course not every third party program is listed. They simply have shut down your ability to select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you select one of their limited choices (not the "recommended" one), let's say for arguments sake I want to change Photo handler app from Photos to the Windows Photo Viewer which is on the list. I'm doing this from a User account with full control

<h3> justas dirgelas  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I set up a turtle beach headset which has the mic separate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought the Turtle Beach Recon 50X headset, and it's microphone is separate, which is meant to be plugged into the headset itself, therefore isn't connected to the laptop directly. My laptop, like most, has 2 jacks, one for audio, one for the mic.
 When I plug the mic into my headset and the headset into the audio jack, how it's supposed to be, the mic doesn't work.&nbsp; I've tested things multiple times, if I plug the microphone by itself into the mic jack, it works, though there's no point of that as obviously
 that's not how it's meant to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was wondering, is it even possible for me to make this work?</p>

    <title>Scheduled chkdsk scan hangs at &#39;press key within 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> race_condition  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scheduled chkdsk scan hangs at &#39;press key within 1 second&#40;s&#41;&#39;</h2>
                    I have a problem with the chkdsk utility on w7-64bit Professional. <br />
<br />
SYNOPSIS<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Scheduled chkdsk scans of the boot partition fail - the computer hangs right before or at the beginning of the chkdsk run and a hard reboot is required, as well as other steps to circumvent the chkdsk routine. It never finishes; it always hangs at that point;
 it doesn't hang later in the process, for example during step 2/5 or 5/5 of chkdsk.<br />
<br />
This occurs both spontaneously (i.e. chkdsk runs at boot without the user scheduling it) as well as when scheduling a chkdsk run manually from within windows.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
Explorer reported a corrupt file and suggested running chkdsk. On a subsequent reboot chkdsk ran automatically on 'disk c:'.
<br />
<br />
The chkdsk routine counts down for 10 seconds: 'To skip disk checking, press any key within 10 second(s)'. When the countdown reaches 1 second(s), it hangs, i.e. no readout of the five chkdsk steps or any other activity. The computer hangs and I am forced to
 cold boot using the power switch. <br />
<br />
Because the chkdsk ("dirty") flag is still set, the same situation occurs on the next boot attempt. Interrupting the scan by pressing "any key" as instructed only works occasionally or not at all. Eventually, I succeed in reaching the login screen even though
 the chkdsk scan clearly fails every time.<br />
<br />
Once logged in, I checked if the disk was "dirty" or not with the command<br />
<br />
fsutil dirty query c:<br />
<br />
which returned DIRTY<br />
<br />
I then disabled the automatic disk check at boot time using<br />
<br />
chkntfs /x c:<br />
<br />
I then booted into a system recovery disk and ran<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f f:<br />
chkdsk /r f:<br />
<br />
from the command line in the recovery console. (The recovery console assigns the drive letter F: to the boot partition although it is assigned the usual drive letter C: inside windows. I don't know why.) It ran successfully on the boot partition and all other
 partitions on the drive. On the boot partition, it found several unused sectors that were allocated as used, and corrected it.
<br />
<br />
Further checks and startup repair revealed no further issues and I was able to log back in normally. Disk checks invoked on non-boot partitions always work, are logged correctly and return no errors at all.&nbsp; To test the issue with chkdsk hanging when scheduled
 at boot time, I navigated to the boot partition in explorer and scheduled a new chkdsk scan at the next reboot. (This works even when automatic disk checking has been disabled with chkntfs /x c:). And yet again, chkdsk hangs at boot.
<br />
<br />
I have run several chkdsk runs on all drive partitions since, both from within windows as well as from the recovery console, as well as running a diagnostic tool supplied by the HD manufacturer Seagate, with no issues. The problem seems to occur only when chkdsk
 is scheduled, either manually or automatically, to run at boot. I am fairly sure my HD is not failing; this issue has been reported by a number of people here and elsewhere, leading me to believe that it's either an issue with the BIOS, with the chipset driver
 for the HD, or with chkdsk itself.<br />

<br />
"On a computer that is running Windows 7, you use the Chkdsk.exe program to schedule a disk check during the next system startup. However, the disk check does not start correctly. Specifically, you may experience one of the following issues the next time that
 you start the computer:
<ul>
<li>A countdown timer is displayed and you are prompted to press any key if you want to skip the disk check. However, after you press a key, the countdown timer continues. Eventually, the system may stop responding at the count of 1, or start without performing
 the disk check. </li><li>The countdown timer is not displayed and the disk check starts immediately. </li><li>The countdown timer is displayed. However, the disk check starts before the countdown timer reaches zero.
</li></ul>
This problem is more likely to occur on computers that have infrared devices equipped. "<br />

<h2>            How do you make a custom font. A &#63;&#63;&#63;.TTF file.</h2>
                    <p>I tried using the EUDC-Edit and it defaults to E000. ??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm working on creating a language and have 704 characters in the language that i need to draw.</p>
<p>Using Character-Map to select and copy into a edit_box , like notepad is just too time consuming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I want to do the font from scratch, rather then stick my characters into an existing font.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What program do all theses people that make the fonts use???&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
I would suggest posting that question in the MSDN forum, and here is the link. At the bottom you see "community Content" then add, click there to post:<br />

<h2>            Bitlocker Decryption problem&#63; can&#39;t decrypt drives</h2>
                    hi,<br />
i used bitlocker and encrypted 3 drives and when i reinstalled <br />
windows 7 i can't decrypt these drives <br />
and when i go to control panel/bitlocker drive&nbsp;encryption it shows that bit locker is off for these drives and when i click on "turn on bitlocker" it says that"there is not enough space on the disk"<br />
i can access to my data by using "BitLockerToGo.exe" in each drive and i have password and a file to recovery the password
<br />
i just want to know how to decrypt the drives.

            Hi A.RT,<br />
<br />
Is there any free space on your hard drive? If no, then free up some space on your hard drive by removing some unwanted files and check what happens. Before trying this step create a restore point/backup important data on your computer to be on the safer side.<br />
<br />
<strong>Create a restore point<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-restore-point</a>

&nbsp;<br />
If you are still facing the same problem then, check if TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is turned on in your computer.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Turn the TPM On or Off<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>BitLocker is designed to make the encrypted drive unrecoverable without the required authentication. When in recovery mode, the user needs the recovery password or recovery key to unlock the encrypted drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This shows a scenario in unblocking bitlocker data.</div>

<p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error 0x80070017 - 0x90002 is usually caused by registry errors within your operating system, excessive startup entries, unnecessary or redundant program installations. Another possible reason why you're getting the error is that the media installer
 that you've downloaded could be broken. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To address this error, we suggest that you re-download the media creation tool while your antivirus are disabled and follow the troubleshooting steps provided in the discussion
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-manual-upgrade-installation/8cb20cea-4d1c-4c1e-996c-b248493d10e8?tm=1438499976622">

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm working on my son's computer which is an old Compaq with Win XP. I have re-installed XP from the Restore Partition and it is working OK.&nbsp; However, my son never turned on automatic updates and never loaded any updates including the service packs.&nbsp; I want

<div>XP SP3 contains all that was contained in it' predecessors.&nbsp; You do NOT have to install an older Service Pack first.</div>
<div>You DO have to check that what's in the system box (hardware AND XP platform), is up to the job before installing it !!!</div>

<div>.....ps&nbsp; there were several programs, previously installed by the owner, that complained that certain parts of Windows were too old, (I'd "repair installed" using her Home ed.+SP! CD), but, as soon as SP3 was installed, ALL her installed
 application programs were fine - didn't have to reinstall a single one.</div>

<p>It depends on just how old the computer is.&nbsp; Although XP sp3 includes all of the previous updates, you can't install XP directly from the original or "gold" version of XP.&nbsp; You must have at least sp1 or 1a (the KB article below says 1a, but the only difference
 between 1 and 1a is that the latter deleted the Microsoft Virtual Machine aka Microsoft's version of Java).&nbsp; If you have the gold version you can install 1a and then 3 or 2 and then 3.</p>
