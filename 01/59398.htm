<h2>            Cannot import registry backup.ref&#58; Not all data was successfully written to the registry. Some keys are open by the system or other processes, or you have insufficient privileges to perform this actio</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>The history of events is this:-<br />
</p>
<p>1) I upgraded my desktop PC from windows 8.1 to windows 10 on the last day the free upgrade was available in July 2016.<br />
2) Immediately the PC developed instability issues and would repeatedly freeze meaning I had to reboot the PC numerous times a day. After battling this for a couple of weeks or so things seemed to stabilise somewhat<br />
3) The instability issues returned again a few days ago and were becoming progressively worse. On Sunday Nov 20th and Monday 21st the frequency of the freezing meant the PC was pretty much unusable<br />
4) On Monday evening (Nov 21st) and Tues am I tried to tackle the instability issues. I can't see anything of use in the event viewer giving me what appears relevant clues. I next uninstalled some programs I don't use. Then from searching online I tried installing
 a free tool named Ccleaner. I have tried to do some stuff with that to try to tackle this win 10 instability<br />
5) A week ago (Nov 14th) I installed the free version of Viivo to give it a try to see what it's like. Only 5 folders are encrypted. After the actions mentioned in step 4) viivo no longer works today. Specifically:-<br />
<br />
a) when I add the password at the viivo password prompt, the [next] button remains greyed out<br />
b) when I click the [forgot password?] button, I get this message:-</p>
<p>"You have not previously logged in on this device. To keep Viivo secure, passwords are not recoverable from unknown devices. Please recover your password from a device from which you have previously logged in."<br />
<br />
This message is ironic since I have only ever used Viivo with one device (the device on which that message appears).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders of which I encrypted the contents with Viivo are all on Microsoft One Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems pretty obvious I have done something to make Viivo unhappy. In terms of recovery / restore options:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The folders of which I encrypted the contents with Viivo are all on Microsoft One Drive. When I look in One Drive it says there are no previous versions of the files that are now encrypted. I'm not aware of the files that are now unencrypted version being
 available anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I have a windows recovery point from the 18th. However when I look at the contents of the recovery point it just seems to be the programs I mentioned above that I deleted</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I took a back up of the registry with Ccleaner before I did the registry clean with that tool. I have the registry backup file and I have tried to run 'merge' to restore this. I get this message:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot import registry backup.ref: Not all data was successfully written to the registry. Some keys are open by the system or other processes, or you have insufficient privileges to perform this action."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows seems to have stabilised again somewhat (that didn't seem to take effect immediately after any changes I made were implemented). Can anyone suggest please how I overcome that error so I am able to restore the registry back up? Just to be clear in
 case it's unclear; my hope from posting this cry for help is that I'll be able to get past the encrypted file issue (most likely by the registry restore).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is massively appreciated. Regards, Stevie</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is now resolved thanks to the support of Joe Nagel at Viivo. Attempting the uninstall from windows gave me an error. Joe then suggested I run a re-install and select repair from the menu that appeared. I did so and this seems to have worked.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much Joe. Thanks also everyone who responded in this thread.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>When I select a TV show a&nbsp;short description of the show pops up with the option to View Seasons. No other options such as play&nbsp;are available.
</p>
<p>Most of the TV shows do show up in the My Videos section but not all of them. And&nbsp;season 1 of Being Human&nbsp;was there last week but now its gone. Some episodes from the rest of the series are also missing but I don't know if they were ever available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have only just got a new Windows 8 laptop and I can't watch tv shows on that either. So the problem can't be with my Surface tablet and&nbsp;I'm starting to wonder if it is actually possible to watch the TV shows on windows 8 devices at all, is this definitely
 possible?</p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp; I just purchased an ASUS notebook computer with touchscreen and have been trying to watch TV episodes of Season 3 of The Walking Dead, which I purchased on my Xbox 360 console and am able to watch from it, but not this notebook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It lists all four Seasons under my Windows 8.1 Video App, the first three of which I purchased on my Xbox 360, like I already said.&nbsp; (The 4th Season I purchased&nbsp;from Amazon Video, because I&nbsp;truly can watch ANY Amazon Video on anything that has&nbsp;access to
 either the Amazon&nbsp;Video website or one of its various apps designed for various platforms.)&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Windows 8 Video app&nbsp;does not give me any option to watch any of the TV episodes--only to buy them, as if it doesn't recognize any of them.&nbsp; And yes, I am using
 the same User ID across all Microsoft-based devices, apps and websites.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What gives? Any idea?&nbsp; Thanks in advance, if you are able to offer any help.</p>

            I bought The Americans on my Xbox one, and am trying to watch it on my surface pro. I am going through the Xbox tv and movie store. I can see the watch now for episode 4 but when I click it I get an error code (0x10006187) When I select other episodes
 I can watch it no problem. I updated to the most recent version of Microsoft Silverlight. I tried to make sense of this error code but there is no easy search for it on Bing and find myself going into your error code format link that is pretty extensive. I
 don't know why I can watch previous episodes but not the latest after it has aired on tv.

 a call center ready to help you anymore that work is all outsourced to 3rd world countries where a guy is reading the troubleshooting manual to you in Pakistani and nobody is helped whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to troubleshoot a silent sound card on Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to troubleshoot a silent sound card on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I've done all the usual things, checked and rechecked over and over.&nbsp; My sound card (PCI M-Audio Delta Audiophile 2496) was working fine yesterday (at least for output - the input has never worked but that is a common problem apparently).&nbsp; Then suddenly
 there was no sound.&nbsp; Can't remember what I was doing at that moment but I certainly can't think of anything that would interfere.&nbsp; Anyway I was wondering if I can troubleshoot this somehow with a little more depth.&nbsp; Device Manager shows no errors. The driver
 is installed and functioning. Of course its possible it just decided to die.&nbsp; But that is rather unlikely.&nbsp; Its seated properly and its warm to the touch.&nbsp; I don't know what else to do.&nbsp; The next time I restart I'll remove it and try another PCI slot - just
 because I have nothing better to do.

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to know if you're still having an issue with your sound card in Windows 7. In line with this, were there any changes made before this issue occur?
</p>
<p>
</p><div><span>Moreover, you can check Windows Update any time to see if it's found updated drivers for your hardware, especially if you recently installed a new device. Then, you can install the updated drivers. Here's how:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Windows Update by clicking the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button. In the search box, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows
 Update</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the left pane, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Check for updates</strong>. If there are any available updates, click the links to see more information about each update. Windows Update tells you if an update is important, recommended, or optional. Each
 type of update might include drivers.</span></li><li><span>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Select the updates you want to install page</strong>, look for updates for your hardware devices, select the check box for each driver that you want to install, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong>. There might
 not be any available driver updates.</span></li><li><span>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows Update</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>page, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Install update</strong>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
 Windows Update will tell you if the updates were successfully installed.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please post back with the status of the issue. We will be glad to assist you further.</span></span><span>

<p>The troubleshooters Microsoft recommends are totally useless.&nbsp; I must have tried them 50 times (you'd think I'd learn) and they have fixed a single thing.&nbsp; 100% FAIL.&nbsp; Of course I've tried troubleshooting and doing the normal things.&nbsp; That article was so
 basic it was demeaning.&nbsp; Check the wires....wow.....you mean sound is carried by wires?&nbsp; The things I learn on microsoft.com/support!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Having a no sound issue can be related into hardware or software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow.&nbsp; That's a profound statement.&nbsp; I asked you to think.&nbsp; Not copy and paste stuff.&nbsp; So I've done the normal stuff like checking in Control Panel, Sound for everything to look normal, checked the hardware, checked the wires, etc.&nbsp; All the normal things
 that anyone with an IQ over 10 would have thought of.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            1394 firewire device&#40;DV camcorder&#41; does not work</h2>
                    <p>I have attempted to capture video from camcorder via 1394 firewire(two different cameras) the software doesn't seem to recognize that they are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for this question and found it, but the replies seem to be about a Windows 8 not 10 and they also seem to say it will work when clearly it isn't. Also the reply buttons won't allow me to comment on the conversation.</p>

<h2>            UPS can&#39;rt keep new Dell XPS from powering down</h2>
                    I just got a 64bit XPS system with Vista on it and when a storm hits, the UPS can't keep the computer on. It tries to turn on but can't. We tried two different UPS, some huge capacity ones. We updated the BIOS etc... We think it's the power supply, but
 the Dell people won't beleive us. Is there anything else you can think of? I can't run an internal power supply diagnostic from this computre, so am going to buy one tomorrow. Any help or ideas are appreciated.

<h2>            The kid Clicked on Win 10 update, Mom doesn&#39;t want Win 10, how to stop it from installing</h2>
                    The Grandchild clicked on Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 Home. &nbsp;Mother can not learn a new OS and does not want to change from Win 7. &nbsp;She pulled the plug during the update, I restarted the system and it reverted back to Windows 7. &nbsp;When we try to update
 windows 7 we no longer get Windows 7 updates. We get Windows 10 upgrade instead. I don't like this change and plan to go to Apple in when Microbrain stops supporting Win 7. How do I solve this problem without editing the registry.&nbsp;

            <p>I don't have Excel, so my issue is only with KB2539581. I tried the clean boot install without a change in results.
</p>
<p>I did have an issue with the System Configuration Utility though. I receive the message "An Access Denied error was returned while attempting to change a service. You may need to log on using an Administrator account to make the specific changes". I receive
 this when switching to Clean Boot as well as switching back, though my changes appear to be reflected. I added a new administrator User to my PC to see if that would work, but had the same results. Thought I should mention this, in case it is a clue.</p>

            In Windows Update, click on the "History" link. Find the updates that failed to install. There shoud be additional information about the cause of the failure and if you are lucky, links to suggestions on how to fix the problem. If no links, try googling
 for the error. If that doesn't work, please tell us exactly what the errors reported in the history are, the full error text and error code.

<h3> oaklandsideshow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Refusal to restore my points</h2>
                    
<p>On October 26th I purchased 4000 microsoft points from Gamestop. &nbsp;I didn't attempt to purchase anything until December 3rd, at which time I noticed my points were gone. &nbsp;I logged onto Xbox.com and saw that on November 9th or 19th two purchases were made
 in FIFA 12, a game which I don't own nor do I play, which also contained no information when clicked on in the transaction history in "My Account". &nbsp;I had once before used Microsoft's phone support when my console got the "Red Rings" 3 months after purchasing
 but they had my console returned to me in about a month. &nbsp;IT HAS BEEN 47 DAYS SINCE I REPORTED MY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO MICROSOFT. &nbsp;I've called in a few times and requested the status at which I was always refused. &nbsp;The information given is that the fraud
 department has control of my account so the call center can't do anything, just wait for an e-mail response. &nbsp;I actually got an e-mail response on December 20th saying it appeared I regained access to my account, so they are going to stop the investigation.
 &nbsp;After a 2 hour conversation I had another service request ticket and started the waiting game again. &nbsp;Today after I was yelled at by a Microsoft call center employee, her manager informed me that Microsoft will delay my process since I keep calling.</p>

<p>I was on the fence about whether or not I was going to continue to give Microsoft my money, but that was the last straw. &nbsp;My question is this: since I have already made purchases previously on my Xbox account for DLC, how do I sell that information to someone
 who wishes to use Xbox since I will no longer be a customer? &nbsp;I would like to sell the points I purchased (if those are ever returned to me by Microsoft) and the DLC I purchased (as well as my console, my kinect and all my games) so that I am not burdened
 by any Microsoft products. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Attempting to sell an account can/will get the account banned. &nbsp;Read the TOS, you cannot sell an account. &nbsp;Even worse for the person you sell it to, if you later claim your account was stolen they will go in and ban his xbox for purchasing a stolen account.
 &nbsp;Just don't do it, read the console suspension forums for evidence.</p>

<p>I don't want to sell my account, I want to sell the DLC that I purchased legally. &nbsp;Microsoft has taken my money and allowed hackers to do as they please to my purchased points. &nbsp;I no longer wish to do business with Microsoft, so I would like to sell the
 license to use the games I have purchased. I fully realize that Microsoft will not refund neither my points nor my live gold account that I legally purchased from a retail store.</p>

<p>Great. &nbsp;Just when I thought I couldn't get screwed over anymore I find out this. &nbsp;When I sell my console to rid myself of the hell Microsoft has put me thru, will whoever purchases it be able to use those purchased games on that xbox? (assuming they don't

The <i>Modern Warfare 3</i> Files: Exclusive First Details on the Biggest Game of 2011
<div>

</div>
<p><span><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/crecente/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gawkerassets.com%2fassets%2fimages%2fcommenter%2f0%2f3401_32.jpg" />
</a><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/crecente/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Brian Crecente</a> —
</span><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</i> is coming Nov. 8, 2011, <i>Kotaku</i> has learned, delivering with it mammoth battles that engulf a dozen cities around the world including New York, Paris and London.</p>
<p>Multiple sources have shared details of the game's story, art, sounds and game modes with
<i>Kotaku</i>, noting that the game will reshape the landscape of the <i>Call of Duty</i> franchise, bringing an impressive number of eclectic settings, deep multiplayer gaming and a story that ties up nearly all loose ends from previous titles, including the
 final moments of key figures in the series' history.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen the game in action ourselves, we've gone to great lengths to nail down as much as possible the veracity of our sources. We believe that the imagery and chief details are accurate. That doesn't mean things can't change before release,
 but this appears to be a full run down of where Infinity Ward, Sledgehammer Games and Raven Software is on
<i>Modern Warfare 3</i> as they add the final polishing touches.</p>
<p><a href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/05/mw3_president_yuri_volk.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gawkerassets.com%2fassets%2fimages%2f9%2f2011%2f05%2fmedium_mw3_president_yuri_volk.jpg" /></a>The
 game opens moments after the cliffhanger ending of <i>Modern Warfare 2</i> with the U.S. struggling to stave off a surprise Russian attack. The single-player campaign will ping-pong players around the world as they take on the multiple throwaway roles as a
 Russian Federal Protective Services agent, SAS Operative, tank gunner, and AC-130 gunner as well as key characters from previous installments and new recurring characters. The game will feature about 15 missions, kicking off with the invasion of Manhattan
 by a Russian force and wrapping up with a final encounter in Dubai.</p>
<p>The plot, as described, seems to be keeping with developer Infinity Ward's habit of delivering complex, short sequences punctuated by lots of gunfire and scene changes. The game also has players take control of several vehicles, returning gamers to the AC-130
 gunship as a gunner and plopping them down in a tank as part of a U.S. Armored Division.</p>
<p><a href="http://cache.gawkerassets.com/assets/images/9/2011/05/sandman_face_detail_01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gawkerassets.com%2fassets%2fimages%2f9%2f2011%2f05%2fmedium_sandman_face_detail_01.jpg" /></a>The
 single-player campaign, which appears to wrap up most of the unanswered questions and character fates of the first two
<i>Modern Warfare</i> titles, also introduces new characters who appear to be destined for future
<i>Modern Warfare</i> games, especially two Delta Force operatives codenamed "Frost" and "Sandman".</p>
<p>Multiplayer in the game returns with a chunky list of playable maps as well as two types of Spec Ops modes: "Survival" and "Mission".</p>
<p>Activision, the series' publisher, still hasn't officially unveiled any details about the game, though executives have said that a new
<i>Call of Duty</i> game was coming this year. Last year's <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops</i>, developed by Treyarch, sold more than 7 million copies in the first 24 hours and within six weeks reached $1 billion in sales.</p>
<p>We've contacted Activision for comment and will update the story when and if they provide reaction.</p>

<em>Modern Warfare 3</em> Multiplayer Features Battles in Brooklyn, Clash in Mogadishu
<p><span><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/crecente/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gawkerassets.com%2fassets%2fimages%2fcommenter%2f0%2f3401_32.jpg" />
</a><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/crecente/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Brian Crecente</a> —
</span>Packed with 15 levels set in locations around the world, from Manhattan to the catacombs of Paris,
<em>Modern Warfare 3</em>'s near-future campaign looks to be an experience that will top anything seen before in a
<em>Call of Duty</em> game. </p>
<p>Multiplayer, too, seems to be shaping up to be an experience packed with new maps, experiences and ways to game.</p>
<p>Sources tell <em>Kotaku</em> that <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> will have as many as 20 multiplayer maps, though it's unclear if some will be cut before release or perhaps sold later as expansion packs. The game will also include a powerful mix
 of mission-based and survival Special Ops modes. While the mission-based levels will be designed like the ones made popular in
<em>Modern Warfare 2</em>, we're told, the survival maps will have players fighting until they're overcome by increasingly difficult waves of enemies.</p>
<p>While we haven't seen the game in action ourselves, we believe that the imagery is accurate. That doesn't mean things can't change before release.</p>
<p>We've contacted Activision for comment and will update the story when and if they provide reaction.</p>

Where You’ll Go, How You’ll Kill, and Who Will Die in

</a><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/crecente/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Brian Crecente</a> —
</span>We've been gentle so far in our revealing of what we know about <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em>. We've tip-toed through the minefield of spoilers, and tried to reveal only facts anyone would want to know. That ends here.</p>
<p>What follows is a detailed summary of what we understand are the events of <em>
Modern Warfare 3</em> described to us by those in possession of dozens of images from the game, as well as voice over recordings. While we haven't seen the game in action ourselves, we believe that the imagery and this plot description is accurate. That doesn't
 mean things can't change before release. Levels could be altered or completely cut before the game gets into your hands.</p>
<p>While we're still keeping some major, pivotal moments close to our chest—let's just say we know some things we wish we didn't know—we're about to lay the whole story out for you from beginning to end. Don't read on if you want to experience the narrative
 of Activision's bombshell shooter free from spoilers.</p>
<p><strong>There are spoilers here. You've been warned.</strong></p>
<p><em>Modern Warfare 3</em> opens as <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> closed: The United States under siege by Russian forces, ultranationalist Vladimir Makarov on the loose, Captain John "Soap" MacTavish and Captain John Price wounded and on the run with the Russian
 informant known as Nikolai.</p>
<p>Fleeing to a safehouse in Dharmasala, India, the three are attacked by Makarov's men. In this firefight players take on the role of Yuri, a loyalist who works for Nikolai. Their safehouse compromised, the group flee the area in a helicopter.</p>
<p>The game then cuts to Manhattan where Russia is launching an attack on the city from a fleet of ships parked in the Hudson River. (It appears the famous U.S.S. Intrepid may be destroyed.) The U.S. calls in Delta Force to repel the attack. You take on the
 role of Frost, a Delta Force operative under the command of Sandman. Your goal is to take out a jamming tower on top of the New York Stock Exchange to open the area for a U.S. counterattack.</p>
<p>Following the mission, Delta flies out of the city on a Blackhawk, gunning down enemy choppers as they make their way to the harbor where they have to infiltrate and take down a Russian sub which is coordinating the attack.</p>

<p>As the New York missions wrap up the game jumps forward in time half a year, thrusting players into the role of a Russian agent tasked with protecting the president of Russia as he flies to sign a peace treaty with the U.S. The plane is attacked by hijackers
 mid-air who attempt to kidnap the president and his daughter. The daughter manages to escape. The president of Russia in hand, Makarov vows to prevent a peace treaty by getting the launch codes out of the president and launching an attack against the U.S.</p>
<p>The game then returns us to Price, Soap and Yuri, now in Africa in a search for Makarov. They meet with a local South African arms dealer who tells them about a shipment of chemical weapons that Makarov is trying to buy. The group make their way to Sierra
 Leone to secure the weapons from African militia.</p>

<p>Next, players take on the role of an SAS operative who is tasked with stopping a delivery of weapons of mass destruction at a London dockyard. A gun battle ensues, and the agents are chased through the London subway. The mission culminates with a series
 of unmarked trucks exploding in front of the house of Parliament, releasing a deadly chemical agent.</p>
<p>Several other European cities and military bases are hit by similar terrorist attacks backed by Russia, and the death toll rises to the tens of thousands. The series of chemical attacks opens the door for a Russian military blitz strikes across the continent.</p>
<p>Price discovers that the South African arms dealer who tipped them off about the chemical weapons deceived them and travels to Somalia to find the man and interrogate him. Through the arms dealer, Price discovers that Makarov's right hand man, Volk, is hiding
 out in Paris.</p>
<p>The game's attention next shifts to Hamburg, Germany where players take on the role of a U.S. tank gunner fighting to push back a Russian advance backed by armored divisions.</p>

 Hamburg falls, the game shifts us back to the story of Price and his crew. Now in Paris, players control Delta Force operative Frost who, with the help of the French special forces, leads an assault on Volk's location in the underground catacombs of the city.
 Next, players take to the sky supporting Frost's ground movements as a gunner in an AC-130.</p>
<p>After capturing and interrogating Volk, Frost learns that Makarov has a meeting in a Prague hotel. Players control Yuri as he and Soap slip into the Russian-controlled city and set-up an ambush for Makarov in a church bell tower. Makarov somehow catches
 wind of the trap and escapes. Soap, Yuri and Price then have to fight their way out of the city.</p>
<p>Yuri leads the team to one of Makarov's headquarters in the Czech mountains and the group infiltrates the location, looking for clues. They discover that the ultranationlist has the president and is trying to get the codes out of him. Makarov has also discovered
 the location of the Russian president's daughter. The group move out to Berlin to try and prevent her kidnapping. Playing as Frost, gamers must find the daughter and protect her, while making their way through war-torn Berlin. The daughter, however, is captured
 and flown away.</p>
<p>Frost next makes his way to the Kremlin where a task force of operatives attack and free the hostages, but Makarov manages to escape again.</p>
<p>The game's final mission occurs in Dubai, where Yuri, Price and Sandman launch an assault on a heavily guarded hotel, eventually finding Makarov and, yes, finally killing him.</p>
<p>It also appears that the game may also include a post-credits level that features the burning of Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>The stage seems set for a passing of the torch: from player-controlled members of Task Force 141 to the new characters from Delta Force.</p>
<p>We've contacted Activision for comment and will update the story when and if they provide reaction.</p>

What are SEAL Team Six and ‘Black Tuesday’ Doing in
<em>Modern Warfare 3</em>?
<div>
<div>
<p><span><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/StephenTotilo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcache.gawkerassets.com%2fassets%2fimages%2fcommenter%2f50000%2f53606_32.jpg" />
</a><a href="http://kotaku.com/people/StephenTotilo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Stephen Totilo</a> —
</span>A brief audio clip that we believe is a piece of the upcoming <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> refers to SEAL Team Six, the unit widely assumed to have killed Osama Bin Laden in a raid in Pakistan earlier this month.</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense. America's favorite fighting men would have to get mentioned in the 2011 edition of the jingoistic
<em>Modern Warfare</em> series. It is, however, both a likely coincidence and a sign that the new edition of the hottest franchise in video games might again be pushing some provocative buttons before year's end.</p>
<p>The SEAL Team Six reference is barked in an audio file that was part of <a href="http://kotaku.com/5801226/the-modern-warfare-3-files-exclusive-first-details-on-the-biggest-game-of-2011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a larger leak of presumed <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> images, story details and sound clips</a> provided to
<em>Kotaku</em>. Those leaks indicate that <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> involves a near-future war between the United States and Russia, though it focuses on the operations of elite military units spread around the globe. In the audio file,
<a href="http://kotaku.com/5801345/where-youll-go-how-youll-kill-and-who-will-die-in-modern-warfare-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
which can be heard here</a>, a voice of a military operative says: "Seal Team Six was sent in but they lost half their team on infil. We need to strike fast before the Russians can launch a counterattack." The word "infil" is likely shorthand for "infiltration".
 The rough audio file may be part of the game or part of a promotional campaign around it.</p>
<p>The <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> leak we received this week includes a summary of each of the missions in the November-scheduled game. None of them feature SEAL Team Six prominently, but the reference we heard takes on increased relevance given the SEAL's post-Bin-Laden
 elevation to the status of American super-heroes. While we have no indication that the reference was added after the Bin Laden raid—SEAL Team Six, after all,
<a href="http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/SEAL_Team_Six" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">was referenced in the first
<em>Modern Warfare</em></a>—that doesn't mean gamers in November wouldn't interpret it as a tie-in.</p>
<p>With their rise in popularity, the big modern combat first-person shooters that come out each fall have come closer to becoming the topic of mainstream news. They're no longer just mainstream headline material for their sales success but, bit by bit, for
 their content. Two years ago, <em>Modern Warfare 2</em> was <a href="http://kotaku.com/#%215403400/msnbc-talks-terrorism-of-modern-warfare-2-with-totilo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a national news topic</a> because of the inclusion of an optional mission that enabled the player to participate in the massacre of civilians at a Russian airport. Last year,
<em>Medal of Honor</em> made headlines for the <a href="http://kotaku.com/5653024/electronic-arts-buckles-under-pressure-removes-taliban-from-medal-of-honor?skyline=true&amp;s=i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
planned option</a> to let gamers play as the Taliban against NATO troops in a virtual version of the current war in Afghanistan.</p>

 concept art for a London attack in <em>Modern Warfare 3</em></div>
<p><strong>From the scraps of story we've seen about <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, however, the bigger eye-brow raisers may not be any name-checking of the SEALS.</strong> According to leaked information, an early mission involving a near-future Russian military
 assault is tentatively entitled "Black Tuesday" and leads to a battle near the New York Stock Exchange. That could be a reference to the infamous stock market crash of 1929 but would surely also reverberate with New Yorkers who recall the day of the week when
 terrorists attacked the World Trade Center. Another level, set in London, involves terrorist threats, a battle in subway tunnels and a truck bomb in front of the house of Parliament, which sounds like a remix of both perpetrated and foiled terrorist attacks
 on London in the past decade.</p>
<p>Video game proponents can be expected to defend the validity that their favorite medium should and can be as topical as books, movies or any other form of entertainment. Nevertheless, if the plot goes unchanged from what we've been shown this week, it can
 be expected that <em>Modern Warfare</em> will exemplify its modernity not just for the caliber of guns its characters wield but for the anxieties with which it intersects</p>

            Hi Jane
<br />
<br />Woll you be coaching on Skype?
<br />
<br />If so, Skype can nowadays record a Skype session. Since your webcam would be used for Skype, that would be the way to do that
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are not using Skype for the coaching, use the built-in Camera App to record that coaching session - Click your Start Button, type Camera and hit Enter . . .

</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>

<h2>            Fresco Logic FL2000 USB3.0 to HDMI adapter problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Fresco Logic FL2000 USB3.0 to HDMI adapter. It worked good on my previous monitor. Now i bought a new monitor, and there is a problem with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attach the monitor to the computer via the adapter, the computer is able to recognise the monitor (it appears in the display settings), but the monitor remains black. I already tried different HDMI cables, and also another monitor of the same model,
 but the problem stays. Does someone know how to fix this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Toshiba Satellite P50t-A-123 with Windows 10. The new monitor is an ASUS VS247HR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi Vijay, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unluckily, none of these points changed the black screen... I tried point 1 and 2b, both didn't change anything. For 2a, I couldn't click the rollback option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this could help: In the device manager, when I expand the monitors, the non-working monitor is marked as Non-PnP-Monitor. Unluckily, I have no idea what this could mean :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<h3> elizabethmansell  say:</h3>
<h2>            SanDisk Sansa Clip&#43; 4GB Media Player  not recognized in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Just got a new laptop running Windows 8.1 but it will not recognize my Sansa Clip+. It will charge&nbsp;the Clip+&nbsp;but it does not show in Device Manager or Explorer. I have been to
<a href="http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/42/~/sansa-player-not-recognized-by-the-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/42/~/sansa-player-not-recognized-by-the-computer</a>&nbsp;and this is no help. I have tried troubleshooting it but with no success. What else can I do to access my music on the Clip+ and also to download my other music
 to it? All the USB ports work so it's not that.&nbsp; I get no messages when I plug it in but McAfee recognizes and scans it!</p>
<p>P.S. It worked fine on Windows 7</p>

            It is a real USB device, it is&nbsp;a Sansa Clip+ MP3 player. Yes the problem is specific to this device, I don't have anything else that uses a mini USB fitting. All my other devices use different connections, phone, cameras etc.&nbsp;The Clip+&nbsp;worked fine on my
 previous laptop which had win7. I think the problem may be with the female USB connection. I have ordered a new Mini USB to USB cable and will see how that works.&nbsp; It seems to be wobbly/loose (technical term!)&nbsp;when plugged in and&nbsp;I can get it to work if I
 lean the connection on something like a book or a phone. I discovered this just now! Thanks for your info I will see how it goes when the new cable arrives.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            go to settings, then to system settings, then to usb mode, change to Msc.&nbsp; Then windows 8.1 will recognize it.

<br />
<br />Open the Control Panel - Language 
<br />
<br />Click Options on the right hand side of your current language 
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />In options if the appropriate language does not appear, click 'Add input Method' 
<br />
<br />Add the appropriate language if necessary 
<br />Move the appropriate language to the top, if necessary 
<br />
<br />Make that the default language 
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT - delete any language(s) not required 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It!
