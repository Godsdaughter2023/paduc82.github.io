<h2>            Can&#39;t play music with the Music App</h2>
                    I have sound and can play youtube and other items but every song I try to stream from the built in Music app give an error message that says check volume button or drivers 0xc00d11d1 (0x8007007e).&nbsp; I have used device manager and checked that I have all
 current versions of audio drivers.&nbsp; Running windows 8.1 on a Lenovo yoga

            That didn't work.&nbsp; Found the answer on the Lenovo support pages.&nbsp; Eventhough checking for updates on the device tab found none, there were driver updates on Lenovo site that made it work.

<h2>            In a clean install Windows XP will only allow 127.99 GB of a new 1 TB hard drive to be formatted</h2>
                    I have a home-built PC with an Intel D875PBZ motherboard. I originally had two 160 GB drives in a RAID 0 array but one of the drives recently failed. I bought a WD 1 TB SATA drive and attempted to do a clean install of Windows XP Professional. I disabled
 the RAID in the BIOS but setup would only allow a 131069 MB (127.99 GB) partition . I tried changing it to 1048576 MB (1 TB) but setup would always default back to 131069 MB. How can I install XP to the full partition of 1 TB?

            I experienced that type problem where&nbsp;the OS&nbsp;licence disk was the original XP Pro but I had forgotten that the&nbsp;initial version of XP Pro did not recognize&nbsp;more than 128 GB&nbsp;which was fixed with a subsequent service pack - I had forgotten&nbsp;to consider service
 pack issue. With the 160 GB HD I had to clean install to a smaller partion, add service packs then expand the partition&nbsp;using use tool such as Partition Magic (Norton's discontinued this product last year) or clone to a larger disk with the disk manufactures
 software.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Problems Opening and Using Media Player</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 8 and the Media player worked okay, except it would not play MPEG files. I needed to use MPEG files for work (they were supposed to be videos, I was only getting the audio), so I downloaded Windows 8.1, which was supposed to help. Now my Windows
 media player is not working at all. It keeps telling me I need an update to keep using the player, but when I go to where it tells me to update it, it tells me I already got the update. Any ideas? Help would be much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            w32time.exe Time sync issues</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a small network. of machines that need to be compleatly in sync on the time. They are not in a domain, since there are no servers.</p>
<p>We used to run w2k with timeserv.exe which worked fine.&nbsp;Now we have&nbsp;upgraded to winXP pro, and&nbsp;both timeserv and w32time (which I downloaded a few days ago from the MS ftp ) reports either&nbsp;"NetRemoteTOD failed for each Primarysource" or "NetRemoteTOD Failed"</p>
<p>The problem only seems to be there if the time "server" is an XP machine, if we boot up the old w2k the timesync works.</p>
<p>Does anyone out there know what we are having so much trouble with winXP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Bloodrite</p>

<h2>            WindowsSearch.exe missing uncdms.dll error - fixed on my Win7 machine</h2>
                    <p>I'm starting a new discussion on this because for two days I've been searching for a solution and there were tons of opinions offered and nothing seemed to work until I stumbled upon this solution for myself. With luck, this will work for others in my situation
 and they won't have to slog through so many different offerings that, for me at least, did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) I did a clean install of Window 7 on a new virtual machine. All went well and on start-up there was no "WindowsSearch.exe could not start because uncdms.dll is missing" error.</p>
<p>(2) I used Windows Easy Transfer to transfer everything from an XP machine to the new Windows 7 machine.</p>
<p>(3) After the transfer, the "WindowsSearch.exe" error started appearing with every start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This course of events made me think that during file transfer some version of some file having to do with Windows Search had been replaced on the new machine by a file from the old XP machine. This made me think to look for a compatibility problem in the
 replaced file, so I:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs</p>
<p>(2) Under "Programs and Features" there is a link called "Run programs made for previous versions of Windows". I clicked it.</p>
<p>(3) In the "Program Compatibility" window, I clicked "Advanced" then clicked "Run as administrator" then cliicked "Next".</p>
<p>(4) I was presented with a list: "Select the program you are having problems with". I scrolled down to "Windows Search", selected it, then clicked "Next".</p>
<p>(5) In the "Select troubleshooting option" window, I selected "Try recommended settings".</p>
<p>(6) In the next screen, I clicked "Start the program..."</p>
<p>(7) When asked if I wanted "WindowsSearch.exe" to make changes to my disk, I said yes.</p>
<p>(8) When I was returned to "Test compatibility..." screen, I clicked "Next".</p>
<p>(9) On the next screen even though I couldn't test if the problem was fixed (would require restart), I selected "Yes, save these settings for this program".</p>
<p>(10) I closed the Troubleshooter, restarted my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WindowsSearch.exe start-up error message was gone. So far it has not returned.</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t get canon image browser to run on windows 8.1</h2>
                    I can't get Canon Image Browser to open. &nbsp;Running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Tried all the suggestions in the May-August 2013 disscussion, repaired silverlight, re-installed canon software, reset explorer options, and set up a new profile but nothing worked. &nbsp;Canon
 insists the problem is with Silverlight. &nbsp;Has anyone found something that works?&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have issues using the Canon Image Browser software in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I would like to know some more information on this issue to help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Did the software work earlier in Windows 8.1 or WIndows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Do you get any particular error message, when the applications fails to open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>You may try to use the software in safe mode and see if that helps.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Refer to the link to boot in safe mode.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>If you are able to use the software in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot because, p</span>utting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup
 items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.
<span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to <span>perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><span><em>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting</em><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If that doesn't help then, try to install the device software with the instructions mentioned in the link below and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://kbsupport.cusa.canon.com/system/selfservice.controller?CONFIGURATION=1011&amp;PARTITION_ID=1&amp;secureFlag=false&amp;TIMEZONE_OFFSET=&amp;CMD=VIEW_ARTICLE&amp;ARTICLE_ID=63360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ImageBrowser EX Does not

<p><em><strong>Note: </strong>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software
 can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</em></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;Nothing works. &nbsp;New camera so no prior history with software. Sometimes I get the" check silverlight message", but I've fixed and reinstalled several times. &nbsp;In safe mode I got the error message "Image Browser.exe Application Error
 &nbsp;The exception unknown softwate exception (oxe0434352) occured in application at location ox7771d4d"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft list the Image browser as compatible with win8.1. &nbsp;Canon &nbsp;support says it's a silverlight issue and said talk to Microsoft. &nbsp;It's not as if I'm trying to use &nbsp;software from some fly-by night companies. &nbsp;Based on the posts on your comunity I'm not
 the only one experiencing this issue. &nbsp;What do I do now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Tried this for the second time. &nbsp;Browser exe downloads but still won't open. Also get an error message &nbsp;when download complets somethin like &nbsp;"windows can't find file location". As I mentioned earlier Canon told me to contace microsoft to see why silverlight
 isn't working properly. I've fixed &nbsp;Silverlight and &nbsp;reinstalled 4-5 times so I don't think that's the problem.</p>

<p>The file checker came back with the message 'found corrupt files but was unable to fix some. note that logging is currently not supported by offline serving scenarios" I have no other copies of win, 8.1, it was installed on my computer which is only about
 7 months old, so I have nothing to replace the file with. Also the instruction to find the corupt file are a bit difficult for me to read as well as follow. &nbsp;Any suggestins on where I go from here?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is anyone else having problems opening the MS Solitaire Collection at - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is anyone else having problems opening the MS Solitaire Collection at the moment&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I clicked on the taskbar icon just now, the egg timer came on but nothing happened. The same thing happens when I go via Start &gt; Apps. Every other icon and Apps works&nbsp;- it's only the Solitaire Collection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, two strange things happened earlier - first, a reply to my previous&nbsp;reply in a thread was shown as replying to a User who wasn't even in that Thread. I had to delete my reply and repost it - when I hit Submit, I got this alert:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As it might be a problem with the site, rather than the Game, I've no idea where I should post this so it probably needs to be moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And&nbsp; now the latest strange thing - this is the second time today that the first Category below has defaulted to Insider Program!</p>

 Thread!&lt;&lt;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem has disappeared - I can now&nbsp;access Solitaire. Perhaps the traffic on that route has been so heavy (with it end-of-month, when paying customers rush to complete and win) that&nbsp;MS closed up free play?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I thought that I had spoken to soon because I got the error message shown below. I clicked on retry several times and now have access. (I shouldn't have to log into X-Box as this Free App.)</p>

    <title>Account Hacked&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curlierimp61816  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account Hacked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>About 6 days ago I received an email saying that I had added another e-mail address (<strong>[mod removed]</strong>) to my Windows Live Account, which I had not. &nbsp;I clicked the link saying that I had not authorized that e-mail address and I didn't think
 anything about it. &nbsp;Today I turn on my 360 and I get the error message that "Your Xbox LIVE membership information isn’t valid. Please use a profile that contains a valid membership or recover your profile from Xbox LIVE."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I go through the steps to reset my password, which seems successful, and try to login. &nbsp;I login, but I have a different gamertag, CurlierImps61816, instead of Bags5484. &nbsp;I'm trying not to freak out and am telling myself that it's just an issue with the xbox
 live status having a service alert. &nbsp;Anyone have any thoughts? &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was compromised. &nbsp;$125 was charged to my account. &nbsp;A very nice lady on the support line helped me get everything straightened out, unfortunetly it will take 3-4 weeks to get things fully resolved.</p>

<p>I feel your pain. I was recently hacked yesterday (though luckily, did not get a name change), and was charged $75 in MS points. When I called customer service, a nice guy helped me out and explained that they could do the investigation (which takes 3-4
 weeks) but that it also meant I'd be locked out of my account during that time frame.</p>
<p>I decided to just eat the charge (I need the Netflix with no cable at the hosue), but have my credit card removed. I then noticed I had to recover my gamertag as well, which I did, then watched an episode of a TV show on Netflix. After the episode was over,
 I encountered the same error, so I recovered my tag once again, then changed the password.</p>
<p>Then today, everything has been working great, but I noticed my MS point total being much lower than it was. Checked my download history and discovered 5 different XBLA titles downloaded, obviously none to my console. Called back just a bit ago, decided
 to go through the investigation.</p>
<p>I'm a bit disheartened over the security breach, and probably will never purchase anything digitally over XBL again with a credit card, but I do have to say the customer service people are very well tempered, nice, and have understanding attitudes.</p>

<p>I actually had this issue yesterday, on this very account. At 5am, someone hacked my account, bought exactly $125 in points, then drained all of them on random games. Then the hacker proceeded to change the live email to one he has made. The problem is he
 failed to remove my primary email (a gmail account protected by 2-step verification) as the secondary email for the account. Because of this, I used the "I did not approve this" link, and stole his email, and moved my xbox live account to a brand new, secure
 email that I created.</p>
<p>It's been a big hassle, but Xbox support reccommended that I do NOT go through with an investigation since I informed them my bank was on it as well, and it would be much faster to just let my bank contact Microsoft, rather then the other way around.</p>
<p>I don't know why Xbox Support gets such a bad rep for phone support, and the whole 21 day thing. It was really quite good for me.</p>

<p>If your account is compromised, you need to call up phone support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>) and ask to open an Unauthorized Access Investigation (UAI) and don't get off the
 phone until you do. This will lock your account during the investigation, and the process can take upwards of 30 days to resolve, sometimes longer in more complex cases.

<p>I think everyone is aware of this, and that stock answer, which isn't a false answer, but just an answer everyone uses to avoid addressing the bigger problem. The bigger question is why multiple accounts over the past week are getting broken into. This has
 nothing to do with LulzSec hack of a bunch of random accounts, because I was not on that list, and got broken into anyways.</p>
<p>I've read over forums for the past couple of days where users are getting points cards bought on their account, immediately spent, and if they're unlucky, their account ID transferred.</p>
<p>Go ahead, look up on twitter for "xbox live hacked", and look at the most resent results. Do the same thing on google for stuff posted this week. It's not a widespread attack, but a growing one.</p>

<p>I'd say this was a lone gun picking off what he can get rather than some mass attack. There's been a few originating from that e-mail provider going by the posts on here but not mass attack numbers.

<p>Same exact thing happened to me. My account has been under an investigation for a week and it will take around 25 days to get resolved. They charged $125 worth of points to my account. Just make sure you contact customer support and HEAR THEM SAY that they

<h2>            Windows Explorer - Modified Date replaces the File Names</h2>
                    
<p>In Vista Home 64 in the right hand pane of Windows Explorer, instead of filenames, i now only see the dates of the files and folders where the filenames usually appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also see this on the desktop. I have the icon for the file or folder and under it, I see the Modified Date instead of the file name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Control Panel, now many of hte applets will no longer launch. For instance, I cannot launch system and Maintenance to see my windows activation number to contact support.</p>

<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read the above for a very&nbsp;good Graphical&nbsp;display of how to go back more than 5 days in System Restore Points by ticking the correct Box.</span></p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>“How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker (SFC.exe) program generates in Windows Vista”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

<p>I tried the steps you suggested. They didn't work.</p>
<p>I'm now doing a registry compare against a good vista install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth spending a few days trying to figure this out as it will take well over a week to reinstall all of my development software if I have to reinstall the OS.</p>

<p>Were you ever able to get your file names back?&nbsp; I am having the exact same problem.&nbsp; On Sunday I was trying to create an additional folder under Pictures and then all of my file names disappeared.&nbsp; On the left hand side, I can still see the folder names,
 but the files now are either blank or just have the date modified underneath them.&nbsp; They are appearing the same way on my desktop.&nbsp; Any help you can provide I would greatly appreciate!!</p>

<br />MS is "trendy", "fashionable", hence the "new and improved" color pallet (I'm no fan of the bland colors they currently foist on us). It is also the reason they are emphasizing cutsie emoji.

<br />If you don't get a good answer you should submit "feedback" to MS asking for the change you want.  It won't come soon, but at least they will be aware of the issue

    <title>printer port won&#39;t recognize hasp key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greg dever 53  say:</h3>
<h2>            printer port won&#39;t recognize hasp key</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a remanufactured dell computer with windows xp sp3&nbsp;to replace one running xp sp3 that had overheating issues.&nbsp; I am running an older&nbsp;software program (Amiable Technologies FlexiSign Pro 7.5V2) that requires a hasp key on a parallel
 port.&nbsp; I never had&nbsp; issues with old computer recognizing the hasp key but&nbsp;when I try to use this software on new computer it doesnt recognize the hasp.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think it may be due to the fact that my new computer printer port is configured&nbsp;as ecp instead of lpt
 port.&nbsp; Is it possible that this could be my problem and can I change the port to older style? Any guidance is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            If the problem really is that the parallel port is in ECP mode, you may be able to change to EPP mode in the BIOS.&nbsp; Restart the computer and watch very carefully at the beginning of the boot sequence for the message that tells you which key to press to
 enter the BIOS (change system settings or the like).&nbsp; Then reboot again and press the key while the message is showing.&nbsp; You'll only have a few seconds.

<h2>            XboxOne console will not be distributed to small businesses... It&#38;&#35;39&#59;s just wrong.</h2>
                    
<p>VIA Facebook.com: The Monitor Game Emporium, Tuscaloosa, AL</p>
<p><span>Sometimes being a small business in a big business world is a tough thing to be. Just yesterday, Sony AND Microsoft lowered the boom on small business and refused all orders for Playstation 4 and XBox One hardware from all BUT the biggest five companies
 in the United States until 2014 at the earliest. It is my pleasure to proudly state that all pre orders made to this point at The Monitor WILL BE FULFILLED AND HONORED! I just wish I could say that this is being done with the help of the manufacturers and
 vendors instead of in spite of them. We will lose money on each console, but our commitment to customers who are loyal to us enough to choose to get these new systems here are THE top priority at the Monitor. Unfortunately, further pre orders will not be accepted.</span><br />
<br />
<span>It is impossible to say exactly why the decision to close the door on locally owned businesses came down. I'd like to think that it is something other than just not wanting to do business with small business, but even a supply crunch could be handled
<span>It is impossible to say exactly why the decision to close the door on locally owned businesses came down. I'd like to think that it is something other than just not wanting to do business with small business, but even a supply crunch could be handled
 more fairly than this has been handled. One would think that if only 20% of orders could be filled, then everyone would get cut to 20% of their order. Instead, manufacturers have decided to allow big corporations exclusive rights to their product. It was Microsoft
 themselves who sent us to our current vendor specifically to acquire XBox Ones. Now we have made arrangements to fill ALL pre orders, at a cost to our store. But seeing these manufacturers unwillingness to do business with small business is very sad, but it
 won't stop us from pleasing you, our customers, the most important part of our company.</span></p>
<p>THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING XBOX. I PERSONALLY WILL NOT BE BUYING THE NEW XBOX BECAUSE THIS IS BIAS AND A STUPID DECISION ON YOUR PART. NOT EVERYONE IS OWNED BY BIG COMPANIES AND SOME OF CHOOSE TO SUPPORT LOCAL GAME SHOPS AND NOT BUY INTO PLACES
 LIKE WALMART. I AM GOING TO SEND THIS TO EVERY BIG MEDIA COMPANY I KNOW IS HONOR OF YOUR BIG DECISION.</p>
<p>SINCERELY, ONE DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER,</p>

<p>Then they shouldn't be sending them to vendors who promise lies that cost them money. This is the Microsoft forum right? Sony is all in the post and if you could read and comprehend well then you would see that. I do not even play Playstation just like many
 other Xbox users. The obvious thing to do would be to tell the businesses before they invest in something not true. You are missing the entirety of the post.</p>

 Had the vendor told them they couldn't make pre-orders and shipping wouldn't happen till 2014, they would have announced that they could not take pre orders. IT'S COMMON SENSE!

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Or the small business made preorders available at their store on a LIMITED (at release) item, that they were not guaranteed to have. It is NOT rare that some companies make sure as many possible units are available on a limited number release to the larger
 stores that quite frank;y is the lions share of sales percentages of their respective item. Wouldnt be the first time that a smaller business guaranteed something they themselves had no guarantee on.</p>

<p>These small independent game stores are run by people like you and me, guys who have made their living out of their love for gaming.</p>
<p>Big corporations such as Walmart, Best Buy and Target are run by corporate drones who underpay their employees and only care about generating maximum profit.</p>
<p>Who would you rather support with your purchases?</p>

<h2>            Startup repair could not detect a problem</h2>
                    I have a dual boot of Windows 7 and Ubuntu. I recently resized the Windows Partition, adding 200 gigs to it. I ran the startup repair two times. On the third time it said "startup repair could not detect a problem." But then I booted up to Windows and
 it said there's still a problem and I need to run startup repair. When I do that, it tells me again "Startup repair could not detect a problem." What can I do?

<h2>            Are more than one HomeGroup or WorkGroup possible using Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From an Earlier Post:</span>My Original Inquiry:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Most Home Users do not realize that their Internet Service Provider does in fact provide two IP addresses. With the Internet Service Provider's Modem, the Home User connecting 2 Routers, 2 Routers connected
 to the Modem by a Switch, and the Home User will be able to connect to 2 different IP addresses with the use of the same or 2 different computers (one computer connected to one Router and a second Computer connected to the 2nd Router). I have been connecting
 to two IP addresses through the same Modem for many years. However, a note for whoever might try to do what I just explained, not any Switch will work. I succeeded with connecting to 2 IP addresses after trying a 3rd Switch. The Switch that I am currently
 using is D-Link, model DGS-105. Anyway, now for my question: I have a HomeGroup set up on one router. Does anyone have any idea about how a second HomeGroup can be set up from the same Windows 10 Tablet by using the other Network through the 2nd Router? I
 currently have two HomeGroups being used by many computers (10 tablets on one HomeGroup, and another HomeGroup with 5 Tablets/Notebooks). Each HomeGroup uses its own Network. Question Repeated:&nbsp;Does anyone have any idea about how a second HomeGroup can be
 set up from the same Windows 10 Tablet by using the other Network through the 2nd Router?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Response from someone:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If Windows detects an&nbsp;</span><strong>existing Homegroup</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">, it won't give you the option to create another one. It will only allow
 you to join the existing Homegroup. But, your Windows computer or device can be part of&nbsp;</span><strong>more than one Homegroup</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">, if it gets connected to multiple networks.</span></p>
<p>My Personal Endeavor by Creating 2 Networks (one wireless and one on&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">RJ-45 Ethernet Port):</span></p>
<p>Yes, that makes sense. Any ideas about how I can get Windows 10 to connect to 2 different networks at the same time. As I was just now replying, an idea just came to mind. Turn off or disconnect one of the routers to see if Windows will not see
 the one network that I am wanting to hide, thereby preventing Windows from seeing the HomeGroup/WorkGroup which is already set up. Get back in a little while!</p>
<p>OK, I'm back... On my tablet where I would like to have two Groups, it would be more difficult because I only have wireless LAN. I am able to have 2 networks active on my notebooks/laptops if it has an advanced setting in my Wireless Network which
 would be in Manage, Properties, advanced tab, "Disable upon wired(cable) connect". I have&nbsp;two Windows 7 Laptops with such capability. However, there is no way that I would go lugging a 15" laptop around to use the way planned, as a center for a Two Group Central.
 Anyway, I tried to create a second group on the Laptop capable of having 2 networks active at the same time. Lets say the capable Laptop has a current HomeGroup on Network #1 by way of a Wireless Connection. I set the advanced settings for the Wireless Connection
 so that it will not become disabled when I connect to the RJ-45 Ethernet Port. I connected the cable to Router #2 and I had 2 networks active at the same time on one laptop. I opened the Network and Sharing Center, to HomeGroup and it would have been necessary
 for me to leave the existing HomeGroup before I would be able to create another HomeGroup. From the Network and Sharing Center, I used the selection through "Set up a new connection or network". I further selected "Set up a new network" whereas a new interface
 appears stating that it would take about 90 seconds to find the network(network #2, Ethernet Port) where a new network&nbsp;might be able to&nbsp;be created. Well longer than 5 minutes passed without any progress. I guess it just cannot be done. &nbsp;Does anyone know how?</p>

    <title>Where can I find the official codecs for Movie Maker&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where can I find the official codecs for Movie Maker&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: movie maker wmv plugin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me where I can find the official codecs for movie maker?<br />
<br />
I'm trying to import a .wmv file, but get this error:<br />
001.wmv could not be imported. The required codec was not downloaded automatically because the Download codecs automatically check box is not selected in the Options dialog box.<br />
I selected the check box and was able to import the file, but since I did that movie maker crashed regularly, and my computer went to a crawl.<br />
After running my security software, I discovered my computer had been infiltrated. I removed the threats, but found my computer did not perform as it did before, and movie maker continued to crash. So I started with a fresh OS. I don't want to go through the
 same drama, by allowing the automatic codec download. So I would like to know where I can download the genuine codecs.<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you're having crashing issues in Movie Maker after importing a .wmv file and that you want to know where to download the codecs. Please note that .wmv files should open without any codec issues because it

 help you. In addition, can you also provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you play the .mov file on Windows Media Player?</li><li>Does it happen on other .mov files?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your reply.</p>

    <title>Active Directory User Attribute employeeType Windows Server 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Active Directory User Attribute employeeType Windows Server 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hello together,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have one short question, I haven't found any more information on the Microsoft Sites, is the User Attribute "employeeType" also still available in Active Directory with functional level Windows Server 2016?</p>
<p>The only two references I found at Microsoft sites were these:</p>
<p>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc221510.aspx</p>
<p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ADSchema/a-employeetype</p>
<p>But none of these refer to Windows Server 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>
