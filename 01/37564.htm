            Hi,<br />
I tried changing themes and no result.Maybe I didn't explain good.When I open something,for example my documents and I want to move that from left to right,I click on window and move but only frame is moving,original window stays where it was originally until
 I let go click on the mouse.I would like to be when I click on the window to move it,everything to start moving with cursor.<br />

            Its not the Aero. I think I can explain what&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7ffac6a8-ce72-46ae-b396-304b2a322301">nikolatarlac</a>&nbsp;is trying
 to explain to you. When an application is not maximized and the window it moved around the desktop with the mouse only the Border moves and the content shown stays in the original place until he lets go of the mouse.

 available it was coming up on the taskbar so i upgraded it to windows 10, and yet again no problems but that has been many months aswell. But then i recieved the error message so read up about it and because i havent actually got a disk for windows 10 it was
 an upgrade i downloaded of the windows website a recovery repair windows file to make a bootable type usb and now i have that in the laptop and its now saying "repairing disk errors this may take over an hour to complete". Ive just let it run and do its thing

<h2>            Tried to save it to my documents and now I can not find it anywhere</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has an icon for a file folder called "Documents". I keep scanned documents, pictures and data downloaded from the internet in that file. There are about 150 items in that file that I use constantly and mostly as attachments to e mails. I now have
 windows 10 and guess what??? I can not get that file to work anymore. The folder comes up with a header that looks like&nbsp;the start of a new word document. The individual files are still there but they will not open. You can not Delete a file to replace it no
 matter how many times you highlight the file or click on the Delete square on the header. You can not get any of the files to attach to an e mail.&nbsp;I need to know if there is a solution for this problem; at&nbsp;least to get the individual files to print. It appears
 that the complete folder is setting in&nbsp;limbo inside my laptop and&nbsp;has refused to work because I switched to Windows 10. Has anyone run into this problem and what have you done to be able to use your desktop folders as with windows 7 and 8.1? I scanned a new
 document earlier today and tried to save it to my documents and now I can not find it anywhere. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Re: &nbsp;your scanned document you tried to save. &nbsp; Did you give it a name? &nbsp; If so, put that exact name in the search box at the bottom left of the windows taskbar, and if it saved, then it will give you its location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;your inoperational Document's folder files. &nbsp;Take one of those files - right click on it - click on properties - what file extension do you see on it (e.g. doc, docx, etc)? &nbsp; If that is so, can you open a blank Word document (maybe from Start Menu -
 Microsoft Office - Microsoft Word)? &nbsp; Does it open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not there or a blank document won't open, then you will need to check in Program Files to find out the status of your Office Program (Program Files - Microsoft Office - Office14).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of your other Office programs open (viz. Excel, Powerpoint, Outlook)? &nbsp; You will need to double click on its .exe file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility: &nbsp;right click on a problem file and click on New. &nbsp; Does a new untitled document with similar contents open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope something helps.</p>

            <p>Hi, Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>This started back in August after my automatic upgrade to Windows 10. I have been able to get by so far because I had some hard copies that I could Fax. My "Documents" screen now comes up as "File Explorer" and has some 18 file types, some of which I have
 no idea what they are or do. I did get a adobe acrobat .doc to create a new untitled file but it would not attach to a email. I scanned a new document (JPEG) and sent it to the new "File&nbsp;Explorer" folder but its not in that folder or the scanned documents
 folder. I have no idea where it went unless its in limbo due to a compatibility issue. I put the file name in the "Search Windows" box at the bottom of the screen but nothing came up. I do not use excel or powerpoint and my Outlook.com takes from 3 - 5 Min.
 to open. I opened word but could not find a way to import a file from "File Explorer" onto a blank page.&nbsp;I am not sure how to get the File Explorer screen to attach to this reply without it sending all of my files with it.</p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions? I would appreciate the help.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Out of interest, what items come up in File Explorer? &nbsp; Is your Documents folder one of them or has it replaced your File Explorer, as it seems from your last post? &nbsp; Type in File Explorer in your Search box and there should be Desktop App to click on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the file types that you see in File Explorer(Documents) &amp; in which folder are they residing? &nbsp; Re: &nbsp;attaching a .doc file (adobe created) to email. &nbsp; I assume that you are using the attach file facility from the email program itself and not trying
 to send it from the document. &nbsp; If it is easier, try saving it to Desktop &amp; give it a name: &nbsp;it will be easier to find and point other programs (e.g. email) to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time, do a scan (take note of its name, maybe the default name will be 'scan.jpg' and send it to Desktop, for reasons stated above. &nbsp; If you can't find it, again do another search using that name. &nbsp;If documents, pictures, etc. are saved or being sent,
 they must be somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You managed to open Word, presumably from its .exe file, so that's progress. &nbsp; Now are you able to open any of those files in Documents, or does it ask you "what program do you want to use to open it" (or similar words). &nbsp; It's hard to suggest unless we
 know what file extensions are involved here. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All for now.</p>

            <p>Thanks again for the reply.</p>
<p>I think we are getting some where with this problem. If I go into File Explorer I get a window with a picture&nbsp;of a computer labeled "This P C" along with other items on the left side of the window.&nbsp;Under the PC is a list, one of which is titled "Documents".
 If I click on that I get columns titled Name: Date: Type. All of the items listed end with Type: file folder. If I click on a Item ; in the File Explorer header the "move to" "copy to" "open" "property's" buttons become active, but not the delete. The move
 to and copy to both have the same drop down listings: Sky Drive, Documents. Pictures, Scanned Documents, etc. If you click on any of these items to move or copy&nbsp;you get a duplicate file with a file type extension: file, that has nothing in it and you can not
 get it to delete. For now I know "My Documents" are still there and the new item I scanned is there but I don't seem to be able to do anything with them. (see my email following)</p>
<p>For my Email "Outlook Mail (Preview)" for a new email with an attachment. When I click on attachment&nbsp; I get 2 new windows side by side. The first window has listed inside the window "OneDrive - personal" and below that "Files" and then "Computer". The other
 windows has: "Files", OneDrive - personal &gt; Files with 3 windows under that: Documents 5, Email attachments 1, Pictures and 2 faded boxes underneath with&nbsp;next and cancel. If you click on any of these you get an error message which reads: There was an error
 opening this document. This document can not be found.</p>
<p>When you click on the&nbsp;"Open" active button in Documents a drop down screen opens with: How do you want to attach this this file?, followed by "Folders can't be added as attachments. Try to share using OneDrive" (I have no idea what OneDrive is and have never
 used it). Then there is a faded box to check for: Attach as a OneDrive file with a line underneath which reads: Anyone can see the latest changes and work together in real time. I have no need to do this and my files&nbsp;are between me and the person I am communicating
 with. There is also a faded box to click for: "Attach as a copy" with a box underneath that reads: Recipients get a copy to review; nothing happens when you click on this box. You also get a box to check for; Remember my choice for files from OneDrive.</p>
<p>Also to answer a prior question about the file types that are showing in File Explorer; they are: file folder, JPEG Image, Compressed zipp, File, office open xml Doc, Configuration, Adobe Acrobat Doc, Docx, Tiff, JPG, google drive.pdf, ZIP, pdf, HTML Document,
 Shortcut, Data Base File, PNG Image, Configuration Setting. As I said before I have no idea what some of these are.</p>
<p>Right now I am in panic mode related to these documents and attachments to emails. I&nbsp;am spending a lot of time on this and getting no work accomplished.&nbsp;I would also&nbsp;like to know if I can get these documents into a&nbsp;Google Chrome Program&nbsp;and start using their
 email instead of this Microsoft outlook program as it appears to have compatibility issues for attachments. I appreciate the help, we know the files are still here but there does not seem to be a way to get them&nbsp;to attach to a email.&nbsp;Additional help will be
 appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>As a follow up to my prior reply: when the open button is active in the file explorer tab and you have identified a file, a drop down comes up with which default program do you want to use to open that file and a list; Internet Explorer, Notepad, Microsoft
 word etc. This does not seem to match the file extensions for the files I have in my Documents. I don't understand this unless Microsoft is trying to force the use of a totally new system that is not compatible with any thing else from prior Windows systems
 that a person has on their computer.&nbsp;Just for your information I tried to call the local Microsoft store to set up an appointment to have someone take a look at why I was having so many problems with my computer. A person answered the phone and after some
 discussion it came down to me needing to buying a maintenance program. I asked who I was talking to and found out it was a person in India. I told them I was trying to contact the local Microsoft store and was told they could provide me with that number. Guess
 what? They gave me the same number that&nbsp;I called that was answered in India. LOL&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Quite a dilemma you're in! &nbsp; To state, I'm not at all familiar with this Outlook Mail (Preview) program, so can't comment on its appearance or functions. &nbsp; I use Windows Live Mail and have not been able to fault it, even when using it with Win7. &nbsp; At a later
 stage, you could try that, or even Microsoft Outlook, which is a part of Microsoft Office suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the file extensions you see, if you have a Word document that is not opening, it should have a .doc or .docx extension. &nbsp; Right click on it and you should get Open with..... &nbsp; Click on Open with, do you get an option to open with Microsoft Word
 or Word Pad? &nbsp; Does selecting that option do anything? &nbsp; If it's doing nothing, then once again right click on the file name and select Properties. &nbsp; You should see: &nbsp;the File name, Opens with (with an option to change this), its location, file size, plus
 other information. &nbsp; Are these details evident? &nbsp; What I am trying to ascertain here is why your document(s) that have been migrated into Win10, fails to now open, indeed, you can't even find others when you search for them through your Search box. &nbsp; So if
 you can see the file name in Properties and its size and location, it must be there, and therefore should open with the applicable program (i.e. Word documents with Microsoft Word or Word Pad, PDF documents with Adobe Reader, music files with (maybe) Windows
 Media Player or another program you're using for this, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;the absence of an active Delete option in File Explorer header is concerning. &nbsp;Normally, it would indicate that a file is not there or because of it's important nature, it cannot be deleted. &nbsp; So finding out the information in your file properties might
 give us a clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp; seeing the option of Sky drive in your File Explorer header (under Move/Copy to). &nbsp; Have you at any time, maybe inadvertently, uploaded your files to Sky drive, which apparently is now called, One Drive? &nbsp; You could check it out here: https://onedrive.live.com/
 &nbsp; or click on One Drive in your Start Menu and log in. &nbsp; One Drive is a facility whereby one can upload files into the 'Cloud' for storing, thereby saving on disk space. &nbsp; An explanation is here: http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/onedrive-will-work-windows-10/
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope something here helps you to get you out of your predicament.</p>

            <p>Thanks, As I get a solution to get around one problem all I find is another problem. Going forward with this new email several things come up: It does not save a draft as you type; The body of the email does not scroll and Emoji's do not move to where you
 want to place them; The sent items tab is empty; the contacts are gone&nbsp;and God only knows what else. I&nbsp;have sent out several&nbsp;basic emails&nbsp;but I have not received any replies. As you type a email&nbsp;occasionally a Windows Media Player window pops up with a message:
 "A error&nbsp;occurred applying attributes to the file. The system cannot find the files specified." (1)&gt;&nbsp;That window will not close unless you Ctrl-Alt-Del. Then you start all over. As for the attachments when you open a file to move it to the email a window opens
 that has a drop down and a question of which&nbsp;app do you want to use to open the file and a box to set that app as the default. the app's are: Windows Live Photo Gallery, Photos, Clean.fi, Notepad, Paint, Windows Live Movie Maker, Windows Photo Viewer, Look
 for an App in the Store, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Word Viewer, Provisioning Package Runtime Processing Tool, Windows Media Player, Word Pad, DVD Maker, MS Build and Realtek. The MS Outlook.com opens my Hotmail account. &lt;(1)&nbsp;When you
 click on the Windows Media Player in the email error&nbsp;message it opens the MY PICTURES&nbsp;folder. Also I have never used Sky Drive. I talked to the computer Tech. at Office Depot today and he said they could extract "My Documents" folders and files and create
 a separate folder on my desktop that I could add to and edit or delete and attach to emails. They also suggested I switch to Firefox to bypass these problems I am having. I downloaded that program, typed in Outlook.com and my Hotmail account came right up
 as it looked prior to Windows 10. I have been waiting up to 10 minutes for my emails to load and the wait time seems to be increasing. I would appreciate your comments regarding this solution.</p>

            <p>Maybe a good move to take up Office Depot's offer to do that transfer - in so doing he may also find out why your documents are not opening. &nbsp; It won't be much good to you if files are transferred to a new desktop folder and they still do not open, so hopefully
 he may get to the root of your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say "going forward with this new email...", which program are you referring to? &nbsp; If you're referring to Windows Live Mail, then it doesn't save messages while you type - you need to physically save it (i.e. Cntrl + S or via its Menu Bar under File).
 &nbsp; You will need to also check in File - Options - Mail - Send (make sure that 'Save copy of sent messages in Sent Items folder' is ticked, as well as 'Include messages in reply'. &nbsp; Your missing Contacts: &nbsp;they will need to be imported from the previous program
 (if it's still there!!). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as a test, try sending an email to yourself and see if you get it - if you don't, then it's unlikely that your recipients are getting them. &nbsp; For checking that: &nbsp;go to File - Options - Email Accounts (make sure that your email account that you are
 using with this program is there. &nbsp; Otherwise, you will need to add it, through their option to 'Add'. &nbsp;And, if your email account is there, then you will need to check in Properties and ensure that all the details in each Tab are correct (that's another long
 process). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;attaching documents to Live Mail. &nbsp; This is done from Live Mail itself. &nbsp; When in composition, click on Attach File - Find the file from Explorer - and then Open. &nbsp; It shouldn't ask you 'which App do you want to use to open...'. &nbsp; It should just paste
 the file into your email. &nbsp; All this I've mentioned in these three paragraphs apply to Windows Live Mail only (in case you're using this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;using Firefox. &nbsp;That's fine if you don't mind getting into the Web (for your Hotmail account) each time you want to send/receive emails. &nbsp; However, your other problems with emails will still be there, which is what we have been trying to deal with.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this tech guy at Office Depot is willing, he could probably look into these problems as well and fix them up at a cost. &nbsp; I think you need someone physically there to look into this as preferable to trying to do it online, which is time consuming and
 irritating for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope things start looking up for you!</p>

<p>I was recently just looking around on the Control Panel I then came across the Windows Defender Firewall and it shows that I'm connected to a "Guest or public networks" It states below the drop down menu that "Networks in public places such as airports or
 cafes" But my connection is a home network and I would of thought I would be connected on the top one "Private networks" please tell me if i'm wrong or if I should maybe be worrying in case of security reasons. Also sorry if I have just wasted a bit of your
 time because I might just be worrying for no reason.</p>

            Hi ECLIPSEFUZION,<br /><br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you.<br />Don't worry about you being connected to a guest or public network, because probably you set your actual network as public One, instead of settings It as private, when you First connected to your network.

            Hi Eclipse, I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />This is normal information that Windows gave to you. For the different types of Network, Windows will automatically set various settings about security for what you intend to do with the network. For an example, if you connect to a Public Network from somewhere such as the airports, what you're going to do is mostly like browse webpages, send emails, etc. You don't need Windows to connect to other devices, so the Public Network will use more security policy to protect your computer from attacks. But for the Private Networks, you already know you're in a safe and private zone, so the policy will be more flexible to allow you to use more network ports or services.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Hello! for problems with account loggin, internet and also Xbox Live access... (Console Power cycle)<br />
We recommend to perform a power cycle on your console, here in the following link are the steps...<br />
<br />
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console<br />
<br />
If the previous recomendation doesnt work for you, just do what i do, turn the console off and unplug the AC cable for 30 seconds and plug it in again, this will do the same effect than power cycle...<br />
<br />
Let us know if these sugestions help, i hope this fix this inconvenient. Good Luck!

            <p>Straight to Apple without giving Linux (free OS) a try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has really goofed on this one. Their totalitarian corporate culture is shining through. I'm learning more and more about Linux all the time. I can't stand someone or some company trying to control every aspect of my computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are trying to completely dumb everyone down so the average user is rendered totally incompetent. Kind of what the auto industry did to the shadow mechanic. They made the engines so compact and inaccessible they drove a lot of backyard mechanics out
 of business and "drove" people into the dealerships. Sad.</p>

            june 17th 2017 windows 10 still sucks, I built my new desktop with 8 it has a titan etc etc all games run maxed, 8 was great 10 is terrible, I didn't have any problems with vista, the problem is 8 was the best performing windows ever I had four start menus
 but most people didn't know how easy it was to get a start menu so everyone cried they fired all the talented people and hired children to make 10 that's not a joke that's not an exaggeration look it up, it's time to move on guys it's time to let microsoft
 die without bill gates it's useless this is what happens when the lowers like balmer and that black nintendo guy get power as the actual smart people who aren't just for crowd pleasing retire/die plus that old dude with justin biber hair let's be honest guys
 the people in charge after bill left are all on **** drugs or cake and did not put 1% of the work in that bill did to actually learn **** and just rode his chair hopping coattails again I had zero complaints with vista nor any other pre

<p>another thing- my wired xbox 360 controller I've had for like ten years recently finally the wire got a short in it I coulda probably gotten that replaced or whatever but I wanted something wireless finally so I got an xbox elite controller and if you press
 on it it makes creaky noises because it's a flimsy piece of **** you can crush with one hand, you can't hurt an xbox 360 controller I did NOT treat it good at all and again it lasted literally like ten years, now look up what's going on with the xbox one controller
 also remember I bought an elite which is the super expensive one, and guess what, I returned it and got a ps4 controller with some wal mart brand kontrol freeks and 1. it weighs nothing while having more features 2. the trackpad is amazing for pc I prefer
 not only to game with the controller but use it to control my computer over my expensive logitech g510s and g700s keyboard and mouse I've always been a 100% controller user but my goodness the extreme lightness of this controller it's honestly a feather oh
 and it feels even more sturdy than the 360 controller it's like one of those old kid's toys plastic that would dent steel&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>anyway I'm at the point now with windows where I'm sincerely only angry when using it luckily games for the most part still work ok but now nvidia's being retarded too anyway I'm really hoping some 4channers at this point come along since they're better
 coders than these big companies **** god damn we need a new group of people to make an operating system and graphics drivers, also games, everyone working now needs to die basically they're not bad because they're young so much as they're bad because they're
 dumb as **** therefore cheap and when bill was around that wasn't the top priority&nbsp;</p>

Based on your description, it seems that your other Surface Dock has a hardware issue. Since you tried the other update into the dock and it worked, we suggest that you bring that Surface Dock to a nearest

<p>I had this exact problem this morning on two docks plugged into two different surface book 2's that I just took out of the boxes.&nbsp; I played with it for a little bit and then I re-downloaded the updater tool independent of the other IT tools, put it on the
 desktop and used it to do a repair on the updater and let the installer do the restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it came back up I was able to do use the updater to update the firmware on the docks on both of them connected to each of the surfaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I downloaded the whole group of tools and installed it from a network location and said no to the installer restart.&nbsp; It became obvious to me that it doesn't like one of the choices that I made.&nbsp; So I went back to installer basics of making
 it local and giving it all of the attention and it worked.</p>

 is the hangup, but now I only have a blank screen with my mouse pointer.. </p>
<p>Very disappointing.&nbsp; Really upset with Windows 10.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            System Restore Not Working in Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    When I try to do a System Restore in Windows 7 Home Premium, after rebooting, the message, "C:\Windows\bootstat.dat" cannot be retrieved from System Restore (Error 0x80070057) so the system restore fails. This occurs no matter which restore point is selected.<br />
<br />
How can I resolve this problem, please, so System Restore will work correctly?<br />

            Hi, Winston,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help.<br />
<br />
I ran a System File Checker scan which reported there were no integrity violations.<br />
<br />
I then turned off system restore, rebooted my computer whereby all restore points were removed, then created a restore point.<br />
Next I did a system restore back to that restore point and it was successful.<br />
<br />
However, when "undoing" that restore point via system restore the same result occurred as in my initial posting - i.e. that it was unsuccessful with the same error message and error number.<br />
<br />
I`m still a little baffled?? <br />
<br />
Roger.<br />

Check Ruth Buruga's reply in this&nbsp;thread :<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/after-upgrading-to-windows-10/23c6e9da-cdde-412c-b572-35240eb0c195">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-winapps/after-upgrading-to-windows-10/23c6e9da-cdde-412c-b572-35240eb0c195</a>
<br />
<br />
More methods you should use :<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)&nbsp;&nbsp; OR&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows PowerShell (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab
 - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
</span><br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p><span><font color="#000000">The "FN" key on a laptop computer keyboard is called the "function" key. It operates
 similarly in concept to the "SHIFT" key in that if you hold down the "function" key you can unlock the secondary operation of specific keys on your keyboard. These keys are typically located in the "F" row of keys at the very top of the keyboard.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Go through the manual that came with your laptop computer to see which specific
 keys on your keyboard can be used in conjunction with the "FN" key. These keys will change depending on the model of laptop computer you own, so it is a good idea to read up on the subject in your manual and see just what capabilities your function key is
 going to unlock.</font></span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Installer Doesn&#39;t See SATA HDD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Installer Doesn&#39;t See SATA HDD</h2>
                    I am trying to install Windows 7 64bit on a new computer I assembled myself.<br />
<br />
When prompted for a location to install Windows, the installer does not show either of my SATA internal hard drives as a possible location to install.<br />
The HDD I would like to install Windows on (74gb WD Raptor) is recognized in the BIOS as the IDE Channel 0 Master (when the drive was in IDE mode).<br />
I've tried different BIOS settings, such as IDE and AHCI for the drives, but Windows does not recognize them.<br />
I've tried pointing to the Windows installer to SATA drivers during this step, both ones on my motherboard driver CD as well as some I downloaded and put on an external HD (Windows installer recognizes the USB external just fine), with no luck in either case.<br />
<br />
The SATA ports on my motherboard are controlled by ICH9R and the GSATA ports are controlled by&nbsp; GIGABYTE SATA2. I've tried both and neither works.<br />
<br />
Later today I am going to try to find a boot disc for a different OS and see if this problem is unique to Windows 7, but if anybody has suggestions please let me know, thanks.<br />
<br />
Here are my system specs:<br />

            If your motherboard's BIOS is properly configured for SATA controllers and you burned the Windows 7 RC1 ISO image correctly, Windows 7 should recognise and install on a SATA drive without any third-party drivers.&nbsp; Consult your motherboard's User's Guide
 for assistance in setting up the BIOS properly.

<h2>            Zahlungsmethoden</h2>
                    
<p>HI,&nbsp;</p>
<p>ich hoffe mir kann jemand helfen :)</p>
<p>Mein Live Gold ist vor ein paar Tagen ausgelaufen und hab mich gefreut, als auf dem Dashboard 1 Monat für 1 Euro angeboten wurde.</p>
<p>Als Zahlungsmethode wählte ich "Lastschrift"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hab meine Daten alle korrekt eingetragen und hab auch mein Gold bekommen. Nun schaute ich auf die Homepage und dort steht meine Visa-Karte wäre abgelaufen.</p>
<p>ich hab nie eine Visa angegeben sondern Lastschrift. ich besitze nicht einmal eine Visa-Karte. Auf der Xbox selbst ist weiterhin "Lastschrift" als Zahlungsmethode.</p>

<p>Muss ich mir nun Gedanken machen? Da der Monat Gold angelich mit Visa bezahlt wurde laut Homepage?</p>

<p>Ich hab vorsichtshalber mal mein Paypal Konto hinterlegt und wollte das Als Hauptzahlung angeben, was nur leider auch nicht möglich war, da der Monat Gold nun mit der "abgelaufenen Visa-Karte" bezahlt werden soll.</p>


<p>Ist das eventuell nur ein Fehler der Homepage? Weil die Zhalungsmöglichkeiten auf der Xbox selbst stimmen ja :/</p>

<p>Vielen Dank schonmal :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is not recognizing the full amount of my Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, i have posted this before a year or so ago looking for help but with no luck and here i'm today hoping that someone has reached a solution or a workaround for my issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a Dell 5537 i7 with 8GB of RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel Graphics Card 4400 along with AMD Radeon HD 8670M&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since i heard about Windows 10 years ago during beta stages i have been using it and i have had this issue with my Graphics Card that i just cannot&nbsp; solve, i have been using Windows 10 for years and have been an Insider Preview user(fast ring) but a
 couple days ago i decided to go back to Windows 7 because on Windows 10 my Graphics Cards are not working as they should be</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how my Graphics Card should be and is on Windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0b6bb2a-e127-45bc-95e5-edb3b52b566d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0b6bb2a-e127-45bc-95e5-edb3b52b566d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is how it was on Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b64ee4c-1c94-45bb-af5c-ab9a5de102f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b64ee4c-1c94-45bb-af5c-ab9a5de102f8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see there is more than 2GB missing which after installing Windows 7 i noticed that it was a huge difference specially in gaming&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is if anyone has faced this issue before and had figured out a solution? if someone out there did please share the fix or workaround! i'm open to any suggestions</p>
<p>
</p><p>and PS: i of course have updated my Graphics Cards both Intel and AMD to the latest version, i tried letting Windows 10 get the drivers through Windows Update. I tried installing an older version of both of them. I tried installing the Windows 7 version
 of both but nothing has worked</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'll be hugely grateful if someone has the will to help me get through this because i don't want to stop using Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I can't offer any workaround but is your device supported by Dell for Windows 10. If it is have you asked them this question. If not then this is perhaps why they don't support Windows 10.</p>
<p>If it has dual graphics perhaps Dell offer drivers for Windows 8, have you tried those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to recall seeing other posts with problems with Intel HD drivers when Windows 10 first came out. Wouldn't you be using the Radeon for gaming.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be a BiOS update dated September 30, 2016. Did you update to it ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your Intel gfx card have real physical memory or do you assign memory to it in BiOS ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What about the AMD gfx card ? Do you have a screenshot for it, too ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't explain why the difference, but would make a couple of points...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Intel HD4400 is part of your CPU and does not have much of it's own memory... It uses system memory, and Win 10 seems to be allocating it differently...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering why you are playing games with the Intel Chip... The AMD HD8670M is a far better option for games... You should have the option somewhere to select which you use...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the option to select the graphics chip was lost in the change to Win 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Laptop with similar, but older processors, and at one time the ability to choose processors was lost... The AMD drivers provided by HP had the controls to do this and was lost in the upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to check with Dell and see what they have in the way of drivers for your Win 10 setup...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I vaguely remember is that if I installed Intel drivers after installing the AMD drivers, the switchable graphics was again lost... But that was a long time ago, and it could be the reverse...</p>

<p>
</p><p>and yes i have tried downloading Windows 8 drivers for both from Dell website, didn't work&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do use AMD for gaming but this effects my PC and i have tried and compared a few tasks, browsing, gaming and other tasks as well all of them seem to be running more smoothly on Windows 7 than Windows 10</p>

            Why are you using integrated graphics when you have a graphics card? You can't use both. Gaming on a 4400 would suck and the 4 GB would not be the issue. Any game requiring 4GB of RAM would need something MUCH better than the 4400 and frankly your graphics
 card also sucks. If this is laptop I guess you're out of luck. There are ZERO games out there that would be totally fine using the the 4400 or your graphics card and also need anywhere near 4 GB of RAM.

</p><p>in Windows 10 i used to be able to get the exact detailed about the AMD since its a newer version for Windows 10 but with this version i'm using on Windows 7 the options are very limited i cannot get a screenshot of the physical memory of the AMD&nbsp;</p>

<p>thank you for taking the time to reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>so is the full memory still there and being used correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm using the AMD for games but i have noticed that it is slower on Windows 10, and some games that i can open and play on Windows 7 won't even start on Windows 10 and give me a low graphics error which is weird since it is the same laptop and the game but
 only different operating system</p>

<p>i am using the AMD but isn't this affecting the performance? i mean the missing amount of memory</p>
<p>because i really did compare between the 2 operating systems and Windows 7 is a lot more smoother than Windows 10 so i thought the issue was the missing amount&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that Win 7 is using the AMD through some type of setting by default...</p>
<p>Especially if you are using the Dell Preinstalled OS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10 may not be using the same setup... The upgrade may have changed, or possibly even eliminated the ability to control that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that having less memory available for your Intel is affecting it's performance, but that would have no effect for the most part on the AMD...</p>
<p>It has it's own 2GB of memory that is not from the system memory...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 2GB of memory that is part of the AMD is actually faster memory than what is available for the Intel...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know based on my machine that the AMD actually outputs THROUGH the Intel graphics... This is necessary because they both use the same ports on the machine...</p>
<p>At least my HP is this way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is a possibility that the Intel is a bottleneck for the AMD as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It unfortunately is true that some machines simply perform some tasks better on Win 7 than Win 10... My laptop works great with Win 7 Pro and Win 10 Pro, but is somewhat miserable with Win 8... It originally came with both Win 7 and 8 Pro..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Dell not have Win 10 drivers available for your machine ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, you may try checking directly with Intel and AMD Drivers and Support website... They both will allow you to enter your graphics processor model and list the proper drivers... Sometimes this is a good solution, and sometimes not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have trouble with this, post your machines full model number, and maybe it's serial number if you feel comfortable doing that... Maybe someone can find something useful...</p>
<p>

<p>is there any way that i could have that default setting set for Windows 10 too? because it really is making a huge difference specially in the game that i'm playing, with Windows 10 i have so many crashes and lags and freezes and but with Windows 7 i have
 2 clients of the same game and it is not even as laggy as it is with 1 client on Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>this really&nbsp;frustrates me because i love Windows 10 and i don't want to stop using it</p>
<p>
</p><p>and yes i have gone to Dell's website for the driver versions and tried the ones in there for my model but it's not working, besides it's been years since they updated drivers for my model so i just install the latest ones off Intel and AMD websites&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Blinking &#38; Unable to Rename Files</h2>
                    I have 2 issues...<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; My windows are blinking.&nbsp; In internet explorer and just running various programs when signed off ie.
<br />
2.&nbsp; I can not rename a file.&nbsp; I can click the file, the blue highlight shows up for a second then it just goes away.
<br />
<br />
I noticed both problems within the last week or so.&nbsp; I have downloaded some windows updates.&nbsp; I have run my virus software AVG and nothing shows.
<br />
<br />
I am running Vista Home Premium, 64 bit with 4GB<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Windows blinking is that you monitor or the window "VISTA" is blinking? When does it start blinking?<br />
You can Right Click on the Fold and select EDIT from the options it will let you change the folders name.</p>

            Hi Vitbtm. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Run this flash tool to make sure you have the latest:
<br /><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />3) You can also try the Facebook app in WIndows 10 to compare:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/facebook/9wzdncrfj2wl?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/facebook/9wzd...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Try another browser. I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser.  Set the preferred one as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Greg!&nbsp; It turns out that the problem is a compatibility issue with firefox/google and Facebook.&nbsp; Right after replying to your help earlier it started acting up again and I got in touch with my PC's support team and that's what they discovered through
 hours of troubleshooting.&nbsp; Ugh! 🤬 But I'd like to thank you for your swift response and your help. 😊<br />

    <title>Skype taskbar icon missing in Skype for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> villainnglasses  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype taskbar icon missing in Skype for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. With Skype for Desktop I had a nice icon on the taskbar notification area that I could see my status, whether I had pending (unread) messages, and I could double-click to open Skype. I've noticed since Microsoft has forced me to now install Skype for
 Windows 10 app that I no longer have a Skype taskbar icon. At this point, I have to open Skype via the search function or Windows live tiles. I much preferred having Skype auto-logon at startup and show my status on the taskbar, and I don't want to have to
 "pin" the Skype app to my taskbar, and I'm not even sure if that would function like the notification icon used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Skype for Windows 10 have a way to enable the taskbar notification icon? I haven't been able to find it, nor an answer online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Well, I finally figured out the navigation-&nbsp; instead of the old Windows menu system at top, they now have a cute little "gear" icon crap thing at bottom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But by then I had backed out to the old Skype.</p>

            I have pinned to the taskbar and put a shortcut in the startup folder. However on startup there is no Skype window open and if I open and then minimise incoming calls do not register. It really is garbage!

<p>Yes, I have it pinned to my taskbar for easy opening, but none of the pending messages/notifications appear on the pinned taskbar icon...</p>

<p>That's really weird why Microsoft decided to remove one of the most useful features.&nbsp;Big step backward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And sadly Skype has many more problems. Messages don't arrive sometimes, notifications don't arrive or arrive late, 300MB file size limit on sending ( WHY? ) and more....</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND IMAGES LOSE QUALITY WHEN SENT! ( WHY?!!!!! )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft!&nbsp;Going down...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are removing features and doesn't leave options for us to change settings and customize as they want. All the settings menus get shorter and shorter. Do as you think is better, but leave checkboxes in settings for us to customize app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple loves to decide for you what you want and need, and gives only one way to do things. That's not bad for some users, but not all should do the same way. Now Microsoft is on the same path...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking at alternatives like Discord, Slack and there are some more other alternatives which look good. Bad is that both they are not free as Skype and both have ugly emojis. We plan to test Google Hangouts too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you'll fix things and we and other people like us wouldn't be forced to leave.</p>

            I'd like to hear about alternatives. I just don't trust that SKYPE is actually running any more. That's a serious problem.<br />

<p>People have been complaining about this for months. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? There's no way to see if it is running. No way to see if it started on boot-up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has only silence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I'd love to revert to an earlier program version that was actually useful. I just can't continue to use this. Does anyone have a link to an earlier version that actually works properly?</p>
