<p>I &nbsp;have other devices in &nbsp;my house which are perfectly getting connected to my Wi-Fi but not my laptop.I am currently using my Ethernet cable but I don't think so I can always use it.I tried going to the network and sharing center in my laptop and tried
 manually connecting to my Wi-Fi and it says that my the network I am trying to connect to already exists but then it won't show up in the list of wireless networks.What can be the problem?<br />

            When I faced a similar problem, I logged into the network settings of the router using ethernet cable and changed the channel and restarted my laptop and router. This should work even for you.

If the only problem with DI2006 is with Shaped Text...there is a <br />
possibility that you have an issue with your Video Driver. It may<br />
be worth a try to update it.<br />

<p><span>My Xbox One has been having issues with reading discs. Ever since the march update, any time I switch discs I get error code (0x21) saying that my disc is dirty or damaged. The only way I am able to get the system to read the disc is to do a hard reset,
 which includes unplugging the system. On top of that, anytime I switch discs I have to do the same reset, and I am unable to even play the same game after turning the console off via its regular sleep mode.</span></p>

</li><li><strong>Eject the disc,</strong> check it for smudges &amp; scratches, and then re-insert it.
</li></ol>

            SATA drives are not recognized by the Windows XP install disk.&nbsp; Changing BIOS from SATA to ATA sometimes resolves this problem and allows you to install and sometimes doesn't.&nbsp; The Microsoft solution is to press the F6 key when prompted for additional
 drivers and then insert a Floppy Disk (yes, it must be a floppy disk) with the driver on it.
<br />
<br />
"Limited OEM driver support is available with F6 during Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 setup"<br />

&nbsp;Several ways have been formulated to get around requiring a floppy disk.&nbsp; You might want to check out the following articles:<br />

    <title>Can default keyboard set to Serbian Latin upon boot in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can default keyboard set to Serbian Latin upon boot in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-ecoms/how-can-i-change-ui-language-in-metro-mail-app/6b7861ba-3424-40a9-aceb-79a691567afc" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I've had the same question. My regional settings are Serbian and I'd like to have the Serbian keyboard as default. However, Serbian translation of the Mail App is less than satisfactory* and I would like to have this and other Metro apps in English.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, is it possible to have the following in Windows 8.1:</p>
<p>- default keyboard set to Serbian Latin upon boot</p>
<p>- default UI language for Mail and Calendar set to English</p>
<p>- regional settings set to Serbian Latin</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know that two out of three are possible, except for the default keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>------</p>
<p>* My biggest complaint is that I can't trust the Serbian translation of the UI in Mail. For example, there is a setting called "Download external pictures" with possible values of "Yes" and "Off". In the Serbian translation, these values are "Dana (english:
 Days?!)" and "Ne (english: No"). How am I supposed to know that "Dana (Days in english)" really should mean "Yes"? Someone made a typo while translating, and while it is easy to conclude what this particular value means, I am afraid that I'll mess something
 up if I run into another incorrectly translated option, the meaning of which may be harder to guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, in the Office 365 discussions app there is an option to "Like" a post. In the Serbian translation, this should be "Sviđa mi se (English: I like it)". Instead, this is translated as "Je kao (English: looks like)". This is just wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>While I believe that UI translations to 'major' languages are OK, in my 20+ years with DOS and Windows I've learned that it is best to just leave the UI language&nbsp;at English.</p>

<h2>            Riddler Trophy in The Bowery</h2>
                    
<p>I have one last Riddler Trophy to collect, but I simply can't figure out how to get it. In The Bowery section, to the very northwest of the Museum (on the roof) is a Riddler Trophy in front of a cage. When I step on the switch here, the cage closes and I'm
 supposed to wipe out the three question marks inside the cage. My guess is that I'm supposed to use the explosive gel, but when I click on detonate they (a) don't detonate in the order I want them to and (b) they detonate before the second question mark is
 even activated. I've tried all the other gadgets but I can't figure it out. How in the world do I solve this one?</p>

<p>use your zoom on the middle one and detonate, only that one will blow. then the first one then the last one. bingo, all done. another player told me the solution.</p>

<p>I've collected all Riddler Trophies, solved all Riddles, removed all cameras and destroyed all breakable objects, but I'm still missing one objective in Amusement Mile (I think). I don't know what it says exactly, but it's the objective that says I'm supposed
 to "talk" or whatever to the Thyger-something. How do I get that one? Apart from that I've still got to complete all the physical challenges, like the combos and such.</p>

<p>@cyphax - did you get the decode the 4 Tyger lock boxs? not sure what your're talking about. when you go to your map and you look the "?' tab it lists all the areas and shows you all the check marks you have aquired. which area and which square is not checked???
 otherwise I dunno what you are refereing to.</p>

<p>@Dawued - Under the "?" tab, in the Amusement Mile subtab, the only square that isn't checked is the second square from the right of the bottom row. It says something about interrogation with TYGER.<br />
<br />
@BKVegeta - I think that's exactly what I'm looking for. I havn't found all the hubs so that's probably why I'm missing that square. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            windows firewall with advanced security and mmc- microsoft management console</h2>
                    &nbsp;I want to know how to operate the snap-ins in mmc. Do you load them under the Console tree permanently? The center column takes them and then what? This thing is huge and I can't find any questions about it on the community boards. I mean REALLY it is
 complex and I am sure most people don't know how to work it. Microsoft Management Console. Snap ins someone explain this - start with- what are the snap ins all about and how to use them. Does Microsoft have a video to watch? Explain the purposes and uses.
 And, how does it all relate to Windows Firewall with Advanced Security? <br />
&nbsp;I just had a pro "Nerd" extract a hacker from my machine. The hacker had taken over MMC and Windows Firewall. I want to learn this now.<br />

<p>How long it runs depends on how many files are on your system, what type of files they are, and how fast your hardware can process them.&nbsp; In general a
<strong>full scan</strong> completes in a few hours.</p>
<p>I'd cancel that long running safety scan and go directly&nbsp;for&nbsp;your infection with the following directions which should remove Security Essentials 2011 and any related malware:</p>

<p>When that completes successfully and Security Essentials 2011 is deleted, I'd again run the Microsoft Safety Scanner in full scan mode&nbsp;from this Microsoft site:</p>

    <title>Aero disappears after reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ieee64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aero disappears after reboot</h2>
                    
<p>Problem: I cannot get Aero on Windows 7 64bit to appear after reboot. Hardware: ATI Radeon HD 4350.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For clean results, I created a new user with admin rights and logged as it. Idea was to check if indeed "some programs" stop aero from working - doesn't hold. No Aero.</p>
<p>It gets working, until the next reboot, if I change video drivers - during installation, screen flickers, and suddenly all Aero effects appear. I've tried several combination of drivers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Standard SVGA driver (no aero) -&gt; replaced with Standard ATI driver: Aero appers, next reboot is gone.</li><li>Standard ATI driver -&gt; Latest ATI driver with Catalyst Control Center - same effect.</li><li>Latest ATI driver with Catalyst Control Center -&gt; Standard ATI driver - same effect</li><li>Standard ATI driver -&gt; Standard SVGA driver (no aero at all, but not expected here anyway)</li></ul>
<p>So doing this cycle (remove ATI/install ATI drivers) I'm able to switch the effects on, but not until the next reboot.</p>
<p>What else I tried, after searching:</p>
<ul>
<li>Control Panel/Trobleshooting/Aero - shows no problems </li><li>net start/stop uxsms, also restart theme manager - doesn't help </li><li>Setting HKCU/Software/Microsoft/Windows/DWM keys Animations,Blur, and UseMachineCheck to 0 - doesn't help</li><li>dxdiag - shows no problem </li><li>checked grafix card rating: 3.4 </li></ul>
<p>Machine is almost freshly installed, no overclocking, no memory or disk faults, run memchecker and chkdisk, no problems at all.</p>
<p>I find it utterly frustrating that there's no diagnostic messages of any kind, no error number, no way to put a finger on what's wrong. I'd be willing to run some devel tools, if there are any to find out what's wrong, but can't find anything related.</p>
<p>Help, please!!</p>

<p>Did you install motherboard chipset drivers when you installed Windows 7 64bit? Generic MS motherboard drivers might not be adequate to support all functions of the motherboard hardware.</p>
<p>Catalyst and driver versions are matched to each other so you should only&nbsp;use them as a pair. MS drivers have no matching Catalyst version IINM, though some Catalyst&nbsp;functions may work regardless. The&nbsp;most compatible drivers would be the ones released by
 the video card manufacturer,&nbsp;though they might not be as up to date as the generic drivers from ATI.&nbsp;Legacy ATI drivers in Windows should not be used at all with newer model&nbsp;cards and SVGA is only useful as a troubleshooting fall-back option.</p>
<p>Download the latest Windows 7 64bit driver for your video card from ATI(AMD). If it is an on-motherboard graphic chipset you may need to download a specific driver that supports on-board graphics rather than the usual driver for add in video cards.</p>
<p>Use the ATI uninstaller utility&nbsp;to remove any existing drivers. Before rebooting delete the c:\ATI\Support folder and contents to prevent the driver files within from being reloaded. Windows will probably install the video driver from MS updates on reboot,
 that's okay. Turn off your AV software and install the downloaded driver. You can run the driver installer with the right-click &nbsp;"as administrator" option to bypass 'permissions' related installation issues (in case it may apply here). Reboot and then restart
 your AV when finished installing the driver.</p>

<p>That seems to take us back to some 3rd party app disabling access to&nbsp;Aero functionality. From what you posted originally it would likely be something that installed for 'all users' and that always loads during boot. I once had a firewall app that&nbsp;would&nbsp;disable
 my USB WiFi adapter during boot when the firewall was loading.&nbsp;&nbsp;As in your case no errors, no problems found, but on every reboot the device would be&nbsp;turned off.</p>
<p>Your idea to check for programs that might cause this issue was good but the methodology was wrong. You can try disabling startup items and services&nbsp;using msconfig. Because of the nature of the problem I'd disable the&nbsp;items in small batches, rebooting in
 between, beginning with the Startup items&nbsp;and if neccessary moving on to the Services.&nbsp;If you can identify the problem software this way then either uninstall it or leave it disabled.</p>

<p>Well, just did a set of rounds with msconfig, as you said.</p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled all programs in startup, rebooted - doesn't help </li><li>In addition to this, disabled all non-microsoft services, rebooted - doesn't help
</li><li>Then tried to switch to diagnostic startup, with bare minimum of even microsoft services, rebooted - all visual styles were gone. Enabled themes and uxsms services, started manually - doesn't help. Rebooted - doesn't help.

<p>Hmmm, edging closer towards a worst case scenario. If you can get hold of a different DX10 video card to test with it would be worth trying that to see if the same issue exists.</p>
<p>Okay, lets look at the hardware.. If you run System Information, under Hardware Resources-Conflicts/Sharing check for devices&nbsp; which are sharing&nbsp;IRQs, Memory addresses or I/O ports&nbsp;with the 4350 and/or the PCI-E or&nbsp;AGP port.&nbsp;&nbsp;If any of those devices are
 on add-in cards you can try moving them into different PCI slots. Numbering the PCI-E or AGP slot, Slot 0, the first PCI slot next to it is liable to be tied to the same IRQ and can cause hardware conflicts, notably with soundcards and&nbsp;ethernet cards but possibly
 others as well.&nbsp;There might be another&nbsp;PCI slot which also has its IRQ tied&nbsp;tied to&nbsp;hardware on the motherboard (owners manual for the board&nbsp;may indicate which one) which could concievably cause the same issue. Check System Information for changes in&nbsp;Conflicts/Sharing
 after you move or remove PCI cards. In the case of on-motherboard devices you could try disabling them&nbsp;in CMOS.</p>

<p>No, I don't have access to another DX10 card, unfortunately.</p>
<p>I've checked Conflict sharing - indeed, there are entries shared with the card, memory and ports ranges, but those are "Intel 4 Series Chipset PCI Express Root Port - 2E21" and "PCI bus" only . I don't know what's a root port, but apparently neither it nor
 the bus should (or even could) be disabled. Strangely, the ATI card uses IRQ -2 (0xfffffffe), but google says it's ok. Anyway I can't change driver resources for the graphics card, the interface for changing these is disabled.</p>
<p>I also tried to play in BIOS with PnP OS yes/no settings (BIOS also doesn't let me change IRQs; yes, it's the latest BIOS), disabled all built-in devices (LAN, USB controller, Serial), doesn't help.</p>
<p>I also tried to compare system information with and without aero, hoping that it there could be difference in resources - there's none.</p>

<p>Those all seem to be okay. I don't know what's going on with video card IRQs these days, mine is reporting IRQ 4294967294 according to System Information, IRQ -2 in Device Manager.&nbsp;:-)&nbsp;<br />
If you can't double check using a different video card or put the video card in a different Win7 computer it doesn't leave many options. I don't know of any free hardware diagnostic software to recommend for testing the video card, unfortunately. Programs like
 SIW, SiSoft Sandra, Everest, etc.&nbsp;can give lots of detailed information about your system but I don't know how usefull any particular one of them would be for diagnosing your problem.</p>
<p>It leaves - uninstalling all added-in software, one at a time (beginning with AV) and/or&nbsp;reinstall the OS from scratch, clean, not upgrade - Which actually you&nbsp;might be able to&nbsp;do as a dual boot in a different partition - just long enough&nbsp;to&nbsp;find out if
 the card works. If it doesn't, replace the card as probably defective and delete the 2nd OS install. If it does work you could go with the new OS install and delete the original one (backup your&nbsp;important data first obviously) or wipe the harddrive and start
 over clean with a new install.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate the issue so that we could figure out why you can't sign in to your Xbox account on this game that you played. Can you tell us if you're signed in to your account on the Xbox app on your computer? If so, can you try to launch the game
 from the Xbox app? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your game is not listed under My games on the Xbox app, kindly click "<strong>Add a game from your PC</strong>" and locate the game. Once done, try to launch the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span>Tony Upton,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Was
 it working fine before?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Could
 you please provide the make and the model number of your device?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know, how exactly have you connected your device, have you used any adapter to connect your mouse by USB.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Connect your mouse to a different&nbsp;<strong>USB (Universal Serial Bus)</strong> port and check to see if the issue persists</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>Run the&nbsp;<strong>fixit
</strong>available in the link below and check if that makes any difference</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><strong><span>Check
 for any error code displayed in device manager – Use your Keyboard</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>When a device is not working properly, Device Manager will also usually display an error message with an accompanying error code.</span><span>Firstly,
 check for any errors in device manager, to do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Hit
 the&nbsp; <strong>Start </strong>Button on the keyboard &gt; type in&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Device manager</strong> in the search box and hit enter<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In the Device Manager, locate the Mouse and other pointing device and then Hit enter on your device
 name.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Under the general tab look for the device status for any error code listed and let me know</span></p>

            Give this a try to see if it works. If not, move on to the next steps:
<br />
<br />Press the wifi key + fn + prntscr 
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can toggle it on or off.
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset
<br />
<br />Hit Enter 
<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.

    <title>XBOX Adaptive Controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XBOX Adaptive Controller</h2>
                    We've purchased the new XBOX One adaptive controller for my daughter. She's been THRILLED about this since we found out it was coming out as she can not hold a regular controller and control the buttons at the same time. We've since realized that though
 it is an amazing idea that XBOX had to put this controller out along with the awesome commercial to bring attention to this product, it is sad that in order for a special needs child to participate with this controller they must pay almost double the price
 of a traditional controller. Not only that, the adaptive controller doesn't allow them to do everything so they must also spend twice again that price in order to find accessories to go along with this controller! Finally we were able to tell our daughter
 that she can play XBOX with her brother, only to find out that now that we've promised her this, we must purchase more accessories in order to make it happen. We purchased the entire XBOX 1 system with 2 controllers, a headset, and a

            Thank you for bringing this to the attention of our community. It is absolutely a valuable feedback.<br />
I suspect the adaptive controller is not cheap at all in terms of cost of production, but I totally agree that more transparency on that side would not harm.<br />

            I had heard about this before, its unfortunate that everything needed isnt included, MS could certainly be a bit clearer about this on the box or at the very least offer a full package that includes all the needed parts.

            I understand both sides of this and absolutely sympathize. This is basically a product that MS will not make a profit on. They decided to leave it up to the individual gamers to supply their own adapters because of different needs. They could never put
 all of the available first and 3rd party items in the box without making it even more expensive. This is exactly why they made the ports 3.55mm so it can accept a wide range of items. This is a great situation for people who already have accessories for other
 applications but not so good for those that do not already have what they need. I would have liked to see them at least include 1 or 2 accessories when purchased through the MS Store simply to get people started.

<p>As someone who works for a firm that provides services to folks with physical limitations, I understand your frustration. But you have to consider it's impossible for Microsoft to include every possible option and configuration in one box. We are testing
 adaptive controllers at my office right now, and we are spending a fair amount on assorted adapters, buttons, etc... So you aren't wrong but one thing we can be hopeful about is that as MS expands this market, prices will come down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent a lot time testing, implementing and sadly discarding a lot of tech for this purpose and I do see a trend of prices finally coming down, but we have a ways to go.&nbsp;</p>

            I completely understand that XBOX can't possibly put accessories for every situation in one box. That's the beauty of the adaptive controller, making it accessible for more individuals with the ability to add these accessories. The issue here isn't what's
 included, it's the price you have to pay in order to get going. This is the same issue that special needs parents have with anything adaptive; I paid $80 for my son's bicycle. I paid $2400 for my daughters adaptive tricycle, a bit ridiculous for something
 that really doesn't have expensive pieces attached to it. The simple fact that it's adaptive makes it more expensive. I don't want to get off topic here, just want to make sure that the point is getting across. I know a lot of people don't know these facts.
 You wonder why kids can't participate and are held back, well this is why. They can't participate in things that they are ABLE to participate in because the tools that are needed cost so much that the average family can't afford it.&nbsp;

<p>Everything for disabled costs more. It is unfortunate. I am disabled myself and at this time I can still play with a normal controller if button remapping is supported.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Dead Or Alive 5&#58; Last Round - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dead Or Alive 5&#58; Last Round</h2>
                    
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>TOO LONG DIDN’T READ VERSION:</strong></span> Dead Or Alive 5 is a rip off, I want my money back, all $63.44 of it.<br />
*If a customer support staff member would PM me, I can give you the exact Order&nbsp;Numbers*<br />
<br />
<br />
Where do I being…. Do you remember when Xbox One first launched, and there was this great fighting game that released with it, called Killer Instinct. Not only was it the first fighting game out on xbox one, but it was also essentially the first “Free To Play”
 game on Xbox One. Killer Instinct was a game that anybody could download for free, and have access to the entire game. The catch was that you only got access to a couple of the characters for free. So, if you wanted to play with any of the other characters
 in the game, then you would have to pay money to be able to unlock those characters. I bought all the characters, It’s a good game.
<br />
<br />
Fast forward a year or two later, and here comes an updated release on Xbox One of a game that had previously came out on Xbox 360, a game which I own on 360, Dead Or Alive 5. Dead Or Alive 5: Last Round.
<br />
When Dead Or Alive 5: Last Round released on Xbox One they followed the same model that Killer Instinct followed, the Free To Play model. You could download the “core” game for free, have access to a few fighters (4 of them if I remember correctly), access
 to most of the game modes, including online play, but not the story mode. Then you would have to option to separately purchase the rest of the characters (and/or the story mode) to use in the game. Like I said, very similar to Killer Instinct.<br />
So I went ahead and downloaded the free “core” version of the game the day it came out on Xbox One. Played a match or two with the free “core” characters available and decided at that time that I was not going to purchase any add-ons for the game. I figured
 that since I already have this game on the 360, then I could hold off on the Xbox One version until an inevitable sale comes around, and then at that time I’ll purchase the rest of the characters at a discount.<br />
<br />
Now come to present day. This week’s Xbox One Deals With Gold discounts included a few discounts for the Dead Or Alive 5: Last Round game. I saw that, and I was hyped. I was thrilled. So after a couple quick fist pumps in the air, I got down to business and
 checked out what I could buy and unlock for the game. <br />
I quickly purchased the “</span><span>Dead or Alive 5 Last Round Core Fighters 30 Character Set</span><span>” for 45% off which came out to a total of $27.93.<br />
I was happy that I finally got all the characters for the game unlocked, and while I was in the spending and saving mood I also jumped on the 45% discount they had on the “Dead or Alive 5 Last round Ninja Clan Complete Set” for a total of $25.05.&nbsp; Which would
 give me some extra costumes for the characters in game to use.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I got those things downloaded, and only one thing left to do now. Go and play the new content I just bought for the game, right? Well at least that’s what I thought. Turned out, I thought wrong.
<br />
When I loaded up the game, I still only had access to the same “core” fighters I had when I first originally downloaded the free version of the game. None of the extra characters or costumes, that I had just bought, were available for me to select.
<br />
Upon further investigation it turns out that I could not access any purchased content because I had a “trial” version of this supposedly “Free”/”Core” version of the game. And If I wanted to be able to have access to the content I just purchased I would have
 to upgrade my “trial” version to the “Free”/”Core” version of the game, which would COST ME an extra $10.46.
<br />
Please keep in mind that there is absolutely NO difference in the game between the “Trial” version and the “Core” version. Also, please don’t get the “Core” version of the game confused with the “Full Game” version which is another $40 on its own.<br />
Anyways, back on track, The “Core” version of the game for an extra $10.46 still only includes 4 fighters to choose from, most of the game modes, but not the story mode. Yes, exactly like the “Trial” Version. Only now, the “Core” version lets will give you
 access to any extra characters that you purchased separately. <br />
<br />
When looking at it on the Xbox One, both the “Trial” and “Core” versions of the game share the same exact page on the Xbox Games Store. (I think it might have been listed under “DOA5LR: Core Fighters Special Discount”) When Looking at the store page for the
 game the first box…. You know the box where it usually shows the Price of the game, or if you already bought it then that box will say “Play”. Well, in that box is said $9.99, and then directly to the right of that box was another box you could select that
 said “Trial version”….. Apparently I only had the “Trial” version of this supposed to be “Free” game.
<br />
Emphasis on the “Free” game because the description for the “Trial”/”Free”/”Core” game is all one in the same on the xbox marketplace, here is the word for word exact description of this $9.99 “Trial”/”Free”/”Core” game…
<br />
<br />
“This is a free version which allows use of most game modes, including online play. However, only a limited number of playable characters are available, and Story Mode is locked. Other characters and Story Mode are available as separate downloadable content
 purchases.”<br />
<br />
Lets look at how the description starts, “This is a free version….” Nope! It cost me and extra $10.46.<br />
Lets look at how the description ends, “Other characters and Story Mode are available as separate downloadable content purchases.” Once again, Nope! I purchased those extra characters and costumes, and I was not able to play them on the version that was truly
 free, the “trial” version.<br />
<br />
So in the end, only after I purchased a Free game for $10.46, was I finally able to use the
</span><span>$27.93 worth of characters and </span><span>$25.05</span> worth of costumes that I had previously purchased for this free game…..<br />
<br />
And before you ask, the answer is yes. Yes, before I spent an extra $10.46 I did try uninstalling/redownloading/reinstalling it all. And everything was still all locked up.<br />
<br />
<span>All in all, this leads me to here…. Here I am completely drained from this experience. I have that bad taste in my mouth. My wallet is $63.44 lighter. I feel taken advantage of. I feel like I got a fast one pulled on me. I feel tricked, mislead, and lied

 to. I am over this game, and over this horrible experience. I’m done. I want nothing else to do with it.

There’s time in everyone’s life when we need need to reevaluate the relationships we have, and unfortunately for Dead Or Alive 5, I’m sorry to say, but this relationship is DOA, Dead On Arrival. We’re going to have to go our separate ways, and the only way
 for me to move on, is with the setting sun on my back and a full REFUND in my hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
