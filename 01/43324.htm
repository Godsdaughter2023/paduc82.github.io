    <title>Control Panel Dead Add or Remove Programs Icon. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefred  say:</h3>
<h2>            Control Panel Dead Add or Remove Programs Icon.</h2>
                    
<p>"Programs and Features" seems to have replaced "Add or Remove Programs" in the Contorol Panel, yet I have one user that has both when viewing the Control Panel in icon view. The Programs and Features link opens the add/remove programs interface. The Add
 or Remove Programs link does nothing. I'm thinking that it does not even belong in the control panel any longer, so I would like to remove it. Does anyone know how to edit the Control Panel so that I can remove the Add or Remove Programs icon? Or to fix the
 Add or Remove Programs icon so that it works.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It appears this system has definitely been compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you migrate on the profile?&nbsp; What OS did the migration&nbsp;come from?&nbsp; Create an alternate user account and verify if you still have&nbsp;both options in the&nbsp;Control Panel.&nbsp; In addition, I&nbsp;would definitely
 suggest ensuring that your data has been backed up to an external location and proceed with either a Repair Installation or a Clean install.&nbsp; I would suggest a repair installation first.&nbsp; Typically all of your data and programs are retained following the installation.&nbsp;
 However, I still suggest backing your data up to an external location to be on the safe side.&nbsp;Of course the clean install would consist of formatting the HD then proceeding with the reinstallation of Windows.&nbsp; I hope this information is beneficial.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

    <title>SfB 2016 Client Regularly Disconnects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidsteel_123  say:</h3>
<h2>            SfB 2016 Client Regularly Disconnects</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with my SfB Client regularly disconnecting from the SfB Online service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client will take 30-40 seconds to connect to the Online service and then every 4-5 minutes (roughly) it will disconnect and take 30-40 seconds to reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using a Websense/Forcepoint web proxy server, which has been thoroughly checked and re-configured by one of their senior support engineers and ruled out as the cause for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I&nbsp;monitor the firewall I can see that immediately AFTER the SfB client drops, the machine/client attempts to create a direct connection to 52.112.194.16:443, which is a Microsoft registered IP address</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read various posts about SfB trying to make direct connections and ignoring proxy settings, but what ever I have tried I cannot get the client to stay connected. I've tried the various KB updates and Registry "hacks" but nothing seems to work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had the same experience and hopefully found a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>As you are using the onmicrosoft.com domain account, there should be no issues with the DNS. It might be related to your network, to check it,&nbsp;</span><span>I'd
 like to know whether the issue persists if you change to another network with the affected account.</span></p>

    <title>Was I just scammed by a remote online computer repair site&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rose-crystal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Was I just scammed by a remote online computer repair site&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if Microsoft shows pop-up windows alerting you to possibility that a virus has infected your computer, then provides a telephone number of a microsoft technician that you can call for help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's what happened to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
Last Thursday I was browsing on Chrome, when suddenly I got a pop-up message stating that "Windows Security Essentials wasn't able to block a virus...." and it gave an error code of 8024402c.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My screen also had another pop-up on it indicating that I needed to contact a Microsoft Tech immediately to resolve the problem, and provided a number to call. &nbsp;It also warned that I not use any other devices on the network, and not to turn off my computer.
 Meanwhile my screen was completely frozen, and I could not get rid of the pop-ups.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I called the number given, and the person answering the phone had an Indian accent. He explained that my network had been infected with a Trojan Horse, and that he needed to transfer me to a Class 12 Microsoft Technician to clear my computer/network of the
 problem (he indicated he was only a class 2 technician). &nbsp;He further explained that my network needed to be reset, my network security restored, and my IP address repaired. Ten applications to be repaired &nbsp;He wanted me to turn over access of my computer to
 him, which I hesitated to do.<br />
<br />
I asked him what would happen if I just turned off the computer, he indicated that the virus was already "in my network" and would infect my other devices/computers. He then proceeded to show me a screen which seemed to show my local IP address and next to
 it a foreign IP address of 199.16.156.41. He explained that they had stolen my IP address and were using it, and any crimes committed would appear to be from me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since my anti-virus had been temporarily uninstalled at the moment this happened, I felt there might be some credibility to what he was saying. I &nbsp;finally agreed to allow him to access my computer, and gave him my credit card number to be charged for $299.
 I watched as the work was done, they used malwarebytes to check for viruses - there were none - but the technician quarantined some files and then deleted them. He re-installed browsers (IE, Chrome, Firefox), and some of their extensions. He also insisted
 I call back in 30 days for a "check-up".<br />
<br />
I later checked my computer, ran Norton full scan (nothing found), changed passwords, and googled on line remote computer repair scams. &nbsp;The company involved has some good reviews, but also some bad reviews alleging they are a scam.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By the way.....this happened the day BEFORE the massive DOS attack on the east coast, so it was not part of it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am currently on windows 7.......if I update to Windows 10 instead of re-install windows 7....... &nbsp;would that wipe the computer clean of anything that they might have hidden on it?&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Yes, you have been scammed. Microsoft NEVER contacts the end user direct about virus issues by any means. It is not actually possible for them to even be able to identify users that have viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the software you have described costs anything like what you have been charged and you really cannot tell what else has been installed. Because they have full access to your system they can prevent suspicious software being detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ultimate solution&nbsp; to be 100% confident that your system is clean is a complete reload.</p>

<h2>            Microphone has 2 channels and can only be heard on the left side.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello, as the title states, I have an issue that has bothered me for a very long time. When I speak on Skype, or other application to communicate, people can only hear me from one side; this being the left. I've uninstalled the driver, the re-installed but
 it does no good. When I go to the 'Sound' settings in 'Control Panel' and click 'Properties' on my microphone and move to 'Advance', it says there are two channels. I tested with someone else's headset, and they only had one channel and the applications allowed
 that headset to be head perfectly. &nbsp;I thought that the headset I had, had the microphone as stereo and not mono. Is there a possible way to change stereo to mono?</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance.</p>

    <title>Wireless Card Not Recognized After Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wireless Card Not Recognized After Windows Update</h2>
                    Hey, some guy over in the "Windows Update" section of the Windows 7 forum was having a problem, but he was not getting many answers. So I thought I'd post it here, since I am having the exact same problem (same model computer and everything). I am hoping
 that I'll get an answer here, cause this problem is really annoying.<br />
<br />
Here's his post:<br />
I have an Compaq Presario F730US. The situation is a little bit complicated, but I will try to explain it.<br />
<br />
I was running Vista on the computer. One day I ran Windows update, and the computer stopped recognizing the wireless card. I uninstalled the updates and disabled new updates, and it seemed to work again. I did not like this setup, since I didn't want to have
 to avoid getting Windows Updates, but I accepted the situation because I was about to update the computer to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
After I did a clean install of Windows 7. The wireless card was working fine immediately after the install. The device manager recognized it (I checked because that was the problem I had been having with Vista). I used the computer for about an hour. I hoped
 that the problem would not come back with Windows 7, so I allowed it to run Windows Update. But immediately after I updated and restarted, the wireless card stopped working again. Once again it does not seem to be recognized by the computer.<br />
<br />
This time, however, once I uninstalled the updates the problem remained. I have re-installed the wireless card drivers. I am out of ideas. I have been on the phone with Microsoft Support for several hours now, and they are shifting the blame to a faulty wireless
 card. But I know that the card worked perfectly up until the Windows Update ran. There's a very very low chance that my wireless card broke right as I installed the updates - especially since I had this problem with Windows Updates in Vista. Does anyone here
 have any ideas?

            Hi Choggner,<br />
<br />
When it comes to flashing the BIOS you need to make sure you know what your doing or you could end up with a totally dead motherboard, you may want to try googling something like "BIOS Flashing guide" and reading a few articles first so that you have it all
 down, and maybe try the HP forums in case there's any proprietary methods they employ.<br />
<br />
With that being said, its a fairly straight forward process usually, though OEM Manufacturers (Acer, Dell, HP etc) tend to make things a bit more difficult as they are usually pretty slow in releasing updated BIOS'.<br />
<br />
Step-by-step for BIOS flashing varies from manufactuer to manufacturer..&nbsp; some will have a built in BIOS Flashing tool in the BIOS itself, which makes things easy, others use an online BIOS update method (which I don't really trust myself) others require a
 Floppy Disk Drive, and flashing utilities ( i.e AWDFLASH) which are run from DOS, needing a startup diskette to boot to DOS first before then running the AWDFALSH utility.<br />
<br />
I've avoided buying OEM PC's for some years now since I had difficulty in getting a motherboard BIOS update when I wanted to upgrade my CPU, and it needed a BIOS update to recognise it, which took a lot of digging to find out the origins of the motherboard
 used by (Acer in my case).&nbsp; These OEM manufacturers usually use a branded motherbaord which they then give a model no. of their own, but it is possible sometimes to identify the original manufacturer of the motherboard and obtain a BIOS update direct from
 the original motherboard manufacturer.<br />
<br />
However if HP have provided an updated BIOS then you should be able to avoid those steps.<br />
<br />
From your post above it sounds as if one of HP's methods for updating the BIOS is done using an online BIOS update tool, I don't like these personally as they can often prove to be unreliable.&nbsp; However its usually possible to obtain the BIOS file and Flash
 it manually.<br />
<br />
THe first thing you need to do is check to see what version BIOS your currently using, an easy method of doing this is to download CPU-Z and open it up and click on the mainboard tab, this will display your BIOS version, another method is to watch carefully
 when booting the PC to read the BIOS version number on the POST pages.&nbsp; Though sometimes these aren't displayed as many OEM PC's display a branding page during POST, though this can usually be disabled in the BIOS.<br />
<br />
Once you establish what your current BIOS version is, next go to the HP website and check to see what the latest available BIOS version for your PC is and see if there is actually a newer version.<br />
<br />
If so try to download the BIOS file, and save it to a USB stick or floppy disk if your PC has a floppy drive. You may need to extract the file first if its a .zip or .rar file.<br />
<br />
If you have a BIOS update tool incorporated in your BIOS, then you can just re-boot the PC to the BIOS, with the USB stick plugged in, entering the BIOS (Usually by pressing the DEL key repeatedly during POST)
<br />
Navigate to the BIOS update utility in the BIOS and starting it.<br />
Once the BIOS Update utility is running it should give you a screen with details of your exisitng BIOS and a section to choose a new BIOS file. (this would be the file saved on the UBS stick)<br />
You may need to switch between available drives before it will find the drive with the new BIOS file, usually using the TAB key to tab between the available drives, you will have a split section of 2 panes, 1 with a list of drives on one side and the available
 directories for the selected drive in the other. <br />
TAB through the available drives until you see the BIOS file in the other pane.<br />
Once you see the BIOS file listed using the cursor keys to navigate the cursor to highlight the BIOS file and hit enter<br />
You will then usually be prompted asking if you are sure you want to update the BIOS, hit 'Y' and the BIOS flash will start.<br />
It's imperative that you do not switch off the PC while the BIOS is being flashed, or until you get a message that "BIOS succesfully flashed", if for any reason it says the BIOS flash failed, DO NOT TURN OFF the PC until you get a succesful flash message.<br />
It's normal when the BIOS successfully flashed message appears for it to say that the PC will re-start within x seconds, this means that all is well, and the new BIOS has been flashed.<br />
When the PC re-boots, I usually enter the BIOS again before letting it boot to Windows, to manually check all the settings, and enable/disable those settings that are necessary/unecessary....<br />
<br />
Method 2<br />
======<br />
<br />
If there is no built in tool in the BIOS then you may need to to use a Flashing utility from DOS in which case you will need:<br />
<br />
Startup disk to boot to DOS or a bootable USB key (a bootable USB key is simple to do, and I beleive that HP even have a utility that creates one automatically)<br />
If you have or make a bootable USB Keyyou will need the new BIOS file saved to it<br />
If you are using a floppy disk method, then you will need 2 floppy disks, a startup disk and a seperate disk with the awdflash utility and the BIOS file saved on it. (Depending on the size of the BIOS file you may need another disk for this alone, so 3 disks
 in total, the startup disk, a disk with awdflash, and a disk with the BIOS file.<br />
<br />
OK so I'll go through the USB key method first..<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Boot the PC with USB Plugged in and enter the BIOS </li><li>Navigate to the BOOT Priority page and change the order so that your USB Drive is the 1st BOOT Device
</li><li>Save and exit the BIOS at which point the PC will re-boot and should now boot to the USB Drive
</li><li>Provided you have configured the USB Key Drive correctly to be a bootable drive it should start loading the files necessary to boot to DOS and you will be presented with a "A:\&gt;" prompt, or other Drive designator for your USB Key Drive i.e. "C:\&gt; "&nbsp; "D:\&gt;"
</li><li>At this prompt you need to type "AWDFLASH.EXE" without the quotation marks and hit enter, this will load the flashing utility
</li><li>When it's loaded you will see the the screen that lists your current BIOS and below at the bottom it will give you the choices available for navigating etc...&nbsp; TAB, Left, Right, Up and Down Cursor keys, Enter, F10, Esc etc....etc and their functions.
</li><li>Use these keys to navigate to and select the New BIOS and follow the onscreen instructions to proceed with the BIOS flash.
</li><li>It will usually check the BIOS file integrity first, then will delete the old BIOS and load the new BIOS
</li><li>Once completed you will be given a message saying so and you can then exit the program at which point you will be returned to the DOS prompt.
</li><li>Remove the USB key and re-start the PC and enter the BIOS again, and change the boot priority back to the original order, save and exit the BIOS and that's it your all done.
</li><li>The PC will re-boot and on starting, Windows (all being well) should detect the Wireless Network Adapter, i.e New Hardware Found,&nbsp; and will load the necessary drivers, and you should be able to enable the wifi adapter again in the network connections screen.
</li></ol>
<br />
The Floppy Disk Method is only slightly different.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Start the PC and go to the Boot Priority Settings page, and set it so that the floppy disk is your 1st Boot Device, insert the startup floppy disk, then save and exit the BIOS, the PC will re-start.
</li><li>On re-starting it should boot from the floppy drive and the startup disk, booting you to a DOS prompt A:\&gt;
</li><li>At this point you can now remove the startup disk and insert the disk with the AWDFLASH utility saved on
</li><li>Once the disk is inserted, at the A:\&gt; prompt type AWDFLASH.EXE and hit enter to load the Flashing Utility, once it has ful;ly loaded, and you need to navigate to the new BIOS file, you can again swap floppy disks and insert the floppy with the BIOS file
 saved to it. </li><li>Select the BIOS file and follow the same steps as above for the USB method. </li></ol>
<br />
Those are the main ways of manually flashing the BIOS, and IMO the safest methods.&nbsp; I dislike the online updating methods but thats just a personal thing.<br />
<br />
The online methods I've come across usually involve the BIOS file being downloaded to the PC, by the updater software, which then runs the BIOS update within Windows environment, it's possible that the first time you tried this that the incompatible message
 you got was just due to a corrupted download of the BIOS file, trying it again, may see it work, and it is a lot easier if your not familiar with DOS etc...<br />
<br />
The only other thing I can add is that if your uncertain of anything Google is your friend.. :D<br />
<br />
@Barb Bowman<br />
<br />
After further consideration I think the BIOS corruption that occurred with me was most likley due to the numerous hard reboots I had to do as a result of the whole wmpnetwork service crashing MCE, I can't say for sure that it was only AVI files that saw it
 happen, as nearly all my files are Xvid AVI files, though it also happened on 2 occasions whilst tryingto play a DVD from the DVD drive, and also when mounting an Image file.<br />
<br />
I havn't had any problems since disabling the wmpnetwork service, but I'm sure it can be re-produced if I re-enable it, just got to wait and see if MS gets a fix for it in the (I Hope) not too distant future..!!<br />
<br />
Or if you hear of a workaround I'd be grateful if you could post details for me.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>
</p><p>I did it with the addition of a Registry Key "<strong>DisableAcrylicBackgroundOnLogon</strong>", set to 1, Google for further details if you need to. However it strikes me that a "cosmetic" change like this should be easily user customisable (i.e. not have
 to use RegEdit), better still, user should be prompted to keep or revert the feature on first login after the upgrade. A "settings changed this upgrade" icon &nbsp;could be added to the "settings"&nbsp; App, so that these optional features can all be tweaked from one
 well know place. It seems ridiculously contradictory&nbsp;that a feature added to make life easier for a user is so difficult to configure.</p>

<p>Sat. 07/27/2019 @11:40 am CDT - Good morning. Please note that I tried to do the Registry version of the solution proposed. However, the key recommended to start with didn't exist in my registry. I checked twice to make sure. This is for Win10 / 1903, installed
 earlier this month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, the Personalization solution of just turning off all transparencies didn't fix the problem, either. I believe there was one more proposed, which I'll try shortly. And for the record, I'm not a rookie; been changing settings in the Registry for
 a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let the forum know what the outcome of #3 turned out to be. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1903 Update introduces lock screen blurring when connecting to a Windows session. Problem I have is that prevents the user from appreciating the wallpaper I set specially for the lock screen as opening a Windows session can be quite long. I suggest there

<p>Hi Shenmue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I agree there should be a "switch" in the settings app to disable "Only" the
 "Hack" out there that will do it, BUT I would Never Suggest anyone to Hack there registry. And if you do, Always make sure you have a Backup of the registry first(Preferably a Complete Disk Image). But for the time being, the best we can do is to Post This
 "Suggestion" for a Disable Switch In Settings On the "Feedback Hub". this way MS engineers will have a better chance of seeing it and possibly adding this to a upcoming Update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I Hope This Help You</p>

<p>OMG</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blur on the lock screen is intentional. It's one of Windows 10's new design elements, called 'Acrylic.' It was implemented because so many people complained that the existing design was flat and boring. They wanted a return to something more like Windows
 Vista's Aero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft knew that many of its users, perhaps most, were fine with flat and boring, because eye candy doesn't improve Windows' performance but it does place a burden of the graphics subsystem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so Microsoft made it possible to turn off the Acrylic feature:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors &gt; Transparency effects &gt; Off</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works. If it doesn't, then you've got a problem that's not caused by Acrylic. There's no need to edit the registry to make this happen.</p>

    <title>Black screen after start up in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> finhuman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after start up in Windows 10</h2>
                    I am facing the problem with Windows 10 Pro. I am running Windows on&nbsp; a laptop, witch has dual GPUs&nbsp; (Nvidia and Intel). I have downloaded the latest drivers for Nvidia chip set. Although I can not download latest beta drivers for Windows 10 from Intel.
 Windows had download previous version driver called 15.28.24.4229. After i reboot the laptop black screen appears and i can not go into desktop. The only way to get into desktop is by closing laptop lid for a few seconds and opening it again. I have booted
 Windows in the safe mode and it works fine. Any ideas how to solve this annoying issue?

            &nbsp;If you upgrade to windows 10 and only get a black screen ... &nbsp;I had three computers with this issue and spent 5 hours on it including 1 hour with Microsoft. They accidently fixed it enough for me to figure out the real problem. Windows 10 was treating
 our single screen computers as if they had dual monitors - the black screen was the other monitor. So ultimately, we were eventually able to right click on the screen and bring up display settings and delete the extra (nonexistant monitor). Our dual monitor
 computer also had a similiar problem reading three screens instead of two and again we went into the display settings and deleted the "nonexistent monitor" &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;if you mouse is not showing on the black screen try scrolling right or left the length of a "monitor"

            I have tried scrolling to the sides of the monitor, but nothing. The only way i can access desktop currently is by closing laptop lid for couple of seconds and opening it again. Also by connecting my laptop to an external monitor, "fixes" the problem.
 This is such a ludicrous problem, hopefully Microsoft will provide an update soon.<br />

    <title>What are wbem logs &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gillacutte  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are wbem logs &#63;</h2>
                    In the system32 files there is a folder named wbem which contains logs of information. There is one that is named [wmiprov] and reads that files were being deleted and replaced I think. There is another folder that reads that Binary data was changed. This
 is a line {WDM event &amp;&amp; WMIBinMof.BinaryMofEventChanged=true. I guess my question would be is this a normal computer function?

            It's work done by Windows Management Instrumentation and it's normal.&nbsp; It's best not to muck about with this as it may invite problems which may cause some Windows components to stop working and a lot of troublesome headaches!&nbsp; If you break WMI you may
 find yourself having to reinstall Windows to fix it.<br />

<h2>            Unable to login to system i keep getting Password Incorrect in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original Title: Windows 10 not able to login&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using an ASUS X551CA laptop running Windows 10. I upgraded from 8.1 a little over two months ago, with no issues. Recently, my PC began running noticeably slower and I began getting occasional popups. Thinking I had some sort of malware, I decided to
 do something about it. I restarted my laptop in Safe Mode, but when it turned back on, it was stuck in airplane mode. It also made me login with my Microsoft account password instead of the usual password I have set to it. No password I tried worked, and believe
 me, I tried. My correctly spelled Microsoft password nor my local PC's password worked, as well as many old passwords I tried. I just keep getting "Password is incorrect." I cannot open the command prompt or reset the laptop, as well as do many other things,
 as I need to login. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>First off, thank you for trying to help with my problem.</p>
<p>Yes, I can login to my account online.</p>
<p>I have made sure that my PC is using an English keyboard, but my password was still not accepted. &nbsp;I reset it through the link you offered, but that didn't do any good either. I also tried plugging it into my router via Ethernet. That also did not work.</p>

<p>fine, here we go again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I pre ordered gears of war 4 for pc and xbox, I redeemed my code, on the xbox site, (which there were NO instructions for)&nbsp; by pre ordering you are supposed to be able to play 4 days early, on the 7th, now I cannot see how to get
 to play this on pc, it does not show up under games for windows marketplace, so how do I play it, or is it not unlocked yet for pc?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This depends the version you pre-ordered.</p>
<p>If you took the Ultimate Edition, it is already playable. For the Standard Edition, you will have to wait until the 11th of October</p>
<p>For installing Gears Of War 4 on your PC, do as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check you Windows version by doing WIN+R and type winver then press enter. if you see 1607, you are good! if not, download the update and install it first&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12387/windows-10-update-history</a>&nbsp;
</li><li>Open the Windows Store app from the task bar and head to your account. </li><li>Click on your user picture and choose My Library </li><li>If Gears of War 4 doesn't appear there, click on Show All </li><li>Click on the arrow to download the game </li></ul>
<p>Hope this help!</p>

<p>Hi Battlex99,</p>
<p>Probably stupid question but are you really sure you got a code for Windows 10?</p>
<p>If yes, check the My Library in the Windows Store App located in the task bar.</p>
<p>Let me know</p>

<h2>            Xbox Elite Controller endless RB signal</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p>I have a problem with my XBox Elite Controller. The RB Button always sends signals without clicking on it. There can't bee seen any damage on the controller the buttons all work fine, the triggers and bumpers are all without damage and seem to work fine. I had this problems a few times and after a while it seems to be working again for some time. Then, without any warning the RB is spamming signals again and it's impossible to play with it.</p><p>I already tried another cable and tried it on my XBox and PC. On the XBox I even tried it wireless, always the same problem. I paid 150€ for this thing, cannot be that it is broken just after the warranty expired.</p><p>Is there anything I can do to repair it? What could even be the problem for the controller seems to be in perfect shape? Oh, and yes, the firmware is up to date.</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p><p>Lukas Bode</p><p><br /></p><p>PS: Why doesn't Microsoft have an E-Mail support like every other company in the world?</p>

<h2>            how do I find laptop windows 10 Office 365 password for wifi to connect my wifi scanner</h2>
                    I am trying to connect my Neat connect Scanner model NC1000 to my HP Envy laptop running windows 10 and office 365. The scanner wants to know the wifi password for the laptop connection. To the best of my knowledge, I have never set one. My Hp printer
 connected without a problem, and the scanner connects to my hotspot, so I know the wifi in both units works. Just need a password that I cannot find.

            That sounds like (as can be seen in reviews all over the Internet) a Neat software issue.

    <title>How can I recover lost metro app links - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simdel1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I recover lost metro app links</h2>
                    <p>Today I noticed that I had very little storage space left on my Surface RT running 8.1. Considering I only have 3GB of apps and no files that seemed odd, so I deleted a few worthless game, turned 'offline files' off on One Drive and did a disk clean up.
 I used the disk clean up utility&nbsp;to delete&nbsp;temporary files and old system information (I did a number of system refreshes when I was trying to get my touch cover to work so I presume that created a lot of old system info. This cleared a decent amount of space
 but still only gave me 10GB free. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The big problem was when I went back to the metro start menu. ALL of my downloaded apps were missing from both the start screen and the app list. I tried a system refresh to fix the issue, but it didn't help. The odd thing is that only the pre-installed
 apps and the apps I deleted just before the disk clean up are showing in the app list. I tried downloading some of my old apps, but they 'download' instantaneously from the store suggesting that they are still installed. I can also launch them from the app
 store, but they are still not showing in the app list. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the link between the apps and the start screen have been deleted, but I don't see how a disk clean up could have done that. Regardless of how it happened I just want my apps back now! I'm hoping that there's something I can try before I do
 a full reinstall and start again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simon</p>

 Where the problem is, is it: the internet provider, Microsoft software, the USB modem???????? There is a lot of confusion about where the problem is coming from. I feel Microsoft try to push the issue a way and cannot fix the problem of recurring IP address
 conflict.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>

            <p>Hi thank you for answering so rapidly.</p>
<p>You asking me, if my computer is connected to a Domain network? I have only one computer, no other devise no smart phone no printer, connected to the internet with a USB modem, the Domain name could be my internet provider “Claro”?
<span>&nbsp;</span>I use a SIM card, here they call those card “chip “I can use different internet provider with my modem by changing the “chip”, it is actually a wireless phone line. My modem is from a company base in California, VERYKOOL m1000 is the modem model
 I have. It is difficult to say if the issue is specific to my modem because I get good 3G signal for a few hours then it collapse and the signal is very slow. That’s when I get the message about
<strong>the IP address conflict</strong>, I also get, <strong>after a diagnose on the, local network</strong>
<strong>“DNS server not responding”.</strong> Today 3-30-14 I have a good signal. I will get a friend’s computer to do what you said. To get another USB modem it’s difficult they cost $50.00 here it is a lot of money for me. How can we find out if another computer
 is using the same IP address? You can call me GP thank you very much for helping me.

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on this issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
For DNS server follow the below steps and check for any errors listed in event viewer–</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click Start. Type <strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
ipconfig /flushdns (there is a space between ipconfig and / ).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It will show the message <strong>successfully flushed the DNS resolver cache.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
ipconfig /registerdns (there is a space between ipconfig and / ).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><span>ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and /).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
The ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If your IP address for your Local Area Connection is either 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (where x is any number), then your computer is not getting an IP address from the router.&nbsp;
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If that is the case, try this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>. <strong>ipconfig /release </strong>in the command prompt and press<strong> Enter.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>· <strong>ipconfig /renew </strong>in the command prompt and press <strong>
Enter.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Test it again by typing ipconfig /all to see what the address is?&nbsp; (If you are on a home router, it should start with either 192.168.1.x or 192.168.0.x or 10.x.x.x).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
If the issue persists you may refer and use the steps provided below and as mentioned in the provided link -</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Click on Start and then Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Go to Networking and sharing center and then click on Change adapter settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Right click on Local Area Connection and choose properties.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Highlight Internet Protocol Version 6 and click on Properties.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Choose Obtain DNS servers address automatically and press Ok.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Choose Obtain IP address automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. Repeat the steps for Internet Protocol version 4 as well.</span></p>

<h2>            Various BSOD errors - Fresh install of Win 10. Whea Uncontrollable Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have been experiencing many BSOD errors over a number of months. I've performed a reinstall of Win 10 on the existing boot drive and with the issues continuing, I installed a fresh Win 10 installation from a bootable USB on separate M.2 SSD. This is now
 the boot drive. Installation happened around 24th March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around 1st April -&nbsp; After a few days of computer running, the computer had crashed with a BSOD and provided a minidump. I found a BIOS update for the motherboard, so I updated this to test if the slightly out of date BIOS may have been the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today (8th April) - BSOD in the process of closing Civilization 5, after playing a multiplayer game. Some of these details are probably not relevant. But it was interesting that the computer threw a BSOD - Whea Uncontrollable Error upon clicking on 'Exit'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minidump, HWMonitor export, MSINFO export and Speccy export are uploaded to this One Drive folder. I've included a Event viewer thing for the bug check log entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqfpQlewbR2Vgw1ZSUEnZ_Hurz20</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been ongoing for quite a while and seems to only happen when playing games on the computer. Seems I can edit photos, videos, play movies, etc without much issue. However when playing a game - Diablo 3, Civ 5, Citiy Skylines, etc. The computer will
 crash. As such I've always believed that problems with Geforce drivers and the Geforce utilities software was causing these issues and I was constantly updating the graphics drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I performed a number of BIOS and other driver updates but to no avail.</p>
<p>In a process to eliminate issues with the boot SSD drive, I have performed a fresh install of Win 10 on a new M.2 drive as described above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The things I'm concerned about are hardware failures. RAM, Motherboard, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Requesting assistance to review the minidump and associated files. Planning to run Driver Verifier after posting this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very much appreciate any assistance you guys are able to provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<br />It looks like an Instruction error in the L1 Cache:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>Error         : ICACHEL1_IRD_ERR (Proc 3 Bank 3)</code></pre>
<br />
<br />It can be due to overclocking, heating or defect.
<br />Please run Open Hardware Monitor and post the temperatures while playing games.

            I adjusted the power settings to balanced and WHEA error is gone. I never have such issues with Win 7/8 until 10. Bizarre.

<p>Thanks for the such quick reply. I've installed open hardware monitor and ran it for about 44 minutes while playing Civ 5. I have a few saves of the monitoring, GPU didnt go above 62 and CPU cores stayed around 47 degrees. No crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep trying to get it to crash and reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, nothing is overclocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>L1 Cache - that's on the CPU right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

</p><p>I've played some Civ 5 for a little while, no crashes. I've saved a few reports from Open Hardware Monitor as requested. They have been uploaded the same One Drive location as the rest of the files.&nbsp;</p>

            Yes, L1 Cache is on the CPU. I would wait for the next crash. If that happens, please post the new dump file.

<p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your insights and assistance so far. I've used the computer a few times since my last post and haven't had a crash until this evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have Speccy / HWmonitor, etc running but I received an IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL system failure message.&nbsp;<br />
I have uploaded minidump file and monitoring files from the minutes after the system booted up. These are located here.<br />
</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqfpQlewbR2Vgxfs_HaRrWQlXSZm</p>
<p>
</p><p>The circumstances for the crash seem to be similar to other crashes. I was exiting the game I was playing (Civ 5) and upon exiting to Windows the BSOD happened. Computer seemed to be running fine through the game and before, however, at the moment of the
 game exiting, and the computer bringing Windows up, the system crashed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope these files help. I appreciate the assistance very much.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim.</p>
