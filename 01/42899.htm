<h2>            Minecraft launcher showing as open but not</h2>
                    <p>Hi, A week or so ago my Minecraft launcher just stopped opening.</p>
<p>It will show as the selected tab on the bar at the bottom as shown by this photo, but is nowhere on either of my two screens. I have uninstalled and reinstalled many times, deleted the game information file before reinstalling. I have downloaded the installed
 again and tried that, I have changed my computer settings to only have one monitor, and to duplicate the display. and I still cannot find the launcher.</p>

<p>When attemting to install a printer the laptop comes up with a message .."RESGISTRY EDITTING DISABLED BY ADMINISTRATOR"... Funny but I thought I was the owner / administrator of the laptop. How do you enable the registry setting connected to this and why
 does it do that. Not the 1st hard drive to do that and display that message. </p>

<strong>(1)</strong>this thing normally happens due to malware.. if u have a antivirus solution update its definitions and have a full system scan.. else install mse

<p>
</p><p>On the Sign in Screen right below the error message you have Sign-in option, Click on it and choose login with pin option. Enter your Pin to login to your computer.<br />
If the option is not visible restart your computer once, check if it helps.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>How does this answer add any info at all that is not already in the topic title? Completely useless...</p>
<p>Obviously, login by PIN is a completely pointless option. I have never been asked to set up any PIN for the account.</p>

<p>Go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Computer Management / Disk Management and see if your D drive is listed there.&nbsp; If so, hover your mouse over the D drive icon until a text message appears and then copy down that message EXACT as it reads
 in the order presented and post it here.&nbsp; It not, it really isn't being recognized.</p>
<p>Go to Start / Control Panel / Device Manerer and look for your D drive there.&nbsp; If you find it then double lick on it to show more details.&nbsp; Does it say that it's working properly?&nbsp; If it doesn't show up there then the system doesn't even have device drivers
 for it.</p>
<p>Is your D drive a hard disk drive or partition or a CD/DVD drive or what?&nbsp; What is the manufactuer, make, and model or your computer and for D drive?</p>
<p>Try removing the D drive and unpludding and replugging in the connections to see if that might be the problem.</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may
 need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the
 drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with burning
 software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Try to post
 any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;drive missing (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command
 prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span>

<p><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if
</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free
 trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:
</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the
 free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span> and let it run
 all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>.&nbsp; If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the
 article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution
 is not going to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp;
</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify
 devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you need then for for D drive at least and any others you have time to do - they may
 help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h3> misterxblonde  say:</h3>
<h2>            Witcher 3- will not launch</h2>
                    
<p>After downloading witcher 3 from the disc onto the console I tried to launch it and I get a black screen and then immediately get kicked back to the dashboard. I have tried everything suggested including unplugging the power, getting a new copy of the game,
 and completely resetting the Xbox back to factory settings. The consoles OS is up to date. The weird thing is that after uninstalling and reinstalling while offline I got through the opening title sequence and began the set up of the game before I'm kicked
 back out to the dashboard. I'm not sure what else I can do, any suggestions?</p>

<p>I am having the same issue but this isn't the first game I've had this issue with. &nbsp;Although the message is extremely vague, this one is on the MS side and not a problem with your game or system. &nbsp;The game, especially for people with digital copies, has
 been becoming more and more sluggish since 1.03. &nbsp;It being down at the moment is likely an attempt to fix that issue.</p>

<h2>            need to clean up start up menu, so need to open defender, but getting errors... now what&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Ok, computer running terribly slow. I'm trying to clean up the start up menu and remove a couple programs to see if that will help. However you have to open defender for that, and unfortunately I'm getting error messages saying that defender can't start,
 and to hunt for info on manually starting services. Can't find that info, nor have I riddled out how to get defender to open.</p>
<p>So, looking for either this magic info on how to trick defender into opening, or I just need back way around it for cleaning up start up menu.</p>
<p>If anyone can lend a hand, would be much appreciated... before I threaten to teach the lapop to fly!</p>

<p>You don't need Defender for that.&nbsp; In fact there's a better option.&nbsp;<span>Go to</span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 run Autoruns and click on the Everything Tab.&nbsp; There you will see everything that starts at startup and you can start cleaning - but be careful, because some of those entries are required to run Windows and removing them could prevent you from being able to
 boot and may even require a re-installation to resolve.&nbsp; Be sure you&nbsp;know what you're removing before you do it.</span></p>
<p><span>As far as running slow,&nbsp; maybe all you need is a little maintenance.&nbsp; Here are some options:</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of
 various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software
 solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can
 handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM and the 64-bit verion can use even more).</span></p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster software no matter what it says (scans will tell you you have thousands
 of errors just to get you to download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great
 harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t
 need any help.<br />
<br />
To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Do all of the options.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;</span>When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects
 – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, reponse times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>
 which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you can’t delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which MUST not
 be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same (except for the registry cleaner – no not even Microsoft’s own product is entirely safe and the product has been removed from the paying
 marked for reasons unknown though it’s still available here for now but probably not for long).&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (in fact MSE will disable it as will a number
 of other AV programs - which may explain your Defender Problem).&nbsp; What AV program are you using or have you installed?&nbsp; I would also suggest downloading</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean&nbsp;a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>================================================================================================================</span></p>
<p><span>As far as Defender goes, here's an article on troubleshooting Windows Defender won't start problems&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555962/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555962/en-us</a>
 (if it is a problem - as noted above, it may be intentionally disabled by an AV program in which case it should remain disabled to prevent conflicts, freezes, crashes, and all sorts of other problems by running both at the same time).&nbsp; If that doesn't help,
 post back with the name of your AV program and we'll go from there.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Why Does Xbox Live Never Ban The Modders&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orcaamity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Does Xbox Live Never Ban The Modders&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm sick and tired of going on GTA and finding nothing but modders in every game ruining the fun. &nbsp;It was bad enough ages ago when they made themselves bomb proof and bullet proof and now they keep on blowing all the cars up all over Liberty City, blowing
 us up and setting fire to us when they are nowhere near us and re-spawning us all over the map. &nbsp;Why is it when I report the modders for System Tampering and Cheating they always get away with it.? &nbsp;It's also bad enough Rockstar don't bother patching their
 games to either stop modders or to make it harder for them. &nbsp;Is this the sort of thing we're going to get when GTA V comes out, modders modding everything as soon as the game is released? &nbsp;I know Xbox Live do nothing because one time me and most of a full
 game reported a modder under the same thing and that modder was still modding weeks later; I know because I saw him modding when I bumping into him again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>a lot of us want a nice enjoyable game and we never can because of the modders messing everything up and when people and me ask them to stop they laugh at us like retards and telling us they are only having a bit of fun. &nbsp;That's true, everytime they are
 having fun nobody else is. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox Live were quick enough to ban a friend of mine many months ago all because he hacked the colour of his avatar hat. &nbsp;Wow, all he did was hacked the colour of his avatar hat and they never only suspended him for that, they banned him. &nbsp;when modders mod
 games and ruin people's fun and stop us getting what we paid for such as when we buy a DLC, the modders get away with it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>BioHAZARD. &nbsp;Are you having a laugh? &nbsp;Why, why, why should I go to a private game or trade my GTA in all because of the modders? &nbsp;Why should I lose out on public games or why should I lose out on the whole game all together all because of the modders? &nbsp;If
 the modders want to mod, why can't they go to a private game and leave others alone that want to play the game in public. &nbsp;Why should decent players like myself lose out all because of the modders. &nbsp;It like the innocent get punished to serve the guilty. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Blazing Saddle. &nbsp;I wonder who they ban, people that don;t do serious things. &nbsp;I remember a time when me and a whole game reported a pervert and I told everyone to make sure they report him under Text And Voice Communications and In-Game Voice so that Xbox
 Live know we are reporting him over the same thing. &nbsp;Then I bumped into him a couple of hours later and he was doing the same thing and I asked everyone to file a complaint against him and they agreed and I told them to file it under the same thing to make
 it count as us all complaining over the same thing. &nbsp;Two games full of people that filed a complaint against the same pervert and a week later he was still on Xbox Live. &nbsp;I checked his profile before then everyday and after everyday for two weeks and it never
 said Code Of Conduct in it. &nbsp;So it seems Xbox Live let him get away with it. &nbsp;Last week I had a message from Xbox Live thanking me for making the community a safer place recently. &nbsp;I haven't filed any complaints on anyone recently so what were they talking
 about. &nbsp;Then some friend of mine told me they got the same message. &nbsp;Interesting that Xbox Live sent out a bogus message to us all. &nbsp;I'd expect that from idiots that live in a dream world thinking Microsoft will give away free 1600 points for visiting a site
 when it's not a free offer, it's a scam that a lot of idiots believe in.</p>

<p>IssacClarke. &nbsp;I told Rockstar many times and before things got from bad to worse Rockstar asked me to send them videos of modders and I did and Rockstar did nothing. &nbsp;Also they have asked for videos again and I told them I'm not wasting anymore of my time
 making videos when they sit back and do nothing to strop the modders. &nbsp;I also told Rockstar I don;t need to make videos to prove this when some people from Rockstar on'y have to enter some games and they are bound to find modders very quick and easy because
 most of the games are modded. &nbsp;I bet Rockstar never came in to see for their lazy selves. &nbsp;All they are interested in is patching all the fun glitches. &nbsp;It's bad enough they leave annoying glitches in their games and they don't do anything to stop the modders,
 either.</p>

            As it turns out, it is an Exel and Word problem too. The primary problem is with color. On neither Excel nor Word can I use color - e.g., When I try to change color on a font or in a cell on Excel or try to make the border of a cell &nbsp;something other than
 black, &nbsp;no color shows up. &nbsp;This color problem also manifests itself in Money by displaying the screen in all black and &nbsp;white. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;thanks &nbsp;CLAY

<h2>            Windows 10 free upgrade 2017</h2>

 and they extended the free upgrade? Also, if it is, is there any way to download it before the 29th of July? It states that my free download will be after July 29th.

<h2>            Can I upgrade Windows Vista 32-bit to Windows 7 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;Win7 Upgrade.</div>
Hi,<br />
<br />
1) I have Vista Home Premium 32bit sp1 on my laptop, I want to upgrade to Win7. Do I have to upgrade to Win7-32bit ver. or can I upgrade to the Win7-64bit ver?<br />
<br />
2) I used the Win7 Upgrade advisor and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (a) the only incompatible device was: Nvidia GeForce 8600M GS - graphics card&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (b) the only incompatible program was : DisplayLink Core Software ver. 4.5.13507.0.<br />
<br />
So, is it OK to upgrade to Win7?<br />
<br />
All suggestions appreciated.<br />
<br />
S Mehta<br />

            <p>You choose either 32 or 64 bit, however, if you go with 64 bit, you will have to do a custom clean install.
</p>
<p>there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
</p>
<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.
</p>
<p>Check nVidia's website for updated drivers for your video card, you can install them now (preferably) or store them somewhere and install them after installation.</p>

<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>

<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>

<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

<p>Hello Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One factor which have caused the issue is due to the network driver which needs to be updated. To isolate the issue, kindly update your network driver. You may update your network adapter by simply following the steps provided in the article below.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, kindly perform a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you
 run a program in Windows 10. You may follow the steps provided in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are having trouble with the settings and software for the Microsoft product you described you may need to contact the website directly
 for that product. One thing I did find in my research is that there is a download available from the compatibility website located below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Microsoft LifeCam VX-7000 - web camera&amp;v=Microsoft&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;s=VX-7000&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Microsoft%20LifeCam%20VX-7000%20-%20web%20camera&amp;v=Microsoft&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;s=VX-7000&amp;os=32-bit</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Please try the download listed here and see if it helps to resolve the problem. If the problem persists
 you might try going to the Microsoft hardware site that offers support for that particular device.</span></span></p>

                    The "dingdong" sound Windows usually makes when connecting to a network occurs randomly on my new Dell 990 64-bit W7. Happens about 4-5 times an hour at seemingly random intervals.<br />
<br />
Any idea what this is and how I can turn it off?<br />
