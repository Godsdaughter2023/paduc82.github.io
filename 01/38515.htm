<p>
</p><p>The message in "Device status" is that "The drivers for this device are not installed There are no compatible drivers for this device."&nbsp;</p>

            The reality is sometimes, systems manufactured even within the last few years can demonstrate some compatibility issues. Your model in particular was manufactured around 2015, which could have been prior to Windows 10's release in mid 2015. 
<br />
<br />I would perform the downgrade to Windows 10 1803 at least if you were running that version before this problem started.

<p><span>Let's check your hard drive with diagnostic software.&nbsp;
<span>
To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
</span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</a>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>and/or
 get the diagnostic software directly from the manufacturer.&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Go to Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Computer Management / Disk Management and check the C drive partition.&nbsp; How much space does it have and how much is showing available.&nbsp; Hover your mouse over the C drive partition and a tesxtbox will open with some features listed.&nbsp;
 Please post all those features EXACTLY as they appear.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be </span><span>sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have
 to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (it works a bit different than the above instructions but if you follow the prompts on the disks and know the above information you should be able to restore with no problems).<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will probably want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot so it will run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Win 10 minimising apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aciobaniteiandrei - daniel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 minimising apps</h2>
                    I had this problem on one of my 5 computers. All my programs are randomly starting to minimise without any possibility to reopen them back. Now after updates two of my computers are having same problem and i lost hundreds of hours of work. I need to restart
 my computers at every 5 minutes. I have read all responses and microsoft wasnt able to remediate this problem from no one until now... i still have 3 working computers but i won't wait them to get same problem. All advices from microsoft and talking about
 corupted files and registry does not resolve nothing at all..i tried any solution i could find on the internet to avoid reinstall windows because i have 30 Tb of data. But after 3 months of pain...bye bye windows 10!!! I will revert to win 7 on all my computers.
 Win 10 really sucks after these so called updates. Shame on you Microsoft support and developpers ! Better don't laynch updates at all than destroy our work ! Shamw on you !

<h2>            Drive not accessible. Access is denied.__Western Digital 2TB External HD Model &#35;WDBAAU0020HBK-01</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a new Western Digital 2TB External HD Model #WDBAAU0020HBK-01 and hooked it up to a Windows XP machine with Service Pack 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;I coppied a fair amount of data to this WD External HD and everything worked great.&nbsp; No issues with anything until:</p>
<p>The maching I had it hooked up to has been updated to Windows 7 64-bit Operating System.&nbsp; When I first hook up the WD External HD it says new hardware found and installs it and says it's ready to use.&nbsp; The drive letter shows up in Windows Explorer but when
 I select it, it gives me: F:\ is not accessible.&nbsp; Access is denied.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have unhooked the WD External HD and restarted the OS and hooked the External HD back up and now it tells me: You need to format the disk in drive F: before you can use it. It then gives
 me an option to format it.&nbsp; I really don't want to format it because I will lose all the data on the drive.&nbsp; Is there any way around this?</p>
<p>I hooked up the WE External HD to 3 different Computers that had Windows XP installed on them and I get these same results: The drive letter shows up in Windows Explorer but when I select it, it gives me: F:\ is not accessible.&nbsp; Access is denied.</p>
<p>I looked in Devise Manager on the OS with Windows 7 64-bit and the WD External HD is listed there and shows: This device is working properly. Also went to driver update and says driver is up to date.&nbsp; Under Volumes in Device Manager for this WD External
 HD there is nothing listed.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; (I'm hoping I don't have to format the WD External HD)</p>
<p>Thanks much!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CDK</p>

            You probably should go back to the sharing tab and undo the Share first of all. Next, to carry out Ajay K's suggestion you need to see the Security Tab which means first you need to have Simple File Sharing disabled. This can be done from My Computer -
 Tools - Folder Options - View Tab - Untick box for Simple File Sharing. Security Tab should now be available when you right click on Files , Folders or Drives.&nbsp;Best of luck.

<p>Mine has no sharing enabled and I still have no security tab. Only some folder show this error. but the errors are consistent on my XP computer, My Windows 7 computer and my Windows 8.1. None of the systems have been altered since the drive was last working
 Except that some of the folders were added with a mac book air. those were the first to show the error, but now the error is coming up on some of the first folders created on my xp system. the tabs that are available are &nbsp;General, Autoplay, Tools, hardware,
 Sharing , and Quota.</p>

    <title>GTA IV SAVED GAMES - conflict with GFWL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikylinr  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA IV SAVED GAMES -  conflict with GFWL</h2>
                    I had to do an emergency format of the pc, as it seemed someone had phisically put a keylogger on the PC. Just a couple of weeks before I bought GTA IV and EFLC. So, before formatting I made a backup of my saved games of GTAIV (I did not yet play EFLC,
 wanted to finish GTTa IV 100% first) and fomrated with "ease of mind". Than when I reinstall GTAIV I cant seem to load the saved games. Before you start, I am aware now of the conflict with the account of GFWL, that I should have backed up info of that account
 to, aso., but I was really advanced in side missions, some of them a bit complicated and all. Also, I know of the alternatives, Xliveless, etc, which would wrap GFWL, and making me able to load my saved games. But what would be the difference with a ìurated
 version than? Even thou I am a paying customer, I have to work my way around with possible legal breaches? And how about future achievments, my 100% goal to be also 100% legal?
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now here it goes. I have actually BOUGHT the games, no one ever gave a warning of "whenever in need of formating your pc, make sure to backup both your saved games and your GFWL ID folder", nor did it occur to me, that , even when I was constantly connected
 to GFWL, it didnt really do anything related to the saved games but relating it and keeping record of achievments, but would be granted the PRIVILEGE to decide whether I CAN OR CANNOT LOAD a previously saved game.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have decided to but GTAIV and have complied to the need to use GFWL with it, although there have been a LOT of problems related to the use of GFWL in the past. PRoblem is, I dont seem to get past the fact I CANNOT LOAD LEGALLY and OWN Saved games from
 my backup.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So yes, I would actually like that someone to subtantiate this state of things. Why Do I have to pay for antipiracy policies, when I am a buying custumer? Do I not deserve a better treatment?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course one shouldnt just shoot the bullet and not give and solutions. How about I option to be able download from my 8and anyones) GFWL account my file to make my saved game work, based on game code and authentication, GFWL account and even Social Club
 logging?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for taking the time to read.&nbsp;</div>

Yep! You just have to get used to the fact that DRM has a <span style="font-style: italic">
bad</span> tendency to punish legitimate users. <br />
I haven't worried about draconian DRM and theoretical legal breaches since I started<br />
using a PC for gaming in '02. I have a noCD fix for about 75 games. I believe I have a right to not have to fish&nbsp; through&nbsp; game boxes for a CD just for a DRM check, particularly when that check
<br />
often sends the CD into a two minute or longer spin, in some cases. Bats-Arkham City is one of<br />
the worst examples of this.<br />
<br />
Bad enough when using a retail disk, but when you buy from Steam and also have to contend<br />
with Monopoly$oft's&nbsp; GFWL marketing vehicle/DRM&nbsp; it just becomes a bit much. I am also an<br />
avid hater of the XBOX controller being pushed by making it a default controller setup in all
<br />
"Games for Windows". Monopoly$oft should stick to making operating systems, imo.<br />
The sad thing is we gamers don't have the money to launch a class action against these corporate giants for their blatant disregard for legitimate users of their precious license.
<br />
<br />
btw - This linking a user name to saves is a real pain. I think this is supposed to relate to cheating,<br />
or some such nonsense . <br />
I lost saves for several games that don't have the same fixes as GTA4 and some other games when accidentally&nbsp; creating a new GFWL&nbsp; account while thinking I was only changing my&nbsp; log in name.
<br />
I believe you can use a different user account and still access those saves, but I was not aware of
<br />
that at the time. Then, of course there are those who have posted here who have had problems when&nbsp; using multiple accounts.<br />
<br />

            in the future, the folder you want to be sure to back up is %localappdata%\Microsoft\XLive. I know I would go ballistic if I lost my GTAIV saves since I've 100% the main game and the two DLCs.<br />

    <title>Consistent BSOD since Intel Microcode Updates &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calvinjh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Consistent BSOD since Intel Microcode Updates &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been recently getting random BSOD from using my machine, which I can only attest to recent Windows updates for the new Intel microcode updates to fix their security problems. My machine has run fine for almost 8 years with various upgrades including
 GPU, ram and CPU(s).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I've mostly been experiencing issues when playing games or doing things which are graphically intensive. For example if I have a game open on one of my monitors and them open a new tab on chrome I got the BSOD but sometimes it happens randomly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't respond with cucked dumb ideas like 'update your drivers' or 'install anti-virus'. I want to know exactly what driver is causing my system to break. I've not experienced&nbsp;system failures like this since Windows Vista or ME.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            Hi Calvin, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s) to see if they can shed any light on the device driver causing the issue:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

</p><p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've modified the system settings to record a minidump whenever it happens again and I will upload it here when it does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I am seeing on the BSOD is WHEA Uncorrectable Error, which seems to be CPU or Power related, but nothing has changed in 5+ years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just hit the same BSOD when restoring my Opera browser with a ton of eBay tabs open, but no dump. I've changed the directory and mini dumps is definitely enabled. I am using the latest NVIDIA driver and windows is up-to-date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of ideas now, but my machine has the following equipment:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - 2 x SSD in Raid configuration attached to an LSI 4 port 6 gig raid card</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - 2 x Intel x5690 not overclocked, in same motherboard with expensive Noctua coolers</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; Intel S5520SC WS Motherboard&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; -64GB Ram DDR3 tested and 100% fine</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - onboard gbe port in use</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - NVIDIA 1070 GTX</p>

</p><p>Hey guys,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to reinstall Windows 10 using the latest x64 image so I could get a clean build. This has installed all of the latest drivers from Microsoft. The only driver I decided to update is the NVIDIA one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I am still getting the random crashes like before, when the machine hits high-load the whole thing locks up, freezes and then reboots. However now I am not getting any BSOD, it just locks-up and reboots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to re-enable the minidumps but before I reinstalled my OS nothing was being logged during the BSOD. I'm also testing an older release of the NVIDIA driver to see if that has caused the issue. I've unplugged everything I don't need which was attached
 to the machine and I've checked the internals for overheating etc, nothing is wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note this PC has been working fine for years, I am pretty sure a recent driver update has caused the issue, either from NVIDIA or due to the changes to the Windows kernel due to the Intel Microcode updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>It seems to me like this has not been at all tested on legacy hardware and most likely my only option will be to ditch Windows and go to Linux, I.E Ubuntu or Fedora which is pretty ridiculous as the only
 purpose for this machine is for playing games on Windows.&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p>

</p><p>Edit: searching around, this seems like it could be an issue with the lack of .NET 3.5 and a potential issue with DirectX. I am installing the Windows SDK and DirectX SDK, along with the DirectX 2010 re-distributable and Visual Studio Professional to bring
 in some missing pieces of software I usually have installed, but most people wouldn't use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you do not see the registry keys in one of the steps provided on that thread, there is a chance that you really don't have it in the registry, and this is fine. You can actually proceed with the next step if you do not see any of these keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, instead of working with the registry editor, we strongly recommend that you do the initial troubleshooting regarding this issue first. We have an article on our support site that might help you with your issue. Kindly visit the link provided

<h2>            Position of mouse pointer does not match screen coordinates clicked - Using XP</h2>
                    I just switched to having dual monitors.&nbsp; When the cursor crosses into the non-primary monitor, it turns 90degrees counter clockwise and its pointer position is about 3/4 inch above where it physically is.<br />
How can I fix this?<br />

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing how it affect only the secondary monitor, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check the status of the issue:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try changing the screen resolution on the secondary monitor, if possible set the screen resolution of both the monitors the same and check if it helps. Refer the following article for detailed steps:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/display_multi_monitors_screen_resolution.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/display_multi_monitors_screen_resolution.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may also check for the screen positioning. On your monitor, open the menu and select 'Auto Adjust'. Refer your monitor manual for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>If the methods mentioned above does not resolve the issue, I would suggest you to set the computer to clean boot state&nbsp;to check for software conflicts.
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong></span><span> </span><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow the ‘<b>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’</b>to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if the issue persists, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Code 19 means there is a driver conflict such as two devices trying to use the same resources.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack.<br />
<br />
Normally the above will fix that issue if not work your way down through these even if you have done<br />
them before.<br />

<h2>            computer freezing - not allowing internet access or Mcafee to run in order to scan computer</h2>
                    My son was on the computer last night when it frooze up on him and he had to turn off manually.&nbsp; When I restarted computer I received the following error "Process id = Oxa48(2632) Thread id = Oxa4c (2636)" and then it asks to terminate program or debugg.&nbsp;
 When you select debugg it say it failed and to debugg manually.&nbsp; The computer eventually freezes where everything stops working including the mouse. And it won't open my Mcafee in order to run a scan to see if there is a virus.

<h3> tommis15  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8&#47;8.1 Clean Install Issue...</h2>
                    Ever since I have started to use computers I have generally loved the OS's that Microsoft releases (with the exception of Vista). I do a little work on the side fixing computers so that I can have enough money to pay for school and so that I can enjoy
 myself. I have ALWAYS have a strong belief of a clean Windows installation. I understand that Microsoft does not want to distribute the windows 8/8.1 ISO's publicly as piracy is a large issue for them. Yes, I know that if you own a retail copy you can use
 the tool from their website to get an ISO. What if you own a computer that you bought from the store (pre-installed) and you have an OEM version of windows that came with no disk...?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Reasons that I might want an ISO?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. OEM OS's usually come with tons of garbage on it.</div>
<div>2. What if my HDD dies or I want to upgrade it to a larger size or to a ssd?</div>
<div>3. Sometimes customers destroy their windows and their recovery partitions (Don't ask me how. I've never done it.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can I get a legitimate disk?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When people spend 800$ on a pc, they don't worry about going out and buying a 250$ retail windows 8.1 pro so that they can fix their pc's...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, might as well put it in here too. When you use the tool provided from MS to download your retail ISO, is the key that you entered stored on the iso? If yes, is they key encrypted or stored in plain text? And if the key is stored on the ISO, do you
 need to still input the key in during install?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand that MS doesn't want their stuff pirated BUT what about legit customers who actually pay for the software (and rightfully "own" it). It seems unfair that those who steal software make our lives miserable and make it harder for us to repair
 our systems.</div>

            That is exactly the issue, you could get a legitimate copy of 7 from digital river and then use your key on the COA so that you can re-activate...
<div><br />
<div>With windows 8, you can't even get the disk, AND there's no COA. The dumbest idea ever was removing it. Even if they faded away in time MS should have made the sticker more durable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I ask for a disk from the manufacture, it will probably have loads (bloatware) of other stuff I don't need.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"OEM activation remains valid as long as the customer uses the OEM-provided image on the computer.", yeah and what if the hdd dies and I want this image?</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a little off topic, but I resolved this preinstalled Windows stuff, hard drive failures, and etc., by making an image of the entire hard drive, and\or each partition...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally use Acronis TrueImage because it will reliably restore the image to a smaller drive, where Windows Images, and others, will not... not even OEM Restore Disks (usually).
</p>
<p>For use on a smaller SSD for instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus... Acronis and some of the other 3rd party imaging programs compress the image...</p>
<p>Along with the fact they are on a bootable CD and don't require installation...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My new HP laptop with a 500GB hard drive ended up as 33GB Image... the entire drive... 3 partitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I most certainly understand your frustration... just making the point that there are a few workarounds.</p>

            Good suggestion and all, thanks.
<div><br />
<div>The problem is: not a clean install. With that said, acronis is an ok alternative if there really is no other way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I usually fix other people's computer's. I very much doubt them asking me to fix their stuff it all of it is backed up w/ acronis.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been reading about the issue of a clean install with Win 8\8.1 that was preinstalled...</p>
<p>It seems a tool in Windows... OEM Activation 3.0 (OA3) ... is triggered to read the license from the Bios...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also read that an image, usb, dvd, etc., should read it and activate, but I have no way of confirming this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This doesn't get you the image in the first place though....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I can suggest is to use a key from a non-preinstalled machine to get the iso...</p>
<p>If it in fact reads the License from the bios, it should be reusable, as each machine would furnish it's own legitimate key..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could do a search for the tool and see if any useful info comes up.... </p>

    <title>Transfer Windows 10 license to re-built computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> javd8180  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Windows 10 license to re-built computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've browsed around and seen multiple differing answers related to this topic. I wanted to state my specific situation to ensure if it would work or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally purchased Windows Vista years ago. This was later upgraded to Windows 7 Pro, which was subsequently upgraded to Windows 10 Pro via the free upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now if I look at my Activation settings, it states my license is activated and linked to my Microsoft account. If I were to rebuild a good chunk of the components (including motherboard), what would be the best set of instructions to re-install Windows
 10? The old components will be scrapped and sold, so this Windows license will only be active on one single computer at a time (i.e. I am not going to keep the original parts as a separate computer with the same license).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not entirely sure if my original license is retail or OEM. I would have to dig through some old records to find out when I bought it and research, however, I can say for a fact that I have upgraded that original PC with mostly new parts at one point
 when I was on Windows 7 and had no issues reinstalling. I get confused with the Windows 10 part as I no longer have a "key."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this(one if you have already run activation troubleshooter)
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi,
<br />unfortunately the upgrade chain is long and there are chances Microsoft cannot track it even your Vista was box version.
<br />There was similar question some days ago and the result was unsuccessful.
<br />You may try to activate Windows by phone but there is no certainty in success.

<p>I purchased the first license of Windows Vista on a PC that I built myself. I know I have upgraded the PC since then (including a new motherboard) and had no issues reinstalling Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I'm understanding correctly, I can upgrade the computer parts again, install Windows 10 Pro and log in to my Microsoft account and just hit troubleshoot to complete the activation?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>A bit unrelated to the original topic, but can I install Windows 10 from the get go? Or would I need to start with Vista, upgrade to Win7, then upgrade again to Win10?&nbsp;</p>

            Assuming the license was retail, yes. In the troubleshooter, you would have to select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Do not do a clean install first. Let the older OS activate and then later do a clean install. You can directly install Windows 10.

            <p>Unfortunately, the People app doesn't support the use of Distribution Lists or Groups at this time. (Whether it ever will I don't know).</p>
<p>Two options:</p>
<p>1. Create your D/Ls on a spreadsheet or Word document or</p>
<p>2. Use a mail client like Windows Live Mail (part of Windows Essentials) or Mozilla Thunderbird, both of which have address books that use D/Ls.</p>

            Hello Ridley12,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />You need to be on Windows 10 V1809 or later to have dark mode supported in File Explorer. As you're on V1803, this is expected. So upgrade to V1809 and the issue will be resolved.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest feature update 1809, should resolve this.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

            I realized earlier that my other computer (I'm currently living with my parents) was on v1809, while this computer is on v1803. This topic can be closed now. And thank you all for attempting to help.

<h2>            WPD FileSystem Volume Driver Error Code 19 &#47; MTP USB Device Error Code 19 &#47; Sansa Clip 4 GB</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have windows 7 professional x64. &nbsp;I have a Sansa Clip 4GB mp3 player (MTP USB Device). &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When I connect it through USB,I get the message "Device Driver Software was not successfully installed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my Device Manager, under Portable Devices, there are two exclamation point devices: MTP USB Device and WPD FileSystem Volume Driver. &nbsp;When I inspect their properties, the Device Status window says for both:</p>
<p>"Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used the trouble-shooter and tried to update driver ... but the message I get when I try to do this is that these are the most up-to-date drivers.</p>
<p>I don't know how to address the "configuration information in the registry" issue, of if that is really the cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

<div><strong>Hi,</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Code 19</strong></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. To fix this problem you can first try running a
<strong>Troubleshooting Wizard</strong> . If that does not work, you should uninstall and then reinstall the hardware device. (Code 19)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Recommended resolutions</strong><br />
A registry problem was detected. <br />
This can occur when more than one service is defined for a device, if there is a failure opening the service subkey, or if the driver name cannot be obtained from the service subkey. Here are some things that you can try to resolve this problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Uninstall and reinstall the driver</strong> <br />
Uninstall the driver from Device Manager and scan for new hardware to install the driver again.</div>
<div>Here is how:</div>
<div>First, please disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:
<br />
1. Click "Start" button, type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotation marks) in the “Search” bar and press "Enter". Click “Continue” if necessary.<br />
2. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
3. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".
<br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.
<br />
<br />
You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may ask for
 the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.</div>
<ol>
<li>On the device Properties dialog box, click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong> . Follow the instructions. </li><li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Open Device Manager, click <strong>Action</strong> , and then click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> . Follow the instructions.
</li></ol>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Revert to the most recent successful registry configuration</strong> This content is designed for an advanced computer user.<br />
The <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> feature is a recovery option that you can use to start your computer by using the most recent settings that worked. The Last Known Good Configuration feature restores all the registry information and driver
 settings that were in effect the last time that the computer started successfully.<br />
