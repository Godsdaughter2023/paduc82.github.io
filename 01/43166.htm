<h2>            &#34;Railworks 3 Train Simulator 2012&#34;</h2>

As the accompanying info booklet says that Windows XP is OK for this programme, how come it's not accepting it?<br />
I see it is recommended that XP have the latest service pack installed. &nbsp;Do I have this and if not, how do I get it?<br />
Kind regards<br />

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I see that when you try to install "Railworks 3 Train Simulator 2012" you get the error "System cannot read from the specified device"".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>At what phase do you get the error?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the following steps and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Let's first verify you are working on a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows XP operating System.</p>
<p>Refer to this link for more information:</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>How to determine whether a computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<br />
<strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>There is no Service Pack three for Windows XP 64-bit, so if you have 64-bit operating system then Service Pack 2 is the latest and if you have 32-bit then Service Pack 3 is the latest.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To know which service pack is installed on the computer try this:</p>
<p>Click <strong><span>Start</span>,</strong> right-click <span><strong>My Computer</strong></span>, and then click
<strong><span>Properties</span>.</strong></p>
<p>If <span>Service Pack 3</span> is listed in the <span>System</span> section, SP3 is already installed on your computer and you don't need to follow the instructions below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>If <span>Service Pack 3 is not installed then you may refer to<strong> </strong>
this link for help:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Learn how to install Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3)</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/help/learn-how-to-install-windows-xp-service-pack-3-sp3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/help/learn-how-to-install-windows-xp-service-pack-3-sp3</strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Additionally if you are installing the game using a CD then please refer to this link as well:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How to troubleshoot common problems that occur when a Windows XP-based computer cannot read a CD or a DVD</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/321641</strong></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists or you need further assistance on Windows let us know.</span></p>
<p><span>We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

    <title>Corrupt files but chkdsk does not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrs. basil e. frankweiler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt files but chkdsk does not work</h2>
                    <div>I started getting popup notices that PrivacyIconClient.exe was corrupt. &nbsp;Then a few times reader_sl.exe (Adobe file) and even cmd.exe was corrupt. &nbsp;All of these are in \user\[my_name]\AppData\Roaming.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Anti-virus</strong>: I noticed that Avira wasn't working, so I uninstalled and reinstalled. &nbsp;Oddly, it wouldn't start up when I reinstalled so I installed Avast instead which appears to be working. &nbsp;(I have always had Malawarebytes installed. &nbsp;Perhaps
 Avira and <span>Malawarebytes</span>&nbsp;stopped getting along well.) &nbsp;No viruses found.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've spent about a day looking deeper into things, e.g., Event Viewer, Registry, chkdsk, chkntfs. &nbsp;The Event Viewer has a ton of errors the details of which I'll spare you unless you're interested.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><strong>Chkdsk</strong>&nbsp;(with no parameters which I understand means "info only, please") cannot complete because "Attribute record &lt;###, ""&gt; from file record segment ###&nbsp;<strong>is corrupt</strong>". &nbsp;(I can give the details if you want.) &nbsp;When I try
 to run chkdsk with /f or /r parameters, it says the scan will happen after reboot because volume is in use. (That is correct.) &nbsp;<strong>But after reboot, the check never happens</strong>.</div>

<p><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span>* The upswing is that I get these "[file].exe is corrupt" messages once in a while and cannot get chkdsk to work to fix them. *&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have just noticed that PhotoShop and Illustrator won't work at all (PhotoShop.exe and Illustrator.exe are corrupt) or Adobe Acrobat (AcroRd32.exe is corrupt). &nbsp;These files are in that Roaming directory and the message prompts me to run chkdsk (which
 doesn't work). &nbsp;The good thing is that MS Office, Skype, and web browsers seem to work.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm worried there might be something troubling under the hood.</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The long value you see in BootExecute will not go away until the scheduled chkdsk finishes...&nbsp; well you can make it go away another way but just leave it for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I extracted the autochk.exe from a Windows 7 Pro SP installation ISO and put a Windows Pro SP1 64-bit autochk,.exe on my OneDrive that you can download and save to your desktop or someplace else you can find it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s%21AlzCDddLSsKogRvFLDPlFukukdEa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/u/s!AlzCDddLSsKogRvFLDPlFukukdEa</a></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Of course you will have to rename the file to just "autochk.exe" when you are ready to replace yours but first...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to "take ownership" of the autochk.exe file you have now so you can rename (not delete) and replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This link tells you how to take ownership of a file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/take-ownership-of-file-or-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/take-ownership-of-file-or-folder/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you need to navigate to your system32 folder and <strong>rename </strong>
(not delete) the suspicious autochk.exe file you have now to something you can remember like</p>
<p>
</p><p>autochk.xxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with the autochk.exe file "missing" from your system (because you renamed it) you can copy in the replacement file you downloaded which you have also renamed replacing the missing file with the one you downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with the new autochk.exe in your system32 folder you can reboot and see if that scheduled chkdsk will run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've done everything right and it still fails to run you can boot on a Windows 7 SP1 installation CD and run the chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) from there and maybe that will get things patched up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise I don't have too many other good ideas at the moment.</p>

On HPs web site - you know - those people who make and support the product.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; (IF they decided to support that specific product under whatever operating system you have chosen to run you will find it here:

<h2>            Windows Features Problem&#58; .Net Framework 2.0 and higher</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new laptop and I need to install several programs. However when I go to install them the installer pauses on the installation of .NET Framework 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0. It will give me a separate window saying that the program needs access to a specific
 feature but wont tell me the feature and only allows me to skip the feature, never install it. When I skip this feature my install fails and I am kicked out of installer. When I go to the app section and go to Turn Windows Features On and Off tab, I get a
 separate window that says please wait but never advances from that point. I have updated my primary windows features but I cannot update any .NET features due to similar issues as above. Please help. Specs to follow:</p>

</p><p>For accuracy, we would like to know the exact name of the program you;re trying to install. Have you also checked if the program is compatible with Windows 10? It also seems that you cant access the
<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>. It is normal that it will take several minutes to show all the features. You can try doing it while on

<p>
</p><p>Regarding the error over the .Net Framework, it seems that you're not able to install them. One perfect reason on why it could not be installed is because the version of .Net Framework you're trying to install is already available in the system, it was just
 turned off/disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check it, Go back to the <strong>Turn on Windows feature on or off</strong>. On its windows, look for
<strong>.NET Framework 3.5 (includes .NET 2.0 and 3.0)</strong>, and the <strong>
.NET Framework 4.7 Advanced Services</strong>. You will that they have available drop-downs. Enable each of them as required by the program you're installing:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE</span></strong>: After this, the system will download the necessary .NET Framework files from the Microsoft server. Therefore, these steps will not apply if you have no internet connections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>That's it for now. Please get back to us with more info from the results of our actions.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I have recently encountered this message when i try to join an Xbox Live party. After finding this out, I then followed a bunch of ways to fix the issue and ensure I have open NAT settings. Yet this has not fixed the issue. I will add that there are two xbox’s In my household. It’s my brothers and he is on strict NAT and doesn’t care about multiplayer too much.</p><p><br /></p><p>Out of all my friends on my friends list, I can connect to 1/5 of them. This is the same for multiplayer matchmaking as well as party chat. Whenever I connect to a large party, I end up disbanding half the party and everyone gets disconnected.&nbsp;So I think my problem is bigger than just open NAT&nbsp;settings. All settings and tests display open NAT settings but everything operates as if it is Strict.</p><p><br /></p><p>Here are the things I have done for my wireless connection:</p><p>-&nbsp;Made a static route to my Xbox so that it will always connect to the same IP on my modem.&nbsp;</p><p>- &nbsp;po

    <title>Win 8 product key not valid after upgrading to 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomecole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8 product key not valid after upgrading to 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Something happened to my client's laptop. &nbsp;Suddenly she received an error message saying Windows has to be activated. &nbsp;It has been activated and working for over a year. I suspect it was a patch gone bad since I have scanned it with every anti-malware known
 to man and it comes up clean.</p>
<p>Here's the problem: when she got the PC it had Windows 8.0. &nbsp;She upgraded to 8.1 and now the key is considered invalid. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I called Microsoft support and was told the key is actually a valid 8.0 code; just not for 8.1.</p>
<p>The solution, I was told, was to reload 8.0, use the key to activate it and then upgrade to 8.1 again. &nbsp;That means reloading all of her programs. &nbsp;One of which is the Adobe CS suite which is very expensive. &nbsp;She doesn't have the software or licensing information
 any any longer and following Microsoft's instructions will result in her losing that software, not that it is useful when Windows won't run without re-activation.</p>
<p>The MUST be a way to do this... otherwise a lot of people are going to be really angry when something like this happens to them. &nbsp;A Windows 8.0 key SHOULD remain valid for 8.1. &nbsp;It doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Any help out there?</p>

            <p>Going back to my original post: &nbsp;I tried method #1 first, of course, though I didn't specifically mention it. &nbsp;Then I tried method #2 and that is what the bulk of the post is about... that which I was told when I contacted Microsoft support via telephone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue most likely IS due to damaged license files since both Windows and Office was affected. &nbsp;It happened the next day after this December's patch Tuesday, hence my suspicion a patch caused the problem. &nbsp;Running chkdsk did not find any corruption on
 the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that there does not seem to be a reasonable solution to the problem. &nbsp;Even though 8.1 was a free upgrade, and therefore everyone with Win 8 could have upgraded, &nbsp;Microsoft still won't allow the OS to be activated with the OEM 8.0 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way I see it, Microsoft owns the software and we are only granted a license to use it. Following this logic, they also own the patch software too. &nbsp;This license came at a cost when the PC was purchased, and we should be able to use that license without
 additional inconvenience and if a free upgrade was promoted by Microsoft (loudly) &nbsp;then the OEM license should be able to follow the OS product through the free in-place upgrade that was probably necessitated by the patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Microsoft page on activation help: &nbsp;"<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">If you formatted or replaced your hard drive, you won't be able to use a product key to update to&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Windows&nbsp;8.1</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Windows&nbsp;8</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">.
 You'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Windows&nbsp;8.1</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Windows&nbsp;8</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">."
 &nbsp; This makes sense since the software would have to be reloaded anyway, but that isn't the situation here and I think it behoves Microsoft to find a way around this problem.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Tom,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delayed response. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that after upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, you are getting prompt to activate Windows 8.1 and when you tried to activate Windows 8.1 using Windows 8 product key you are getting error messages and cannot activate your Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that there is no separate product key required after upgrading to Windows 8.1.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A separate product key will only be required if Windows 8.1 Pro was installed from Windows 8. If it's an upgrade then it should take the same Windows 8 product key automatically and activate your Windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To get the issue fixed, I suggest you to contact the OEM for further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Feel free to write us if you have any queries using your Windows.</span></p>

            I just bought a&nbsp;laptop my daughter running Windows 8.&nbsp; After receiving an alert that the windows is running and old version and is no longer getting updates, I have updated the same with 8.1 using the links provided by the system.&nbsp; After installation,
 it is now requesting me to activate the windows. Using the current product key, I tried to activate the windows but it is not accepted by the system. Please help me fix this issue as my daughter requires her laptop for her school projects.&nbsp; I would really
 appreciate your urgent assistance on this issue.

<p>I also have this problem I purchased Windows 8 and after many attempts to upgrade to 8.1 and fix the errors I only got the addition. which does not accept updates and the product key does not work with it and became those who use illegal copies were better.<br />
why Microsoft deals with customers like this by putting product with so many problems and ask them to solve it or buy more programs which may solve it ,which is impossible for many people such as me .I'm from Yemen&nbsp; where there is no agent and the internet
 so slow I bought&nbsp; windows 8 It suppose to be tested by the company&nbsp; and come to the market with out&nbsp; all this malfunctions&nbsp; cause I choose it to help me in work not to be my work
<br />
I apologize for this, but I consider such a behaviour a kind of commercial fraud</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the future and anyone having this issue, the solution is simpler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing the microsoft staff are not allowed to promote tools that find your product key, but there are quite a few free and legitimate ones (I used ProduKey).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you need to do is actually reenter your Windows 8 product key, the issue stems, most likely, from the windows activation after upgrade to 8.1 using the default 8.1 product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 product key is valid for 8.1, you just need to re-input it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for me and I hope it works for the rest of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To summarise:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Get product key:</strong> use either a program such as ProduKey or find it on your computer.</li><li><strong>Input key:</strong> just open PC settings and go to activate windows and enter your valid windows 8 key</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have a nice day!</p>

            1st-install pm 7.01. To do this it seems work well if u boot win 8 or 8.1 into safe mode. Also need to go to pm sub directory on installation cd. Find and select setup.exe. After that install distiller using same method. Before u boot back to the regular
 windows program also install pm 7.01a update. Restart normally and u should be good to go.

</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>System Restore is NOT the way to uninstall programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if those "utility programs" were registry cleaners, tune-up utilities, or the like, well -- you should have made a system image before you started to mess around with that sort of snake oil.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the result from sfc /scannow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you had tried System Restore in Safe Mode with no success; have you tried it in the Windows Recovery Environment (i.e., when you boot with your System Repair disk)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although symptoms are not unique, I have not seen a definitive fix.&nbsp; Short of a repair install (if you happen to have the correct installation DVD), there are a couple of things to try that may or may not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open an Elevated Command Prompt window (right-click on cmd.exe and select "Run as administrator) and type</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk /F</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and press Enter.&nbsp; Answer Y to the prompt and then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; There are two similar complicated KB articles that explain how to install a Hotfix in the Windows Recovery Environment.&nbsp; The articles appear to be identical, but I haven't gone through the list of files included in the Hotfixes to determine if they are,
 in fact, the same.&nbsp; Both of these articles are more than 4 years old and indicate that the problem is related to the installation of some old Windows updates.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One S shuts off after a second</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys my Xbox One S has an issue that when I turn it on it goes back off after a second. I tried leaving my Xbox One S unplugged for hours and it still does the same. My Xbox One S was connected into a surge protector and that day it was thundering but I didn't have no outages in my apartment. Then the next day I go to work try to turn it on and that would happen. I'm guessing I need to buy a new Power Supply Unit and change it because the battery got fried? Please help me guys I want to solve this problem thanks.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem.&nbsp; The Xbox One S has a build in surge suppressor feature build into the power supply and can sometime have issue if it is plugged into an addition power strip with a surge suppressor.&nbsp; I would try to plug the console directly
 into the wall outlet per Microsoft recommendation.&nbsp; If your still having problem you might need to get your console serviced.&nbsp; Here is a link for power supply issues and it has a link to request repair services from Microsoft.</p>

<h3> adamwindows  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signing in to xbox live with a second controller</h2>
                    
<p>I have purchased a second controller for use with my Xbox 360. To use it I turned off the original controller and turned on the new one&nbsp;</p>
<p>However when using the new controller if I press the guide button to sign in to my xbox live account it is not listed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(There is a player one profile - as there is when using the other controller - but my second profile which is the one connected to my xbox live account does not show up when using the new controller)</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>not sure if I understand the issue, but a profile can only be signed in once, so if it is already signed in on the other controller, you will need to sign it out in order to be able to sign in with the second controller.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Question is who's fault is it? MS or my software supplier? Does MS really not know what the issue(s?) is after so many weeks of failing updates reported on this forum?</p>

There are many suggestions that worked for a few people at a time, in that thread. Mine, removing 'problematic' accounts from the Windows registry,
<em>after uninstalling</em> in my case Ocster backup Pro, did work this time too. I also contacted that supplier whether they know why this happens.

<p>Are you using Network Level Authentication [NLA]? If so you could try disabling NLA on both the Remote Desktop [RDC] host machine and client as a test (ie. not a permanent fix).</p>

<p>You can then try removing the certificate from your RDC&nbsp;host computer by going to<strong>Start | Run</strong>and typing<strong> mmc.msc</strong>, adding the certificate snap-in and deleting the Remote Desktop certificate then connecting again as a permanent
 fix.</p>

<p>Note the comment about making sure the date and time&nbsp;is set correctly (on both the RDC host and RDC client)&nbsp;in&nbsp;this old thread from the Vista forums that deals with this issue...</p>
