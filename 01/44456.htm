<h2>            edit  windows 7 registry to boot from ide</h2>
                    What registry Keys would I need to alter to configure windows 7 to boot from a system in IDE mode? The image i'm working with is currently configured for a system in AHCI mode.

            Hi
<div>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Types of SATA modes:</div>
<div><br />
<div>•<b>IDE</b> - Old, slower, it is simply a compatibility mode</div>
<div>•<b>AHCI</b> - AHCI stands for Advanced Host Controller Interface. It makes Native Command Queuing (NCQ) along with hot-plugging or hot swapping through SATA Serial-ATA host controllers possible. NCQ is one of the important features of AHCI for SSDs. SSDs
 can process requests faster than HDDs. It can process so fast that the SSD could end up waiting for work. NCQ allows the OS/controller to request up to 32 simultaneous requests at once. So you basically get more performance from your drive over older IDE mode.</div>
<div><b>•RAID</b> - RAID stands for redundant array of independent disks, originally redundant array of inexpensive disks. It is a means by which your PC uses multiple disks as if they were one, either to increase performance, safeguard against disk failures,
 or both. RAID mode has all the advantages of AHCI mode. There are four main factors of a RAID setup: striping, which spreads data across multiple drives, mirroring, which copies the data to more than one disk, space efficiency, which is how much of the total
 space is available to use, and fault tolerance, which is a measure of how well protected the RAID array is against disk failure.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>The Problem:</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;The issue with changing the SATA modes is they need to be enabled in the BIOS prior to OS installation; doing so after you have installed the OS will disable the PC. The reason why is Windows disables the drivers for the others that are not needed during
 installation. This tutorial will show you how to enable the different SATA modes after you have installed the OS.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Notes:</b></div>
<div><b>*</b>You may need to install the IRST driver first in order to do the registry change from AHCI mode to RAID mode for Intel motherboards.</div>
<div><b>*</b>You may have to uninstall then reinstall any SATA drivers such as Intel RST or AMDs equivalent.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Change to AHCI mode from IDE mode:</div>
<div>You can use the MS Fix it tool or edit the registry yourself.</div>
<div>Link to tool here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/922976/</div>
<div>Regedit:</div>
<div>1. Exit all Windows-based programs.</div>
<div>2. Press [Win] + R or take the RUN option from the start menu.</div>
<div>3. Now type Regedit there and press Enter Key to open up the Registry Editor Window. (If you receive the User Account Control dialog box, click Continue.)</div>
<div>4. Locate and then click the following registry sub key:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\msahci</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. In the right pane right-click Start in the Name column and then click Modify.</div>
<div>6. In the Value data box, type 0 [3 is default], and then click OK.</div>
<div>7. On the File menu, click Exit to close Registry Editor.</div>
<div>8. Restart your computer</div>
<div>9. Go to UEFI/BIOS and enable AHCI, Save &amp; Reboot</div>
<div>10. Another restart will be required to finish the driver installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Change to ACHI mode from RAID mode:</div>
<div>1. Exit all Windows-based programs.</div>
<div>2. Press [Win] + R or take the RUN option from the start menu.</div>
<div>3. Now type regedit there and press Enter Key to open up the Registry Editor Window.</div>

    <title>fix corrupted .EXE or BEX files This is both a windows 7 and internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> april elliott-gevedon  say:</h3>
<h2>            fix corrupted .EXE or BEX files    This is both a windows 7 and internet explorer 8 topic, with the same solution I think.</h2>
                    I think the problem is corrupted files. This is complicated and I will be amazed if I get a response that actually does work. I am running windows 7 along with internet explorer 8 and mozilla foxfire on a toshiba laptop. Most of the time when trying to
 go into internet explorer from any where on the computer I get&nbsp; of 1 of 2 error messages; either it will say that windows explorer has stopped working or internet explorer has stopped working, and it will give me options to restart the program or close or
 check the internet for a solution and close....none of which work....in the details it says something either about IE.EXE file or a BEX file. I figured maybe they are corrupted. Mozilla works sometimes, but mostly offers to submit a crash report but can't.
 Sometimes I can go to my media player and choose to browse online store then type something like 'ads' in the search box, then it will say it is temporarily unavalible and then I can I choose the word ads to see an image from the internet via bing, then I
 switch my view from image to web....and that, if you followed, is how I have been getting on the internet for months now! I know enough to try to do a system restore, but this laptop was this way when we got it and there is no point saved that is any better
 and my restore also doesn't work. I do not have a disk to reinstall windows. I am, as we speak running a sfc/scan to check for corrupted files, but when that is done...where do I go from there? Does any of this have anything to do with the various small problems
 I am having such as the system restore, unavalible media player search, and some of my anytime updates not working, as in can not be applied at this time? I feel I got ripped off with this laptop and I wanna get it fixed, but I don't wanna invest anymore money...is
 that possible? Now the sfc/scannow says no integrity violations found, so now what do I do?<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
A new sound card may work IF there are not other issues including BIOS, low level
<br />
chipset drivers, and other major device drivers. For either a PC or a laptop you can
<br />
try a Windows compatible&nbsp;USB Sound Card which is not expensive - be sure to <br />
remove the old sound card and/or disable the sound in the BIOS and Device Manager.<br />
<br />
Since&nbsp;you upgraded to Windows 7 did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check with <br />
the Compatibility Center (for device compatibility)?</p>
<p>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor &lt;-- please run this now<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center (for device compatibility)?<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Check with the System and Device makers for updated drivers and many have special<br />
instructions to help with upgrading to Windows 7. HP has specific instructions for
<br />
upgrading so be sure to check with their Support, on-line documentation and Forums.</p>
<p>========================<br />
<br />
<strong>If the system is Windows 7&nbsp;compatible AND there are drivers for your sound (and other devices).<br />

<br />
Also update or re-install the driver.</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click
<br />
on and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found) <br />

<p>You can try Compatibility Mode however this rarely works on Sound Drivers.<br />
<br />
Right Click the executible driver file (.exe) - Select Compatibility Mode<br />
<br />
From the drop down menu choose XP&nbsp;and Service&nbsp;Pack OR Vista&nbsp;&nbsp;(if that is the version<br />
drivers you are trying).<br />
<br />
Click OK and then let the executible run to see if it will install.<br />
<br />
=================================================<br />
<br />
This one also seldom works on Sound Drivers.<br />
<br />
Another method to try is to run the .exe (if self extracting) or upzip (if compressed)&nbsp;it to a folder&nbsp;:</p>

<br />
Open an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong> : (probably looks like this)<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32&gt;<br />
<br />
CD \the path to that folder&nbsp;&nbsp; such as&nbsp; C:\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or whatever the path<br />
is to the folder where the driver is unpacked.<br />
<br />
So in this case it would be&nbsp; CD&nbsp;\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder and the prompt would look like :</p>
<p>CD&nbsp;\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder&gt;<br />
<br />
type this in at the prompt and hit enter.<br />
<br />
pnputil -i -a *.inf<br />
<br />
It will take a little while to respond.<br />
<br />
If that does not work (errors out)&nbsp;use the entire path to the driver such as (which can be used from<br />
any prompt) :<br />
<br />
pnputil -i -a C:\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder\*.inf<br />
<br />
Again wait to see if it will install.</p>

<h2>            Scam email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi<br />
<br />
I couldn't reach any Skype person to discuss about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm from Finland. I am having time to time Spanish emails claiming to be from Skype. Why would Skype send me Spanish emails? I have no idea what do they have in mind, normally I just delete them. How can I can check if this is actual? If it is, how to stop
 them spamming me with Spanish emails, that I don't understand. My language settings are all to either Finnish or English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be happy if this could be solved some other way than adjust my spam filter settings to delete emails from Skype.<br />
<br />
Sender:&nbsp;<br />
Skype &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>

<p>As I said, language setting are ok. I talked customer service and they couldn't help. "Skype engineers are working on it". This has continued several years.</p>

<h2>            Need help Identifying my DirectX Shader model</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to play a game on my laptop and got an error message saying 'gpu compatible with directx 11.0 shader model 5.0 not found' and I used GPU Z to find out what my Directx version and shader model was, so I have DirectX support - 10.1 and shaders
 - 12 unified,&nbsp;but I have no idea what '12 unified shaders' mean.</p>
<p>Can someone please translate this into a somewhat understandable term like shader model 2.0-5.0</p>
<p>I just really want to play this game!</p>

<p>What brand and model graphics processor does you machine use ?&nbsp; What game ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It may just be you need to update your drivers, if the mfg of you laptop has provided dedicated Win10 drivers</p>
<p>you should use the drivers they have provided. </p>
<p>(the generic graphics driver provided by MS are not adequate for more than basic graphics.)</p>
<p>- However, going by the error, I will guess your machine is an older laptop using Intel HD3000/2000 integrated graphics,</p>
<p>or a similarly dated DX10 dedicated graphics card, in which case there has never been proper Win10 graphics driver support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The critical part is...&nbsp; <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DirectX support - 10.1</span>.&nbsp;
</em>The error specifies&nbsp; <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">directx 11.0
</span>shacer 5.0 .</em></p>
<p>The shader version is related to the DX version your graphics processor is capable of using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Shaders is a complex topic, and you can find many articles on the internet, but basically ...</p>
<p>In the early days <em>pixel</em> and <em>vertex</em> shaders were separate entities, which caused problems.&nbsp; They 'unified' the two
</p>
<p>back in the DX9 days to make them interact more successfully.</p>
<p>I believe the <em>12</em> relates to the number of shader pipelines used by the processor. This number may be larger with</p>
<p>more modern gpu's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games that use OpenGL&nbsp; (an open source alternative to DirectX used by many games) also use shaders,</p>
<p>and the version of Open GL&nbsp; that&nbsp; a graphics processor can use is generally relative to the version of DX the&nbsp; gpu can use.
</p>

                    <p>at the end of the save I got this message: The ASR discovery diskette was not created. You will not be able to restore an ASR backup without the system information stored on this diskette.What does this mean? Should I be saving my data some other way? I
 don't have a diskette drive (I'm surprised if anyone does) but I have a read/write cd dvd drive...One last thing. When I looked at the contents on the flash drive withe de-fragmentation program it was solid red, meaning completely fragmented, the program recommended
 it de-fragment it... is that safe with a file this large on a flash drive?</p>

<p>All of them point to the same exact file location, and culprite, I do not know why exactly, However I did update the driver to the video chipset that was onboard graphics for this laptop. I'd like to continue to play Halo on this laptop, but if this continues
 ot happen I'll be dfriven crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell me that updating the Intel Graphics driver was the proper thing to do ? Should I try once more to play Halo ?</p>

            OK, UPDATE TIME; I uninstalled Halo and ran MalwareByte's AntiMalware, it found two password stealers that somehow got into my machine when I had downloaded a p irated version of Halo Classic, {turns out that pirated version only had the Halo background,
 nothing more.} I have the microsoft Halo Trial edition, that runs just fine.
<div><br />
<div>However I am unable to run the full game due to memory troubles, the driver is not the problem anymore. Turns out my RAM cards are faulty. So until I am able to replace those I will be unable to play Halo Classic for PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks all for your help!</div>

<h2>            Since installing new RAM, I now get a BSOD.</h2>
                    I'm currently running Win 7 64bit. I moved from 8gb ram to 16gb, and after installing the new ram modules, every now and then my system just crashes with the BSOD. Here's the dmp file...<br />
http://www.wenatcheekennelclub.com/022713-33384-01.dmp<br />
Any ideas on what is causing it? Bad RAM? Conflict?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <div><strong>&nbsp;These crashes were caused by memory corruption&nbsp; Usually a driver but since you updated your RAM at two different times I would run the two tests below.&nbsp; Run Memtest first and if that comes back clean run the driver verifier.
</strong><br />
<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)</span></em><br />
<br />
<span>*If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent</span><br />
<br />
<strong>1-Memtest.</strong><br />
<span>*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. http://www.memtest.org&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.</span><br />
<span>*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.</span><br />
<span>*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.</span><br />
<br />
<i><u>Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.</u></i><br />
<strong><br />
2-Driver verifier</strong><br />
<i><u>Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.</u></i><br />
<br />
<span>*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.</span><br />
<span>*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.</span><br />
<span>*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.</span><br />
<span>*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).</span><br />
<br />
<b>*In Windows 7 you can make a Startup Repair disk by going to Start....All Programs...Maintenance...Create a System Repair Disc - with Windows Vista you'll have to use your installation disk or the "Repair your computer" option at the top of the
 Safe Mode menu .</b><br />
<b><br />
Here is the procedure:</b><br />
<span>- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter</span><br />
<span>- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"</span><br />
<span>- Select "Finish" on the next page.</span><br />
<span>*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.</span><br />
<span>*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it
 run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.</span><br />
<span>*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.</span><br />
<span>*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.</span><br />

            <span>A Google search for "crekrthj.dll" brought up nothing. When you don't get any hits for a file name on Google, chances are high that it is a malware file. Either you uninstalled the malware program or your antivirus/antispyware
 program did. In any case, a reference was left to the file in Startup which is why you are getting the error message.<br />
<br />
Because you had at least one piece of malware and because you can't get on the Internet, the chances are also high that your computer is still infected.
</span>Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
Cleaning up the computer should solve both problems.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.<br />

<h2>            Xbox Fightstick is showing up as an Unknown Device</h2>
                    I have a Street Fighter 4 Fightstick, and it won't work in 7 - 64 bit. It's a 360 controller, but compatible with windows. I downloaded the Xbox 360 driver, and have tried to manually point to the install directory, tried &nbsp;(x64) and (x86) and it won't
 recognize it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried the fightstick today on Xbox 360 and on another windows 7 computer(it downloaded the drivers automatically on plugging in), and it works perfectly on both. I have tried another xbox 360 controller on my PC and it also works fine. There is some
 unique issue, as only this unique combo seems to have problems.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

<div>*I have tried it in several usb plugs, directly into the computer and on a hub, nothing changes.</div>

            <div><span>Hi,</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I would suggest you to perform the following steps and check if it helps.</span>
<span>&nbsp;</span> </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Method 1: Remove all device drivers related to the controller.</strong></span></div>
<div><span>a. Click on </span><span><strong>Start</strong></span><span> button<br />
b. In the search box type </span><span><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></span><span> and then press
</span><span><strong>Enter</strong></span><span><br />
c. Select the </span><span><strong>Xbox controller device</strong></span><span> and right click on it<br />
d. Now select <span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><strong>properties</strong></span><span><strong>.<br />
</strong>e. In the </span><span>properties</span><span> window, under </span><span><strong>Driver</strong></span><span> tab, click on
</span><span><strong>Uninstall</strong></span><span><strong> </strong>button.<br />
f. After the uninstalling the drivers restart the computer. This should automatically install proper drivers for it.</span>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><strong>Method 2: Remove all ghost devices in device manager.</strong>
</span></div>
<p><span>To get rid of unwanted drivers, devices, or services, use the following steps:<br />
a) Open the <b>Start</b> menu and choose <b>Run</b>.<br />
b) </span><span>In the search box type<b> </b></span><b><span>cmd</span></b><span> and click
<b>OK</b>.<br />
c) At the command prompt, type in <b>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1</b> and press Enter. (Note that nothing seems to happen. This is expected. You are actually setting an environment variable that is going to help you to see hidden devices.)<br />
d) On the next command prompt line, type <b>devmgmt.msc</b> and press Enter. This will launch the Windows Device Manager Console.<br />
e) In the Device Manager Console, from the <b>View</b> menu, select <b>Show Hidden Devices</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>As you expand the different drivers and devices in the device manager, you will see not only the items that Windows currently detects as installed on your PC; but you will also see drivers, devices, and services which have been loaded in the past but
 were not uninstalled or are not currently started. You can find your offending device, right-click, and choose
<b>uninstall</b> to remove it from the system completely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note that non-loaded devices, drivers, and services are “grayed” out, but that does not necessarily mean that you should delete all of them. Only remove items you know you do not need. Be careful that you do not change too many devices, or you might
 need to re-activate your Windows installation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Finally, if you accidentally exit the Device Manager Console you will need to start over again at the command prompt. To close the command prompt window, type
<b>exit</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span>Method 3: Try installing the arcade stick again.</span> &nbsp;</strong></div>

<h2>            Folder preview tiles are blurry -</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my tablet (Wacom Cintiq Companion with a 1920x1080 display) from Win 8.1 to Win 10. Everything seems good - except for the photo app. While it worked great in 8.1, now all of the preview tiles (thumbnails) in the folder display are blurry. when
 I select and open an image it is displayed properly.</p>
<p>Is this a know issue and is there a fix?</p>
<p>Any suggestion would be appreciated - thanks!</p>

<h2>            Resolution Issue</h2>
                    I have this problem on my pc where my resolution keeps changing automaticly and there isnt anything that I could do about. I tried everything like restalling drivers to updating them. I still fix this issue and I tried restarting my pc as well to see if
 that would have an effect, but it didn't do anything at all and now I'm stuck at 1024 x 768 instead 1440 x 900 (native for me). Please help

<p>This is the Highest resolution the monitor supports</p>
<p>1440 x 900 at 60 Hz</p>
<p>But that is not a guarantee you will get that resolution. Other factors come in play.</p>
<p>Try 1280x768 or 1280x720, which is what I run mine on. It still is HD resolution, bigger text, icons, windows etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Also Auto hide taskbar gives you more screen area for icons and viewing, especially full screen mode for like videos and without the annoying taskbar showing while watching a video in FS Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try and change the refresh rates for it. But only change to one that is recommended safe.</p>
<p>If you need help doing that just ask.</p>

<p>Another thing, do you have Nvidia control panel. Look in it and check all the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn off any hardware acceleration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a PC or Card that does not have Windows 10 drivers from the OEM(s), and you are using Microsoft generic drivers, then this could be the issue too and you might be stuck with what you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check you display adapter in device manager and see who provided the driver.</p>
<p>Microsoft or Nvidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure custom scaling is set to 100% and not above that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I assume you have VGA out from card to VGA in to Monitor ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>What other ports do you have on the card, such as DVI, HDMI</p>
<p>You could get like a DVI out to VGA in adapter and see what happens. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your card an AGP or PCIe&nbsp; ???</p>
<p>or just a PCI card ????</p>

I won't play or buy since I lost so much last time this happened. Why is it taking so long to fix?</p>

            <p>Is there any particular reason why you want to run 64 bit Windows 7? Not because the processor is 64 bit capable means you need to run a 64 bit operating system too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, ATOM is not really a powerful processor and you will just be putting more workload on it by trying to run 64 bit Windows 7.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits are most apparent when you have a large amount of 
random access memory (RAM) installed on your computer, typically 4 GB of RAM or more. In such cases, because a 64-bit operating system can handle large amounts of memory more efficiently than a 32-bit operating system can, a 64-bit system can be more responsive
 when running several programs at the same time and switching between them frequently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 PC won&#39;t complete update.</h2>
                    For months now my Windows 10 PC hasn't successfully completed an update. It always fails, and on the next start up, I get a blue screen message saying something to the effect of "Windows was unable to complete updates. Undoing changes", which takes some
 time. It's been like this for at least a couple of months.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p><br />
Looks like you are encountering challenges getting your system to perform an update.
<span>To diagnose and fix this problem, we suggest that you follow the&nbsp;</span>guided walk-through in the following link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix
 Windows Update errors</a>.&nbsp;This guided walk-through provides steps to fix problems when installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>I went through the entire diagnostic process via the link and let it apply the suggested fixes, but the result is the same. The update eventually fails, and after some time the changes are undone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same result. I've followed all the steps in the links posted, although i don't think that they were all completed successfully. For example, one step required stopping the Windows Update Service. This failed, giving the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows could not stop the Windows Update Service on Local Computer.</p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can supply more information to us that would be helpful, such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Windows 10 and what build number&nbsp;is currently installed&nbsp;on the device (at Settings &gt;System &gt;About)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is/are the update(s) that has/have been failing to install successfully (at Settings &gt;Update &amp; security &gt;update history)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What error code(s) or exact messages are you getting with the failure (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and exact model number of the affected device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the device come new with Windows 10 preinstalled or was it upgraded from a qualifying previous&nbsp;version of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other pertinent&nbsp;info could prove&nbsp;be helpful as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds as though it could be the Creators Update (upgrade to version 1703) that is failing to complete successfully?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can reply back with more info we can then be better equipped to help you further.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, the build that you're on indicates that the device has not updated successfully&nbsp;since January with KB3213986 (OS Build 14393.693).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span>Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4033637) has apparently&nbsp;been pulled and no longer exist&nbsp;in the MS Update Catalog
<a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4033637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4033637</a> . From doing some research there were a number of reports of problems with it but I wasn't able to find much else about it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HP has not supported your PC since Windows 7 (Win XP through Win 7) so there is a possibility of compatibility issues&nbsp;being in play so I do not suggest upgrading to version 1703, at least not at this point anyway.&nbsp;Do you by chance&nbsp;have a version 1607
 ISO file previously downloaded or one burned to a DVD disc? If so an in place upgrade/Repair install would probably be the easiest and/or best way to go. Let me know.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using a 3rd party anti-virus product uninstall it completely, the packaged with uninstallers do not completely remove them so run the uninstaller for any that have been on the PC in the past as well whether you actually used them or not.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Then, lets try this. Open Notepad then copy and paste the text below into it then select save as, then in Save as Type change it to All Files and&nbsp;then name it &nbsp;</span>Reset Update Service.bat &nbsp;then save it to you're desktop (or another place of your
 choice).</p>
<p>After saving it close all open apps then right-click on the file and select Run as Administrator, after it completes restart (not a shutdown and start) and then try checking for updates.&nbsp;This is an automated script to reset the update service, perhaps it
 will&nbsp;complete the task&nbsp;successfully. Let me know.</p>

<p>Ok,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a way to get the version 1607 (Anniversary Edition) ISO download so lets do that and then try doing the Repair installation, this allows you to keep your files and apps as well if you choose to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First get the ISO file, make sure that you chose the correct Edition, Version, and type (32bit or 64bit) that matches what is now installed on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using the Edge browser follow the instructions at the link below for Directly download the ISO.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then, once you have the ISO follow the instructions at the link below to perform a Repair install with&nbsp;in place upgrade&nbsp;(this is essentially the same type of procedure as the ordinal upgrade to Windows 10 was so give yourself enough time&nbsp;for it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it, this&nbsp;most always&nbsp;works for any number of difficult to seemingly impossible to solve problems, including this one (barring a hardware issue). After the installation is complete let Windows 10 fully update to current from there before doing any
 thing else with the PC unless prompted to do so, this may take several pass of Check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck and let us know how it goes and/or if you need more help.</p>

    <title>System restore deleting drivers that were installed prior to the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System restore deleting drivers that were installed prior to the restore point date</h2>
                    I am going to do a system restore before moving on to a clean install of windows 7 on my hp pavilion laptop. But as I scanned for affected programs etc, I see that it will delete my keyboard drivers, mouse, printer and some system drivers. All of which
 are dated well before the date of the restore point I am choosing. I don't want to be in a position that my keyboard and mouse will not work, or possibly worse results than that. I am pretty sure I will end up re-installing altogether, but if it would restore,
 I will put it off til next weekend. Is this cause for concern? The dates on the system,keyboard, and mouse drivers is 6/21/2006. I purchased the laptop in Aug. 2012. So I assume these are drivers that were installed at the factory. Is it safe to continue with
 this restore?

            System restore looks at the date of <strong>installation</strong>, not at the date when a driver was created. You can safely go ahead with your system restore without fear of losing your keyboard, mouse or video drivers. Furthermore, Windows has a number
 of inbuilt drivers for basic services that always work when booting into Safe Mode. You cannot uninstall them.<br />

            <p>Can you help me understand why it is deleting stuff from before the date that the restore point was created? Those drivers were not from a windows update. You say that it looks at the date of installation and not when the drivers were created, but I am pretty
 sure this laptop was not built in 2006. Just trying to understand. You know when your pc is doing crazy things, its hard to trust that it knows what its doing all the time.haha&nbsp;</p>

            It just said that those drivers would be deleted when I did a scan for affected programs. I thought that it would only undo any changes made after that restore point was created. I know my way around a pc, but I certainly am not a tech so bear with me
 if my questions seem uneducated. I have not encountered this before. Usually it shows the expected list of things I have installed or updates.&nbsp;

            <p><span><em>Is it normal for system restore to delete anything that was installed before the restore point was created?
</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; This is impossible, if only because System Restore has no information about the system state prior to the date of the Restore Point.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Is it possible for a virus-(specifically: icreinstall_adobe_flash_setup.exe) to manupilate my system in such a way that it can alter the restore image?</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; It is highly unlikely that a virus can alter the restore process. However, a virus can directly modify the registry and system files.</span></p>

            <p>I didn't think so on both accounts. I still do not understand why those drivers were listed as affected and were to be deleted. I did do a restore as AVG av, spybot, spyhunter, and ccleaner could not resolve the issues that were caused by the&nbsp;icreinstall_adobe_flash_setup.exe
 virus. All is well and everything is working. I plan to run AVG recovery boot disk tomorrow to be sure. Probably should have done that first! Sometimes though, it is just a matter of figuring something out to better understand.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info!</p>

<p>
</p><p>To assist&nbsp;you further I would like to ask if you are playing the game online or from&nbsp;desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the game is installed and you are playing from the desktop, the issue might be caused due to compatibility of the game with Windows 10. I suggest you to install the game in compatibility mode by following the steps provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Download the s<strong>etup files</strong> for the&nbsp;game from the game&nbsp;developers website and save it on your local disk.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the
<strong><span>setup file</span></strong> of the

<span>“Compatibility”</span></strong> Tab.</span></li><li><span>Place a check mark next to<strong><span>“Run this program in Compatibility mode”</span></strong> and select operating system from the drop down list.</span></li><li><span>Let the </span>
game <span>install and then check the<strong><span>functionality</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>

    <title>Screen Saver Images in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manu chatterjee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Saver Images in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>While I like many of the images in the Windows 10 lock screen I find it annoying to almost offensive that they don't have a simple acknowledgement of what the picture is about and who took the picture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of them are really interesting.&nbsp; But I don't
 want to click around -&nbsp;I just want my curiosity satisfied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, if I'm lucky,&nbsp;I get this gamey little trivia globe about what it might be (or not) &nbsp;or some other middle-school level editorial content.&nbsp; And if I click on it then it runs a Bing search I didn't really want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I would appreciate.&nbsp; A simple easy-to-reach &nbsp;option to select one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>(no supplementary text) - just shows the image</li><li>Simple unobtrusive text with what the photo is about and who took it.&nbsp; This can be on a mouse-over icon or similar clean but nice UX feature.&nbsp; And yes credit to the photo-maker&nbsp;/ photographer should be their right even if they've been paid by MS.&nbsp;
</li><li>Whatever gamey middle school stuff Microsoft apparently thinks its professional audience wants.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As an add on to #2.&nbsp; Allow people to add their own photos and supplementary text to the screen saver (I think this is done elsewhere w/o the text option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much.</p>

            <p>So let me get this right.&nbsp; I spend the time to register here, type my feedback, it gets answered by Microsoft person who tells me to do the same thing again instead of just putting it where it needs to go?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I tried this but its not clear where to provide the feedback in Feedback hub.&nbsp; In any case it made do all the same steps I just did here.&nbsp; Again.</p>

</p><p>I expect better from the New Microsoft.&nbsp; </p>

            Yup, that's what I expect from a company that releases, to the public, an alpha release of a software product over and over until they fix most of the bugs. Then they take that version and hose up more things and release it as the next OS. This has been
 going on sense Windows 1.0. If they would get rid of that registry things would be much better, much more stable and it would be almost impossible to crash the OS.<br />
