            Have you selected a Photo from your Pictures Folder?
<br />Were any changes made to the PC prior to this issue occurring?
<br />
<br />1. Right click Desktop &gt; Select Personalize
<br />Beneath Background have you selected Picture from the dropdown menu?
<br />
<br />2. Select Lock screen on Left Menu
<br />Try switching to Windows Spotlight in the Background Menu
<br />Reboot the PC
<br />Do you now see a photo?
<br />Switch back to Photo in the dropdown menu
<br />Pick a Different Photo
<br />Reboot 
<br />Do you now see the photo on lockscreen?
<br />
<br />3. Have you tried a System Restore to a date/time when the photo did show on lockscreen?
<br />If no, please launch System Restore and go back to a date/time when the photo did show.
<br />When you pick the date to revert to, notice the changes made after that date. They should be listed whether it's a Windows Update, driver installation, etc..

<p>Some of those other studios didnt really do anything. One was set up to make Kinect game but Kinect has turned out to be a bit of a flop and its only use now is Skype, and Kinect sign in. I just hope these closed studios get replaced with new ones that actually
 do something</p>

<p>well the list of studios got smaller indeed, also like how they point out that the spark server have been offline since 4th march and there apparently investigating, bet they will pull the plug on spark. &nbsp;losing faith very quickly after the past 2 weeks
 of live issues, studio closures etc etc.</p>

<h2>            precision touchpad on an acer aspire E15</h2>
                    My laptop came with windows 10 and this precision touchpad worked fine then my 10mnth old baby started jamming on the keyboard when I walked away, now touch pad does not work only touch screen does and if I plug usb mouse in&nbsp; but no touch pad. when I go
 to the settings the settings are completely missing not there for the touch pad. so I check the device manager and have to click on hidden devices to even see the touchpad anywyas when I click on it it says not connected which is impossible its attached to
 my laptop so I thought maybe if I try to uninstall and then renstall it but after uninstall I cant find it so how can I reinstall the touchpad driver ?

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
Sometimes, security software like antivirus and firewall can also cause such issues. So I suggest you to temporarily disable any third party security software that you have installed and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

 you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean
 boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem
 still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

    <title>PIN, Password and Fingerprint scanner. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rohitmalladi  say:</h3>
<h2>            PIN, Password and Fingerprint scanner.</h2>
                    <p>I use a live account to sign into my Dell XPS 9560</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;However, I can no longer scan my fingerprint to login to my laptop anymore, it says I require a PIN, which is apparently common(but not okay).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I type in my PIN(99.999% sure it's right) and I get an error code. Error code 0x80070032, and it says "something went wrong"<br />
I cannot access my Dell laptop using my PIN anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I then type in my password(100% sure is right again), and I'm almost in, it said "welcome", and those dots began circling around. BUT THEN, it says my password is incorrect and I have to try again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restart several times to face the same issue, and now even before I type in my password (which is anyway deemed incorrect henceforth) it says I need a PIN to sign in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I call Dell Support and try and access the console through booting into recovery (holding shift + restart), anything else I do from here (besides a complete factory reset) requires me to select my account and type in a password. This very password is continuously
 deemed wrong. so I cannot access the command prompt, or even factory reset while keeping my files. I have also used a separate laptop to change my live password online, and then use that password in to try and log in( even after booting in recovery mode) but
 it is apparently incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several restarts, the following day the "something went wrong, error code 0x80070032" message&nbsp; appearing when I used to type in my correct PIN has disappeared, but now my PIN is consistently just incorrect, so is my password, and my fingerprint is
 not usable. I am effectively locked out of my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Extremely frustrated and worried, please help me resolve this issue!<br />

            Hi Rohit.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello GUDRUNm <br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />by any chance did this issue started crying after updating to the latest version of Skype?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel=

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>actually, I think the problem is not with the client you use (the new Skype might be missing some features, but in general should work fine without any major bugs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you have probably logged in into different account than you usually used. I will send you private message with more details.</p>
<p>But in general if someone's contacts/credit/history disappears, it's best to log out and log in again, using the usual username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Michal</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10, version 10.0.17134 disables Remote Registry service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gjchief  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, version 10.0.17134 disables Remote Registry service arbitrarily.</h2>
                    <p>My Win10 Pro machine is used to demonstrate configuration and perf counter data collection from a remote Windows computer via WMI.&nbsp; In order to do this from a remote machine, the Win10 machine must have Remote Registry services running.&nbsp; So prior to the
 April update I had changed the default settings from Automatic (trigger) to Automatic by deleting the "trigger'.&nbsp; Also in the Win 10 machine registry I set the DisableIdleStop to 1.&nbsp; These two changes should be permanent.&nbsp; But after the April update, I received
 a data collection error stating that Remote Registry was not running on the Win10 machine.&nbsp; I looked in the Win10 machine registry and the DisableIdleStop was still set to 1.&nbsp; But, in the services.msc list, Remote Registry services was Disabled.&nbsp; When I then
 set it to Automatic, then Automatic (Trigger) was displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did the April update reconfigure some customized settings back to defaults?</p>

<h3> dvdave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Fallout 3 Redeem Code</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a digital copy of Fallout 4 through the Xbox One Store on 09/15/15, but I do not have a code to redeem Fallout 3.&nbsp; Looking around, it appears the codes were sent via Xbox Messages.&nbsp; I rarely check these, and as I understand it, messages do expire
 and are deleted automatically.</p>
<p>My guess is that I was in fact sent a code to redeem my copy of Fallout 3, but I never saw the message and it was deleted automatically before I read it.</p>
<p>I'm hoping you can verify my purchase of Fallout 4, but also verify that I did not redeem the code for my copy of Fallout 3.</p>

    <title>Chrome keeps freezing on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> manuelgedinian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chrome keeps freezing on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, in the last few days a serious issue has started to severely affect my experience with Windows 10. I am not aware of any changes having been made immediately before everything started but I have tried to do one thing to solve it. First things
 first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro 64bit on an HP Laptop. </p>
<p>Maybe a week ago, probably more like 4-5 days, something odd started happening: Sometimes, while watching YouTube videos in my Chrome browser, the video would stop and I'd be unable to click anything. Changing tabs would result in me seeing a completely
 white page, changing back in the same. By chance, I found out that disconnecting my internet (whether over the task bar icon or with the shortcut for Airplane Mode) and reconnecting, everything is magically fixed and Chrome works again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick Google search showed one similar result:</p>
<p>https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/fOGiSKsrFsI</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the thread was never revisited and nobody else seems to ever have experienced the same. The steps given in the one reply did not help me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue sometimes does not arise for hours at a time, other times there is hardly a few minutes without everything freezing up. I read somewhere else for a similar problem that it might be Chrome compatibility problems with the network driver, even though
 nothing changed in that regard (no recent Windows updates). However, I did manually search for a Wi-Fi driver update, of which there was one available that I did download. No recognizable change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, for the past few days, I was somewhat content with that idea and just thought the issue is probably going to be fixed soon. However, today I got frustrated and tested a few things.</p>
<p>1 - I unfortunately do not have a network cable available right now, so I can't check if the issue persists with wired connection.</p>
<p>2 - I have not left the laptop going for a while without disconnecting Wi-Fi. Should I, to see what happens?</p>
<p>3 - Not only YouTube but also other videos cause this.</p>
<p>4 - It is indeed not just Chrome that freezes, it is my entire Wi-Fi, Chrome is just the only program that noticeably misbehaves beyond not having internet access. Firefox, where I'm typing this up right now, simply does not load anything when this issue
 occurs, i.e. there is no redirection to a page telling me there is no internet connection, it simply brings up an empty loading screen (like what appears fractions of seconds before a page loads) and stays there until I disconnect Wi-Fi. Working on an open
 page or changing tabs, however, does indeed work still. Which led me to the conclusion Chrome can't be the culprit and I'm better off asking for help at Microsoft. Other programs seem to work fine, simply having no internet access for the time being, I have
 no other browsers in use right now to test their behavior.</p>
<p>5 - Actually right now while typing this, the issue made itself even clearer to be independent from Chrome. Without any video running (but Chrome being open), when searching for the link I provided above, I noticed the issue has been occurring while I was
 writing the start of this post. So it seems to be independent from Chrome usage and my first impression of videos being the cause also appears to be false.</p>
<p>One more thing I just realized might be connected, while I thought it was my Fritz!Box: In maybe 2 weeks leading to this frustrating state of my laptop, I had a more or less recurring issue of internet connection becoming super slow, as in just like Firefox
 now, pages taking forever to load, seemingly never loading. I fixed this also, always once at a time, by disconnecting from my network
<br />
as well as turning off my laptop's Wi-Fi for ten seconds. Afterwards, internet would be fine again. This happened pretty irregularly and mostly at night, so I believed it to be an issue with my Fritz!Box or the ISP, of which I've had countless. Now I feel like
 I should mention it, just in case. I strongly doubt the whole deal even now is cause by the Box, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is everything I can think of right now, I'll make sure to update this thread if anything comes to mind. The obligatory Malwarebytes scan is still running, even though I doubt it's a Malware issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help, it's really appreciated. This is driving me insane, mostly because my old desktop computer also has a very distinct Wi-Fi issue that nobody ever managed to solve, so I hope this laptop is not forever disabled as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: The extremely slow/basically non-existent internet connection issue still does seem to occur, so those might not be correlated and it might as well be the Fritz!Box.</p>
<p>Edit2: Malwarebytes came up with 0 results, as expected...</p>

            <p>Could not believe myself that i will really finish reading what you've just wrote! Lol (Hands Clapping).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is serious. I once had this issue with google chrome before. I, still, am running 64bit version of Windows 10, and knowing that the default available version of Chrome is just 32bit version, and yes, it is working with my PC. So i started to suspect
 that chrome, being 32bit and runs in a 64bit Based OS &nbsp;is the issue here, but NOPE.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yes, I was able to install the x64 of chrome, it run really well and made me think that the problem is now gone. Thinking back when i still have the x32, when freezes, the whole internet that i am trying to download --Yes I am downloading the whole internet--
 will fluctuate. It will not work for a moment and will comeback later. This happens regardless if i am watching Videos in Chrome, but hang-on, I am downloading stuffs, right? so i begun terminating them. . . Start observing Chrome, which i later found out
 that he is innocent.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After thinking that the version x64 fixed the problematic connection, IT CAME BACK. And because i am frustrated, i just used my Android phone to use the Internet. Now --here-- it is made clear. The internet in my Phone started to fluctuate to. i was forced
 to Download an App that can run a PING TESTS and the result is a lot of Time out connection.<br />
<br />
Making it short. There is something wrong with my Connection. Called the ISP and they sent me techs who later figured out the my (i mean their) Modem is already Burned. So they replaced it and the Internet became Happy.<br />

            <p>First off, congrats for making it through. I just thought whoever might be able to help me would benefit from as much detail as I can possibly remember.</p>
<p>Secondly, sorry for the delayed answer, yesterday I saw that I had answers but for some reason the page wouldn't display them, no matter what I did.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're saying you had a similar problem and it was actually your modem? I mean, with all the crap I've been through with these things, I wouldn't put it beyond them. Oddly enough, right since I've typed this question, the freezing issue has not occurred
 a single time, therefore the net getting extremely slow one did. So that does hint at either the network or something network related on the laptop being at fault I suppose. The problem is that there are several other devices (partly from other people) connected
 to the same network and I haven't heard anyone else experiencing such issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answer and patience in reading!</p>

            <p>Yes, it boiled down to my modem being old to perform its tasks. On my understanding, it seems that I had the same issue before. Just more than a month ago . . .roughly. Try to spend some time with your ISP's support team and observe your connection while
 they're monitoring it on their end.&nbsp;<br />

            Hello Manuel,<br />
<br />
<br />
I just wanted to check if you've already figured out the solution for the issue. The suggestions that were posted by Gina are helpful, and can actually get the job done. Would it be okay if you can share the results with us, after following Gina's instructions?<br />
<br />
Tell us when you need more help.<br />

            <p>So, for some reason, the problem simply disappeared since I've last posted here. Still had the odd occurrence of having videos stop mid-play and internet not working until I turn&nbsp; my wi-fi off and on again on the laptop but the annoying Chrome freezes were
 gone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now today suddenly (so far four times) videos in full screen have gotten stuck again while sound kept playing. There's a significant difference to before, though, as the video freezes and internet does not work on other tabs, however those tabs do actually
 display properly and only the initial tab now shows completely blank when I get back to it without turning off my wi-fi. No idea if that is any help in figuring out what is the cause of this strange behavior. Nothing has changed as far as my settings etc.
 go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Gina suggested was installing a different version of Chrome. The problem I have with that or general new installs is that I have personalized my Chrome browser to a decent extent and reconfiguring everything is something of a last resort step. Given
 that my issue is not focused on Chrome I feel like it is probably not the culprit here.
</p>
<p>As for the ISP part, Gina mentioned that it happened on Android as well. I have a cell phone and a tablet as well as an older desktop computer who are all on the same network without any problems (outside of normal crappy connection stuff that just happens
 in rural areas), same goes for everyone else that is using the network. Add to that that our ISP is not very supportive when called
</p>
<p>(we have had several issues before like not receiving the promised internet connection speed, having random cut-offs, traffic being extremely slow at night as if they are throttling it, which they obviously deny, and most of the time the answer is "from
 our side everything is fine. It must be your modem/router/end devices. Please call support of the producers of those" which in turn leads to nothing either. They tried to sell as an internet plan that has amazing speed but limited download rate and the "helpful"
 support person explained how that was not a problem with online gaming and streaming (Netflix etc.) as aforementioned download limit would only apply to actual data download of files to devices. As if the modems made any distinction there.)</p>
<p>while (or because of) being the only half-way decent option for good internet speed in our rather rural area.
</p>
<p>So I could certainly call them but I doubt the (paid for) call would last more than a few minutes and result in anything more than "Is this affecting anybody else or any other devices? No? Well, then you should probably contact the manufacturer of your device
 or Windows support, I don't see how the issue would lie with us." </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, bottom line, if you recommend me installing Chrome x64 (why does Google even auto-install the 32bit version if there are compatibility issues with the nowadays far more common 64bit processor devices and there is a perfectly functioning 64bit version?)
 I will try it and check if the issue returns, otherwise I'm open for different suggestions. Sorry for the late reply, been kinda busy last week (partially involving the laptop, though, so it wasn't lack of internet usage that led to the issue not occurring)
 and did not think of checking this thread regularly. Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Gotta love this. Just happened again, this time text book with every screen but the video screen blank. What the heck.</p>

            <p>I'm having similar issues, which seem to be related mostly with the display. Everything locks up, though sound will continue usually. I can even keep on typing and it'll all pop up whenever the display starts working again, usually about 10 seconds or so,
 but sometimes as long as almost a minute. The cursor will usually still move around, but nothing is responsive on the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was quite obviously a result of the upgrade on around the 11th. I have my machine set to let me decide if I want to restart, but this one told me it would restart in about 20 min. I couldn't find any way to stop it, in spite of the fact that I as in
 the middle of working with someone out of state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the forced restart, the display started consistently freezing. I've tried restarting several times, with no observable improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This machine is super robust, allowing me to have many tabs, browsers and apps going at once, and still letting me watch videos without a hitch. It never has done anything to show me that it couldn't handle anything I've thrown at it. Now I can't even perform
 a simple task without freezing, even with only one browser open and all apps closed. Forget watching a video. It's out of the question. The image freezes up every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked video drivers, but it's up to date. I've watched the resources, but nothing stands out. I've tried to run the troubleshooter, but all it does is find a problem with the cache store that it can't seem to fix (what's the point?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restoring, but it won't let me, claiming that the last restore point is more than 10 days ago. What's up with that? It also won't let me uninstall the latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An amazing machine has been turned into a sluggish pig with one forced update. It's pretty tough to be productive right now, with these sluggish delays easily doubling the amount of time it takes to perform anything but the simplest tasks. Sometimes just
 opening another tab or clicking on a button requires waiting until the display can catch up with my actions.</p>

            <p>That does sound similar yet different. Like for me it won't come back (at least in the 1-2 minutes it has gone on yet before I fixed it) and usually I can still move the cursor , it's literally that one tab being frozen, the rest being blank, then recently
 perfectly normal, nor blank again the last time. </p>
<p>What I should mention is that when the tab freezes without a video playing, I can't scroll or anything, cursor still going though, when I turn wi-fi off and on again it will have continued with all the scrolls I've done while it was frozen. Also, the freezes
 seem to appear a lot more prominently when a video is playing, freezes are extremely rare when I'm just browsing. No other difference that I could think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I also assume it should be something related to software or displaying issues, as everything seems to work, just that one tab always gets frozen in time (and others become blank when changed to) while my machine acts like nothing happened, still plays
 sound and takes all my controls. I can easily Spacebar pause or "M" mute the video, it really only doesn't display properly. But then there's the fact that it occurs far more often when a video is playing (=high data load?), not generally while browsing, which
 points to something network related. That or graphics card and again display, with videos stressing the screen and card a lot more than just pages being displayed and scrolled on. It also only occurs in the browsers, not for example Skype, which points away
 from network. However, the other issue of net not working (haven't had any occur during a Skype call so can't tell for 100% certain that net is actually not working in my other issue where it just vanishes until I turn wi-fi off and on) on the other hand sounds
 very specifically like a network problem given that it just cuts the network off. Still suspect something network-related on my laptop rather than the whole system, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just seems so fixable because it's so specific, yet so unfixable because it's so specific and apparently nobody else has the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Okay, it seems to keep switching between the two versions of the issue now. What I've just noticed is that when it freezes and the other tabs stay fine, the full screen only exits into the browser window, i.e. filling out the whole tab, and the mouse
 does not show when hovering over the display area of the tab, only above it where you switch tabs. The tab also stays unresponsive to button presses (after the "Escape" from full screen) until after "fixing" (which is what I'll refer to switching wi-fi off
 and on as from now on to not have to write it out all the time). Which in turn points the blame more towards Chrome, not any displaying errors. Gonna have to check how responsive other tabs and firefox are the next time it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit2: Okay, just happened again and I left it running. This time all the tabs were blank once I switched, which never happened before but suggests it's all the same thing manifesting slightly differently. Logically, no other tab let me enter anything either,
 video stopped after a few seconds due to internet being gone. Firefox also had no internet, same for Skype (offline icon appeared). So I guess it's safe to say that these issues affect internet throughout the laptop, not just a single or several browsers.
 It can happen in both Firefox and Chrome but only glitches out the browser that was in view at the time of occurrence.
</p>
<p>So, again, I doubt it has very much to do with any of my browsers, I'm open to the network and display/software interpretations although I do not understand why a network issue would make Chrome or Firefox behave the way they do. Still hoping for a Windows
 update any time soon that fixes this, obviously, although I doubt anyone would actively work on that given nobody has that problem.</p>

<p>I have AT&amp;T U-verse. I have a package including NFL network and NFL red zone which both currently work on my TV. However, for the last week I haven't been able to watch it through the NFL app on Xbox one.after typing in the code and being told through the
 NFL website that my device is activated, the Xbox one gives me a message "sorry, the app is not able to authorize you. Please try again in a few minutes."</p>
<p>I subscribed to those channels with the intention of watching them through the Xbox last week, and I have no idea why its not working.&nbsp;</p>

This has been around for ages and it seems that it is nowhere really described what this means and how to fix it.<br />
I tried everything from registry fixes to restarting&nbsp;bits,&nbsp;wuauserv&nbsp; crpto services and so forth.<br />
I do hope that there is fix for the "average joe" available from the Microsoft site and not some dodgy tools provider.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
Thanks for replying.&nbsp;<br />
I am not sure what update it is, the update history is empty and the troublershooter says:<br />
"An unexpected error has occurred, The troubleshooting wizard can't continue."<br />
The details reveal the&nbsp;0x803C0103 error code.<br />
</p>
<p>I hope that can be fixed easily :-)&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update and apologies for late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must require a repair disc in order to run startup repair. You can also perform system restore as suggested earlier.</p>

<div>Hi legolazzz,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. What Operating System are you using?</div>
<div>b. Do you remember any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From your earlier post , it seems like the issue is to do with the graphic card drivers and BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Along with the suggestions suggested by Cari, you could follow the below methods to check if the issue persists.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest you to disable automatic restart on system failure and try to make note of the error message and reply back with the exact error message you receive on the blue screen. Once we have the exact error message we will be in a better position
 to determine the exact nature of the issue and fix it.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to disable Automatic Restart on system failure and try to make note of the error message and reply back with the exact error message you receive on the blue screen. Once we have the exact error message we will be in a better position to
 determine the exact nature of the issue and fix it.<br />
<div><br />
<div><strong>Follow the steps below to disable Automatic restart on system failure:</strong><br />
<br />
a. Click on Start.<br />
<br />
b. Type system in the search box after clicking Start. Choose System from the list of results.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If you're viewing the Classic View of Control Panel, you won't see this link. Simply double-click on the System icon and proceed to Step 4.<br />
<br />
c. Click on the System link.<br />
<br />
d. In the task pane on the left, click the Advanced system settings link.<br />
<br />
e. Locate the Startup and Recovery area and click on the Settings button.<br />
<br />
f. In the Startup and Recovery window, locate and uncheck the check box next to automatically restart.<br />
<br />
g. Click OK in the Startup and Recovery window.<br />
<br />
h. Click OK in the System Properties window.<br />
<br />
You can now close the System window.<br />
<div><br />
<div>From now on, when the computer shuts down the computer will not automatically reboot and you will receive the error message, make a note of it and post back.<br />
<br />
Also you may open event viewer and check if there are any other significant error messages/codes. Refer the link below for more details:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</strong> <br />

<br />
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you check for any updates from the manufacturer.</div>

                    I have been recording over-the-air TV programs on WMC 7 without problems. All of a sudden last night, around 10 PM, I lost the signal for KABC-7, our local ABC affiliate in Los Angeles. All of the other channels seem to come in fine. I re-did the TV signal
 setup and re-scanned for channels, but it is the same problem. Almost all of the other channels come in, except for KABC-7 - which is a problem because I want to record Game 5 of the NBA finals tomorrow! I usually record and watch these games after we put
 our kid to sleep. The station comes in perfectly fine if I plug the antenna directly into my TV. My TV card is a&nbsp;

Since you are facing issue with one particular channel I would suggest you to check with particular channel support and check if there is any issue with the signal strength.<br />

<h2>            DPC Watchdog violation</h2>
                    I recently replaced Windows XP With Windows 8, but it has been funny / slow since day one. &nbsp;When surfing the web my browser will become choppy and slow, until eventually crashes and I get a BSOD. &nbsp;The main program I use to work on music (ableton live)
 can barely run because the memory maxes out too soon. &nbsp;I never used to have these problems in XP. &nbsp;I attached a zip of my mini dumps here.

<div><strong>These crashes were related to memory corruption (<font color="#FF0000">probably caused by a driver</font>).&nbsp;<br />

Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</strong></div>

</strong>Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. Get it&nbsp;<b><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></b><br />
Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
If a known good stick fails in one motherboard slot but not another it is probably the slot<em>.</em><br />

Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition.<br />
Most times it will&nbsp;crash and it will tell you what the driver is, but sometimes it will crash and won't tell you the driver.</div>
<div>Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Start</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and type in "<b>verifier</b>" (without the quotes) and press<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Enter</b><br />
Select "<b>Create</b><span>&nbsp;</span>custom settings (for code developers)" and click "<b>Next</b>"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
Select everything<span>&nbsp;</span><b>EXCEPT FOR</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Low Resource Simulation"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>For Win 8 dont check</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Concurrency stress test, and DDI compliance checking click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers<span>&nbsp;</span><b>NOT</b><span>&nbsp;</span>provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Finish" on the next page.<br />
<b><br />
Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.</b><br />
<b>Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b>If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.</div>
