<h2>            What could cause intermittent &#34;Operating system not found&#34; on boot-up - HP Pavilion dv9815nr Notebook PC, Windows Vista Premium 32 bit, IE9</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Primary problem - on boot-up I get a blank black screen with what appears to be a command cursor that just blinks for several minutes until it is replaced by "Operating system not found". After an unpredictable number of CTRL / ALT / DELETE's it does finally
 catch.</p>
<p>Secondary problem that might or might not be associated - I routinely use Windows Photo Gallery to sort through photo downloads from my camera, deciding what to keep etc. Lately, it has been taking several moments to achieve each deletion. Pesky, but not
 a show stopper.</p>
<p>What I have tried - on boot-up, pressing F keys to interrupt and then running self diagnostics. The memory and disc appear to have no issues discoverable by these tests.</p>
<p>In Googling the issue, I did find several references but no solutions, at least not from sites I might trust. I did try one, and got stuck in it. The site would not allow me to exit because it was waiting for a response I was not willing to provide,, had
 to end the session thru Task Manager.</p>
<p>Upon advice from a friend, I created a backup of picture, video, data files etc. and then restarted the system. On boot-up, I used F11 to access the HP Recovery process and reset the computer back to factory original,, (in theory?). I say "in theory" because
 the "factory original" is rebuilt from the files on the computer‘s hard drive, not from an external source like a CD or DVDR. It seems possible to me, that unwanted code could have been inserted into the HP Recovery files and that this boot-up problem might
 be the result of a virus or some other such business.</p>
<p>The recovery process went along well, as far as I could tell. I did see several small command-style boxes come and go and one that hung there just long enough for me to start reading it before it disappeared. After the recovery there came the multitude of
 Windows updates and then the task of redoing my internet preferences. Somewhere in that process things went bad. The system was still able to acquire and download updates but I could not access the internet myself. Finally I decided I would need to run the
 HP Recovery process again.</p>
<p>The second time through, worked as well as the first, and this time I was waiting for that command style box to appear and when it did my eyes caught on the following, "..... will assume this is ??? 32......", and then it was gone. The "???" is a place holder
 for the characters I failed to catch. What did catch, and hold, my attention was the word “assume”.</p>
<p>Back in the day, for a period, I was a computer programmer, not machine language but COBOL and RPGII among others. One indispensable tool was the use of comments or comment lines to describe the actions or functions of subroutines, called procedures, variables
 etc. Explicate descriptions were the rule. If for whatever reason you were no longer available, any other programmer on the team ought to be able to take a dump of the portion of the program you were working on and (with your comments, coding and flowcharts)
 walk right through the entire process. Never, ever would a programmer ASSUME anything. In no code I ever wrote or read did I encounter the word "assume" in the comments. So, to see this as part of a legitimate piece of anything belonging to HP or Microsoft
 just doesn't jive.</p>
<p>My inclination is to wonder if this was a "not-meant-to-be-read-by-the-user" self note for the developer of a nasty bit of business. So I’m trying to place this in a context that might make sense. Might the complete sentence have been something like, “when
 the system encounters this file it (will assume this is ___ 32)…..” Does anyone know if there is a file, with “ ___ 32” in its name, in either HP Recovery or the operating system that could be replaced with an altered version that could cause the problem or
 problems I’ve been and still am experiencing?</p>

<p>I’ve installed every available Windows update (120 plus) all the way through SP2,, IE9,, and counting.
</p>
<p>The diagnostics found no problems.</p>
<p>Even repeated security scans (Windows and Norton360) have found nothing.</p>
<p>At this point, any ideas would be helpful….</p>

            My first thought throughout is HD.&nbsp; I would run a chkdsk /r/f and go to the mfr and download their disk utility.<br />
<br />
If you havent already make a backup.<br />
<br />
Ir probably isnt software but just in case I would also run a system file check<br />
<br />
A- CHKDSK /R /F:<br />
<br />
Chkdsk disclaimer: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found&nbsp; when chkdsk tries to repair that sector&nbsp; any data available on that sector might be lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Run CHKDSK /R /F from an elevated (Run as administrator) Command Prompt.<br />
<br />
Do this for each hard drive on your system.<br />
<br />
When it tells you it can't do it right now - and asks you if you'd like to do it at the next reboot - answer Y (for Yes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Then reboot and let the test run.<br />
<br />
It may take a while for it to run, but keep an occasional eye on it to see if it generates any errors.<br />
<br />
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/guide-to-using-check-disk-in-windows-vista/<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;See "CHKDSK LogFile" below in order to check the results of the test.<br />
<br />
<br />
B- Elevated Command Prompt:<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the Search Box, right click on Cmd.exe and select "Run as administrator"<br />
<br />
<br />
C-CHKDSK LogFile:<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "eventvwr.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
<br />
Expand the Windows logs heading, then select the Application log file entry.<br />
<br />
Double click on the Source column header.<br />
<br />
Scroll down the list until you find the Chkdsk entry (wininit for Win7) (winlogon for XP).<br />
<br />
Copy/paste the results into your next post.<br />

<p>Hey there :)</p>
<p>This is a strange issue. I would consult with the manufacturer on how to check the console's HDD health as it might have problems and prevent you from playing the game properly. Here's a KB on this that might be useful:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-360/system/hard-drive#eb43c45720e94035940f316d194621af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../hard-drive</a></p>
<p>Ideally you'd want to check the S.M.A.R.T. status of the drive but you'd need to plug it into a computer for this and I'd check if removing it voids the warranty of the console.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Blue Screen Spinning Dots - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcindric  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Blue Screen Spinning Dots</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my OS to Windows 10 about a month ago and until yesterday I had very minimal issues. &nbsp;While checking out some of the functions I decided to try to connect to XBox and check out the streaming function. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the upgrade and in the time since I utilized my old login which was not connected to my Microsoft account; it was a simple user name and password. &nbsp;When I connected to the XBox it asked fore my Microsoft account information which I provided. &nbsp;Unbeknownst
 to me or I missed the warning but it changed my user to the Microsoft account. &nbsp;I only found this out after my system would not boot to the login screen and after mulitple attempts was able to get in through safe mode and realized that the login had changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially my computer will not load to the login screen. &nbsp;I get past the four square windows screen, hear the tell tale welcome chime and then a blue screen with spinning dots. &nbsp;Oddly enough the screen also flickers so that if I try something like CTRL+ALT+DELETE
 it will briefly bring up the screen with the power button but will immediately go back to the blue screen with spinning dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use a boot device to do a startup repair (comes up message that it could not do anything) and I apparently have no previous builds or system restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be certain that the user account is the issue but I can't get the login screen to appear. &nbsp;I have been able to get to boot to safe mode but am lost from there.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform <strong>Automatic repair </strong>and check if the issue is resolved</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may use <strong><span>Windows 10 installation disc/USB</span></strong> to perform automatic repair by creating a Media Creation Tool. Use the link below to create the media tool.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform the Automatic repair:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to check the option for boot menu, it will usually be
<strong><span>F12</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b) The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is displayed, keep pressing the
<strong><span>Boot menu option</span></strong> key to enter the boot menu and change the boot option to
<strong><span>CD\DVD ROM</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong><span>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</span></strong>". Press any key.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Select the correct time and <strong><span>Keyboard type</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong> in the lower left corner
</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click on <strong><span>Troubleshooting</span></strong>, advanced option and then click
<strong><span>Automatic repair</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Get back to us if you have queries regarding Windows, we will be happy to help you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you,<br />
Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>The operating system version is incompatible with Startup Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to try other options but after trying the Startup Repair several times I don't think it is the solution.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and perform the Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart
</strong>at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><li><span>1. Select <strong>T</strong></span><strong><span><span>roubleshoot</span></span></strong><span><span>and click on
</span></span><strong><span><span>Advanced Options</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>2. Select </span></span><strong><span><span>Startup Settings</span></span></strong><span><span>and click on
</span></span><strong><span><span>Restart</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
<p><span><span>3. After restarting, choose </span></span><strong><span><span>Enable Safe mode</span></span><span><span>with networking</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After Clean Boot troubleshooting step, refer to "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with Clean Boot</strong>" from the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>You may try to boot from the Windows 10 media and try performing an Automatic repair from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</p>
<p>To perform Automatic repair on Windows 10 computer follow these steps:</p>
<p>a) <strong>Insert the media</strong> such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer</p>
<p>b) <strong>Press F12</strong> key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</p>
<p>Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</p>
<p>c) Click <strong>Next </strong>and select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.
</p>
<p>d) You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong> and select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</p>
<p>e) You may choose <strong>Automatic Repair</strong> from Advanced boot option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the below link to download the ISO and create the installation media:</p>

            <p>Annu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to get the computer to login in safe mode with networking but the clean boot did not work. &nbsp;Additionally I have tried on several occasions to perform a Startup Repair (there is no Automatic Repair option) only to have it say it is unable to do
 a repair and the log file returns the message indicated in my previous post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per my original post it appears that this has something to do with my user account change. &nbsp;During the spinning dots screen I can press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and the login screen will briefly appear before returning to the spinning dots screen. &nbsp;What I can tell
 when the screen appears is that there is no login box, only the ease of access options in the lower right corner. &nbsp;Aside from the user account change that occurred when I used the Xbox app nothing more has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any further help.</p>

            <p>Hello Purushotam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your computer connected to a domain network?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also realize the inconvenience you are experiencing due to <strong>APIPA </strong>
issue. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With <strong>APIPA</strong>, <strong>DHCP </strong>clients can automatically self-configure an IP address and subnet mask when a DHCP server isn't available. When a
<strong>DHCP </strong>client boots up, it first looks for a <strong>DHCP </strong>
server in order to obtain an IP address and subnet mask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the client is unable to find the information, it uses <strong>APIPA </strong>
to automatically configure itself with an IP address from a range that has been reserved especially for Microsoft. The IP address range is
<strong>169.254.0.1</strong> through <strong>169.254.255.254.</strong> The client also configures itself with a default class B subnet mask of
<strong>255.255.0.0</strong>. A client uses the self-configured IP address until a
<strong>DHCP </strong>server becomes available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if <strong>DHCP </strong>server has not assigned IP address to Windows or if
<strong>DNS </strong>service has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + C keys </strong>together and click <strong>search</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Type <strong>cmd </strong>in search box, right click <strong>command prompt
</strong>in search results and click <strong>run as administrator.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Type the following commands in command prompt one by one and press Enter after each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>netsh winsock reset catalog</strong><br />
<strong>netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt</strong><br />
<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /registerdns</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /release</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with required information and do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Unfortunately, language localization is not that simple. Microsoft has to do a lot of market research, sociology, anthropology to determine if there is a significant enough demand&nbsp;before they can commit&nbsp;the resources to invest in developing support for
 that language in Windows. Its a lot of work, since it&nbsp;requires engineering application programming interfaces and other products to work with it. &nbsp;

<h3> mike in phoenix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x80042412 when restoring from a system image backup</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to help my elderly mother with a computer problem. She has a Toshiba laptop running Windows 7. The hard drive is failing and Toshiba confirmed that it needs to be replaced.</p>
<p>I purchased a new hard drive at a local retailer and installed the new drive, after creating a "system repair disk" and a "system image backup".&nbsp;I am trying to restore her system, software, and data to the new hard drive using a "system image restore". Everything
 seems to have&nbsp;gone well so far, but now that I am trying to restore the image, I get an error message (0x80042412).</p>
<p>I have checked many sites and forums for this message, but I have yet to determine why it will not restore the image. One thing that I came across is a statement that the new hard drive must be the same size, or larger than the original hard drive, because
 I could not find another 640gb drive, only a 500gb replacement.&nbsp;Can anyone help me with this? Please?</p>

            <p>Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga.&nbsp; 254 GB SSD drive was failing so did a win8.1 system image backup&nbsp;onto external drive (60GB image done pretty quick).&nbsp; Lenovo tech replace same size&nbsp;SSD hard drive.&nbsp; Got a copy of Windows 8.1 DVD and external DVD drive.&nbsp; boot to DVD
 and </p>
<p>1. select "repair&nbsp;your&nbsp;computer option"</p>
<p>2. Troubleshoot</p>
<p>3. advance options</p>
<p>4. System Image Recovery</p>
<p>5. Chose "Windows 8.1" for target operating system (only selection)</p>
<p>6. finds system image on external drive</p>
<p>7 next screen show additional restore options keep default and click Next</p>
<p>
</p><p>got error message: No disk that can be used for recovering the system disk can be found.... error code 0x80042412</p>
<p>
</p><p>spent&nbsp;5 hours troubleshooting error, MS forums, Mr Google.&nbsp; fooled around with bios uefi settings, diskpart commands. Also use diskpart to format the drive and tried to restore disk image without success.&nbsp; Thought my system image backup was corrupt, thinking
 I probably have to reinstall from scratch and restore data manually from failing drive. (which the tech already took back with him)</p>

<p>
</p><p>tried the fix from below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I finally just got it working.&nbsp; Trying to go from a 500gb drive to another 500gb drive and getting the same error.&nbsp; I went into Diskpart and type "select disk=0".&nbsp; Then I type "detail disk" to make sure I had the right drive.&nbsp; I typed "Clean", and then&nbsp;"exit"
 to get out of Diskpart.&nbsp; And then I started the image recovery and finally it works.&nbsp; Before I did these commands I had formatted the drive to one large partition, set the partition to active, and made sure it had a drive letter&nbsp;assigned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>this did not fix the problem still got same error message.&nbsp; almost 1AM and about to give up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>decided to Boot to DVD again and start a fresh install of Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>came to part where it asks you to format hard disk.&nbsp; I deleted all partitions and create one whole partitions, windows create 3 additional partitions for recovery, system and etc.&nbsp; the 4th partition had the biggest size. 238 GB.&nbsp; so I formatted this partition.&nbsp;
 click next to start Win 8.1 install but cancelled it right away. (could of restarted the computer after the formatting was done)&nbsp; All I wanted to do was format the drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sames step as earlier...</p>
<p>
boot to DVD and

<p>
</p><p>VOILAA!!&nbsp; system&nbsp; image ran through completely (didn't time it but went pretty quick)</p>
<p>System restored!</p>
<p>
</p><p>formatting the hard drive during the Fresh Windows installed made it work!!?.&nbsp; not sure why but it did.</p>
<p>

            <p>I signed up just to tell you that I have been messing with getting Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 System Image Backup to work the last few days, reading and trying all kinds of things. Sometimes it would work on some system, but my laptop I couldn't get it to
 go and your method worked, why I am not sure as I tried about everything else it seemed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into disk part and selected my HDD and "cleaned" it then went to install Windows 10(Preview) and when I get to the screen to select the drive to install Windows on I selected my HDD and clicked format(Windows auto created&nbsp;2 partitions)&nbsp;and then install
 to the larger one. But as soon as it starts to install click the X in the upper right corner to cancel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then rebooted from the Windows 10 USB and as you did.......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. select "repair&nbsp;your&nbsp;computer option"</p>
<p>2. Troubleshoot</p>
<p>3. advance options</p>
<p>4. System Image Recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had mine on a USB which I had plugged in and it found it as it had been before but this time it actually started and finished with an error :)</p>

            <p>i had the same problem I have a 60GB SSD and a 1tb HDD. What happened is when I made the image the SSD was labled C:/ obviously but here is the thing I also backed up the HDD in my image also so when I tried to restore it using the image it was looking for
 the HDD as F:/ but I had the HDD as D:/ </p>
<p>So to fix this I did a fresh install of the OS when it was done installing the OS I opened disk manager and removed the drive letter that the system automatically assigned my card reader F:/ and put F back on my HDD retried the image and boom it worked but
 it still gave me some parameter error but I ignored it booted the computer back up and seems to be working. And just to assure myself I booted the os disc and used it to delete all partions on the ssd and hdd then exited the os install and chose repair instead
 and repeated the system image restore and this time around no errors so this worked for me. hope this helps anyone else that may have goofed like me</p>

<h2>            Control Panel - Application not found</h2>
                    
<p>When I click 'Control Panel' from the 'Start' menu, a small window comes up with Explorer.exe at the top and the words 'Application not found'.&nbsp; I get automatic Windows updates, so I'm assuming this was taken out inadvertently during one of my updates.&nbsp;
 The 'Control Panel' use to be accessible before.&nbsp; This hasn't affected the rest of the operation of my computer.&nbsp; When I go to online help I have to give the product code---instructions for getting this code are in the 'Control Panel' which I can't access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide</p>

<div>
<p><span>Before addressing the problem, let me offer some assistance with getting access to the Product Key.&nbsp; Download and install
 Belarc Advisor <a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a>&nbsp;which when run will provide you with that information (frankly, I don't know how to get the Product Key using Control Panel and would appreciate
 you letting me know how to do that in a reply if it''s not too much trouble - It provides some product identification codes in the System program&nbsp;but not the actual Product Key unless I'm mistaken).&nbsp; To my knowledge this third party product is the only way
 to get the actual Product key from the system (though there may be other third party products - I just know about this one).&nbsp; You can also get some Product identication codes in Start / Computer / System Properties and look at the bottom at system activation.&nbsp;
 This is NOT the Product Key but some other code that only people at Microsoft can decipher (if even they can) - and it's placed there once you insert the proper Product Key so the actual Product Key no longer shows.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, let's address the problem:</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began (give it a little leeway if you can).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.&nbsp; This is the easiest and most likely way to resolve the problem if you know when it began and have system restore points before that point in time.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, here's an article from Microsoft speaking to the problem of being unable to open
 the Control Panel in Vista and suggested a repair: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936686/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936686/en-us</a>.&nbsp; It's worth a try.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;Control Panel &nbsp;(Start / Control Panel / Administrative
 Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good
 maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
</span></span><br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

            I'm sorry to say this but I have been looking around and they don't have a Vista Driver for Crystal SoundFusion(tm) CS4281. It looks like there not going to make a driver for that type of sound card for Vista. The closest I came to a Vista driver was here
<a href="http://www.zdnetasia.com/downloads/pc/swinfo/0,39043052,50002418r-39496284s,00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.zdnetasia.com/downloads/pc/swinfo/0,39043052,50002418r-39496284s,00.htm</a>&nbsp;but when I tryed the program it only came with a 2000 driver in it.
<br />
<br />
Sorry but it looks like XP is the only one that can run that sound card.

<h2>            Boot manager installs on wrong HDD and raid HDD&#39;s was not assigned drive letters after install</h2>
                    This is first time I installed Windows 7 and after updating motherboard BIOS and mixing the HDD boot order I find out in the end that the files Windows require has been installed on my mirror raid instead of the system disk stripe raid. This annoys me
 a bit, do I have to plug out all my HDD's except the ones I want to install Windows 7 on to ensure the booting is independent of other HDD's?<br />
<br />
(Another annoyance was that the mirror raid did not show up under my computer, which after installing every driver known to man I found that a drive letter had not been assigned.)

            Solution:<br />
<br />
I marked the Windows partition as active in disk manager.<br />
I copied the Boot folder, bootmgr and BOOTSECT.BAK from the other disk.<br />
As the BCD and BCD.log files were in use by the system, I rebooted and used the repair option on the<br />
Windows 7 DVD which at once detected that the files were missing, it was repaired and Windows is now<br />
bootable from the Windows disk.

<h2>            My C&#58;&#92; space is getting eaten very fastly in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am running a Dell Inspiron Laptop and bought it with Windows 8.1 OS. Within fewer days Microsoft invited me to upgrade to Windows 10 and I did it at its initial stage of release only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, I have been seeing what might be the issue that is eating my C:\ drive space which is 105 GB. As it is nearing that limit, I have increased the space to 135 GB and now it reached to around 123 GB with 12GB left over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could not understand what might be the reason. I tried a lot to handle it but I could not. I am not a Windows expert but is it something like I am getting new updates/upgrades getting installed but the older versions of their corresponding update
 is not getting deleted which is occupying the space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please someone help me and pull me out of this hell situation.</p>

            What model Inspiron? 135 gb is not enough space for windows 10 and your files. If you have partitioned an older laptop for the old versions of Windows, you might need to repartition your hard drive to combine all the space into one and reinstall windows
 and all your files. Breaking up a normal sized hard drive into smaller partitions is not recommended for today's Windows.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mine is a Dell Inspiron 15 5000 Series model. And the space 135 GB what I am saying is only for C:\ drive. My entire hard disk is of 1TB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Earlier C:\ drive space 100 GB and I used some spanning sort of techniques to increase the size of the drive which of course allowed me to 135 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could you please suggest with this information ?</p>

</span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Microsoft Windows operating systems include a power function called hibernate that saves the desktop state and random access memory (RAM) contents before closing down. Upon
 the next boot, the hibernate feature restores the desktop as it was at the end of the prior session. This differs from Shut Down, which dumps RAM contents and closes all programs and files. Upon booting after a standard shut down, the desktop is pristine.
 If one wants to continue working on a previous project, programs and associated files must be reopened manually.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
Power.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hibernation involves a full power off and saves the system state in a file on disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hybrid shutdown depends on a machine's low power mode to maintain the state of the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, check your&nbsp; Power Options&nbsp;&nbsp; advanced settings because the state
 can switch over time.</p>

            <p>The actual difference between <em>hibernation</em> and <em>shut down</em> in Windows 8, as I understand it, is the part of memory that is being&nbsp;saved on the hard drive just&nbsp;before the PC turns off.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In hibernation, as <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c4a66171-694a-4d9e-b657-a674c7887557">
<font color="#0072c6">Jeevan Yadav </font></a>described, all of the RAM's&nbsp;contents are&nbsp;being saved on the hard disk so the next time the computer launches, the session is restored at the exact same&nbsp;point it was turned off.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In shut down with fast startup enabled (Windows 8 only), the session is terminated (the user is signed out) and only the part of memory that remains (for Windows and other basic processes) is saved on the hard disk. This way, the PC is&nbsp;boots up&nbsp;faster next
 time you hit the power button, since it does not require&nbsp;to launch from the beginning&nbsp;every single&nbsp;system&nbsp;process (but not as fast as if it was hibernated).
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since Windows Vista, there is also hybrid sleep, which applies only for desktops and includes both sleeping and writing all contents of&nbsp;the RAM&nbsp;on the hard disk (partly hibernating) to restore the PC in case of power failure.

            <b>Hibernation</b> will store all memory content which includes kernel and user session.<br />
<br />
<b>Hybrid shutdown</b> will log-out user session and save only the kernel session.<br />
<br />
Therefore, <b>hybrid shutdown</b> is a smaller content set to save to disk. It is more quickly to svae, and faster to restore. It is also safer to log-out user session for security concern.<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 this happen only with the Games disc?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does

<h2>            How do I get my other computer harddrive to be accessed as an external drive</h2>
                    <p>I have 1TB hard drive which used to run windows 10 with UEFI boot. I tried connecting it as an external drive to another computer which runs win 10 with UEFI as well, but I cannot access the files in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external drive shows up in device manager and in disk managements as GPT partition. But cannot assign drive to it, as its greyed out. Tried using Diskpart to assign a drive letter to it but it did not allow me. I read something online that it may be
 protected due to UEFI etc and most solutions required reformating. &nbsp;I would like to remove some files from it before doing a reformat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I can access the data on the hard drive at all?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Awinston,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better I would like to know, what is the make and model of the HDD?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For now, let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below steps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open <strong>
Disk Management</strong> and look for the drive that is identified as GPT and note the
<strong>Disk number </strong><span>.e.g. Disk 1</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open a Command prompt by pressing Windows key + X, select Command prompt, type
<strong>diskpart</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. The diskpart prompt will open.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From the diskpart prompt, type
<strong>list disk</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A list of disks will appear in a text format. You will return to the diskpart prompt.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From the diskpart prompt, type
<strong>select disk <em>disknumber</em></strong> (for instance, if the disk containing the GPT Protective partion is Disk 2, you would type
<strong><em>select </em></strong><span>Disk 2</span>)and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A message appears saying that the disk is selected. You will return to the diskpart prompt.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From the diskpart prompt, type
<strong>clean</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. At this point the drive's partition and signature a removed. You will return to the diskpart prompt.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>From the diskpart prompt, type
<strong>exit</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Type <strong>exit</strong> once more to close the Command Window. At this point, the internal and/or external drive can be re-initialized, partitioned and formatted.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Launch Disk Management, and to initialize the disk:
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>8.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Close the Wizard, right-click on the disk in question and select Initialize Disk from the drop-down menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>9.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Once the drive is initialized, continue using Disk Management to partition and format the drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the result for further assistance. </span></p>
