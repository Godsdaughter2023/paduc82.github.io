<h2>            Missing Wifi Icon on Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey I just upgraded my laptop into Windows 10. But sometimes my wifi icon is missing and all I have to do is to restart it all from the beginning. It doesn't occur once, but often. I wonder if you guys have a solution besides troubleshooting? because I think
 the problem is not on that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello Mister Target, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I do show them, but somehow in certain condition, the wifi icon won't appear unless I restart the system. It's pretty annoying since I haven't experience it when I was still using windows 8</p>

<h2>            Hyper V Platform cannot be installed</h2>
                    Ok so the error is that hyper v cannot be installed because virtualization is disabled in the firmware. But I Do enable the virtualization in bios and yet no result! It still says that virtualization is not disabled. Any idea of what might be wrong?

<p><span>Hi jhean_03,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Have you installed the latest drivers after upgrading to Windows 7 from Windows XP?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue is most likely caused due to the absence of device drivers. Iâ€™d suggest you to download and install the latest device drivers from the
 link below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Sony eSupport â€“ VGN-CS320J â€“ Software Updates &amp; Drivers</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=VGNCS320J&amp;SelectOS=48" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=VGNCS320J&amp;SelectOS=48</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Select the version (32-bit or 64-bit) of Windows 7 Ultimate and download and install the drivers to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<p><span>As I understand that you are facing the issue with the program Cyber buddy appear in a blue or green

            Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;As it turns out, the downloaded hotfix had to be unzipped. &nbsp;I thought it was just download and run program. &nbsp;You have to go to your downloads file, find the hotfix, then extract all. &nbsp; My Cyberbuddie works fine now.

<p>I really want to know what they have found out and how long my investigation will take depending on what they found.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The investigation will take as long as it needs to. There are 30 million subscribers, you are not the only person who needs attention. Be patient, that is why they told you it could
 take up to 30 days.</span></p>

<p>I have been told 7-30 days but that gap is too large, I want better answers.&nbsp; Is there anyway to contact or phone the people who are actually dealing with my problem?</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">When the support agent told you this on the phone why didn't you ask him/her why the gap was so loarge? You won't get any answers about your case until it has been resolved. Contacting
 them constantly about it will not speed up the process. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">While you are waiting for them to complete the investigation you should take a few moments to read up on Account Security for your XBL account. Many people claim they were 'hacked'
 but that just isn't possible on XBL. It is too secure and safe a network. If not then they would have been 'hacked' long ago and
<strong>millions </strong>of customers would have been affected, but that isn't the case at all. Many people just don't know how to keep their personal information to themselves or use the same log in information across multiple websites/services.

<p>As someone who has been waiting for about 3 months, I would say call support every week. I was being patient, waited for a month, stopped being patient, called back every week starting January. I got the run around a few times and finally found out my investigation
 got lost at some point. Got it restarted a few days ago. No telling how much time nothing at all was going on with my case.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you should be rude or anything. It's not the support reps fault the investigation team is probably balls deep in cases, but just my 2 cents based on my less than awesome experience.</p>

            Hi Tom
<br />
<br />Currently, you will have to manually select it.
<br />
<br />
<br />If someone has recently left you a message, you will see a notification in your recent conversations list.
<br />
<br />Click the contactâ€™s name in the Recent list, then in the conversation window, click the Play button next to the message.
<br />
<br />If you canâ€™t hear the message, try turning up the speaker volume on your computer.
<br />
<br />After you have listened to a voice message, it is stored locally on your computer. This means that you wonâ€™t be able to listen to it again if you sign in to Skype on a different device.

<h2>            new update has modified the privacy options and other options that existed before</h2>
                    <p>This new version of Skype is a disaster.... </p>
<p>I am dealing with problems about my privacy options ... they are not available as they were before.&nbsp; If they exist, somebody tell me where they are....I cannot delete conversation history. I have no access to different other options as they were before.
 You cannot even see who of your contacts is online. Whoever develops these new "features" in the Skype or simply eliminating the previous options that worked well is thinking in a non logical way. Even closing your account takes up to two weeks.</p>
<p>I am seriously considering closing my account. I feel like I am not able to use Skype as it was before.</p>
<p>I just discover that entering to your account on the chrome and there you can see the setting options but considerably reduced in comparison t what was in previous version.<br />
If you receive some images that you need to delete, you cannot do it.... unbelievable!!<br />
This is one more example of what new software developers are creating.. apparently more user friendly but most of them are not.</p>

<h2>            My computer isn&#39;t letting me log onto my other user accounts.</h2>
                    &nbsp;The main log in screen is completely different. It's only a little window now with my moms user account name and a space for a password. I don't have any option to switch accounts.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done nothing to my computer within a week. I've logged on once or twice on my moms account so it's been logged on for quite some time. When it first was locked it was an administrator account. I could go in and look at my other accounts but there
 was no way of logging on. Unfortunately, I thought if I changed my moms account to a limited account it would change back to the normal log in screen. It didn't. It's still the same small window and it only logs in for my mom. Although this time I am unable
 to view my other accounts. I can only view my moms so it seems as though there is only one account on my computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is becoming very frustrating. I have no idea what to do and I haven't seen any other problem like my own. My computer is not locked or anything... it only shows just one account. My documents are on my user account (which is an administrator). I have
 my music (itunes) and other important things. I really hope I don't lose all of it or I really hope I haven't already lost it. I honestly have no idea what to do. So please respond and help me with this. I need to get on my account.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure if this will help but my computer is a Dell and it is an Inspiron 1525.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please respond.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
If after that you are still crashing<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<em>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.<br />
If you continue to get BSOD here are some more things you may want to consider.</em><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the in-built memory diagnostics (run MDSCHED) or the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing.</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

<h2>            Vista 32 Home Premium&#58; USB Devices Not Recognized</h2>
                    Vista Home Premium<br />
Packard Bell Easynote MZ36-T-015UK<br />
<br />
OK, I keep getting "USB Device Not Recognized" errors in all three USB ports for all USB equipment.<br />
Even happns to a simple mouse that will work on other equipment!<br />
<br />
I have:<br />
Updated all Windows software<br />
Deleted all relevant USB devices in Device Manager and has Windows reinstall them<br />
Deleted INFCACHE from C:/WINDOWS/INF<br />
Deleted all USB information from Regedit (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM &gt; CCS &gt; ENUM &gt; USB) Especially the VID_xxxx entries!<br />
BIOS updated<br />
I have even let the power drain from the battery and rebooted<br />
<br />
None of it works!<br />
<br />
On the odd occasion I get a flicker from the optical mouse so I know a signal/current is getting through.<br />
<br />
In the taskbar under 'Driver Software Installation' it says "Unknown Device Installed - The software for the device has been successfully installed."<br />
Under the 'Unknown Device Properties' under DRIVER it&nbsp; shows driver details, but under GENERAL it says "No drivers are installed for this device".&nbsp; But isn't Vista plug and play?&nbsp; Should I need drivers for a simple optical mouse or iPod touch etc?<br />
BUT, in Device Manager all drivers are 100% up to date!<br />
<br />
Any advice would be appreciated.

<p><span>Hi AnsrewScaife,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>Will you please run a clean boot on your system and then see if you get the same issue after running a clean boot?</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps on how to run a clean boot on your system:</span></p>
<p><b><span>First Step: Perform a Clean Boot
</span></b></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to your computer with an administrative account.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to uncheck the Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.</span></p>
<p><span>*NOTE: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other
 services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Second Step: Enable Half of the Services
</span></b></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the System Configuration Utility. Refer to the steps above if you need to see how to do this.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.
</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.
</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Third Step: Determine whether the problem returns
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat the First Step and the Second Step. In the Second Step, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat the First Step and the Second Step. In the Second Step, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared
 in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to the Sixth Step. If
 no service causes this problem, go to the Fourth Step.</span></p>
<p><span>Fourth Step: Enable Half of the Startup Items
</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Startup tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Fifth Step: Determine Whether the Problem Returns
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat the First Step and the Fourth Step. In the Fourth Step, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat the First Step and the Fourth Step. In the Fourth Step, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared
 in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service
 that is causing the problem. Go to the Sixth Step.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem,
 repeat the First Step and the Second Step without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Sixth Step: Resolve the Problem
</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved.
 Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Seventh Step: Resolve the Problem
</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Here is the KB article these steps came from:</span></p>

            Unfortunately, this option is currently not available.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

<br />
<br />    An announcement has been posted on all Skype forums on MS Community.

            Andre - Thanks for your insights.&nbsp; It seems from all the other posts about Skype that we should say "SHAME ON MICROSOFT" for pushing version 8 down our throats way before it was ready or even supportable.&nbsp; And further shame for stopping version 7 too early.&nbsp;
 Maybe they're trying to force users to go elsewhere?

<h2>            HBOnow in Microsoft Edge - No full screen</h2>
                    My HBOnow no longer will go to full screen in Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; When I click to full screen it acts as if it will expand but then stays in the same size video in the upper left of the monitor.&nbsp; It is in full screen mode but does not show full screen.&nbsp; It
 used to work, then I had to hit it back and forth a few times to get it to full screen, but now it doesn't go to full screen size.&nbsp; Although it thinks it is.

<h2>            Windows8 Reader - Printing PDF&#39;s A4 onto Letter paper</h2>
                    <p>I have created a number of diagrams on A4 paper, some are portrait and some are landscape. They are stored in PDF files. I have sent them to a lady in Canada where she used to print them using Win7 on Letter paper (which is slightly smaller than A4) with
 no problem. But now she has Win8.1. It appears that when she prints them: a) a landscape diagram is printed across the middle of a portrait page, b) a portrait diagram is printed the right way up, but the bottom is cut off.</p>
<p>(eventually he gets to the question!) What is needed are the options to scale the document drawing and to rotate a landscape document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not have Win8, so can you advise me how she can locate these options?</p>

            <p>Thx Tom;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When she does that the bottom (of portrait) or left (of landscape) is cut off. &nbsp;A4 is taller than Letter, So to print it she needs it to shrink or fit the A4 size to Letter size. &nbsp;Is this functionality (that every OEM PDF reader has) available in Win8 Reader?</p>

<p>Yes, I have no doubt &nbsp;that an OEM PDF reader, such as Acrobat Reader or Foxit Reader will properly print A4 content on Letter paper. You or I would of course just install one of them. But this is an elderly lady with no technical skill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see that the user can choose to print portrait or landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is - does Win8 Reader have the functionality to automatically&nbsp;scale and rotate a document to fit on the current printer page? Or even &nbsp;manual options?</p>

<h2>            Will new Surface pen drivers fix the pressure issue in Zbrush&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The pen pressure currently doesn't work in Zbrush when using n-trig drivers.</p>
<p>I've talked to Pixologic and they can't do anything about it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The issue here is that software can support one protocol or the other (WinTab or N-trig). It can't support both.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">We developed ZBrush for the WinTab protocol because that is what the dominant graphics tablets (including Wacom) use. But this means that we cannot directly support N-trig. It's just not possible."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">If I install the WinTab driver, as several people have suggested, Zbrush does actually work great. Unfortunately Photoshop and Mischief suddenly draw terribly :S</span></p>

            <p>Hi! I just want to help you regarding your issue with Windows store. Here's the steps I've made so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may "right click" your start menu and go to "Control Panel".</p>
<p>Click "Network and Internet" and select "Network and sharing".</p>
<p>Click the internet connection you have there. For me, I'm using (WIFI)</p>
<p>Go to "properties" and search for "Internet protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPV4)</p>
<p>Select "properties" again.</p>
<p>Change the "obtain DNS server address automatically" to "Use the following DNS server address"</p>
<p>For preferred DNS server address change it to 8.8.8.8</p>
<p>for alternative address server, change it to 8.8.4.4</p>
<p>and click "Ok"</p>
<p>Restart your windows store.</p>
<p>Hope it will work!</p>

            Would you please explain this better. You need to explain where to get the "subnet mask" address, etc., to put in there; otherwise, it won't accept the change of the i.p. address.

            <p>Thank you, but I ended up deciding to back out of Windows 10 and revert back to Windows 7. Windows 10 was just much too unstable and kept crashing on me. Windows 7 isn't one of the most stable OS's either, but it's much more stable than Windows 10. I can't
 stand either Windows 8.x or 10, and I now know (among other reasons?) why the upgrade to Windows 10 was free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be even more completely honest, I think you guys (Microsoft) need to go back to Windows 98 or XP, which were probably your most stable OS's, and improve on them without over-complicating them and thus making them more and more unstable, and/or offer such
 an alternative OS for those who can't stand Windows 8 and 10. In other words, I think you need to go back to a pared-down (NON-METRO!), uncomplicated, very stable OS, or at least offer it as an alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, hint-hint, go back to supporting 98 or XP, probably the latter, XP, and keep updating it; and then heavily advertise that you're doing so. Thus, people who have stayed with those OS's will have a relief; and for those who don't and don't still own the
 install disk(s) for same, you make them available for purchase again, maybe at a very low price. Or make a new "XP" and call it "Windows 5.1", "Simplicity", or whatever, that is really just XP but improved without going "overboard" (simply improved original
 XP "template" or "foundation"), and heavily explain to the public why you're offering it. I believe millions of people would welcome it, especially after, like me, they considered Vista, Windows 7, and so on, to have been debacles that weren't worth the "upgrades".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another idea, create a very stable new OS that is the best of both worlds of Windows "XP" and Android combined into one platform; or, make it so you can switch back and forth between the two without rebooting; or, create a STABLE VMWare/Virtual Box software
 like Andy (which is crud as far as I'm concerned because it's too unstable and has too many problems, and lacking in any REAL support), where a complete, very stable Android OS version can be run in emulation within Windows (an OS within an OS). Or, vise versa,
 Windows within a Microsoft version of "Android".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that's what you (Microsoft) meant Windows 8 and 10 to be, "Android-like" versions of Windows; but, I believe with the Metro design, you stumbled. I suggest sticking with a more "true-to-Android" design if you can design that OS differently in such
 a way that, though it will still be very much like Android, you will not get in trouble with Google claims of copyright violation(s), or at least successful ones. Or partner with Google to create this new groundbreaking OS combining, quite-stably if you can,
 the best of both the Windows and Android worlds into one OS. Or something combining both into one that is "brand new" and monumentally groundbreaking, BUT *NOT* LIKE WINDOWS METRO AND WINDOWS 8 OR 10 IN ANY FASHION WHATSOEVER, OR VERY LITTLE!</p>

            What is the program?
<br />Did you go to task manager and try and kill the processes for that program?
<br />
<br />Also I find when I can't delete a program that going into safe mode is the best way.
<br />Hold your shift button and click to restart your computer.
<br />Select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.
<br />After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in Safe Mode. 
<br />
<br />Then see if you can delete the program.

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails locate the program in Task Manager reached by right clicking the task bar, under Processes, highlight then End Process.  Try deleting again.
<br />
<br />If that fails Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>The Skype account that was linked to your Office 365&nbsp;account is where the 60 minutes will be activated. With that, we strongly advise you to use your old Skype account to enjoy the free 60 minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding account deletion, if your Skype account is linked to a Microsoft account, then it is considered a unified sign in credentials across all Microsoft products. With that, once you decided to delete your account the associated Microsoft email will
 also be deleted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if your Skype account is not associated with your email then your Microsoft account will not be affected, you will just be prompted to a page where you need to associate your account to a newly created Microsoft account in order for you to delete
 the account.</p>

 the proper drivers for Windows 10 though.&nbsp; A nice move from Creative to support legacy cards.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The new drivers for your card are listed, they have not been released yet.&nbsp; They will be later this month.&nbsp; Just keep an eye on the Creative webpage I hyperlinked to.</p>

<h2>            Ways to improve your computer&#39;s performance</h2>
                    <p>I already know this is silly but, it's irking me that I'm not getting a 7.9 for windows performance.&nbsp; The scores that I'm getting are proc. - amd fx 8350 -&nbsp;7.7,&nbsp;ram - 32gb - 7.7, graphic - dual amd r9 200 series - 7.9, gaming graph. - 7936 mb available -
 7.9, and primary hd - 370 gb free - 7.9. My mobo asus sabertooth 990 fx r.2.&nbsp; Let me add this I have a Samsung 500 gb. s.s.d. and 4 Western Digital Red 3Tb hd. and 3 are empty with the last 1 is about 1/4 full.&nbsp; The motherboard suppose to be able up to 64
 gb. of ram.&nbsp; It's not my HD but, my ram memory that's at 7.7 and would I have to get the amd fx 9590.&nbsp; For a perfect score</p>

            <p>The Windows Performance Index was never a particularly reliable measure of computer performance and should not be taken too literally. In fact the system has now been retrograded and does not function to the user in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other benchmarking tools are available such as SiSoft Sandra and include facilities to make comparisons which would be more relevant. For example it does not matter how fast the rest of the system is under WPI mechanical hard disks will never exceed 7.9
 even under SATA III and it always uses the lowest value as the score.</p>

            <p>Absolutely agree with Andrew, do NOT install any 3rd party "speed up" tools. If nothing else you are not actually trying to fix a problem so why add more to the system? Specific to your OP software cannot affect the hardware performance of the components
 in the computer so such tools would be pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean system is going to give the best results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk clean up, uninstall unused programs, optimise start up programs, defrag. All can be done out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said WPI is not a reliable enough indicator to spend much time or even money on it.</p>

            <p>If your system has been installed and being used for 2 years or more, consider re-installing a clean install.&nbsp; In most cases, this will give a substantial boost to performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the specifications on your hard drive, if it is a 5400rpm disk, replace it with a 7200 when you do the re-install.</p>

            <p>The Hard Disk is already at 7.9 which is maxed out for a mechanical drive, the only option there is the use of an SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lowest values are the CPU and memory, the latter probably being affected by the former. The AMD is recognised as being good value vs performance but is still 3/4 the rating of a good i7, unfortunately that's not an option as its Intel and very pricey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is WPI rates the whole system on the lowest value, the fastest SSD and memory is going to do nothing for the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Benchmarking is always a unreliable process, how it feels to the user can vary significantly from the raw stats. If you accept those figures it is actually a fairly well balanced system with only 0.2 between highest and lowest values which shows a good mix
 of components. Blistering graphics performance is no good if the CPU is slow and vice versa, about the biggest bang per buck is the SSD and that is particularly true for the perceived performance rather than benchmarking.</p>

            <p>hello saab2000, and welcome to the &nbsp;Microsoft form,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i would like to know a few things about your situation&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. what is your anti virus</p>
<p>2. when (approximately) was the last time you scaned your computer for&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a. viruses?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b. malware?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c. spyware?</p>
<p>3. is the problem occurring in safe mode ?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; to access safe mode restart your computer and hold F8, use the arrow keys to highlight "safe mode" and press enter</p>
<p>if the problem does not exist in safe mode do a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>also try the following</p>
<p>&nbsp; preform a&nbsp; system file checker</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; click start-&gt;search-&gt;cmd-&gt;right click-&gt; click "run as administrator"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;type "sfc /scannow" without the quotas and hit enter</p>
<p>once the scan is complete</p>
<p>&nbsp; preform a check disk</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; type "chkdsk" without the quotas and hit enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;when prompted hit the&nbsp; "y" key and hit enter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; type "shutdown /r" without the quotas and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; after restarting let this scan complete</p>
<p>once the process is complete</p>
<p>&nbsp; preform a memory diagnostic test</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;restart and hold F8</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;at the advanced boot menu hit escape once</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;hit tab to highlight "memory diagnostic test" and then hit enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;let this scan preform&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;good luck&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you, very much, for taking the time to type up such an excellent "Fix Your Crap for Dummies"! It was so nice to see that the world I know, and love, from my childhood still exists, alive and well, behind all of this Windows crap. Your piece was so
 clear, concise, and utterly devoid of b.s., which I appreciated, and was able to put to use right away. Bonus; I don't feel as stupid as I did before reading your help.</p>
<p>So, thanks, again!</p>

<h2>            Unable to add gmail account to calendar app</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with the calendar app. I want to connect a certain one of my two Gmail&nbsp;accounts to the calendar app. When I click the settings button then 'manage account', I can see that my Gmail&nbsp;account is connected. However, when I look at the calendars,
 it says I have my outlook calendar, some Microsoft account, and one of my Gmail accounts... but not the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rely on that certain Gmail&nbsp;calendar to record my events, so I need that calendar.</p>
<p>Could someone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Somerset.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd try first is removing the Google Account and adding it back.
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot Google account in WIndows 10 Mail &amp; Calendar app see:
