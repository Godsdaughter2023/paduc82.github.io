<h2>            kernel data inpage error windows 8</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I also have the problem with blue screen + the kernel_data_inpage_error and don't know what to do (sometimes the command 'srv.sys' is added, I got this screen a lot of times since the past 2 days). I already read a few posts about this topic before, but
 they don't really help me. I tried to scan in the prompt with 'sfc/scannow' command, but after 50% it says that there are damaged files which can't be repaired, then the scan stops.
<div>I also ran 'malwarebytes' over the system but this didn't find anything.</div>
<div>I'm a bit confused because this win8 - acer is not really old and I didn't load much new stuff on it, so it'd be great if someone could help me :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The minidumps are attached to to link, maybe they'll help anyone.</div>

            <p>Hey Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The error code KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR STOP states that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory. It appears that there are some issues with the hard disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running check disk on the hard drive to see if there are any corruptions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Type <strong>command prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> charms. Right click on it and click on
<strong>Run as administrator.</strong></p>
<p>2. Type <strong>chkdsk /f</strong> and hit enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then&nbsp;press
<strong>Y</strong> to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Check Disk Disclaimer: <font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available
 on that might be lost</span></font></span></span></p>
<span><span>Once Check Disk completes, boot the computer and then check if the issue persists.</span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful. If you have any concerns, please let us know.</span></span></p>

            Thanks for the fast answer,
<div>I ran chkdsk, and I got no new error so far, but I have to see if it works the next time.</div>
<div>But since the check my laptop needs a long time to boot after i logged in, about 5 mins until I can start working with it, do you know what I can do to solve this?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Paul</div>
<div><br />
<div>-UPDATE</div>
<div><br />
<div>the error came back yesterday, so it's still not fixed. I ran chkdsk again, it's booting faster now.</div>
<div>but I still want to get rid off this Kernel thing, any other idea?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, sometimes after I logged in, there is just a black screen where I can move the mouse but nothing else happens. Do you think I could restore the system to an earlier time to solve this?</div>

            <p>Yes Paul. If you have created system restore points when the computer was working fine, then you may perform System restore to that point and check if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned under the section "Restore your PC to an earlier point in time"</p>

 when the computer was working fine. So any changes made to the computer after the restore point will be erased</font></span></p>

<p>I have had this problem and this seems to have fixed the issue.&nbsp; It is basically a registry error.
</p>
<p>I went to the geek squad but they suck!&nbsp; They&nbsp;seemed more concerned about me wanting to pay for their services to fix my computer.&nbsp; This should help you, you might have to do it a couple times, I did but have not had issues more than a week so far.</p>

            Guys I've had this problem for a while and to think that I have paid for my Avast anti-virus and I had to experience this (NO NO NO). I had no idea this was caused by malware. I went to command prompt and tried fixing it from there a couple of times but
 nothing. For those of you experiencing this issue please follow the steps explained in the link I've pasted it below:&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>http://malwaretips.com/blogs/webcake-virus-removal/&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;it's worked very well for me and I've had no issues since. After trying this out if it works for you please let others who are experiencing the same problem know.

<p>I'm having the same exact problem. The disk can be read when the computer is on, but the computer can't be booted from the cd. I've attempted to change several things in the set up screen (changing order of boot methods; deselecting the hard drive as an
 option; resetting to the original settings; etc. FYI after resetting to original, a diagnostic was run and I got a message saying the the cd-r/rw and dvd-rom are not supported by the diagnostics. I also could not run the diagnostics from the resource cd).
 I downloaded the latest drivers from dell for my cd and dvd drives and while the dvd doesn't seem to be able to read discs, the cd definitely can. While I'm not particularly savvy, I have successfully reinstalled the os twice and can usually figure things
 out with the help of online sources&nbsp; such as this. But I'm at a complete loss. Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take care,</p>

            It is dangerous to hack the registry unless you know exactly what you're doing. I recommend you leave it to your virus scanner to deal with the problem - if, in fact, it is a problem.

<p>Volume Licensing is way for large organizations to purchase Windows 10 in bulk for 5 or more computers. Its usually recommended for large roll outs of Windows 10, like in the hundreds or thousands.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A unique characteristic of volume license clients such as Windows 10 Pro, in order to qualify to use it, the machine must be properly licensed with a full package product or OEM preinstall of a premium business edition such as Windows 10 Pro (already) or
 a corresponding edition such as Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate. This is because Windows 10 Pro under volume licensing is an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to purchase 4 licenses, can do so from the Microsoft Store, which permits up to 20 licenses per account.
</p>

<br />    Select your friend from the search results and click Add to Contacts.
<br />
<br />    Type a quick note to introduce yourself and then click Send.
<br />
<br />
<br />The person is added to your contact list, but will appear offline until they accept your request. After they’ve accepted your request, you can see when they’re online and make free voice and video calls with them.

<h2>            Monitor loses signal when Windows Starts</h2>
                    Windows installed an update on my Windows 7 32 bit PC around 3:00 AM on May 16th. (Coincidence?)&nbsp; Later on the 16th while using the computer, the screen went black.&nbsp; Computer still running.&nbsp; After several reboots and even more repair attempts my computer
 refused to reboot even in safe mode.&nbsp; I determined that I had a video card problem so swapped in one from another desktop.&nbsp; Able to reboot in safe mode, but no signal to monitor after Windows started.&nbsp; Determined the graphics card to be failed so purchased
 and installed a new PNY card with Nvidia GTX-650 processor and 1 G memory.&nbsp; Booted fine, then loaded the GTX drivers from the PNY disc and rebooted.&nbsp; Monitor lost signal as soon as Windows started.&nbsp; I can now boot in safe mode with no problem but in normal
 mode as soon as Windows starts the monitor loses signal. I then swapped the two monitors between computers and the problem stayed with the computer.&nbsp; The problem was in existence on the PC when using the video card from another machine (GEForce 8400) so it
 would seem that the card is not the problem. I have accessed that PC with another using remote desktop and have attempted reinstalling the video card, reinstalling the card drivers using drivers from windows and those from the Nvidia website, reinstalled the
 updated monitor drivers, run Mr Fixit, and other Microsoft repair facilities and searched the Microsoft Knowledge base with no positive results.&nbsp; still have the BSOD.<br />

            I believe that I have found the problem(s).&nbsp; The original graphics card went bad at about the same time as a Windows update.&nbsp; The power supply in my computer was inadequate for the new graphics card that I installed.&nbsp; Possibly as a result of the bad graphics
 card some Windows files were apparently corrupted.<br />
I installed a larger power supply and reinstalled Windows then did the 180 gazillion Windows updates and then reinstalled my applications.&nbsp; All seems to be good now.<br />

<h3> john_____982  say:</h3>
<h2>            Show windows side by side and stack window feature isn&#39;t working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Every time I run it, it does /show different things... usually wrong or bad, like the one in the screenshot. Is there any way to fix it? It's so annoying, it's one very basic function.... how is it not working</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: only one virtual desktop was open, and I tried many times: result it's always broken (empty space left, and sometimes SideBySide and Stacked show the same bugged wrong thing)</p>

    <title>AT&#38;T Uverse wireless connection problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duk1111r  say:</h3>
<h2>            AT&#38;T Uverse wireless connection problem</h2>
                    I just had AT&amp;T Uverse installed in my home. The hard wire internet connection works fine but when I try to use the wireless mode a nessage comes up that says " Windows is unable to connect to this network". AT&amp;T instructions tell me to hit the connect
 icon on the designated 2wire&nbsp; and I will be asked to entire a passcode number but that option never comes up, only the " unable to connect" message. I have tried re-booting th computer, unplugging the Uverse route...still no luck.

            Duk,
<div><br />
<div>Let me explain the basics about a wireless network security. In order for any wireless device to connect to a wireless network you need to know the following:</div>
<div>
<div>1.- SSID or the name of your wireless network.</div>
<div>2.- The security type: WPE, WPA, WPA2.</div>
<div>3.- The encryption type: AES, TKIP (sometimes your security type will determine this encryption so no need to find it).</div>
<div>4.- The wireless key or password.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will assume that you already know or Win7 got the first three and that somehow the fourth setting was not entered correctly or you never had a chance to enter it. I'm also assuming that you are using the defaults of your gateway (according to the 2wire
 documentation the default of "[t]he network name is the word “2WIRE” (in all capital letters), followed by the last three digits of the&nbsp;gateway serial number (for example, 2WIRE110).&nbsp;The encryption key is a 64-bit hex value, located beneath the bar code on
 the bottom of the 2Wire&nbsp;gateway." The key is at the bottom of your gateway.) To enter your wireless key or passcode manually, Follow the next steps:</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>- Click on the wireless networks icon on the notification area (5 bars).</div>
<div>- Find your wireless network on the list and right click (2WIRE### if you're using the defaults).</div>
<div>- Click Properties.</div>
<div>- Make sure the Security tab is selected. To see your wireless key in plain text, click the<b> Show characters</b> check box.</div>
<div>- Type your passcode or <b>Network security key</b>&nbsp;in the appropriate text box (The hex number beneath the bar code on the bottom of your gateway.)</div>
<div>- Click <b>OK</b> button.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If after this, you still cannot connect, it means that the Security and&nbsp;encryption settings&nbsp;are not correct. Unfortunately, there's no straight way to get this info. The method to get the info, varies even when using same brand gateways. In this case,
 I recommend to talk to the tech support team of your ISP company. I'm sure they will guide you through the process better than me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do not forget to mark my posting as answered and/or helpful.</div>

            <p>I managed to make it work for Linksys&nbsp;WMP54G v4.1. Hope this would be helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Download the Ralink Wireless LAN Driver (PCI/mPCI/CB RT2500) version 3.2.0.10/3.2.0.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Run the installer on your Windows 8 machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. From Device Manager, right click Update Driver Software</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.1 Then select 'Browse my computer for driver software'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.2 Then select 'Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.3 Instead of pick any item from the list now, click 'Have Disk'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.4 Then browse to the installation folder of the driver pack. On my machine, it&nbsp;was:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files (x86)\RALINK\RT6x Wireless LAN Card\Driver</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.5 Pick 'rt2500.inf'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.6 Then in the new Manufacturer list, pick 'Ralink Technology, Inc.'</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.7 In the Network Adapter list, pick '802.11b/g Wireless PC Card'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Windows 8 from here :)</p>

    <title>Transfer of gamertag to current microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexh27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer of gamertag to current microsoft account</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to transfer my existing gamertag to my Microsoft account that I use with Windows 8 and my Surface.</p>
<p>The problem is my account appears to be caught in an endless loop of autogenerating gamertags. When I first bought the surface and logged in it autogenerated me a gamertag that I had to wait 30 days to transfer. Kind of a ridiculous solution but after being
 told by both xbox support and microsoft account support there was nothing they could do I decided to just wait it out.</p>
<p>Yesterday I finally managed to sucessfully transfer the autogenerated gamertag to a temp account as per the directions on the xbox website. But when I went to transfer my proper gamertag to my newly freed up account it gave me an error saying xbox live was
 having problems. I tried again about 20 mins later and somehow ANOTHER gamertag had been autogenerated for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried contacting xbox support 4 times, and used the Microsoft account community forum. Each time I am told it is the other team who is able to help me. As a last resort I am hoping that there may be someone here who will be able to give me an actual
 solution or atleast point me in the right direction. Otherwise my newly purchased Surface and Windows 8 computer are missing major points of functionality as I cannot play any games nor can I use the newly released xbox smartglass.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey there Jet! If you try signing into a LIVE service, like Windows 8 or Xbox.com, with an MS Account that is new, it will auto-generate a Gamertag. What you need to do is create a new MS Account, then log into the account you want, and change the MS Account
 there.</p>
<p>For more information on changing your MS Account, please check out our "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Questions about a Microsoft account or a gamertag</a>" guide. Let us know how
 that goes, thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply but I'm not sure I made it clear what I am trying to achieve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to transfer my existing gamertag from an old microsoft account(account #1) to the microsoft accout I use in Windows 8 and on my Surface(account #2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot do this as my current ms account(account #2) has an autogenerated gamertag from when I first logged into my Surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference,</p>
<p>Account #1 = old microsoft account that is linked to my gamertag - useless except for gamertag</p>
<p>Account #2 = current microsoft account linked to my Surface and Windows 8 - accout I want to use for everything</p>
<p>Account #3 = temporary accout I transferred autogenerated gamertag from accout #2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after calling xbox support 4 times someone finally determined that you can only transfer gamertags every 30 days(even if they are unwanted autogenerated gamertags). So I waited a month and transferred the autogenerated gamertag to a temp account(account
 #3)to to free up my active ms account(account #2). Now that account # 2 is free I went to transfer my gamertag from account #1. When I tried to complete this it spit up an error about xbox live having difficulties.</p>
<p>I tried again about 20 mins later and somehow ANOTHER gamertag had been autogenerated for me. So again I cannot complete the transfer and I have to wait ANOTHER 30 days and just hope that it does not generate another autogenerated gamertag for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the article I followed in addition to having xbox phone support walk me through the process</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account#c51e0882871543b993f445f821f847b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account#c51e0882871543b993f445f821f847b9</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This situation is ridicilous, after purchasing almost $2000 in new Microsoft products I cannot get either of them to function correctly and nobody seems to be willing to put in the effort to actually help me. Instead I get told its another teams problem
 or quoted generic help artices that I have clearly already followed. At this point I am fairly confident that I am more knowledgeable in gamertag transfers than the majority of the support staff. Even more dishearting is the fact that I am trying to be an
 ambasador for these new microsoft products and would like to see widespread adoption. But it makes it very difficult when a product I purchased on launch day still doesn't work correctly over a month later and nobody is able to fix that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if Microsoft/support would step up and take responsibilty for this obvious oversight. I suspect that someone is going to have to go over and above their normal responsibilities as there is clearly no guidelines for dealing with an issue
 like this.</p>
<p>/End rant</p>

<p>Hey again Jet! I'm not sure why it's autogenerating a Gamertag when you try to change the MS Account when you're already signed in to a Gamertag. I've never seen that happen before. It sounds like there are some other factors at work here, and I think the
 extra information that phone or chat agents are able to see would be useful here.<br />
<br />
I would give phone support a call back and see if they can't help you out on their end. Let us know what you find out, thanks!</p>

<p>Hey, so I called xbox support again for the 5th time. They were still not able to help me aside from suggesting to wait another 30 days and try again. I even spoke with a supervisor in an attempt to get the issue esclated but they stated that this was not
 an issue they would be able to esclate for. </p>
<p>So, again, I'm just sitting here with $2000 of Microsoft products that still don't work correctly and nobody seems to know how to or be willing to help.
</p>
<p>Any more suggestions?</p>

<p>The 30 day wait period after modifying a profile is something we cannot get around. Once you free up an MS Account email from an account, it will take 30 days for you to be able to use it on a different account, or modify the original account again. I would
 agree that waiting out this 30 days and trying it again is the best course of action here. Let us know how that goes, thanks!

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>Normally I would agree with you, but I have waited the 30 days and followed the provided solution exactly. I still have the same issue. I know you are just following the guidelines set by the company but clearly they are not comprehensive.</p>
<p>Lets say you take your computer in for service and you get told the solution is to wait 30 days then run a virus scan.</p>
<p>Now you wait 30 days, run the scan and you still have the same issue.</p>
<p>Now if you get told again to wait 30 days and run a scan, I don't suspect you would have much faith in that assertion.</p>
<p>Its pretty obvious that if it didn't work the first time, there is no reason it would work now.</p>
<p>Now I understand this is not the same thing but the idea is the same.</p>
<p>Here is a solution, go away for 30 days. </p>
<p>solution doesn't work</p>
<p>Here is a solution, go away for 30 days. </p>
<p>Does anyone have an actual solution or am I back to where I started?</p>

<p>The 30 day 'speed bump' in changing the Microsoft Account addresse is imposed by the security mavens at Microsoft Accounts, and is not the idea of the good folks at Xbox. All of this can be addressed at

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately the issue is not the 30 day speed bump. The problem is that even after waiting for the speed bump I still cannot transfer my gamertag. I have asked in the microsoft account forums regarding this issue and am always told that only xbox support
 can assist.</p>
<p>Here is one of my threads started in the forum you specified:</p>

<p>Hey there Jet! I am sorry for the frustration here. I've read through your posts and other forum interactions (multiple times :) and I think I've got a good idea of what is going on. It sounds like you're actually trying to merge two accounts, which is why
 you're having trouble. Here's what clued me into this:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"I am trying to transfer my existing gamertag from an old microsoft account(account #1) to the microsoft accout I use in Windows 8 and on my Surface(account #2)."</em><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're only trying to transfer the gamertag here you're going to continue to run into this issue. It is not possible to merge two accounts by changing the Microsoft Account Email from account #1 to account #2. That account information will stay separate
 which is why you're getting that auto-generated gamertag. What I would suggest you do, is pick a new gamertag, perhaps with one character or number different than that old gamertag you like!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps clear things up! We're here for any questions. :)</p>

<p>Hi Miss Kleo,</p>
<p>Thanks for looking into the issue for me. You are correct, more or less I want to merge the accounts.</p>
<p>Basically the only thing my old microsoft account is used for is my xbox live gamertag. Since that is the case I want to transfer the gamertag to the account that I use with windows. This way I can use xbox smartglass and earn achievements, etc. on my Surface
 and Windows 8.</p>
<p>I havent been trying to change email addresses on the accounts, simply transfer my gamertag to the active ms account I use with windows and my tablet.
</p>
<p>Not to be rude but doesn't it seem like creating a new gamertag would defeat the purpose? Wouldn't I lose all my xbla games, achievements and game saves. I would guess i've got atleast 50 paid xbla games on my account.</p>
<p>The process I'm trying to do but keeps failing is here(specificly the "Can I switch my gamertag to a different Microsoft account?" process):
</p>

<p>It seems like that would achieve what I am trying to do here. Do you agree?</p>

<h2>            Keep Getting Bumped Off Internet</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have an HP laptop, using Windows 10. Ever since the last Windows Update in May 2017, I keep getting bumped off the internet. I use both Google Chrome and Firefox. &nbsp;My laptop says it is connected to my wifi, but I still keep getting bumped off
 continuously. My internet speed is usually very fast, but now it is very inconsistent. No error codes. When I try to trouble shoot, I get different responses. One is that I can access some sites. Another time, I get a message that states, "Your computer appears
 to be correctly configured, but the device detected or resource (DNS server) is not responding. Please help, thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Beatrice,<br />
<br />
Have you tried turning off your router for a few minutes to change / refresh the IP address of the laptop? If you haven't tried it yet, please do so. We also suggest to run the Windows Update Troubleshooter to check and scan for corruption errors during the
 update. To perform the task, kindly follow the steps provided on the article below:<br />

<p>I had this exact same problem following a fresh install of Windows 7.</p>
<p>Workaround is to run "sdclt.exe /configure" from the start menu (just type it into the seach box as it appear, withouth the quote marks.)</p>
<p>Get the backup running no problems.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you too.</p>

<h2>            Continuing Issue&#58;  Internet won&#39;t work until I restart my computer after initial boot</h2>
                    <p>Despite repeated attempts to scour the internet and fix my issue, I have been unable to have any success. &nbsp;It began a few years ago after years of use with no problem, and I'm at a loss of how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon initial boot, my internet does not work. &nbsp;I get a message saying "Could not connect all network drives" and when I troubleshoot my LAN connection in the Control Panel, it tells me there is a driver/hardware issue. &nbsp;The internet works fine again after
 a restart, and continues to work through future restarts. &nbsp;If you completely shut off the computer and boot it back up, I get the same problem until a restart is performed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed hardware since I bought the computer, and my drivers are completely up to date. &nbsp;I am on Windows 7 64-bit, fully updated, using ESET NOD32 Antivirus. &nbsp;I have performed a full scan of my computer and it has come up clean. &nbsp;I even uninstalled
 and reinstalled Windows last week in an attempt to solve the issue, but had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what other information I can give you to help me diagnose my problem. &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the efforts which you have put to try to resolve the issue. Please write to us with the following details.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>What is the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/find-which-edition-of-windows-7-you-are-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
edition of Windows 7</a> installed on your computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You could face this issue due to corrupt drivers. I will explain you why this happens, after you restart your computer Windows might be installing the generic drivers which
 make you to connect to Internet. Updating the drivers to the latest date does not always helps. You need to uninstall the previous one and then install the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would suggest you to follow the steps given below and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Check the issue in safe mode with networking.</span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall and then reinstall the network driver from manufacturer’s website.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method: 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If your Windows Update is showing available updates and your computer starts downloading them, it may happen that at some point it just gets stuck and stops downloading. It will show a constant figure but there will be no progress. The figure in your
 case could be 0%, 23%, 33%, or any other, but every time you try to download the updates, you find that they are stuck on that particular figure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press “<strong>Windows + X</strong>” and select Command prompt (admin).</span></li><li><span>Type the following one after the other and hit Enter:</span></li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop </span></strong></span><span><strong><span>wuauserv</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;net stop bitsc.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This will stop the Windows Update related Services.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next browse to the<strong><span>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution </span>
</strong>folder and delete all the files and folders inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Ctrl+A to Select All and then Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you have emptied this folder, you may restart your computer or you may type the following commands one at a time in the CMD, and hit Enter to restart the Windows Update related Services.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><strong><span>net start
</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>wuauserv</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>net start bits</span></strong></p>

<p>I followed the procedure, and it seems to have worked (though it took a few minutes to download the latest update). &nbsp;A few comments:</p>
<p>(1) the second command in step 2 should be "net stop bits" not "net stop bitsc," right?</p>
<p>(2) I couldn't delete all the files and folders in step 4 at once; it complained that DataStore was still in use. &nbsp;I was able to delete them all individually, one by one.</p>
<p>(3) When I typed "net start wuauserv" in step 5, it said that the service was already started.</p>
<p>(4) I had to restart the PC to be able to search for Windows Update in the search bar.</p>
<p>(5) Note that the procedure resets Update History, so it now said that no updates have been installed.</p>

    <title>&#34;To&#58;&#34; field is blank in inbox in windows live mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;To&#58;&#34; field is blank in inbox in windows live mail</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up my Windows Live Mail as I had my Outlook Express.&nbsp; This issue goes across multiple machines and platforms and is specific to Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the following columns in my WLM Inbox.&nbsp; The reasons should be irrelevant, but I'll explain in a moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watched items; Priority; Attachment; Flag; From; To; Subject; Date; Size; Sent</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "Sent" date/time means little to me, though it's what everyone seems to think is important and as I recall, this is the default that WLM and other programs show and sort by.&nbsp; Spammers often put a fake future date there to make their emails show at the
 top forever.&nbsp; Also, some people just flat out have their machines set wrong.&nbsp; [As an aside, I recently had a lot of aggravation with this, as a couple of spams supposedly coming from AARP had a future date. &nbsp;I could not find them in windows desktop WLM, and
 they appeared forever at the top of my WLM on my droid.&nbsp; Very sad, but there are other sad issues with push and WLM and the droid.&nbsp; Yes, AARP.&nbsp; I'm old.&nbsp; This means I know crappy programming when I see it.&nbsp; I was/am a developer.&nbsp; Since you are younger than
 me and think you know more, read on carefully please, and see if you can solve any of my problems.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the reasons I just laid out, I sort by "Date", which is the day and time I actually receive the email.&nbsp; This is what I need to know.&nbsp; Not when it was sent, but when I actually got it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the problem...</p>
<p>I also add the "To" field.&nbsp; This isn't typical, I know, but in OE, I found it helped me scan for spam much more easily and accurately.&nbsp; A lot of spam is sent to other emails and CCed.&nbsp; Sadly, and actually, pathetically, when email comes to my Inbox the "To"
 column in WLM is left blank.&nbsp; It's not that there isn't a correct "To" field in the email, it's that WLM doesn't bother to look at that field and display it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will make a bold statement here...&nbsp; I think it wasn't tested properly and hasn't been tested properly and this problem has existed for years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my work around, which is, of course, ridiculous and I shouldn't have to do it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select one or more or a lot of emails.&nbsp; Move them from the Inbox.... TO THE INBOX.&nbsp; In other words, do an operation which should do nothing.&nbsp; Without fail, when I do this, all the emails I "moved" now have the "To" column displaying the "To" address correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "To" field also displays correctly when moving emails to other folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am asking other people to please test this for me, in order to build a case which will get the attention of the developers.&nbsp; I strongly suspect this is a bug, not a misconfiguration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, I can't even tell if I am posting this in the correct forum, which is also sad. Please let me know if I am in error.&nbsp; WLM seems to be an unwanted orphan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note another posting I have recently made regarding my desire to find out if Microsoft is supporting Windows Live Mail or trying to kill it.</p>

<p>I will faithfully read and respond to&nbsp;all editorial responses to my editorials, hoping that they are as polite as I've tried to be, and that the main focus of the replies has to do with resolving the issues I've laid out.&nbsp; I'd prefer not to get into a flame
 war with anyone, and it isn't my intent to start one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you all for your time,</p>
<p>Jim</p>

            <p>Are you kidding? My WLM Inbox. I added a column for "To". This is trivial to recreate. Incoming mail does not populate the "To" column unless I select the emails and move them.... to the Inbox... where they already are. Then the column populates.</p>
<p>I think my explanation is quite clear. Please prove to me you actually read it before asking me to send more info.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, you are kidding, right?&nbsp; You just can't be serious.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you read the mail, you would see that the "To" column properly populated in the Inbox when I move the mail redundantly back to it.&nbsp; I'm not sure why you guys can't read carefully.&nbsp; Please carefully read my original post, or *any* of my followups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, it's positively ridiculous to say that only the default columns would be populated.&nbsp; If that were the case, then why would users be allowed to select more columns?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And... furthermore... why do all the other non-default columns which I've added to the Inbox all populate properly with no problems at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your answer makes no sense.&nbsp; Please read again more carefully.&nbsp; All of the necessary information is in my original post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is clearly a question which needs to be elevated to the developers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other threads, we are complaining that we don't believe there actually are any developers working on WLM anymore.&nbsp; Prove to us that we are wrong.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for carefully reading what I wrote and re-creating the problem properly.&nbsp; Thank you for elevating the issue.&nbsp; This issue has existed since the very beginning of WLM, but did not exist in Outlook Express.&nbsp; It is one of the many reasons
 that for me, WLM is a downgrade of OE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will await with great interest the efforts of the developers to finally fix this issue.</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just now checked my inbox, and the "To" column is showing the details as it should, without having to do your work around,&nbsp;and I believe that it always has. I say this because in the case of spam, where I have been BCCed, an unfamilliar email address is
 displayed. I will do some investigating to see if I can find an answer for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have WLMail&nbsp;Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3508.0205). I suspect you have the same?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Jim, here is a solution I found for a similiar problem, you might want to give it a try on the off chanc it will work here as well. Go to your "Columns" window, uncheck the "To" box, and proceed to exit WLM.</p>
<p>Wait a few minutes, then go back and re check the "to" box, and again exit. I know it sounds crazy, I am hoping it is crazy enough to work!</p>

    <title>Can I uninstall Edge browser, or do I have to uninstall Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidcrocker1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I uninstall Edge browser, or do I have to uninstall Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am fed up to the back teeth of having my .pdf file association reset to Edge. This has been happening several times per week EVER SINCE I "UPGRADED" TO WINDOWS 10 (from Windows 7). The forums show that I am far from the only user having this problem, and
 Microsoft shows no signs of fixing it. So I can only assume that this is deliberate Microsoft policy to force us to use MS apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I uninstall Windows 10 and finally make the move to Linux that I have pondered many times, can anyone tell me how to uninstall Edge? Maybe uninstalling it will stop Windows messing with the .pdf file association.</p>

            Sorry, Edge is the part of the OS and cannot be uninstalled.
<br />AFAIK With every feature update, the file associations are reset to default, which I agree with you that it shouldn't do so.
<br />I suggest you to add a feedback in Feedback hub so that developers can have a look

<p>Thanks for replying. If the file associations only got reset when updates are installed, although it would still be annoying, I could live with it. But the .pdf extension gets reset SEVERAL TIMES EACH WEEK. I think it's even happened more than once in a

<b><span style="font-weight: bold">F4, F6, F7, F9, </span></b>or<b><span style="font-weight: bold"> F12
</span></b>to disable/enable the Touchpad.</span></span></p>
