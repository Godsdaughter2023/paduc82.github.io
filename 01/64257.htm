            <p>This sounds a lot like a malware problem.&nbsp;Are Windows Defender and Windows Firewall running?</p>
<p>You need to do a full system scan. If you cannot do a full scan, you may have to purchase 3rd party software to clean up your machine.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could do a full system refresh or reset and start from scratch. Be sure to back up your files.</p>

<p>My computers still will not update, in view of the excellent "Microsoft Fix It" Tool/Processes shared with me by community members.&nbsp; Is it possible that Microsoft Programmers can provide a "Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix&nbsp;Link" that will&nbsp;automatically Restart/Fix the "Microsoft
 Updater" (Process)&nbsp;for&nbsp;Windows 8.1?&nbsp; My 2 HP Computers &amp; Microsoft Surface RT stopped "Updating" following the Microsoft Updates provided on
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">February 12, 2014</span></em></strong>: although when I&nbsp;run the "Updates" I get a message that indicates there are no updates &amp; that updates will automatically be installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>It&nbsp;appears that the

            <p>You mentioned that you are getting pop ups for 3rd party software. Is this from websites that you are visiting to help solve the problem or are they occurring spontaneously? If they are occurring spontaneously, you have a malware problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Have you scanned for malware and what are the results of that scan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very unusual for all three machines to have the same problem. Do they all have the same exact issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Did all three machines with different processors to develop the same problem at the same time? If so, did you install any piece of software on all three at that time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Are you able to go back to a System Restore point before these problems started?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Did you install 3rd party anti virus software on all three at the same time? Some 3rd party programs cause issues. Drop back to Windows Defender and Windows Firewall and see if you can update after a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of this does not lead to progress, you will need to refresh or reset your computers.</p>

<p>Claudia, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do the following. </p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to Command Prompt (Admin).</li><li>Type: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit Enter. </li></ol>
<p>System File Checker will check Windows system files for corruption and attempt to repair any found. If it can't fix them, you'll see a message to that effect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the latter case, open another Command Prompt (Admin) and then copy / paste the following command and hit Enter:
<strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot directly paste into a command prompt though. Instead after copying, right click the black button top left, go to "Edit" and then "Paste". Here's a screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47687348-95b5-4149-8dd7-c1e4a7a57412" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM.exe downloads original system files from Microsoft's servers which are used to replace the corrupt files which System File Checker was unable to repair.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provided it's successful, run <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> once more to ensure that there aren't anymore problems. Here's a screenshot of both which I ran on my own computer recently.</p>

            <p>I believe you should have your email service provider (optusnet) explain.&nbsp; The configuration necessary for Outlook to connect to and receive/send email via the optusnet email servers is determined by optusnet and entered in Outlook by you.</p>
<p>Strangely, there isn't a lot of clear cut information out there.</p>
<p><a href="http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/on_email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://whirlpool.net.au/wiki/on_email</a></p>
<p>Which leads you to two other pages:<br />
</p>
<p>Which has these basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the <strong>Incoming mail (POP3, IMAP or HTTP) server</strong> enter <strong>
<em>mail.optusnet.com.au</em></strong> in lower case letters </li><li>For the box titled <strong>Outgoing mail (SMTP) server</strong> enter <strong>
<em>mail.optusnet.com.au</em></strong> </li><li>Do not tick the "Outgoing server requires authentication"</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check your credentials in the account. Maybe some password changed somehow and you have not reflected that in the account settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For optusnet outlook setup please see the following article :</p>

    <title>My laptop has taken over 12 hours to install a windows update and is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> creditsgroup  say:</h3>
<h2>            My laptop has taken over 12 hours to install a windows update and is still doing it, and won&#39;t shut down.</h2>
                    I'm using Vista and a HP Pavilion laptop. I noticed the shut down and install updates logo was on so I used it and my laptop started to install 2 updates (18th June 2011). It finished the first but has been installing the 2nd one for over 12 hours now.
 The screen warns me not to power off or unplug the machine.&nbsp; Occasionally the hard drive light briefly flickers, it may come on fully for one or two seconds. What can I do? Surely this is far to long to be normal and something has gone wrong.&nbsp; The laptop keys
 are unresponsive. The cursor changed to the blue circle while updating and cycles but will not move with either mouse or pad.&nbsp; In the past some updates have taken 3 to 4 hours, they have been large one with more than a dozen components, but never anywhere
 as long as this. I've opened and closed the DVD drive several times, which works and is empty, just to see if anything at all is happening. What should I do? Should I continue to wait? If so how long? Should I really just ignore the warnings and shut it off
 and attempt to restart it?<br />

    <title>Internet connection randomly stops working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tidakriger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet connection randomly stops working</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded to windows 10, my internet connection randomly stops working. It shows the yellow icon, and the only way to fix it is the run the troubleshoot. The issue is that it's not a rare occasion - happening only a few times a day - it happens
 a couple times an hour. It usually occurs when I'm browsing the internet, like when I try to find a solution, or sometime during when I have a game running full screen (almost never happens when the game is not in full screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the troubleshoot is completed, one of three messages appears. The first, and most common, being that connection was restored. The second message, and one with the yellow icon and not a green checkmark, says that the connection between the modem and/or
 router and the internet was not established, although the message below usually says that it fixed the issue, and I can continue using the internet. The last message that I've gotten from the troubleshoot says that the IP was not correct, and that is was fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is pretty annoying, and I've received some "tips" that may help, but they all involve either things I've tried, such as restarting my computer or the router. I also received a recommendation that seemed to complicated for me and that I have no
 idea what will happen if I actually go through with it.</p>
<p>On that note, the complicated things. The first recommendation was to perform a Network Reset, but I am not sure exactly what things will be uninstalled/reinstalled or settings restored to default, or any other things that may happen (such as me losing temporary
 or important files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me with what might be happening here, why, and how to fix it, that would be extremely helpful to me. And if the solution is to "reset" or "uninstall" something, please provide further details as to why, what the program(s) do, and what
 will happen - aside from potentially fixing my issue - once it is removed.</p>

            hi Tida.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>

<p><span>None. I have been using AutoCAD R14 for many, many years and I have never had a problem. All of sudden this error message came up. Could it have been because the Windows
 Automatic upgrade to Service Pack 3. How can I reverse changes to my computer prior windows upgrade? Maybe AutoCAD R14 will work then.</span></p>

            Quite a few of the links produced by that Google search linked above refer to AutoCAD. Take a look at some of them or contact AutoCAD tech support.

            CONROL PANEL&gt;ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS&gt; check the box which says "show windows updates" and the automatic upgrade should be listed. Select it, and click on the repair/remove&nbsp; selection box to uninstall it.&nbsp; ALTERNATIVELY, if that doesn't for some reason or another
 help you, you could try using the system restore feature to restore your computer to a point prior to the time of the update... START MENU&gt;All programs&gt;applications&gt;system tools&gt;system restore, and choose a point prior to the problem occurring. Should neither
 of these options help you, you could also try going to the directory where autocad14 is located, finding the executable which starts the program, right-clicking it, and choosing the properties at the bottom which opens a menu of settings for the application.
 one of the tabs listed will be COMPATIBILITY. ON THAT TAB, YOU CAN CHECK THE BOX TO RUN THE PROGRAM IN COMPATIBILITY MODE AND SELECT XP SP1 OR XPSP2 (WHICHEVER IT USED TO RUN UNDER AND CLICK APPLY, THEN CLOSE THE WINDOW, AND TRY RUNNING YOUR PROGRAM AGAIN.
 GOOD LUCK&nbsp;!!!

            <p>To increase the pixels, you can try resizing the photos. But, it is important to note that clarity of a photo, especially when you attempt to resize it, depends mainly on the camera from which you have taken it. If you have clicked the photos from a low-resolution
 camera, there are limitations on resizing them and resizing them too much may actually make them blur. Still, you can try the options below and see if that works.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can resize your photos by using Windows Live Photo Gallery. To know more about Windows Live Photo Gallery and to download it on your computer (if you don't have it already), you can refer to the following link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/photo-gallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/photo-gallery</a><br />
<br />
You can follow the steps below to resize your photos:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click <strong>Start </strong>and then, go to <strong>All </strong><strong>Programs</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;In the list that comes up, navigate to <strong>Windows Live Photo Gallery</strong> program.<br />
</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Find and click on the photo you wish to resize. Click on <strong>File </strong>
and select the option for <strong>Resize</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Select your new size from the "<strong>Select a size</strong>" drop-down menu. Then, click "<strong>Resize and Save</strong>" button to resize and save the photo with its new resolution. Follow on-screen instructions to save the resized photo in your computer.<br />

<h2>            error 0x00ccc0e Unable to send or recieve messages for pop3 account</h2>
                    I have windows 7 fresh install on new HP notebook I3 processor with base applications fror retail purchase only. I have discussed with HP and ISP the problem is with a blocked port for the email system. No firewall on -have killed them in Services and
 passed on installing antivirus on setup of the computer and have killed Windows defender in Services. I have tried the Windows Mail and had same settings on that and same error for send and recieve issue. The help desk of my ISP and HP both have cleared account
 settings and checked settings on machine but it points to port not accessible between the computer and the email server. The pop3 account when pinged from the machine is timing out. I have spent 3 long days trying to establish email on Windows 7 machine. I
 can access it from another machine with Win XP. Help please.

<p>
</p><p>Dave, it worked for me, you should try it out:</p>
<p>1) Go to the&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/windows-update-issues/en-us and download application that they suggest. It will find and fix all issues that it can find with Windows Update on your machine;</p>
<p>2) Install updates, it doesn't matter how many or how exactly: from Windows Update, or manually;</p>
<p>3) Reboot your PC and then, in BIOS, specify exact Hard Drive with your Windows 7 on it. BIOS should directly boot right into it. I do not why, but it solved the issue for me.</p>

<h2>            Random buzzing sound and freeze</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10 Pro 64-bit</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">AMD FX 8320E (8-core) with 16 GB RAM</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MSI 970A-G46 with onboard Realtek audio</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">NVidia GeForce GT 710</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is a brand new installation (not an upgrade), less than 1 week old. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There is a random buzzing sound during audio playback, not repeatable or predictable. &nbsp;However, the PC can also freeze up with a sustained buzzing sound (I've tried to leave it for 10 min and it did not recover).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager showed both Realtek and Nvidia High Definition Audio. &nbsp;Realtek is connected to my PC speakers via 3.5 mm jack. &nbsp;Nvidia is connected to my TV via HDMI, but it's not in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other threads have seen suggestion to delete the device driver and install the device again. &nbsp;So I've tried the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, uninstall the device, and choose to delete the driver software. &nbsp;Reboot, run with the default Microsoft driver. &nbsp;Problem remains</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot, install Realtek 6.0.1.7806 (latest on MSI website). &nbsp;Problem remains</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot, install nVidia 1.3.34.15 from&nbsp;368.69-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql. &nbsp;Problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I'm a bit lost. &nbsp;I can only think going back to Windows 7 as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>"We can't tell if your PC has enough space to continue the installation. Try restarting Setup."</em></strong></p>
<p>The thing is I have on my C: Drive<strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, I would suggest you to run disk clean up once to remove any unwanted files and then try to install form ISO and check. Refer to this article to perform disk cleanup:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have performed this step, try to install using ISO and perform an upgrade installation. Refer to this article for more information:</p>

    <title>MS Wireless Mouse 2000 Does not scroll&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edmondgantney  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Wireless Mouse 2000 Does not scroll&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought a Microsoft Wireless Mouse &amp; Wireless Keyboard 2000 as a package as one unit as the third keyboard and the second mouse, Its wireless system does not allow any other mouse but the one that came with it such as the MS&nbsp;Wireless&nbsp;Mouse
 2000 in which case,&nbsp;is lame because the scroll&nbsp;wheel does absolutely nothing. With the MS Wireless Keyboard 1000 in which I have three of, I can also select which Microsoft Mouse I want, wireless or wired with no problems at all. Like use a Microsoft&nbsp;Comfort&nbsp;
 Mouse 4500 because I need the Explorer Forward and Back side keys. Because of this problem since I am using a 64-bit version of Windows 7, I have to add a normal wired keyboard and Dynex's Browser mouse and the keyboard that came with the PC because I need
 also the Sleep button to Hibernate the PC in which case Windows 7 inside a desktop PC does NOT allow hibernation!!! It is
<u><em>A Downgrade</em></u> to me with the Wireless 2000 Keyboard and mouse&nbsp;not being able to get three more MS Wireless 1000 keyboards, regardless of mouse I use. NEWER is NOT better in this case. I Like the MS wireless 1000 keyboard with five stars because
 it has a F LOCK key allowing your programmed functions on one keystroke as its prime function...&nbsp; such as, If I define F2 as Explorer BACK, on both keyboards, it is one keystroke on the MS Wireless 1000 keyboard by pressing F2 alone as the first function when
 the F LOCK&nbsp;is OFF; AND on the same definition on the MS&nbsp;Wireless Keyboard 2000, of [Fn +&nbsp;F2] also be Explorer BACK, it is not worth it, it is also two keystrokes as: [ALT + Left Cursor Arrow, &lt;--</strong><strong>] as [Fn +F2], so what gives??? I am missing
 the MEDIA key [STOP] and the MUTE key&nbsp;in which case is an added key I also can also&nbsp;program as a Macro as I can on the MS Wireless keyboard 1000.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; I look for these keys on any Media keyboard besides Volume + or -:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mute, NOT on the MS Wireless 2000 keyboard!!!</strong></li><li><strong>Computer (I have the Calculator button on the MS 2000 wireless and defined as Flip 3D on the MS &nbsp;keyboard 1000)</strong></li><li><strong>Browser FORWARD</strong></li><li><strong>Browser BACK</strong></li><li><strong>Cut</strong></li><li><strong>Copy</strong></li><li><strong>Paste</strong></li><li><strong>Save and EXIT</strong></li><li><strong>and a whole lot of MACROS</strong></li><li><strong>Paste and Confirm</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I use a lot of repetitive sequences and Macros are not conducive being a subprogram of keystrokes, HOWEVER, ... I figured out where these MACROS are stored and I can copy them from one PC to another and they work on either keyboard doing the
 same. The more annoying is when I make a shortcut in Windows 7, I have to delete out the suffix of: " - SHORTCUT" about 11 keystrokes as I can tweak UI out of in Windows XP. I do a lot of CUTTING, COPYING, and PASTING, only one keyboard I have it as direct
 keys, but most users do not know it&nbsp; is [CTRL +X], [CTYRL +C], and [CTRL + V. Save and close as I find out is very useful as it sometimes requires&nbsp;four keystrokes as: [CTRL +S] and&nbsp;[ALT + F4]. Try to do it with one hand using the Fn key on the&nbsp; MS Wireless
 keyboard 2000? You cannot, it is on the right of the spacebar on the keyboard when I find it on the left of the space bar. I keep my right hand on the mouse&nbsp; but not all the time... How about the numeric keypad on the left for left-handed users? My dad and
 my older brother are one. MY solution: I got a separate USB numeric keypad!!! I can put it anywhere the wire allows. It also has two more low power USB ports for another USB&nbsp;keyboard or USB Mouse.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The newer PCs and notebook PCs do not have a PS2 connections, and some do, what do you do when you want to connect a PS2 mouse or PS2 keyboard to a USB port? Spend thirty bucks and get that special connecting cable. My brother uses three monitors
 on one PC, I use three keyboards and two mice on each one of&nbsp;mine.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On both keyboards, the definition of the F1 key&nbsp; in blue and the F1 key itself is redundant. It is Help, I define it as Favorites as [CTRL + I].</strong></p>

 Mouse and that affected both mice as to not being able to scroll at all! I as well as anyone else has to think "</span></strong><strong><i><u><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">OUTSIDE THE BOX</span></u></i></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">".
 There is </span></strong><em><b><u><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NO SELECTION</span></u></b></em><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> ANYWHERE in the dialog boxes for the Microsoft
 Wireless mice as to turn this ON or OFF regardless of model. The Dynex mouse has, and there is a difference... NO Knowledge Base article can tell me this, WHY Bother? The problem I do know, is that what affects the mice also affects the keyboard or other mice.
 Just as [SHIFT LOCK] turns on the lights and puts the [SHIFT LOCK] on all of the keyboards, AS to WHY I have two or three connected to my PC, because the MS WIRELESS 2000 keyboard has no lights at all and the "On screen Display" or OSD is only momentarily
 and tells me nothing after three seconds. The green, white, amber, or blue LED lights DO TELL me on any old PS2 keyboard and some USB keyboards. Likewise, with the [NUM LOCK] and the [SCROLL LOCK] keys. Secondly, I took out the two batteries from the MS Wireless
 Mouse 2000 to deactivate it and I bought a MS Wireless mouse 5000 as the wireless mouse instead. I do not like Automatic Updates it created to get its software when I already have it on file. SO, I dumped it!!! That left the drivers intact. Besides, seeing
 its new window, as I am colorblind to cyan and some shades of light blue in which are invisible to a white background. I want my OWN scheme of themes I set by the display; DAMMIT! As so I can see the small text! What I ended up to do was to UNINSTALL both
 software for the MS Wireless Keyboard 2000 and its associated mouse since I deactivated it and set the software from the CD I had on the Hard Disk, I got with the MS Wireless 2000 keyboard and IT ALSO set the software for the new MS Wireless 5000 mouse!!!<font><span>&nbsp;
</span>Windows 7 told me to uninstall the software so I did! The trick was to get the MS Wireless Mouse 5000 working first with its buttons, and I want the OLD dialog box I can see in GREEN, and everything came up ROSES without a RESTART, I do not need to RESET
 the keyboard definitions, because I had them established before all this all happened, and it has not changed a bit! A restart is somewhat fatal to my established setups because it upsets the apple cart (The hard disk drives do get scrambled as to its partitions)
 and some do not get recognized at all and the network server takes the unused drive letters instead. This PC which has the MS Wireless 2000 keyboard has ALL 26 drive letters and 13 more mounted, and so far, as to keep it stable takes a lot of doing and I must
 hibernate the PC instead of shutting it down to come back as normal as possible. Even a best, ONE external HDD cannot be turned on BEFORE the PC goes on until I see the Desktop<span>&nbsp;
</span>and settle down; THEN and only then, it comes on and is recognized properly! I am more or less fighting Windows in what gets used as which order the drive letters get assigned, in which drives do have a specific partition as drive letters!!! The external
 drives are recognized in any which order as disk number 12, for instance, is not drive letter ‘L’ all the time! THAT upsets the apple cart as to which drive has which drive letter!!!</font></span></strong></p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mute What? How about trying a macro on the Wireless 2000 keyboard? the [MUTE] key is a series of
</p>
<p>[VOL-] until you no longer hear the sound. You may have to press it about 15 times, so what? A Macro&nbsp;can be any length as big as the space on your hard disk drive.&nbsp;SAME on any remote&nbsp;for any TV. Besides, I like the MS Wireless 1000 Keyboard better&nbsp;with a
 MS Wireless 5000 explorer mouse instead. You need two transmitters, one for the mouse and the other for the keyboard. IF you read my comments as to WHY two or more mice or keyboards, ♫"If one does not have it, the other one will!"♫ A macro does wonders if
 you know what keys to press. How about deleteing the end of the filename: "... - Shortcut" when you create it and then advance to the next created shortcut in Windows Vista or 7? This is different with XP and it can be done with ease. I Like the MS Wireless
 1000 keyboard because I can switch the f keys IN or out in favor of these NEW redefined keys as by pressing the [F LOCK] on or off. that light is on the wired transmitter you can see as a green LED. As so that as explorer BACK is one KEY press instead of two
 as [ALT + Left Cursor Arrow &lt;--] or [Fn + f2] as programmed. as the difference between the lower case 'a' and the Upprt case 'A'. You are stepping out of bounds if you go online to get a program to help you! The wireless 2000 mouse is used when I do not want
 to use the Explorer BACK or FORWARD because I keep hitting those keys while on line and end up somewhere else. With a wired mouse, I find that&nbsp;you drag its cord around and it gets caught between the folds in the cord and the edge of the table&nbsp;or under some
 object and may drag the mouse off the desk or table. You must have the perfect freedom to move the mouse anywhere, with no wires (cords) attached, that is ideal. This time you need to think inside the box (What is given as the Wireless 2000 Keyboard ALONE)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you know where the Wireless 1000 and the Wireless 2000 keyboards store their macros? (You have to define at least one to know). Also do you know that a macro from one can be used by the other? A wireless 1000 keyboard has its own mouse, but it can
 also select about forty more MS&nbsp;mice you already have drivers for? For instance, A wired 4500 mouse, and a wired 3000 mouse? But when you get the wireless 2000 keyboard, you are stuck with its mouse, a bummer in my book!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Yeah! So what? If I was not, I would not solve any of my issues with my nine PCs. It is like a bull in a china shop not knowing anything; as like my idiot brother frying his 366i e Machines PC's CPU not knowing anything about a page file! You have
 to learn by doing it yourself so you know how to proceed, it is all there in front of you if you just read it. I almost fried one of my PC's CPU eight years ago. but smoked it a bit, luckily the breaker popped inside the PC, because I did not know about installing
 NEW HDDs, YOU and I must UN-install the old one first before installing a NEW one. NO one can bypass this procedure, it is like in computing and programming, it is an
<em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EXACT SCIENCE</span></strong></em>. what was programmed initially still holds true today and forevermore, like "2 + 2 = 4", it will not change but you do wanting the PC to do more. As also why I am glad Microsoft
 ended its support for Windows XP, because they are disruptive to what I am doing with all of my PCs. I am constantly upgrading my systems and finding out what it can do or cannot do by what little or great knowledge I know, as to turn an empty case of a PC
 as sold by the manufacturers to something I can use that is fully loaded. Cost is not a factor, performance IS! I buy cheap refurbished PC and make it perform like an I3 PC with four cores. And the PC I have that has an I3 processor performs like an I5 or
 I7 and it is NOT so cheap to build. My older brother has an I7 PC costing him four grand, because he runs a business that requires three monitors and one PC. ME? I have my nine PCs in a network as so that I have all of its needed software in more than 150
 backups... Just in case I lose a drive or two for a broken cable connector or pin. I just go out and buy a new HDD and put that data back on it. The HDDs are expendable but its data is NOT, the HDDs have a very short life expectancy even if it last ten years.
 A lot of people wont invest in their own mind and PC or know how to take care of it themselves. YEAH, like my older brother with his fancy PC, he does not know how to fix it or clean out the dust bunnies in the CPU Processor's heat sink fins he spends hundreds
 of dollars for his tech guy to come, and he tells me it is still not right. I learn from what I do and troubleshoot my own PCs as which many of you could benefit by it. The only difference from the rest of the Tech personnel. they have a license to work on
 other people's PCs, but I do not when I work on my own, the knowledge is the same, I choose not to have a license because I do not want to work on the other person's PC and have him destroy what makes it tick, work better. THEN come back to me says it does
 not work at all. All a wasted effort in my part. He sold that part for money! I have the education to wire it all as a network and I do not want a stupid maintenance guy messing around for a HUD inspection that is destructive not knowing where to step or not
 to short circuit a GFI outlet that is not wired in properly, and fries a USB hub despite it all, even with a surge protected outlet box. I later made the management pay for their carelessness and pay for a new USB hub. Part of my education is from my Dad being
 a chief inspector of<span>&nbsp; </span>the inspectors on the flight line in the Air Force and won the Bronze star for fixing a lot of problems the airplanes had during WWW II and inventing the bomb rack that is still used today! That is a third of my education.
 A third being proficient in fixing anything with an AC cord. and the first third you call me upon as being a mentalist, is from my Mother... As to learn the first two and the fourth "R", My Dad the third! So, I have more than the basic academic education!
 And a EE degree to boot!</span></p>

            <p>Sorry, I will try to be more detailed from now on. Okay so about this article that you kindly sent me Kapil. I followed all of the steps until I got to the part where you had to click on add account. Upon clicking add account nothing happened, except the
 text and the + sign would move slightly to the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried clicking everywhere on it, right clicking, etc. Nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I cant get my admin privledges back then all I would need to do is find a way to get recovery data and put it on a flash drive, correct?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and me losing my admin rights is not the only reason I want to restore, as I mentioned I deleted all of my environmental variables which is causing alot of problems. So i need those back and the only way to do that is via system restore, I just hope
 I can get help fast enough before I lose the restore point.</p>

    <title>BSODs caused by ntoskrnl.exe, SFC found corrupt files but couldn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSODs caused by ntoskrnl.exe, SFC found corrupt files but couldn&#39;t fix some error &#34; PFN_LIST_CORRUPT, MEMORY_MANAGEMENT,&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've been experiencing BSODs like PFN_LIST_CORRUPT, MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, and others including PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED. Those two specifically I know are related to bad memory but in using the memory test tool, I didn't find any issues. I will have to remove
 one and then swap for the other to find out which one is bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I have been getting other random BSODs like the ones I've uploaded here... http://1drv.ms/1u0Lzr9</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting because the driver attributed to the code is ntoskrnl.exe (checked through BlueScreen Viewer). I also ran SFC and it found corrupt files but was not able to fix all of them. I have the log file for that if anyone would like to see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BSODs are never during use of the computer. They are always when I turn on the computer for the first time each day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read some other question threads but none of those users were on the same OS or had the same driver issues with their STOP codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>MB: GIGABYTE F2A58M-HD2</p>
<p>CPU: AMD A10-6790K APU</p>
<p>RAM: 2x4GB Crucial Ballistix DDR3</p>

            <p>I had to return to Window 7. The windows 10 installation asked me to uninstall HP Recovery Manager and then the same problem. When I deleted this program a lot of files are deleted and then some of them are missing and some errors are in the process. No
 way to install window 10 in my PC.</p>

<h2>            Invalid parameter error when renaming directories</h2>
                    <p>Hi, whenever I try to rename a directory I get "error 0x80070057" and "Invalid Parameter". Doesn't matter where I try it or whether the directory already exists or I just created it. There are two directories I can rename, my documents and pictures folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a process monitor trace and determined that "INVALID PARAMETER" is coming up in response to an operation called "QueryRemoteProtocolInformation", but I don't know enough to get any further. Also this doesn't happen if I rename a directory at the
 command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Mapj,<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern, we recommend that you check if your computer runs the latest windows update to check if this will help you rename directories.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, just to clarify, what are the directories that you want to rename?<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

            <p>As far as I can tell everything's up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter which directories I want to rename. It applies to all of them. If I create a new directory on my desktop, for example, or at c:\, I can't change its name from "New folder". And I can't change the name of any director on the entire machine
 with two exceptions. As described in my original post.</p>

            Just to clarify, are you logged into your account when trying to rename directories in Windows 10? If so, we recommend that you sign in using another profile, or
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a local user account</a></strong> before renaming your directories in

<br />
If you still encounter the same concern, we recommend that you <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">clean
