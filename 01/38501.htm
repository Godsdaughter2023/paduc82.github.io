<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error could mean that the issue is either with the network adapter driver or the hardware itself. Try uninstalling the driver, reinstalling it, and update the drivers if must. We suggest following the solutions listed in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a></strong> link to fix the network connection issues. If it persists, have it checked
 by your laptop manufacturer's service center. Let us know how it went or if you need further help.</p>

<h2>            XBox One shows error with fault codes  0x80072F8F 0x00000000 0x00000201 when connects to the enternet</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>From some time, xBox starts to show the following error: </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is the problem with update. </p>
<p>You need this update to use your console, but something went wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>ComsoleID: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0x80072F8F 0x00000000 0x00000201<br />
<br />
There are also several buttons, try again, skip, check connection, turn off Xbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the connection to the internet, it is OK. I can skip and enter to the menu, but when i try to enable network connection i can see same error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also try to make console reset, but situation is same. So in fact Xbox now is blocked by reared update that cannot be installed due to unknown reason.&nbsp; What shall i do to fix this problem?

            I am currently in the process of using a work around. &nbsp;Once finished, I will list what to do. &nbsp;It's got to do with offline updating. I hope xbox does something for all of us for dealing with this. &nbsp;The file downloaded at 4mbs because so many people were
 downloading it(I know because I have download speeds of 140mbs). A lot of people in this same boat. I've spent almost an hour working on this.

            Ok, I have returned with 1 possible solution. A troubleshoot reset. &nbsp;Hold the bind and eject buttons on your console. Then, push the power button while still holding the other buttons. You will hear your power on chime. After a few more seconds you will
 hear the chime again. Let go of the buttons and grab your controller. &nbsp;Select reset xbox and choose whether to "keep your games and apps" or "keep nothing" You won't lose your cloud data. &nbsp;Your console will reset and just follow the set up options after the
 reboot and your good to go. &nbsp;Wish I would have tried this option first, &nbsp;would have saved myself like 2 hours. &nbsp;This worked for me. OSU1 and OSU2 didn't work.&nbsp;

<p>I wasn't able to do the reset by holding buttons (only works on One S maybe?) but I was able to do it through the settings -&gt; update menu, and it seems to have fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell I didn't lose any saved games, and I have everything saved locally, but I did have to re-download all of my Skyrim mods and redo my load order, so be aware of that.</p>

            <p>Hello Faishal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that everything works fine in safe mode then there might be a chance that some third party application or services is restricting Office application to work. In safe mode computer boot with the minimal application and services which
 help us to diagnose the root cause. If your computer work fine in safe mode try to
<strong>perform clean boot&nbsp;</strong>and then see if you are able to use Office application or still you are facing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <strong>‘Boot’</strong> tab and uncheck <strong>‘Safe Boot’</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click to select the option <strong>
‘Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <strong>‘Services’</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</strong> check box, and then click<strong>‘Disable all’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f) On the <strong>‘StartUp’</strong> tab, click ‘<strong>Open Task Manager’.
</strong>In the<strong> Task Manager window</strong>under<strong> startup tab, </strong>
right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <strong>‘OK’</strong>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Enable half of the services</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab, and then click to select the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the <strong>Service</strong> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 3: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<strong>Service</strong> list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<strong>Service</strong> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If only one service is selected in the <strong>Service</strong> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 4: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Enable half of the Startup items </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong>
 check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 5: </span></strong></p>

<h2>            Paying for Xbox repairs</h2>
                    
<p>The Xbox one has always had problems since day one and is still having problems. But when you call customer support (the people that are supposed to help solve your problem) you almost always get the one hour run down of basic trouble shooting cause the
 "specialist" your talking to has no idea what to do. Then when you talk around in circles for a good 2 hours they say you'll need to get a repair. For those lucky few who are still within the time frame of their warranty this is a breeze. Then you have people
 who aren't in their warranty. I have had problems with my Xbox since I have had it and many others that I know with all the same problems. The disc drive no longer reads disks. The answer from customer service- get it repaired. Until we come to talk to probably
 the best coustomer support rep ever. we didn't even get transferred. he told us the problem and told us how to fix it simple. If only the rest of support was like that. Then we have the problem with system errors which my Xbox has had a constant battle with
 for the last 2 days. Yet no one could help me. And I have seen plenty of problems on the Internet just like mine and still nothing. You would think customer support would have a list of these error codes and there meaning but there's only a forum about it.<br />
Now my last option is to pay 115$ to get an Xbox that has always had problems and probably will continue to have problems. If any one has another option for me or feels the same way feel free to reply.</p>

<p>Hey Cravenator1114,</p>
<p>Sorry to see you're having issues with your Xbox One console - and that you're not too happy about the support you have received from Customer Support. I truly am sorry for this experience.</p>
<p>The support agents do have to go through the troubleshooting steps, it's one of the technicalities of looking into an issue, for a couple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mission Control (the people who act as the middle-man between support and developers) need to confirm that there is no current remedy for the issue before investigating.
</li><li>Troubleshooting helps the agent understand what the issue could be, for example, if you couldn't connect to the Internet on your console, it's important to go through the diagnostic tests, the speed tests, restarting the router etc, to try and determine
 the root cause. </li></ul>
<p>I understand spending time troubleshooting the issue might seem wasteful - but it is an integral part of finding the end solution to a problem.</p>
<p>As for the requested payment in order to have your console repaired; if your console is outside of its warranty, then unfortunately, you will have to pay a fee, or purchase a service plan to extend your warranty. The only case in which this would be waived
 is if there is a known defect in multiple consoles, affecting multiple customers, that isn't the customers fault - now, taking into considerating the issue you mentioned, the disk drive not reading disks, I personally have not seen a widespread issue with
 that, so therefore it could be just your console, this means it isn't necessarily a product defect, but more, damage to the product.</p>
<p>Take, for example, a supermarket/shop. They sell you a toy for a baby, but as the baby is playing with it, normally, it breaks and they almost choke; the shop would recall the product from all customers and offer to repair or refund for the product - that's
 basically what is happening here, except, it isn't a defect with the product itself, as the majority of consoles aren't having said issue.</p>
<p>I honestly hope this post doesn't frustrate you - and I totally understand it won't please you either, but I'm afraid it's just the way it works.</p>

<p>I have the Xbox One console purchased on Day one, and have been disenfranchised as a customer of Microsoft.</p>
<p>I started reporting issues with my system not recognizing certain bluray movie discs in March of 2014. I continued to report these problems until just a few days ago. I reported that these were new discs in perfect condition, and they work with no issue
 on my PS3 and my other bluray player on my other TV setup. I went through all the troubleshooting each time only to be told that they would report the specific movies I was having trouble with an there should be an update to resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>They told me the system did not need repair, except for my last contact. </p>
<p>After the troubleshooting for my last contact a few days ago they stated that I needed to send the system in for repair. They also stated that since my warranty expired in February 2015, that I would need to pay $115 for the repair.
</p>
<p>They confirmed my previous contacts about the issue prior to the warranty expiration, yet still refused to warranty the persistent issue with the system.</p>
<p>I have supported Xbox since 2001 when the first Xbox was released. I bought the first edition of the &nbsp;360 in 2005, and the firs edition of the Xbox one. I bought a couple others along the way, and still have an unopened 360.
</p>
<p>I have always had multiple Xbox live accounts since 2005, and have always paid with autopay. My kids wanted to play without the limitations of being a guest.</p>
<p>Since this issue was put off by support until the warranty expired I have been disenfranchised as a customer and have removed Autopay from my Xbox live accounts. I will not renew even with free credits as this is the worst experience of customer service
 I have ever encountered.</p>
<p>I have really only had one other tech support experience with this company. That was due to the red ring issue with the Xbox360, and since they had extended the warranty for them, they happily covered the repair.</p>
<p>Too bad they lost that desire to treat the customer right. I did not ask for something that happened for the first time or that I had turned down suggested repair previously. I just wanted the correct course of action in this situation.
</p>
<p>DID NOT HAPPEN. </p>
<p>My Xbox Live gamertags are set to expire early next year, Since they do not refund unused time for that service I will play them out, but will be done with Xbox from that point on.</p>

<p>Hey Kevin,</p>
<p>I apologise deeply for the inconvenience you have experienced as part of the Xbox Support system, I know it must be difficult to be told to pay for an issue that you reported whilst you were still in warranty.</p>
<p>At this point, there isn't much we can do on the Community Support Forums, except wait for an Official Staff member to drop-by and look into what can be done.</p>
<p>Of course - the right action would be to waiver the replacement fee, as the issue was reported numerous times during the warranty period, however, it is at Microsoft's discretion as to whether this takes place.</p>

<p>Id have to disagree and say it is a wide spread issue cause I've browsed only like 4 pages and i see multiple people stating the same issue with the disk drive not reading games and how the faulty disk drive chews up the disk. but of course ms would never
 admit its a problem and force loyal customers to pay and have it repaired or force loyal fed up customers to go elsewhere. Cause me I'm having that exact problem, and saying its not a wide spread issue is really a joke, sorry. rant over</p>

<p>Hey TwitchingBug,</p>
<p>Microsoft will announce if there is an issue - as happened when the Xbox One console was first launched, they let everyone know that some consoles had faulty drives and to send them back.</p>
<p>An issue is classed as 'widespread' when Xbox Support, or a Community Ambassador &amp; Preview Member detect that there is a growing issue where the cause and defect are the same.</p>
<p>I myself monitor the forums quite regularly and look for patterns of issues, and if found, forward the details to the dev team.</p>
<p>If you do have a specific issue with the drive - contact support and let them know and ask for a repair.</p>

                    I am trying to network my 2 computers.&nbsp; The computer I started the HomeGroup on appears to have a problem with the setup.&nbsp; When I run the troubleshooter I get the message "System Time is different from Local Standard Time".&nbsp; I have checked both computers,
 and my router (on the Dlink site) and they are all exactly the same except Dlink says GMT and the computers say UTC.&nbsp; Any suggestions what I should try now so my other computer can join the HomeGroup. &nbsp;

<p>If you used a device with Apple software (like an iPhone with iOS) in the typical vertical orientation then images and videos will display sideways on a Windows device (like Windows 7) but will display normally on another Apple device (like a Mac).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A workaround for the future is to orient your iPhone (turn it to the left 90 degrees) so that the volume buttons are down pre-rotating the images and videos for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Images videos taken with the iPhone in this origination will display "normally" on your Windows device - and sideways on your Apple device.</p>

<p>I have a xbox 360 given to me by me daughter. she had a family password setting on the game. she can not remember the password. I have tried to delete all data and re-format hard drive, but this did not work. Any suggestions or help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Many people have asked how they can reset the family timer settings and/or the passcode on their Xbox 360 console. I have the answer! No cheap tricks! Reset all passcodes and security questions with this code:</p>
<p>1. On the 360 dashboard, scroll over to the "System" tab.</p>
<p>2. On the System tab, click "Console Settings".</p>
<p>3. Scroll down in console settings and click "System Info".</p>
<p>4. When the system info box comes up type in this sequence:</p>
<p>LT RT X Y LB RB Y "Left Stick in" (press it in) Y Y</p>
<p>A box should come up and say, "Would you like to reset the console to the factory defaults?"</p>
<p>Click Reset and you're done!</p>
<p>If this doesn't work, and that's highly unlikely, call Microsoft at 1-800-4MY-XBOX (U.S.). Provide them with your registration info and they will tell you how to reset the console.</p>

<h2>            MW3 DLC 50&#37; Off&#63; Is This True&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so I saw <a href="http://mp1st.com/2012/06/26/upcoming-xbox-live-discounts-50-off-mw3-and-black-ops-dlc-mp-games-deals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article on MP1s</a>t&nbsp;titled: "<em>Upcoming Xbox Live Discounts – MW3 and Black Ops DLC 50% Off, MP Games Deals</em>." The article lists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3: Collection 1 600 (50% off) </li><li>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3: Collection 2 600 (50% off) </li></ul>
<div>and it uses <a href="http://majornelson.com/2012/06/26/content-coming-soon-to-the-xbox-live-marketplace26-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Major Nelson's blog</a> as its source. However, there is no mention of the MW3 sale on his blog, but there are complaints about it in the comments &amp; there is an asterisk at the bottom of the Major Nelson's post that says "<em><strong>Edit: Removed next weeks
 DOTW pending confirmation</strong>."</em>&nbsp;There is also t<a href="http://www.callofdutymappacks.com/news/mw3-collection-1-2-half-price-next-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">his website</a> that also mentions the sale.</div>
<div>-</div>
<div>So, it seems trivial to ask given the asterisk, but is it true? Are the two MW3 DLC collections going on sale next week for 50% off or was it a mistake? Because if it's true, as an Elite Premium member, Activision owes me some *** money because I didn't
 spend twice the money <em>just</em> for a month of early access.</div>

<p>&nbsp; I cant see them discounting mw3 dlc this early in the game. ..... but who knows......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What I do know is that when you bought elite, that was a deal between you and them. If they give me a special deal as a non-premium elite person, thats a totally different story and has nothing to do with your deal with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You were told you'd get dlc free and early, and they have lived up to their end of the deal on that. &nbsp;Even if they were to decide to give me it all for free, it would be none of your business and have no association with what you and they agreed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Personally ......... I dont understand why someone who has hated on the game so badly for the last few years would have even considered purchasing elite. Heck, I have liked every cod I've played but still wasnt about to purchase elite. &nbsp; &nbsp;IMO, purchasing
 dlc is my one way of showing my opinion on how I like a game. If I dont like it, I can decide not to sink more money in it than I already have. .......... Yet here we have people who hate every release that comes out, but are willing to fork out all that money
 befpre even playing the game..... ......... its just silly.</p>

<p>Yup. From a website that took months to get to work (and is still plagued with issues) to content we didn't expect, didn't ask for &amp; didn't want to possibly paying more for the DLC than the people who bought it on sale. Nope, I don't feel like I just got

<p>No one believes me when I say MW3 is my last cod, but unlike years past, I'm getting less interested in cod as the new cod nears, not more interested. Hell, only reason I stuck around for this many cods is because I've gotten every cod the week it launched
 since cod3 &amp; MW3 was the 1st one I paid over $40 for.</p>

<p>I'm an Elite member and... wait for it..... this doesn't bother me at all. &nbsp;I've received my content early and at a discounted price and received an unexpected prestige token as thanks. &nbsp;I've enjoyed the DLC for many months now and had a leg up on the competition
 who got the content later. &nbsp;That's what I paid for and that's what I got. &nbsp;And now, at 50% off, hopefully people who have held off will now purchase, therefor increasing the population in the playlist and, of course, injecting a fresh batch of newbs to the
 maps I know well.</p>

<p>MW3 was my last CoD as well. Don't get me wrong I love the Call of Duty franchise because of its multiplayer. However I feel like since every year is now a "Copy &amp; Paste" game its getting old. At first it was ok because It was the CoD I knew and loved and
 I was able to jump in and start playing right off the bat. Now though I just wish something new and exciting would happen with the franchise.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I've seen trailers and what not for "Black Ops 2" and I am completely uninterested. Its just the same old game that I have played for years now. Theres games coming out this year that can and will most likely be better than "Black Ops 2" that I am extremely
 excited for. Like GTA 5, Medal of Honor Warfighter, Hitman: Absolution, Halo 4, and a few others. This year and next year are going to be big for the gaming industry, but not so big for the CoD franchise.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<h2>            Auto Maintenance Taking forever&#33;</h2>
                    Since three days ago, every time I turn on my computer action center tells me that maintenance is is progress, but maintenance has been in progress for 3 days now! I let my computer run for 7+ hours and it is still in progress when I returned. I also tried
 to manually stop the maintenance but nothing happened and I couldn't stop it. My computer runs on windows 8 and this is really frustrating! Any ideas or solutions to this?&nbsp;

<h3> kaiwilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            the specified drive letter is not free to be assigned</h2>
                    <p>When my external hard drive adapter broke i had to take out the hard drive and put it in my PC with a sata connector after i did that every thing worked fine apart from it automatically changed itself to a (E:) drive when it used to be a (F:) drive. This
 was a problem when i found out all of may games were installed the old (F:) drive and Origin and Steam did not recognize any of my games since the letter was changed.so i went to try and change it back to a (F:) and it came up with "the specified drive letter
 is not free to be assigned". so i looked up a bunch of forums and nothing seemed to work, so can you please help me ?</p>

            This is why you cannot change the drive letter-- no other current drive can have the same letter. You have to rename the current F drive letter to an unused letter. That frees up the letter you want to use. Use Disk Management to change it. Warning-- this
 will cause the same problem you are having now and will break connections to programs on the changed drive/partition. Reinstalling the programs would be better.

<p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We can only provide you generic drivers and updates, which is different from the one that will come from your
<strong>Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)</strong>. For further troubleshooting, we suggest that you contact your device's OEM so they can provide you the specific update for your drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if further help is needed.</p>

<h2>            User mode driver crash</h2>
                    <p>Errors 10110, 10111, 7011.</p>
<p>My Windows 8.1 Pro computer has been failing to start consistently for the past 3-4 months. It boots to desktop normally for about 2-3 weeks and then crashes. Shutdowns appear to be normal so there is no hint it is not going to restart the following day.
 I have to power cycle the PC 2-3 times before it boots normally and then it runs perfectly until a couple of weeks later when&nbsp; the user mode crashes recur.</p>
<p>Symptoms are, it boots to login screen, allows me to log in but there are no icons anywhere, just a blank screen with an empty taskbar. The error log shows user mode driver crash across all storage devices which includes SSD boot drive, hard drives and all
 USB drives, whether flash or normal drives. WUDFPf service does not start. WUDFRd does not load.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A Code 10 error is generated when Device Manager can't start the hardware device, a situation usually caused by outdated or corrupted drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the methods below to fix this.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Check if there are any updates for display drivers available in Optional Updates; this might fix the issue.</span></strong><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following steps.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
At the Start screen, type <strong>Windows Update.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong>Click</strong> or <strong>tap</strong> Settings on the right side of the screen, and then select Install optional updates from the left results.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
When the Windows Update control panel opens, click on <strong>“Check for Updates”</strong> on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates and install them.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to put the computer in Clean Boot state to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Clean boot</span></strong><span> process will help you determine which third party program/app that is causing this issue. It
 could be some other application or programs, which runs on the computer at the background, leading to this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below to perform clean boot:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Please go through the section:
<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>W</strong>, click apps if it is not selected</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>control</strong> <strong>panel</strong> and hit enter</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If the icons are not displayed in large size, click on category which is above the list and select large icons</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now click on <strong>troubleshooting</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Now click <strong>system and security</strong> and click <strong>Run maintenance tasks</strong> and proceed further.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to test the issue by running the Driver Verifier. If this tool finds a problem, your machine will crash again.&nbsp; Hopefully with it enabled, it will allow you to easily identify the bad
 driver.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 32, 96, 1)"><span>What is Driver Verifier?</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you
 can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
</span></p>
<p><span>Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</span></span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps creating a System restore:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Press the Win Key +<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to display the system menu and click System.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
On the left side menu, click System Protection.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the Protection Settings section, click the C: (system) drive.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click the Create button.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type a name for the System Restore file (The Date and Time will be added automatically).</p>
</li><li>

            <p>Thanks for your prompt reply. I did a system restore (fortunately) and ran the verifier.exe. It completely killed Windows and I had to run the restore to get back in. Even a hard reset would not work. Unfortunately the Microsoft crash procedure gives no
 useful information other than to say it is collecting data which I don't think it actually does. So, at the moment I cannot isolate what is causing the problem. What drivers relate to user mode? Is it chipset? None of the errors seem to relate to a graphics
 problem, besides, I did a clean install of my NVidia driver recently.</p>
<p>Doing a clean boot using MSCONFIG may not help because the problem only occurs every couple of weeks and while everything seems to be working there are no related errors in the error log. If the driver concerned is causing the problem why would it even work
 at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per request here is a transcript of the error logs. They are all related and occur at the same time:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Error 10110. A problem has occurred with one or more user-mode drivers and the hosting process has been terminated.</p>
<p>2. Error 10111. The device (all storage devices - there is an error for each one) is offline due to a user-mode driver crash. Windows will attempt to start the device 5 more times.</p>
<p>3. Error 7011. A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the WPDBusEnum Service.</p>
<p>4. Error 7011. A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the UmRdpService service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you kindly clarify if these logs are generated at the time of the user mode crash? Or if they are generated everytime the system failed to boot normally?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a shot in the dark: Its possible that some critical hardware ended up in a bad state. When this happens, have you tried to power off things completely [Unplug the power chord / if it is a laptop, pull out battery / unplug any power supplied to externally
 connected devices (or if possible remove and externally connected devices)]. Leave it off for 10-15 seconds and start again.

            The user-mode crash only ever occurs on boot. There is no crash once I've logged on. As you say there could be a hardware fault and I have contacted Asus (motherboard) also for their thoughts. Still waiting on them. This being the case I am assuming the
 logs are generated somewhere around boot time. The 3-4 different errors I get are all time stamped within&nbsp; minute or so of each other.<br />

            <p>My computer is a custom PC that I have built.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason my PC is not responding to F8 so I can't get into Safe Mode. I need to investigate this now s well. As the problems I am having are almost certainly driver related I wouldn't expect to have any problems in safe mode. In fact my PC has booted
 cleanly for a week, but this is the pattern. One or two weeks it works fine and then it crashes. Even though it is booting cleanly, I am still getting errors in the log eg:</p>
<p>Driver WUDfrd failed to load for the device ACPI\PNP0A0</p>
<p>Driver WUDfrd failed to load for the device SWD\WPDBUSENUM</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user-mode errors are not appearing at the moment and these are the errors causing the crash. The above errors aren't stopping me getting to the desktop but they are part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the same errors all the time. What is this WUDfrd?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could simply reinstall my whole system but due to the way Microsoft has chosen to roll out 8.1 I am not downloading another 3.5GB update on a limited data allowance. If Microsoft thought about their customers a little more and stopped making things so
 difficult and unfriendly it would make their reputation improve dramatically. Why does Microsoft not allow me to download an offline 8.1 image so that when I have these problems it is straightforward to pop a disc in and update? If I have to reinstall I'll
 just stay on Windows 8 or even go back to Windows 7 where I had very little trouble.</p>

            <p>WUDFrd is&nbsp;one of the core drivers for&nbsp;user mode driver&nbsp;infrastructure. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The log messages indicating WUDfrd&nbsp;failed to load is not a problem.&nbsp;The message is expected, but I realize it is misleading. That message shows up when a WUDFrd tries to load and a component&nbsp;WUDFrd is depended on is not yet running. Once the necessary components
 are running, WUDFrd reattempts to load and load fine. That's why you see that message on every boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also next time it does happen do try the power cycle solution I suggested.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Update and All Troubleshooting Does Not Work Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taylorhebert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update and All Troubleshooting Does Not Work Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Over the last few months I have had a problem updating windows (<strong>Error code:0x80070643</strong>) and troubleshooting for practically anything (<strong>Error code:0x8007000E</strong>) with no success in finding a fix for the problem. From what I have
 seen I believe it may be corrupted system files but I cannot be certain of that. I was recommended to use sfc /scannow in the command prompt as admin but it says "it could not perform the requested action." Windows update troubleshooter will not even start
 (<strong>Error code:0x800700C1</strong>). Troubleshooter in Settings will crash Settings when clicked as well.</p>

            Hi Taylor
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Those update errors appear to be as a result of Office 2010, not Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Have you tried repairing your Office 2010 installation to see if it helps?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change on the screen
<br />Choose the option to Repair Microsoft Office
<br />
<br />Another option you can try:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

<br />
<br />Please keep in mind, Microsoft is ending support for Office 2010 by next year, so, you might be starting to see the early effects of this.

<p>To specify on updates, I seem to only have trouble updating the office updates shown previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Repairing office in the first solution gives me an error (<strong>Error 1723</strong>) and says "there is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A DLL is required for install but could not be run."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second solution does not work. When entering "ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old" it says "Access denied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third solution gives me the same "Access denied" message when I enter "Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More importantly, I need the troubleshoot problems addressed. The 5 tips given are all for updates and therefore not useful for solving my troubleshooting issues.</p>

<br />At the command prompt, type:

<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try updating Office again in that account. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Uninstall Office 2010 then reinstall it to see if it corrects the problem.

<br />There doesn't appear to be a definitive solution to this.

<br />You can try using Revouninstaller to completely uninstall and reinstall it:

            Hi Jeani.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can block the Fall Creators Version 1709 update.  See:  <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/microsoft-windows/how-to-block-windows-10-fall-creators-update-from-installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/m...</a>
<br />
<br />When ready what I would do is try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi JeaniWarren, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />You will eventually need to have 1709 just to get security and other updates however you can block it.
<br />
<br />How to Block a Windows 10 Feature Update and Why You Might Need To
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />=====
<br />=====
<br />
<br />If you are having problems installing the 1709 update you can try these methods if you wish.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load with A. use Windows Update or use the B.. "Even better methods" or C. "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />A. Try to use Windows Update
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />

<br />
<br />Uninstallers (removal tools) for common antivirus software 
<br /><a href="http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;am...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />B. Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have updated the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />C. Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<br />
You can block the Fall Creators Version 1709 update. See: <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/microsoft-windows/how-to-block-windows-10-fall-creators-update-from-installing.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.computerworld.com/article/3232632/m...</a> <br />
<br />
When ready what I would do is try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:

<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong>On Windows 7 Professional, I am unable to attach a VHD file created with Windows 7 System Backup. Attempts to attach the vhd file result in the error "This version does not support this version of the file format". VHD files created the same way
 with Windows 7 Ultimate RC can be attached without any problems. The VHD file I am unable to attach into a running Windows 7 system works fine however when doing an Image Restore.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is this behaviour normal? Shouldn't I be able to attach a backup created VHD file onto a running Windows 7 Professional system?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for any help.</strong></p>

<p>Hey felixd69,<br />
<br />
Try changing&nbsp; the security of the .vhd file in order to be able to attach the vhd.</p>
<p>You can also mount a VHD file using diskpart . See how it goes.</p>
<p>1. Open Start Menu and search for "cmd" and run it . <br />
2. Type in "diskpart" and press Enter. <br />
3. In the diskpart window , type in the content:<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT VDISK FILE=”</strong>file path and name of the vhd file”<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ATTACH VDISK<br />
<br />
<br />

            During shutdown of Windows XP computer, it may take more time to complete shutdown process. Slow shutdowns are caused many factors. One of the common cause is the Clear Pagefile at Shutdown option enabled.<br />
<br />
Using Group Policy Editor <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, Run and type "Secpol.msc"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Local Policies | Security Options<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the right-pane, set Shutdown: Clear virtual memory pagefile to Disabled<br />
<br />
However, this setting is not the only cause for slow shutdowns. Non-responsive programs and Services also contribute to slow shutdowns.
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the problem is seen recently after installing a third-party driver or software, try a System Restore to see if that resolves the slow shutdown problem.<br />

<h2>            windows hello face software device missing in device manager</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using my SP4 for over two years and the windows hello was working just awesome. But all of a sudden it stopped working and as I searched various sources I found out that the "&nbsp;windows hello face software device" is missing in the device manager. I tried
 to install different firmware from this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to see if it could solve the missing driver problem and none of them helped. I have also tried the "Surface Diagnostic Tool" and that did not help either. My device is up-to-date and the info is as followed. Can anyone please help me get my&nbsp;windows
 hello camera working again? thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Barb and thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>the only strange thing I saw was that my Microsoft IR Camera Front was hidden and had this error</p>
<p>"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)</p>
<p>To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."</p>
<p>Besides this everything was fine, except the missing "Biometric Devices" where I used to see the "Windows Hello Face Software Device" and is missing now.</p>

<div>are you saying that the camera now appears in device manager in the correct</div>
<div>place without errors? if yes, try this:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open Device manager by typing</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>device manager</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>in the Cortana/Search field lower left hand corner</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Expand System Devices and find the Microsoft IR Camera Front and uninstall by</div>
<div>right clicking/pressing and holding (but don't delete the driver when prompted).</div>
<div>Then do the same for Surface Camera Windows Hello</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. restart your Surface twice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If this fails to resolve the issue,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open device manager as above</div>
<div>2. Expand System Devices again</div>
<div>3. Find the&nbsp; MICROSOFT IR CAMERA FRONT - </div>
<div>4. right click/press and hold and then select&nbsp; Update Driver </div>
<div>5. Select Browse my computer for driver software </div>
<div>6. Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer </div>
<div>7. Microsoft IR camera front and then click or tap NEXT to install the driver </div>
<div>8. restart Surface twice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Then, go through the process again but select SURFACE CAMERA WINDOWS HELLO and</div>
<div>go through the same steps as above and when you browse your computer, use</div>
<div>Surface Camera Windows Hello.&nbsp; Install as above and restart twice again. </div>

<p>I appreciate your patience and thanks for the help, I followed all the given instruction and unfortunately neither did the windows hello start to work nor did the biometric devices appear in device manager.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can add the "Windows Hello Face Software Device" manually? Like downloading the drivers and adding it via the "Add Legacy Hardware" option in device manager?</p>

<p>thank you very much for the help. I think it will take some time to do so because right now I am not able to have a complete re-install. But once done, I will let you know whether it worked or not.</p>
<p>Once again thanks for keeping up<br />
