<h2>            ERROR 0x8007045d when trying to transfer a video file to an external HDD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been receiving ERROR 0x8007045d when trying to copy a 660MB video file to a G-Technology ev ATC 1TB external HDD from my ASUS ROG GL552VW laptop. I have tried copying larger files from my desktop to the drive and it works fine. I have read many post
 from all over about this error code, but most of them are concerned with installing Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file begins to transfer, but then freezes part way through and then the error message comes up. The HDD then unmounts and when I plug it back in it says that there are errors on the drive, but when I scan for errors, it says that none were found and
 the drive shows back up and appears to work again. I have transferred files from the external HDD to laptop just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home Version 1511. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have copied other files to the drive from the laptop just fine, but the larger video files are what are the problem. As I said in my OP, I've copied large video files to the drive from my desktop just fine, but get the
 error when trying to do so from the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have followed all the steps that you outlined and things are still now working. I did notice that the error code had changed to 0x80070079 though. So, I'm not sure what that means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I've tried disabling my anti-virus software and that has not helped.</p>

</p><p>In order to isolate the issue, try using your Windows recovery USB on another HDD and check if it will show the same error messages. If yes, try creating a new USB recovery drive using a new USB drive and see if it with allow you to install Windows 10 without
 errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it would be a good idea to have your HDD checked if it is failing as well.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The PenCam that you are referring to is not compatible with Windows 7 as per the information provided by the link from Aiptek.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.aiptek.com/drivers/pc0v/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.aiptek.com/drivers/pc0v/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>As a workaround you may try to download the Windows XP drivers and install it in compatibility mode and check if that helps to
 recognize the PenCam.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To install in compatibility mode follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></span></span></strong></p>

            <p>Seriously ? Pls read the question. We aren't asking how to get new/duplicate/different versions of&nbsp;games. We would like to turn on the games we played in Windows 7. Windows 10 pestered us for a year to upgrade, stating
<p>
</p><p>I can see the folders still on my C drive, but searching for them yields no results. The games I played are not in the windows store, or are for a phone&nbsp;or they want money for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize there is a learning curve but this is frustrating, I just want to know how to turn them on as I did in "Features" in Windows 7.</p>

            <p>You can 'see' your games folder, but it is a ghost folder, a remnant of what you had. Win-10 does not have games installed. They will not give a reason, so either go back to Win-7&nbsp;or 8; or 'deal' with Win-10 as is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally do not like Win-10. I did give it a good long try, but it is so frustrating to have that system on a desktop machine. There is SO MUCH you have to TURN OFF, and the constant monitoring by Microsoft applications eats up a TON of resources. You
 need a very large memory and processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIN-10 is geared toward mobile devices, and touch screen pads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember you have a time limit on 'reverting' back to what you had before you gave Win-10 a try.</p>
<p>I will keep my desktop 'as is', but I may go ahead an allow the upgrade on an old laptop.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I suspected that, I didn't understand why the folders were empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a fast processor (i7 &amp; 16 GB RAM, NVidia GTX 980 Graphics) and Win 10 does seem to be slowing it down. Your reply explains/confirms a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will probably do something similar. I don't think I'll keep&nbsp;it either. However, the picture seems to be sharper.</p>

    <title>Intel drivers corrupting pointer and sometimes freezing PC for a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Intel drivers corrupting pointer and sometimes freezing PC for a second</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've just completed building my new PC (i5-6500 with 530 HD Graphics, Asus H170 motherboard, 8GB RAM, Win10 build 10586 64-Bit; will add graphics card next month so by then the problem should disappear).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After starting off by using the default Microsoft generic driver, only being unable to run games, I installed the newest Intel graphic and audio drivers, only to have my mouse pointer distorted and corrupted, with the trasparency rendered badly and no shadow
 appearing:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/5IDY7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/5IDY7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to disappear when dragging windows, activating mouse pointer trails, and uninstalling the Intel drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, every few minutes, the screen stops responding for a good 1-2secs before waking up. None of this happened with the generic drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already installed Intel's drivers from their own site, as I said. Using Windows Update yields nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting into safe mode, however, bring up the default video driver instead of Intel's one, thus rendering the pointers correctly (although with no shadows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages are shown anywhere.</p>

                    &nbsp;Just wanted to try to help out by posting my results from upgrading my win 7 pro x64 to the win 10 home insider preview. I was alittle nervous that i was in for trouble but my experience was awesome and very easy. It took a total of 30 min to sign up
 and download and install it. All my programs and games work fine. I had to reinstall a few programs like Bitdefender, Realtek audio, and my Nvidia drivers, Razor was auto reinstalled with the win update upgrade which was pretty cool. So far not that hard to
 find what i need almost all the stuff is in same spots. And i love the new start menu so easy to pin and find frequently used programs. I did have 2 issues. 1st one was i could not delete the windows.old file which caused a unfixable corrupt file result from
 sfc scannow. A Little google fu found a link on the windows 10 forum {thank you whoever made it} to use ccs cleaner to remove .old and all was right in the world. Passed with no integrity violations. 2nd issue was i had to set

<h2>            Network connection lost after Windows update KB915597</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Defender KB915597 update</p>
<p>Suddenly today (Windows 7 Gateway) Computer will connect BUT will not access my home network. No Hardware issues noted. I restored the system to an earlier point and network connection worked fine. Windows updated again automatically with Defender KB915597
 update. Again network could not be accessed. I had to restore again and suspended automatic update installation. How can I avoid this from happening again? Any permanent solution? Any alternative Defender update ?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Do you have Microsoft Security Essential or any other Anti-virus program running on the system?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to download the latest

<div>However neither article seems to show how to <u>remove</u> files from the public folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I overcame my problem by copying all the files in my personal folder on to a disc. I then closed my personal account and opened a new one. I put all the files into the new account.</div>

<div>In future I will be very careful not to store files in the Public folder.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>You just dragged a folder and changed&nbsp;the settings. Two special folders ended up pointing to the same underlying directory.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is about dragging the two desktop folders to the same underlying directory but the principal is the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like both the all user desktop and your user profile desktop point to the same folder. Your desktop is composed of two merged folders (plus registry specified icons like My Computer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories </em>- Right click <em>Command Prompt
</em>and choose <em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type <em>Regedit.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigate to</p>

<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders</p>

<div>This is the first time that I have ventured into the Registry, I checked out the places you suggested and they were the same as the&nbsp;<em>Reg_Expand_SZ</em>&nbsp;and set to&nbsp;<em>%userprofile%\desktop
</em>and &nbsp;<em>Reg_Expand_SZ</em>&nbsp;and set to&nbsp;<em>%public%\desktop</em>.The only difference was that
<i>userprofile</i> and<i> public were in capitals.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>I think that by closing my account on the computer and opening a fresh account that I have solved my problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you however for introducing me to the Registry, I went in and got out safely so I feel that I have learnt something.</div>

    <title>BSOD - ntsokrnl.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shkira120  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD - ntsokrnl.exe</h2>
                    I have an HP elitebook 8560p with 16GB (2 sticks of corsair) less than a year old.&nbsp; I am running 64 bit Win 7 Pro.&nbsp; I started having problems with BSOD approx 5 mos ago and they continue getting more frequent.
<br />
<br />
I have worked with HP tech support over the last few weeks and they had me update all my system drivers as well as hardware drivers to include a Bios update.&nbsp; None of the BSOD are related to anything I am doing on the computer.&nbsp; I don't use the computer for
 gaming or anything out of the ordinary other than word processing, and surfing the net.&nbsp; I don;t go to high risk sites or any sharing sites.&nbsp; I have always run Symantec endpoint enterprise AV since the computer was new and on all my other MS systems.&nbsp; I have
 never had any problems with it and keep the AV updated and computer scanned.&nbsp; I run Zonealarm firewall and keep it updated also.&nbsp; Infrequently, I use the machine for post processing of image files, but I do not have greater BSODs doing that then anything else.&nbsp;
 The computer crashes randomly regardless of whether it is running in safe mode, normal more or selective start up with all the start up programs disabled.&nbsp; Predominately, the systems only have MS Office, Adobe Professional X, and other business software installed.&nbsp;
 Other than skype I do not have other software that was downloaded and installed on the machine throughout the period of trouble.
<br />
<br />
I have run memtest for 24 hrs and it did not report any errors.&nbsp; I even tested the memory sticks individually and tried the original memory 4 GB Samsung which came with the machine.&nbsp; HP had me do the run in and start up hardware tests which also did not report
 any errors. <br />
<br />
I have run check disk and that does not identify any issues. <br />
<br />
HP installed my modem (it was supposed to be part of my original hardware but it was missing when I got the computer) for me a few weeks back, but this issue was happening long before they did that.&nbsp; There is no non HP installed hardware other then what came
 from the factory except for the upgraded memory. <br />
<br />
HP advises that there don't seem to be any hardware faults since the start up and run in tests check out fine.&nbsp; They tell me that I should reinstall windows 7 as it may just be a problem with the OS.&nbsp; I have read of others having this problem and they continue
 to have the problems after reinstalling the OS.&nbsp; I don;t want to waste time reinstalling the OS if its a driver issue.
<br />
<br />
I ran Bluescreenview and it seems to point all failures back to ntoskrnl.exe<br />
<br />
My 10 most recent memory dump files are posted to the below link.<br />
https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=68343B117E207855!121<br />
<br />
I would greatly appreciate any assistance as this is really interfering with my use of this machine.&nbsp; Ironically, I purchased this machine so I wouldn't need to continue battling with slower, older machines or rebuild them.&nbsp; And now seems like I am back where
 I started but this machine is less stable and reliable then the slower ones.&nbsp; Please let me know if there is other information I can post which can help in diagnosing the issue with this computer.<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

            We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />
<br />
To run MSinfo32 please go to start&gt;run&gt;MSinfo32<br />
Go to "file" "save" and upload the saved file with the DMPS<br />
(Instructions for XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8)

            Absolutely right that I am not overclocking.&nbsp; I have need for that.<br />
Thanks for telling me how to save the DMP files.&nbsp; I was perplexed as Windows didn't want to give me access.&nbsp; Also included is the MSInfo32 file.&nbsp; I have now created and shared a folder with ten of the most recent crash files at the link below...<br />

<br />
&nbsp;These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably your Checkpoint).&nbsp; Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
*Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)<br />
<br />
*If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent<br />
<br />
<br />
1-Memtest.<br />
<br />
*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. http://www.memtest.org&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
<br />
*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
<br />
*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2-Driver verifier<br />
<br />
Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.<br />
<br />
*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.<br />
<br />
*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
<br />
*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<br />
*In Windows 7 you can make a Startup Repair disk by going to Start....All Programs...Maintenance...Create a System Repair Disc - with Windows Vista you'll have to use your installation disk or the "Repair your computer" option at the top of the Safe Mode menu
 .<br />
<br />
Then, here's the procedure:<br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
<br />
*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.<br />
<br />
*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least
 36 hours of continuous operation.<br />
<br />
*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />
<br />

            <p>BLUF:</p>
<p>I have never overclocked.</p>
<p>Symantec Norton uninstalled.</p>
<p>1 audio driver updated. Believe everything else is up to date. Not sure why comment made about updating?</p>
<p>Couldn't get McAfee to work right. Using Checkpoint with AV.</p>
<p>Memtest run couple weeks back with all combinations.</p>
<p>Computer still crashing -- newest crash file uploaded to https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=68343B117E207855!122</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>Per the recommendation to unstall Symantac I did.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure if the comment to update drivers was directed at something specificlly seen as out of date.&nbsp; HP made sure I updated all my drivers when I was working with them.&nbsp; The HP website could be very
 helpful to issolate and update one specific driver, but without knowing which one then I don't know which way to proceed.&nbsp; The only newer dated one which seems like it might be to refreshed was the audio driver which I did.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Prior to posting to this forum I went through&nbsp;all the combinations of memory strips and runnning memtest.&nbsp; The program ran for more than 7 passes for each combination of memory.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this morning the computer was running and I was not doing anything.&nbsp; It just restarted.&nbsp; I am very disappointed I was truly hoping that it was Symantec.&nbsp; I fought and fought trying to get McAfee set up and finally gave up.&nbsp; McAfee would block
 my IE, plus it seemed to be blocking itself?&nbsp; It was unable to activate the subscription.&nbsp; Their forums/tech support didn't really explain much.&nbsp; There was discussion of a patch, etc, etc. but nothing conclusive.&nbsp; I can't see dealing with that with a new program
 install so I uninstalled McAfee.&nbsp; Now I have a better understanding why I was a fan of Norton.&nbsp; I never had issues like that.&nbsp; Newest crash file added to sharedrive folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I shifted my attention to Zonealarm.&nbsp; It is running with the AV on now also.&nbsp; If your recommendation is to get rid of that I will have no firewall or AV.&nbsp; Any recommendations for a product that is as tested and reliable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver verifier doesn't inspire a whole lot of confidence. So do I understand that it may report the driver? I am concerned since it sounds I may end up getting my computer stuck. While it is randomly crashing now at least I can get some operation out
 of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any stable computers out there that you don't have to deal with this noise?&nbsp; Why purchase a new machine if they behave this way?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t switch back to 7 on dual-boot 10&#63;</h2>
                    I am dual-booting 7 and 10, after creating an installation USB drive for 10 and installing it to a smaller partition I made in 7, I was happy. I set up stuff decently, and then I found that I couldn't boot back into 7. Checked the 10 options where default
 OS on boot is, only 10 is in the drop-down list. I check the files, they're all still there, but the C volume housing the files for W7 has been renamed to D, and now 10 is listed as C. Any help, anyone? This is frustrating like nothing else, as I prefer W7
 to 10.

<h2>            I have been permanently banned. I would like a chance to defend myself and get unbanned.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am posting here today for any and all Enforcers to read. my other account Robits22 (I am happy to provided evidence that this account is mine) has been banned since 6/1/2016 7:23:32 PM (UTC) on the accusation of marketplace theft. More specificity I am
 being accused of fraud and I quote;</p>
<p>"repeatedly trying to fraudulently acquire refunds from Microsoft support after having been explicitly told the account is not eligible for further refunds. These numerous attempts indicate a willful effort to defraud Microsoft Support, especially when the
 efforts continued in spite of being told that the account would not receive more refunds."</p>
<p>Now I understand why an issue of this nature would receive a permanent ban but what XBLPET Foxtrot and Kappa (The enforcers who dealt with this issue) failed to address or see is that while speaking to many different Xbox live support members that I tried
 to get the problems fixed after being told I could not be given any more refunds.</p>

<p>To start my defence from this accusation and ban I would like to state for you the definition of fraud:</p>
<p>"wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain." - source: Google.</p>

<p>now, the games I bought, I bought because I wanted to play them, why do you buy certain games ? they look fun, enjoyable and worth the money.</p>
<p>In receiving a refund my licences to these games would be revoked (I know this because this has happend to other games i have had refunded) and therefore I have only received the money I bought these games with (id also like to point out that the money refunded
 would be going back in to my xbox wallet so even after a refund has happend the money would still be spent within the xbox marketplace) , in order for me to gain anything here I would have to have kept the licences of these games and received the refund as
 well. so right away I have not committed fraud as by definition I have not had any financial or personal gain - all I have had is the money for the games that I could not play due to a fault beyond my control. I am loosing the ability to play the games I bought
 and wanted to play.</p>

<p>To begin with you might argue that since i asked to receive many refunds within a short space of time this may seem suspicious, but let me explain by saying I have had my account many years, dated back to when I first started high school to this date to
 being a fully qualified electrician. I am a gamer i always have been and i always will be, so keeping this in mind why would i ever want to jeopardize my account and my relationship with xbox over trying to apparently scam and commit fraud for whatever motives
 the xbox enforcement team seem to think i have - I have few Friends within the Xbox ambassador program (who can support my claim) and talking to them they talked me Threw&nbsp;the steps i would need to do before contacting Xbox Support for a refund these steps
 including but are not all listed as the following;</p>
<p>Doing a hard reset of my xbox one.<br />
Changing the Mac address of my xbox one.<br />
Clearing the cache/persistent data&nbsp;of my xbox one 3 times.<br />
deleting a re adding my account on my xbox one.</p>
<p><br />
later on XBLPET Kappa tells me "Xbox Support exists to help all Xbox Live members. Inappropriate or fraudulent use of the support system threatens the integrity of Xbox Live and can delay or deny other players access to support that they need." As i just stated
 I had already spoken to ambassadors of xbox to try and get the issues i was having with the games resolved before contacting xbox support about my refund, granted there was no way of kappa knowing this but i wanted to point this out as i do understand why
 the support system is there and why i would never under any circumstances abuse it. Back to my first issue that you my think is that asking for many refunds within a short space of time may seem odd, well if a product does not work then yes anyone who values
 there money would ask for a refund and yes i was aware that my limits of refunds was met but when content does not work why would anyone including myself just allow that, games are expensive so why would i just allow myself to throw away money, what has happens
 because the games dont work on digital download again even doing what Microsoft support asked of me including a factory reset, an offline software update and anything else they asked of me. with this is mind is it really that unreasonable of me to ask for
 a refund ? I remember even the Microsoft support staff them self said they wish they could give me the refund because they understand my frustration. I was kind, calm and polite to everyone member of the Microsoft support staff because i understand this is
 there job and they are trying to help get my issues solved.</p>

<p>and even after all of this my account was banned so keeping this in mind i was told;</p>
<p>"we can assure you that this suspension was not issued lightly. Suspensions are only issued following a rigorous investigation of the account’s activity and conduct confirming that a Code of Conduct violation occurred. Additionally, following the submission
 of this Case Review inquiry we thoroughly reviewed the circumstances behind the enforcement and again confirmed that the violation occurred and that enforcement action was warranted. As a result, we cannot adjust or remove the suspension."</p>

<p>so either the enforcers &nbsp;failed or ignored to see that i did do everything within my power to get the games fixed before and after being told that i could not have any more refunds so again i ask how have i committed fraud when all i wanted was my games
 fixed or my money back like any other person would want.</p>
<p><br />
At this point as much as i would love a refund for the games that i carnt play as they still dont work i would much rather just have my account back. unbanned because i have put so much time, effort and money into it why would i ever want to lose that. My xbox
 is my pastime when im not working and i have made friends for life and spent millions of hours and hours playing it so im asking you from one gamer to another, reading all of this can i please have my account unbanned as i would never commit fraud and i would
 never risk losing my account and xbox's trust in me</p>

<p>thank you for taking the time to read this and i am eager to hear anyone's reply.</p>

<p>- Robits22</p>

<p>For support not being able to fix an issue causing a game not to launch, I myself would ask for a refund otherwise its just a waste of money and for an Enforcer to take such an extreme action makes me worry about the power they have over my account. &nbsp;It
 also makes me question the Digital Marketplace, The seizure of my games is not something i would ever want to risk and i imagine a lot of people reading this would feel the same way about losing all their games. Imagine someone turning up to your house because
 you asked for a refund on a physical copy and they came and took your games at home.</p>

<p>So they have basically done what they claimed you have, by being banned you no longer have access to the games you own, even the ones you own? Sounds to me like it hasn't been fully investigated correctly and more of a ban out of spite, since it could be
 a hardware fault or a software fault which customer support don't always habe the resources or capabilities to address, further if they told you you had reached your limit, then why was more refunds then given, some lack of due diligence on the xbox customer
 services part may be to blame, it is not defraudment to ask for a refund, if they are given after a warning then methods should be in place To then not refund any more without proof or further investigation, it looks to me like an error on the enforcement
 part. </p>

<p>If you've been suspended from Xbox you can submit a case review to see if there was an error. See the link below for more info. Unfortunately this is the only method for enforcement, and no one on the forums can assist with those types of issues.

<p>Unfortunately, if the case review has been closed, that's the end of the discussion and the decision is final. &nbsp;The XBLPET does not browse this forum, nor can any of us nor the support team lift your suspension. &nbsp;I apologize that you don't agree with their
 decision, but if after a second review of the case they find the suspension was justified, then that's the resolution of the matter.</p>

<p>Judging from your post you still have to come to terms with the verdict of the enforcement team. A permanent ban is rarely delivered and in those cases this is done after many indications that point out the infractions of service rules.
</p>
<p>No one can do anything about you in this situation for once the fraudulent behavior from your part is established, the enforcement team has decided on the suspension and to uphold the verdict after a case review there is no one that can revert the situation.</p>
<p>My advice for you is to get acquainted with the code of conduct and start fresh:</p>

<p>Doesn't smell like a code generator at all IamOldTestament if you read the original post. People have problems with digital content all the time and because it doesn't happen to you doesn't mean it doesn't happen to anyone else. If the enforcers don't make
 these desicions lightly then they should have enough time to investigate all aspects including hardware and asking if its still in warranty and making sure everything is fine to then lool why customer support broke policy and gave more than one refund essentially
 entrapping in a perma ban,</p>
<p>I think is quite rash and immature of the enforcement team to not let people air there voice that maybe not all fault is with who the account is owned by, since only enforcers can uplift a ban which is usually made very rapid and not often changed, gives
 me concern that customer service and enforcment team dont communicate very well together and that is why most people who recieve a ban albeit tempory or permanent may be unjust.</p>

<p>After following the trobleshooting steps did they ask you any hardware questions? I would of, such as,
</p>
<p>Is your product still in warranty?</p>
<p>Have you had your xbox tested?</p>
<p>Do you have an alternative account you could try launching the games on?</p>
<p>Is your xbox making any noises or very hot?</p>
<p>What type of games are you trying to launch hi res games or arcade?</p>
<p>Have you tried launching a backwards compatible game? </p>
<p>Did any if support or enforcement ask these? </p>
<p>Obvously you can't check now and I hope it doesn't turn out to be a hardware issue.</p>
<p>This is why I rarely come here but seen the post and wanted to know how you get on. Its a shame that the state of xbox has become too quick to accuse and dismiss people and its turned into a malignant mess with forums like these ones. Keep us posted. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Constant &#34;Timeout&#34; on WiFi connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Constant &#34;Timeout&#34; on WiFi connection</h2>
                    <p>Laptop: Lenovo Y50</p>
<p>There is a problem with my laptop that started after I got home from visiting a friend.</p>
<p>When browsing the web or watching videos on YouTube, my internet connection will cut out every 10-15 min, often lasting up to 10 minutes. My connection to the router appears fine, yet, for example, when trying to connect to a website the usual "There is
 no Internet connection" will pop up, even though I'm connected to the router and the signal seems fine. It's not just a browser (Google Chrome) problem, as it happens with Steam too.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c819960a-500a-4a2c-87f4-b96dcaed719b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c819960a-500a-4a2c-87f4-b96dcaed719b" /></a></p>
<p>This is a screenshot I took showing the different time it takes to connect or dissconnect.</p>
<p>I've also been using Command Prompt (Admin) lately to use the command&nbsp;<strong>ping &lt;ipaddress&gt; -t</strong> to see how my connection does. And there is one thing that I noticed that might mean something. When watching a video on YouTube or browsing a website
 like usual, the connection will "timeout" more often with varying intervals, but when I go over to watch i.e Rick and Morty that I have saved on my harddrive, the connection will extremely rarely "timeout" in that it shows my ping maybe 50-70 times before
 1-3 "request timeout" happens.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/568e9633-7cd9-40b4-b9df-cc3dca310161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/568e9633-7cd9-40b4-b9df-cc3dca310161" /></a></p>

<p>Top picture shows how it is when I'm watching Rick and Morty as mentioned, bottom picture shows a screenshot I took while writing this, perfectly showing how it loses connection when doing something in the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried many methods of fixing this issue, from reinstalling the wireless adapter driver, to doing commands in Command Prompt (Admin).</p>

Norton, however, this firewall has been installed even before incrdimail account was setup and no changes have been made after that.

            <p>Hey there joefro007.<br /><br />Currently the only universal remote for the Xbox One is the official Xbox One Universal&nbsp;Remote. Some universal remotes may hay have the ability to use the IR blaster, but you'll need to check their support pages for steps on connecting it.&nbsp;</p>
