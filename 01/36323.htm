<h3> &#216;yvind midtfjell  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have 17 versions of Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; Redistributable, can I safely remove some&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There have been others asking a similar question, and the answer has been "no". However, in those cases it's been dealing with much fewer versions, and the responses I found were also quite old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running WIN 10 and have 17 versions of the C++ Redist. dated back to 2005 through to 2015. What is the purpose of these programs? Can I identify which are still in use (perhaps by old games and such) and which are not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(If I'm asking in the wrong topic, that would be because the "programs" topic is not available for Windows 10, for some reason.)</p>

            <p>The answer is still no.&nbsp; Applications need a specific version of C++.&nbsp; If you remove any of them the application that depends on it will break (not run).&nbsp; They are not big files so I would just leave them.</p>

            I currently have 21 versions of this software using up 400+ mb&nbsp;on a system that only has 128gb of disk space! Surely, there must be some way to reduce this ridiculous amount of baggage? Does anyone know of a way to disable each version without uninstalling?
 That way I could test each version for a while before actually uninstalling.

<h2>            Skype Video call</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am having difficulty when my contacts video call me on Skype. They claim to not be able to see me during a Skype session, but I can see them. I am using an Android device for my Skype, is it because the person calling me is using a computer or what can it
 be? Because when someone calls me through an Android device via Skype they can see me. I have checked my device's front camera and it's working just fine. Please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

    <title>Recently occuring problems with my Slim. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeychelovich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recently occuring problems with my Slim.</h2>
                    
<p>So I've been using my 360 Slim for about 8 months now with no problems until now. In the past week my Slim has been having a problem where the first 2 or 3 times I turn it on it shows the screen that says "Xbox 360" for about 5 minutes. After this happens
 it'll bring me to the dashboard how it usually does, but there is one problem. I have nothing there. It says there are no profiles, I have no save data, nothing is saved on my HDD yet the 70 gigs I've used out of 250 are still gone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why this is happening. I take good care of it: I do not leave it on over night, I dust it off everyday, and this is the first time it is happening. I suspect that maybe, (<i>and this is a big maybe I don't understand why it would happen now
 when this is how I've had it</i>) it could be a problem with my turtle beaches. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use X11 Turtle Beaches and I know the require some sort of power source to run, otherwise the light on it turns off. Even when I turn off my Slim it still siphons power from it, and I know this because the light on the headset stays lit up. I've left my
 Turtle Beaches doing this since I've got them and even on my old 360 console it never caused this problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any input and advice would be a great help as to how to fix this.</p>

<p>Well seeing as I can't modify my post I'll have to make a new one. So far it has been 4 tries and my 360 hasn't loaded any of my data. So I went to go look at the memory section and it says my HDD is unformatted. Unfortunately I have no way to back up my
 saves or anything seeing as I can't access them. So I'm in a bit of a situation as to what to do.</p>

    <title>Why are there SO many constant Windows Updates&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why are there SO many constant Windows Updates&#63;</h2>
                    For the record, Microsoft is probably my least favorite company, right up there with Verizon, and this is one of the hundreds of reasons why. No other program requires SO many constant, obnoxious updates to be downloaded on a (literal) daily basis, like
 Windows does. Is it really so difficult to develop a program that just WORKS? I could understand maybe monthly updates... MAYBE even a couple of weekly updates, but every single day? I can't fathom how Microsoft sees nothing wrong with this. I cannot WAIT
 for Chrome OS... No other program requires a fraction of the amount of updates as Windows does. And then to have to restart after nearly every single update is yet another obnoxious feature Microsoft annoys its users with. I don't need to be prompted every
 4 hours to restart... seriously. This is by far the most nagging, clunky, bloated piece of software on the planet. And then you have Internet Explorer... every developer's nightmare. Just like everything else Microsoft develops, it ju

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Even though I am a MVP I neither speak for nor represent Microsoft so my thoughts are my own.<br />
<br />
Certainly I understand some of your frustration however Windows is an extremely complex operating<br />
system trying to allow the users to perform their tasks without having to purposely engage with the<br />
actual underlying engine. That is not an easy task. Added that new methods as well as possible
<br />
security issues are discovered daily and need to be addressed. For most the updates function in<br />
the background requiring&nbsp;a minimum&nbsp;of user intervention.<br />
<br />
Windows could be made a lot simpler however then we, the users, would have to do much more work<br />
to get programs and data to function with each other. Such as that required in the DOS era as well as<br />
required by the Linux Systems.<br />
<br />
Firefox, Chrome, and Safari are only browsers and not full fledged operating systems. In fact IE does<br />
compete very well with those and has almost 50% of the market. Actually having&nbsp;many major players<br />
competing with each other means many more improvements and special functions that probably
<br />
would not be available if there were fewer developers. <br />
<br />
Worldwide combined browser market share : February&nbsp;2012<br />
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/03/browsing-behavior-in-february-internet-explorer-chrome-down-firefox-up.ars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/business/news/2012/03/browsing-behavior-in-february-internet-explorer-chrome-down-firefox-up.ars</a><br />
<br />
Apple has an OS and many MAC systems today run Windows and other Microsoft programs.<br />
<br />
Competition in the market place is very good for us the users and though Windows, as well as&nbsp;all the
<br />
others, has a lot of room for growth and improvement it is important to realize the major strides that<br />
have been made in the last few years. <br />
<br />
The present CP8 is an attempt to allow users to check out and provide feedback so the final Windows 8<br />
RTM will be even stronger and more refined than otherwise possible. Steps such as these are very important<br />
as Windows continues to evolve. One day Windows will be self-healing however remember the lessons<br />
from HAL in 2001: A space odyssey.<br />
<br />
Take me to the river tonight.</p>

 the port, however the webcam isn't detected at all. My keyboard, mouse and microphone should also light up when connected, however these only light up and work when connected to the 2.0 ports.&nbsp;</span><br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Based on the information that you have provided, it seems that the Control Panel is unable to detect the USB 3.0 driver. At this point, we would recommend that you have your BIOS settings' firmware updated. It is highly advisable that you get in touch with
 your computer manufacturer for steps on how to update your BIOS settings and further troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<h3> oreo_nubcakes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to upgrade my PC from windows 10 education to windows 10 pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So the story is I had windows 7 ultimate, took advantage of the free upgrade to windows 10 but then my hard drive failed and I bought a new one, and sadly was unsuccessful to copy my data over... And at that time the only version of windows 10 available
 to an MSDN account was windows 10 education, so I was forced to get Education edition. Now it was okay, but after the anniversary update I cannot take Education any longer and now MSDN offers Pro edition, so I got a product key and entered it into settings&gt;update
 &amp; security&gt;activation&gt;change product key. But when the key is entered I get an error and windows saying that's not legit, but it loads for a while unlike when you put a fake product key in. So my question is, is it even possible to to change editions like
 that or is my windows just glitching?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Michael</p>

            <p>According the following page, you can only perform a custom install. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/windows-10-upgrade-paths?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/deploy/windows-10-upgrade-paths?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question, whats so difficult about using Education anyway? Looking at your screenshots, its currently activated and offers the same full feature set as Windows 10 Pro. Its not a downgrade, in fact, its a premium business edition and is considered better
 than Windows 10 Pro. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would keep it and skip downgrading to Pro. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want the peace of mind though, you will have to perform a custom install using Windows 10 Pro install media, then recover your files from Windows.old:</p>

<h2>            Cortana and Search Bar Bugs</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so after upgrading to Windows 10, I was looking around to see all the new features and I noticed something,&nbsp;<strong>the Search Bar on the task bar was missing.</strong> I right click on the task bar, hover over "Search" and only two options showed
 up on the sub-menu: "Hidden" and "Show Search Icon". I looked around the web to find a solution but couldn't find a thing. Also, Cortana always does a Bing search for&nbsp;<strong>every single command</strong> (EX: "Tell me a joke" always ends up with a Bing result.).
 I really need some help with these issues because I was really hyped for Cortana and new Search Features, but I didn't get those two.</p>

                    When I attempt to enter a passcode to join a conference call, Skype enters some or all of the digits of the passcode twice. &nbsp;For example, when I enter 2345# on the key pad, it shows up as 2345# at the top of the pad. &nbsp;However, the conference call tells
 me that I have entered 22334455, or 233445, and I must enter the pass code again. &nbsp;Sometimes it works to enter the number again (and again), sometimes not. &nbsp;This only started after Microsoft took over Skype. &nbsp;It is very frustrating, since I mostly use Skype
 to join conference calls, many of which are officially noticed US government calls. &nbsp;THIS IS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH SKYPE! &nbsp;I have not found any way to actually communicate with a Skype representative directly about this technical problem. &nbsp;I cannot believe
 that I am the only person with this issue.

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade to WDF_Violation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim the chef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade to WDF_Violation</h2>
                    <p>So, Microsoft decided to push windows 10 onto my computer, which, yes I get it, they don't want to support obsolete versions... but maybe they should have just said, don't call us if you have problems with windows 7, because we won't support it after (date
 x) instead of just throwing it on some automatic update...&nbsp; My problem is, we turned on our family computer last Friday and surprisingly windows 10 was installing.&nbsp; We didn't care initially, but it stopped at 99%.&nbsp; We waited, and waited and eventually my CPU
 started to warm up and we had to leave the house, we didn't want to leave it on, so we were forced to turn it off... well obviously it didn't fully install windows 10, and now we have the "blue screen of death," it says "WDF_violation" as the code reference..
</p>
<p>All the solutions I can find online require me to essentially lose all of the data we have on that computer, whether its a system recovery or a boot disk.&nbsp; Is there a solution to getting my files out of the computer?&nbsp; We have family pictures of our toddler
 we don't want to lose,&nbsp;important work document, medical record,&nbsp;and pictures of my wife's grandfather who literally passed away the day before this issue.&nbsp; Had we known windows would randomly upgrade to this new system in advance we would have backed up our
 stuff, but because it was a random automatic update we were not able and didn't know.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any solution or am I doomed to hold a grudge against Microsoft for essentially cleaning out my valuable as well as priceless&nbsp;files?</p>

            I don't care if I have windows 10 or 7.&nbsp; I just want my files (mainly pictures).&nbsp; Are they gone, is that hope lost?&nbsp; I understand how to make a recovery file to get out of the WDF_Violation, my issue is once I go through with this are all my documents,
 pictures and files I had on my computer when I had windows 7 lost?&nbsp; Please answer either&nbsp;they are lost or they will be recovered after I go through this process.

            <p>I am having this same issue, where WDF_VIOLATION appears and then gets stuck in an infinite loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 upgrade performed months ago (from Windows 7) and was running without issues. Problem seems to have occurred sometime yesterday, presumably because of a Windows Update. Automatic updates were enabled in the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried all available local options (startup repair from HP Recovery Manager), with no change. Disconnected all USB drives, modem, etc, leaving only power, monitor and mouse hooked up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on how to resolve without losing any personal data.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well I tried the boot thing, but I think all the restarting attempts made on my computer fried something because now my monitor and keyboard do not turn on when I turn on the computer.&nbsp; So as far as things go, I was unable to even perform the task.&nbsp; However
 what I do know id your personal files should be accessible in your heard drive and should not be effected by a change in the OS.&nbsp; So if you do a recovery as outlined above from Microsoft, you should be good.&nbsp; At least that's my understanding. Let me know how
 it goes!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>As suggested by MVP “auggy”, you may restore the PC to a previous date when the system was working using the Windows 10 recovery media under the recovery options.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you are in the recovery environment, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click the Command Prompt option to open the CMD window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type “rstrui” and hit enter.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Select the desired restore point and proceed with the restore.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If
 your intention with this tool was to recover a deleted non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks, this is a good suggestion, however, as it turns out because I was having so many issues, my computer could not reach a windows screen, then with all the restarting and trying different solutions via the BIOS, my computer decided to no longer turn
 on for more than 10 seconds&nbsp;and reach the BIOS. So it is dead,&nbsp;&nbsp;I think, it's at a local computer repair shop...good $45&nbsp;diagnosis fee....If they can't fix it I'm hoping to&nbsp;get my files off the hard drive.&nbsp; Hopefully I still can. Windows may want to consider
 customers before forcing an upgrade.&nbsp; Things like this happen, in fact I've talked to a few people frustrated with this.&nbsp; The only reason for the upgrade was because Windows didn't want to support an obsolete OS....I get it, but don't force it on me, if I
 don't upgrade, that's my problem.. I won't be able to receive windows support in that case....&nbsp; Makes me want to get a Mac, at least they give you the option.&nbsp; Now I have to buy a new computer after I hopefully&nbsp; get my files off my old hard drive...&nbsp; I don't
 have a ton of money right now to get one, being a single income family with an autistic child and having to try to afford two different plane tickets for two separate funerals.&nbsp; Not the best time for Windows to jerk me around and ultimately result in&nbsp;frying
 my computer.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            What has happened to my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday morning 20.4.17) I logged onto my computer as 'normal' and then got a message saying 'Preparing Windows'.<br />
Then I get the blue ?default Windows Screen with a message saying' we can't sign into &nbsp;your account , please sign out or your files will be lost' or the other option is 'dismiss'. If I sign out the process happens all over again. The only way I can access my
 computer is to select 'dismiss'. All my folders are empty (fortunately I did a backup on the 19.4.17). It is like I have a 'new' computer. Where are my favourites etc.? Where is my tack bar? Where is everything? I didn't use my computer the rest of the day.
 The exact same thing has happened this morning.&nbsp;<br />
Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you're unable to see the files on your computer is because your only having temporary access. Here's a simple guide on how to fix this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your PC and check if the issue still persists.</li><li>Create a new user account and see if you're able to move your data from the old profile to this one. If you can do it and if the new account works fine for you, you can use it as your main account.</li><li>Run the <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/microsoftaccounts.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Account Troubleshooter</a> check if this resolves the issue.</li><li>Use System Restore to restore your system to a prior good point and check if the resolves it. Here's an article that you can check on how to do it:

            <p>Hello Paolo Mag,<br />
Thank you very much for this. I had restarted it before I read your reply and now back to 'normal'. Why didn't I think of this before?<br />
I will save your answer in case it happens again and restarting doesn't solve the problem.</p>

<h2>            How Windows 7 activation key is protected from trojan&#47;virus thefts&#63;</h2>
                    I always know there are tools to recover your Windows (any version) but I didn't know it was still quite easy on Windows 7, the application I used doesn't need administrator access rights (UAC was useless) to the registry to recover my Windows license
 keys and some other MS products, and is only measure to around 100KB. So the question if I were to be infected with a virus will it just as easy to get my CD key? If my keys get around the net because of a virus, how will MS support a buyer in this case? In
 fact I got a trojan recently, MSE was useless and I had to kill it by hands thanks to tools from technet (Process Explorer, Autoruns and Process Monitor), it even connects to some random Russian server &gt;_&lt;. I'm quite annoyed by this fact.

            Your actual product key would not reveal that easy, it is encrypted and hash refrence inside your registry plus during activation some information about your Hardware will store in Microsoft Server . If someone stole your product key cannot use it because
 it already inside activate. And if it happen then you just call Microsoft and ask them to help you deactive that person and active your key. Also you could ask them to help you to do some legal actions if you want.<br />
<br />
MSE is not useless product at all, you might not be update or done full scan or it turn off or many other issue. Also there is no Anti-Virus in Any Operating System in all over the world that could protect user 100%. But if you have sample and MSE miss it you
 should submit it to:<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Submission/Submit.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If it is website , then use Internet Explorer 8 and go to <strong>Safety-&gt;SmartScreen Filter-&gt;report unsafe website<br />
</strong>And report website that contain infection.<br />
<br />
Your best way to get ride of Malware is contact support. You should contact to MSE support:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</a><br />
<br />
They would help you to get ride of Malware for free.<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials will keep improving.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you mean to say that the computer always starts in Safe Mode automatically?</p>

Follow these steps to uncheck the option:</span></p>

Your problem is quite different from the original post and should be posted as a separate question in a separate thread.&nbsp; Then we can try to deal with each problem in its turn.&nbsp; At this point, I don't know if the proposed solutions I provided the OP solved
 the problem or not (and without a Hijack report, I can't tell if it's even the same problem though I don't think it is).<br />
<br />
It would also help if you would delete your post here so it doesn't confuse things in this thread (after you copy it to repost it in a new thread).<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<br />
With all due respect, I believe my problem to be very similar to the previous post.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don't believe that Dhoneycutt posted the entire situation accurately.&nbsp; Hopefully, if they are following this thread, they can verify this.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What happens is one of two errors pops up.&nbsp; Sometimes, after I stop the shutdown (shutdown -a at RUN prompt), the second error will pop-up 10-15 minutes later at which time I run the stop command again.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be a specific pattern as to which
 appears first, but they almost always appear after each other.&nbsp; When I get the Plug and Play service error - I lose sound and my system isn't able to detect any sound devises until after I have restarted the service.&nbsp; By the way, this also happens in SafeMode
 w/without Networking enabled.<br />
<br />
"Windows must now restart because the DCOM Server Process Launcher service terminated unexpectedly"<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
"Windows must now restart because the Plug and Play service terminated unexpectedly"<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, there is another message box in the background that always says this:<br />
<br />
"Host Process for Windows Services stopped working and was closed.<br />
A problem caused the application to stop working correctly.<br />
Windows will notify you if a solution is available."<br />
<br />
The first two errors appear as popups in the center of my screen, while the last one appears as a popup on my system tray after the same or similar message appears as a third popup in the middle of the screen.<br />
<br />
Please reconsider, as I believe the previous post <em>is</em> identical or very similar.&nbsp; The blue screen issue may or not be related, but I started getting all of these right around the same time.&nbsp; It is just my assumption that the blue screen is related,
 which by the way, does not always happen.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Have you tried the potential solutions I posted - even the system repair/upgrade?&nbsp; That should definitely have fixed the problem if none of the other solutions worked or gave clues as to what the problem was.

<p>Tried system restore and got the following errror:<br />
<br />
"System restore does not appear to be functioning correctly on this system.&nbsp; The Volume Shadow Copy service used by System Restore is not working.&nbsp; For more information view the vent log. ()x81000202)"<br />
<br />
When I try the sfc /scannow, I get an error:<br />
<br />
Windows Rescource Protection could not start the repair service.<br />
<br />
I haven't tried the System repair/upgrade procedure, as my Toshiba laptop did not come with a Vista disk and apparently has files stored in a partition.<br />
<br />
If you can tell me how I can generate a report from my Event Viewer, I can get that to you as there are several entries.<br />
<br />
By the way, this all started to occur when I clicked on a Google result page for MP3's - the page appeared to be malicious as a pop-up appeared stating that my computer was infected and the background page appeared as if though it were running a virus scan.&nbsp;
 I did a CTRL+ALT+Delete twice before I could get it to shutdown.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I've already had to stop the shutdown process for both errors before I could enter this post.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />

            You are very likely infected with some sort of malware.&nbsp; <span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
I realize this is a lot of programs, but you noted an infection (and if you've been infected by one, chances are good you've been infected by more than one) and no one program can catch all types of infections.<br />
<br />
Once the system is clean, try some of the options above again to see if removal of the malware cleared up their problems.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<p>I've removed Windows Security Essentials, Advanced Optimizer 3, Dealio Toolbar &amp;&nbsp;Search Settings 1.2.1 (Spigot, Inc.) and a couple of folders that were left over from Trojan Hunter 4.?? and 5.?? (I believe this was malware) which I had installed/unistalled,
 as well as, any registry key referencing the latter.&nbsp; I also removed a folder from my Program files referencing to an AV Talking Parot screensaver which had an executable file to the Dealio Toolbar - I had unistalled the parot app when I found it installed
 on my system without my knowledge - I believe that was malware too.&nbsp; After unistalling and rebooting after removing each, I am now able to access System Restore without a problem and have had my system running for over half an hour without any prompts to restore....
 keeping my fingers crossed.&nbsp; I want to give PandaSoft a try, but am wondering if Windows Defender will conflict?&nbsp; It seems to address the issue of malware and unwanted software but not virus protection.&nbsp; Can you offer any advise before I install and run?&nbsp;
 If Windows Defender is going to conflict, do you know how I can unistall this?&nbsp; I can't seem to find an unistall link on my programs toolbar or in the Add/Remove Programs from the Control Panel??&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Pandasoft does not conflict with Defender - PandaSoft is anti-virus/anti-malware while Defender is anti-spyware (or more importantly NOT anti-virus which is where the conflict comes in).&nbsp; You can run both at the same time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So it did turn out to be malware after all (though not one I expected - one you downloaded intentionally) - that doesn't surprise me (it was sounding like that).&nbsp; You may still be infected so you should run the other products.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

            Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; I disabled Defender (turned it off) and ran the PandaSoft.&nbsp; When I woke up this morning, it had found several Trojans and Worms.&nbsp; My system seems to be running a bit faster.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am still getting the shutdown errors.&nbsp;I
 will try the other solutions you mentioned.&nbsp; By the way, you may want to update your previous post, as you linked to PandaSoft.Com, which comes up as a generic search page.&nbsp; I actually downloaded the trial version of Panda Global Protection 2010 v.3.01.00
 from <a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</a>&nbsp;or just
http:///www.pandasecurity.com.&nbsp; I assume this is what you meant.&nbsp; The nice thing about this trial is that it is fully functional, including support and updates for 30 days unlike many others where you have to buy
 in order to clean/remove the threats found.&nbsp; Do you know of any free or trial (similar to this offer) Registry Cleaners that are MS approved?<br />

            You should NEVER use a Registry Cleaner of any sort on your system (not if you want it to keep running properly and avoid potentially needing to re-install the entire OS).&nbsp; Most do very little to help and quite a few are actually dangerous (and that's
 not even counting the ones that are actually malware in disguise).&nbsp; Vista does quite a good job of keeping its registry&nbsp;clean on its own and you shuuld just let it do its job.&nbsp; I don't know any primary answerer here (or Microsoft Support personnel or Microsoft
 Systems Engineer) who recommends a registry cleaner but I know many who recommend against using one (ANY one).<br />
<br />
BtW, I used PandaSoft for 4 years before I recently switched to MSE (because it was almost as good at finding problems, was less of a drain on system resources, integrated with Defender better, and was free).<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback on the link - I've revised my blueprint document to reflect the change.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>Samsung Notebook 7 spin crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> talisa mthompson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung Notebook 7 spin crash</h2>
                    My Samsung Notebook 7 Spin is about 3 years old, and came with an Intel Core i7 processor and Windows 8 installed. System has been fine for months and I've been updating when notified by Window's that an update was needed. The most resent update has crashed
 my laptop and cannot repair itself. I get a blue screen with a few recovery options, none of which work except to restore from a previous image. This has happened a handful of times over the last couple of months. Unfortunately, Windows was set to an automatic
 update for the system at that time after the last update, so when I came on my computer, it was already in the process of updating Windows. Now my laptop only shows the blue screen with options that fail and nothing else. If anyone can help it would be greatly
 appreciated.

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>My HP dv6000 Window Vista home premium Service pack 2 64-bit does not recognize my internet connection (local area connection or wireless network connection). The
 icon for network has a red cross and it said not connected, but in fact I am connected with my wireless network. Also on the Network and Sharing Center I cannot see any connection (no full map) but remember there is a connection using my wireless network (a
 Netgear router on my desktop computer); if I open my wireless connection it said that the network type is an Access Point. How can I change this? How can I make my wireless connection Private when the connection does not show on the network and sharing center?
 I deleted my wireless network and set up again and still saying the same.</span></p>
<p><span>I am able to use the internet but I cannot update any program using window updates or another service on my laptop. I already did a system restore but everything
 stills the same. Can anyone please help me with this situation? I have tried everything that I know but nothing seems working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have seen the Red X problem before however not with all the other issues you are having.<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
After the above :<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point 1st so you can get back to where you were if needed.<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Then :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab -
<br />
write down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying
<br />
drivers). Do same for Network Card (NIC) - Then Right Click on both&nbsp;Devices and UNINSTALL -
<br />
Reboot - this will refresh the driver stacks.<br />
<br />
Now go look at System maker's site for updated drivers.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.
<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as
<br />
Vista loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually
<br />
be&nbsp;older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)
<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
-----------------------------<br />
<br />
Let reset your TCP/IP Stack just to be sure :<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMAND&nbsp; - find at top of list and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp;-&nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter these one at a time (or copy and paste)&nbsp;and hit enter after each<br />
<br />
ipconfig /flushdns<br />
<br />
nbtstat -R<br />
<br />
nbtstat -RR<br />
<br />
netsh int reset all<br />
<br />
netsh int ip reset <br />
<br />
netsh winsock reset<br />
<br />
Reboot<br />
<br />
----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wired/wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations
<br />
page - on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;<br />
(and any&nbsp;others you no longer use) - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------<br />
<br />
Other tips :<br />
<br />
If using a wired cable -</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - Network Adapter -&nbsp;(NIC) - double click Advanced&nbsp;Tab &nbsp;and set
<br />
the "Speed &amp; Duplex" to 10 mbps full duplex and then try 1/2 duplex. Be sure to APPLY / OK. Maybe
<br />
some help here : (remember the answer is complicated since there is likely more than one single
<br />
thing causing the issue)</p>

<br />
There are many causes one of which is the little monitor is paying attention to the wrong network
<br />
device. You can try disabling any other network device such as WiFi and rebooting to see if that
<br />
has an affect.<br />
<br />
Even a hardware issue such as a loose network card&nbsp;that is not secured properly in the computer
<br />
can cause this.<br />

            <p>I tried these steps to no avail, as well as a reboot, an SFC scan (returned the worrying message that "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them...") and a DISM restorehealth that has been stuck at 20% for the past
 half hour so I'll probably kill it and shut down soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't understand how Microsoft releases these updates without checking first to make sure they won't destroy peoples' computers.&nbsp; I never thought I'd pine for the good old days of 8.1, but this is ridiculous.&nbsp; Store doesn't work, and now my PC is
 complaining to me that the Defender definitions are out of date no matter how many times I click update.&nbsp; This is really amateur and I'm going to need to find another solution pronto if Microsoft is no longer up to the task of providing a working operating
 system for me to work with.</p>
