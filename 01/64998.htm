            The Device Manager is based on the Microsoft Management Console, so I don't think the Start menu troubleshooter would really help fix that.

<br />Open Start, type: CMD

    <title>Surface 4 sensitivity issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david.herman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 4 sensitivity issues</h2>
                    <p>I'm having issues with my Surface 4 being way too sensitive. Sometimes, I'm not even touching it and it changes to a different open window. When I click on Settings to adjust it, it tends to open up the Add Device panel immediately after. When I'm typing,
 it will change the focus to somewhere else. I don't know if it's the touchpad on the Keyboard cover or the touchscreen. If I wave my hand, I can sometimes see the cursor move and those concentric circles indicating that I touched the screen when I haven't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried adjusting the sensitivity of the touchpad (right now, it's on "No Delay", but I've tried "Long Delay" and had the same issues). Any suggestions before I contact support and/or go to the Microsoft Store? Thanks!</p>

            <p>I have gone through about 4 different glass screen protectors thinking they may have something to do with the terrible touch response of my surface pro 4. But the last one seemed to be working fine,&nbsp;then the problem returned. Touching the screen to do anything
 is a severe pain.&nbsp;I don't have this issue on any of my other devices using the same brands of screen protectors. I want to use a screen protector on this device because the screen seems much more delicate than previous models. There is noticeable flex and
 image distortion when touching the screen with finger or pen. I'd like to add that I have&nbsp;never actually touched the screen on my surface pro 4&nbsp;without a screen protector so I'm not sure if isn't a problem with the device itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I remove this last protector and throw more money away, is there a way to&nbsp;improve the touch sensitivity through settings.... OTHER than the simple calibration thing...which I've done too many times?</p>

            This totally not the same issue I'm having. I don'tknow why my question was moved to a post about being way too sensitive when my device is being the complete opposite. I took the screen protector off and it is still not responding to touch.

            <p>I know this discussion is over a year old but I just got an email today saying this was one of the most recommended discussions. I ended up going to the Microsoft Store and they ran all their diagnostics, installed all the updates, then they even called
 to ask if they could restore it to the system default! Yes, they essentially wiped my entire hard drive... and it still didn't work! It was a manufacturer defect in the screen, which meant I was getting a whole new Surface Pro 4. But when I went back to the
 store, they almost gave me my old Surface back to me! I realized that it was the same one because of a tiny little scratch along the top edge, and I asked them politely if the one they were giving to me was the new one. They checked and apologized, then they
 brought the new one out and gave it to me straight out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it's a common thing, but I was told that I was one of the "lucky" ones and usually it's not a defect in the screen, but that sometimes it does happen. So take this as a lesson, if you're having trouble with the screen at all and you've tried
 all the suggestions, get support on the line or bring it back to the store. And ask questions!! Any that you can think of! I almost ended up with the same problem back in my hands!</p>

<h2>            Wifi gets disconnected when screen is locked</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div>I am fed up of this problem since i purchased this computer. The problem is :</div>
<div>-- Whenever i lock my screen (even for a second), the wifi connection gets disconnected.</div>
<div>-- On reopening the screen or at startup, it takes at least 5-8 minutes to reconnect again/ connect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried setting the wireless adapter power settings to maximum performance, but of no help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using a linksys for wifi connection. Other laptops running Win7 in my apartment are facing no problem with the same router.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system details are:</div>
<div>Make: Lenovo Z-580</div>
<div>OS : Windows 8 X-64 (Intel i5)</div>
<div>Security : No 3rd party antivirus/firewall. Uses only windows defender.</div>
<div>Adapter: Broadcom 802.11n</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;Many thanks for the prompt reply. I tried the methods as directed by you :</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Troubleshooter did not return any results, all fine.</div>
<div>2. In the second method, the check box was already unchecked. So no benefit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I also tried setting the "Minimum power consumption" to "Disabled" in the Advanced properties tab and restarted the system, but of no help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please suggest any other option, if any. Thanks again.</div>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;I tried un-installing the driver. but after clicking on un-install option, the device disappears from the list but it is not prompting for any further steps. After a considerable amount of time, if i refresh/ restart the system, the device re-appears in the
 list and works as usual.<br />
<br />
I guess i need to contact the manufacturer now.<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

    <title>LifeCam VX-2000 Installation Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muhammadmalik  say:</h3>
<h2>            LifeCam VX-2000 Installation Problem</h2>
                    A couple of months ago my roommate bought a LifeCam VX-2000 Webcam, he used it for skype and msn, and i wanted to use it as well, so i installed the cd onto my laptop and started using it also. now my friend has left and he took the webcam as well, and
 so i went out and bought the same webcam.&nbsp; and then i tried to install the cd but an error came up "Setup cannot continue because an unexpected error has occurred. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953691". So I go to this site and it tells me to uninstall old
 version and then reinstall from current CD. so when i go to Add/Remove programs i find the program and i try to uninstall but then another error message appears "The windows installer service could not be accessed. this can occur if the windows installer is
 not correctly installed." <br />
<br />
What the heck do I do!? I'm Stuck!<br />
<br />
P.s. I Have Windows Vista, and Dell Inspiron 1525<br />

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Paint</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For photo editing, you need a more sophisticated program.</p>

            Hi Loius,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Moving from an Insider release to stable release requires you to do a clean install or wait for the next stable release. As the next stable release is very far away from now, you should do a clean install of version 1903.
<br />
<br />How to do a clean install

    <title>Forced gamertag change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> el guapo dbrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forced gamertag change</h2>
                    
<p>After 7 years as a loyal xbox live member, and more as an xbox owner, I am EXTREMELY frustrated with the way in which microsoft has seen fit to handle an issue.&nbsp; I was notified in an email last evening that my gamertag was deemed inappropriate.&nbsp; While I
 don't believe that it was, I'm not frustrated in the least by this.&nbsp; What angers me is that it was changed by microsoft, without WARNING or MY CONSENT.&nbsp; predictably, my new gamertag is something terrible.&nbsp; Microsoft now demands that I pay them $9.99 to change
 it.&nbsp; I should have been allowed the opportunity to correct the situation myself.&nbsp; I certainly believe that I should be allowed to change my gamertag now at no cost to me.&nbsp; I'm more than happy to comply with microsoft's ever changing code of conduct, but I
 refuse to pay what amounts to an arbitrary fine. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I called in to customer service today 9/3/14 and spoke with a supervisor, Doug, call reference number [Mod removed].&nbsp; He refused to transfer my call, or pass on any method of communication to anyone who could help rectify this situation.&nbsp; He was not in any
 way rude, just handcuffed by his inability from corporate to do anything that could in any way help to resolve this issue.&nbsp; He said my only outlet was this new forum, which means my anger will surely go unanswered, as this thread will float of into space ignored
 by microsoft.<br />
<br />
I feel incredibly disrespected by a company to which I have been very loyal.&nbsp; Oddly enough, today I received the xbox one and peripheries in the mail that I recently ordered from Amazon.&nbsp; As they sit in my living room unopened, I can't imagine continuing to
 do business with a company who has so little respect for its patrons.&nbsp; Though I don't want to, at this point I feel my only recourse is to return all of my purchases (which will cost far more than $9.99, but angers me to waste FAR less), cancel my xbox live
 subscription, and to take my business to Playstation.&nbsp; I humbly submit that microsoft strongly consider that part of the reason they are lagging in the console wars is poor customer service.&nbsp; I mean that not in a get a hold of somebody 24/7 sense, but more
 in an actually caring for the treatment and experience of your users way.</p>

<p>you are not on the correct boards, forced gamertag changes are processed by enforcement Team and they ONLY read this board section -&gt;

<p>though there is no Appeal, all you can do is ask for the reason which obviously would be: it was reported for Violation, checked and Changed.</p>

<p>blame those who abused the free name change. &nbsp;in the past you could not sign in unless you changed the tag but others kept creating bad tags so they changed the policy. &nbsp;loyalty means nothing if you had a tag that was against the rules does not mater if
 you had it for 7 days, 7 months or 7 years, if it was something bad somebody finally reported it it was investigated, found bad, then given the forced autogenerated new tag.</p>

<p>At this link you will find the policy the Enforcement Team uses with Forced Name Changes. You agreed to the policies and procedures used by the Enforcement team when you created your account. &nbsp;As Dave posted they changed the free gamertag change policy due
 to most people would change it again to another violation. So that just doubled the amount of work for the PET. &nbsp;The reason you can't contact them is due to they would never get anything done if ever person who violated the rules got all upset when they were
 punished. &nbsp;The rules are simple, they are everywhere and you agreed to them.</p>

<p>it was reported for violating and Changed because it was in fact violating - else nothing would have been done - so it definitly can not be used by this single fact and gamertags somehow remain "used" for uncertian periods of times, there is no stated rule
 to the 2nd Part, Information gained by testing and seeing the result.</p>

<p>It seems to me that we are all victims to the Communist Microsoft Corporation apparently they don't believe in a free America or the First Amendment they type up all these rules in very small print or on a page 6 miles long knowing good and well that no
 one will read them and then they leave there rules open to the interpretation of what ever liberal/communist/child they have working your case The only way to ever stop this kind of treatment is to stop giving your hard earned money to these fools

<p>Dixe Pride: you are using a Service, xbox live is no birth right. when using a Service you agree to Terms of use. each Service has rules and regulations. if you dont agree then dont use xbox live, but fyi this also applies to sony, nintendo, steam, origin,
 ubisoft, or whatever Plattform you could be thinking of using.</p>

            Yes...but the whole reason we needed a new password was we forgot the old one...so even though we can access our email, the fact of the matter is that we'll never to able to use Cortana if we can't remember the old password. &nbsp;Is there a way around this?
 &nbsp;Otherwise why would we have needed the new password in the first place?

<h2>            Unable to recover Skype password - THIS IS INSANE&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft, have you gone totally crazy out there!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Skype for over 10 years and I'm shocked how it was terribly destroyed by your company.</p>
<p>I've logged out and forgot my password (as I never logged out for years) and I'm getting through the recovery process for 3rd hour now - without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery system is simply ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead of simple mail/phone confirmation, I'm being asked numerous&nbsp;questions such as</p>
<p>- providing 3 previous passwords (!?)</p>
<p>- providing ALL my personal data</p>
<p>- emails, contacts names!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you need all this information?</p>
<p>I'm filling this form 5th time and EVERY TIME i receive an email saying that it wasnt enough! To make thing worse the EMAIL THAT YOU SEND ME TELLS ME TO FILL FORMS THAT ARE NOT EVEN IN THE ONLINE FORM!!! (email subjects and receptients, for example).&nbsp;</p>
<p>And not even get me started on the fact that YOUR OWN EMAILS from MICROSOFT DOMAIN end up in MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 SPAM FOLDER!!!</p>
<p>How is possible that a billion dollar company is unable to deliver a working software?<br />
</p>
<p>I used my&nbsp;all options to recover my password, this is my last try. After this I'm switching&nbsp;together with my company to any competitive&nbsp;product that works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>in my personal opinion. DON&#39;T buy a Lenovo Legion Y520 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            in my personal opinion. DON&#39;T buy a Lenovo Legion Y520</h2>
                    <p>Do any of you have a Lenovo laptop? I've just bought one - the spec looked very impressive and it is, performance-wise. But it was advertised as a Windows 10 laptop and it looks to me like it's a Win 8/Win 10-ready. (I won't know for sure until I've checked
 it after it's finished updating). A couple of years ago I bought one of these and it trashed my laptop. Got a full refund and started over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other laptop (this one) has v1809 and the oldest version on it, v1703, probably goes back at least a year. The new Legion Y520 has v15! It's been updating for several hours and is now preparing to install the Feature Update to Windows 10 v1803 which was
 installed on this probably 5 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I chose this Lenovo model I read many reviews and all of them said Lenovo is a good manufacturer. But go to their forum and you'll see hundreds of major angry complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure this near-£900 laptop will be going back to the UK retailer and when I get the refund I'll have to start looking at other manufacturers. Back to square one.

<p>It gets worse:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) The WUs have finished and it's now at v1803 build 17134.407 - that was installed on this laptop on the 14th November. The Update History is nonsense - it say I've had one Feature Update and three Quality Updates but there must have been at least twelve
 updates, some going back three years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) It says that I'm up-to-date but I'm not - there's v1809 to come. I'll try again in the morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) It's now sending me notifications for email replies and MS Community replies, and the background on it comprises pictures from my OneDrive folder. But I've not yet set up OneDrive on it. How can it be synchronising with this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've changed the title of this to reflect my feelings about Lenovo Legion Y520</p>

                    I can toggle between a metered connection and non-metered connection of a wi-fi network, but I can't toggle between a metered connection and non-metered connection of a cellular network. As the option is greyed out. I used to toggle on windows 8.1, but
 I&nbsp; can't toggle in windows 10. I am using windows 10.0.10240 with all the windows updates installed and windows is up to date.

</p><p>Try to disable and enable and check or create a new admin account and check.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Wi‑Fi networks</span>—Windows sets Wi‑Fi networks to non-metered by default. But if your Internet service provider charges you by the amount of data you use, setting your network connection to metered can help you limit your data usage.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Mobile broadband networks</span>—Windows sets mobile broadband networks to metered by default. But if your mobile broadband service is actually unlimited, then you might want to change the network setting to non-metered.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you're not sure what to do, keep an eye on your data usage. If you find that you're being billed for extra data usage, setting your network connection to metered can help you manage this.

            <p>The question was HOW to swap between metered and not metered!!</p>
<p>Not what to do. We all know what to do..but,,</p>
<p>HOW do we do it???</p>
<p>I tried as a "user" and as " administrator". The Choice remains greyed out. So far no luck.</p>
<p>According to MS, metered Mobile broadband use is excluded from updates....BUT..... mine keeps on downloading updates and is shortly hitting my data cap.</p>
<p>Anyway HOW does MS know if the data is metered or not..????</p>
<p>They should at least give users a choice</p>

            <p>Think I've managed to sort this one out:</p>
<p>The values for metered or non-metered are stored in the registry keys (to be noted the solution was tested on&nbsp;W10 x64 Ent edition).
</p>
<p>Logical explanation would be that when the drivers for the WWAN cards are installed, either when W10 is setup or afterwards (depends on what you chose), the drivers are installed under trustedinstall account, and that account remains the owner for the registry
 values and will block any changes to those keys regardless if you are the local admin or user accounts.
</p>
<p>In order to make changes to those registry keys you should take a backup of your registry, change the owner of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\DefaultMediaCost key to your account&nbsp;and set 3G and 4G values to the
 whished output (1 for non-metered, 2 for metered). Once done, reboot the machine and you will obtain the desired effect.
</p>
<p>I started working on this after changing from the toggle button the WWAN connection to metered - off but Outlook 2013 when starting still saw the connection as metered.
</p>
<p>In theory it's a registry key permission issue, if you would change the owner either to System or Users to allow changes to those registry values, when toggling the button in the GUI you would also see the change in the registry for the values between 1
 and 2, but I do not know how that GUI management was designed by MS and I did not take the time to test it further, although MS should release probably a fix for it if it's a design issue.
</p>
<p>Let me know if it works, although it did the trick in my case, the short steps would be:</p>
<p>1. take a backup of your registry;</p>
<p>2. change the owner to administrator/ users or any other account you are working with for HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\DefaultMediaCost</p>
<p>3. set the desired values for 3G and 4G keys to 1 for non-metered or 2 for metered</p>
<p>4. restart the machine.</p>

            <p>Is there an actual first. For this problem without altering the registry? Microsoft puts this option in however we can't enable it without modifying the reg? That makes no sense.&nbsp; It didn't work in 8.1 by the way.&nbsp; Only the main account allows me to toggle
 this. Not my work account. </p>

            <p>In my registry, the setting already set to 2, yet in the Cellular settings, it's greyed out in the Metered "Off" position and windows update has gobbled up 9 gigs of data in the last week. I've disabled the Windows Update service and changed the Group Policy
 setting to "Notify to Download" and "Notify to Install" yet Windows has mysteriously consumed another 500MB in the time it took me to access this page, read through and make this comment! I'm frustrated!!!!</p>

            Try to configure / enable a data plan instead of using the toggle button. Acording to MS that's the next evolution step to the togle button anyway, and doing so you may also activate the button. Read my post, that button being greyed out or not doesn't
 matter, the registry values are the ones that count, and from reading your issue, you've set it as unmettered.&nbsp;

    <title>Audio Distortion When Using The Internet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio Distortion When Using The Internet</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having an incredibly annoying problem with my computer for the last 2-3 months, where, when ever I listen to music/audio on my computer it will distort and slow down when loading internet pages. Some websites cause a much more severe distortion
 while others don't seem to have much affect. This problem happens whether I play a music file from my computer or if I'm streaming music/audio from websites such as youtube etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an integrated network card in my computer and I've already tried updating the driver for my network card with no result. My computer is running Windows 10. I haven't made any changes to any settings as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

                    <p>For Windows 7, in Network and Sharing Center, on the Change Advanced Sharing Setting, what would each radio button in HOME and WORK and also in PUBLIC sections be set to as default ? I often see reference to a default, but a simple list of each with their

<h3> neofrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            AC3 Freezes in DISC 1 &#40;Single player&#41; Could need some help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I played some AC3 for about 5 hours untill I had a totally random freeze. I rebooted it and played for a while untill it happened again. And now I can't even get through the "loading" screen into the world, since I get freezed. The whole xbox freezes
 and not the game, but all my other games work fine. So with that I mean that I cant go back to the Dashboard, I have to rebot it and do the same process again. Ending with a new freeze at the loading screen. I've deleted my cache, removing and putting back
 my memory, opening the xbox and cleanng the laser and all other stuff from dust etc. And by the way, when I try to install the game it says that it's unreadable at around 42%. So I can't play the goddamn game. Please don't even bother to write a answer with
 "You prolly got a bad copy" "You should delete your cache". Since I know that's not the case neither the problem. I've been googling around and other people is saying that a new disc isn't helping. I also had the same issue with MW3 a while ago, and I got
 the disc replaced and it <strong>DIDN'T </strong>work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be very happy if someone with the same problem had a solution, or somebody else for that sake! :)</p>

<p>I had the same problem when I bought the game last week. I tried all of the things you mentioned and when I removed my memory stick from the second port, the darn game worked. But it looks like you've tried that. I was ready to take it back because I was
 so frustrated...I don't even know if the memory stick removal fixed it or not...I put it back in after i got it to work and now I leave the memory stick in just as I had done before attempting to play the game. Keep trying stuff...I haven't seen any real solutions
 to the problem many of us had with the freeze and "unreadable disc" with the single player disc...my multi player worked fine.</p>

<p>Id try a simple process of elimination - </p>
<p>1) Try the save and the game on a friends xbox and see what happens then you can rule out either your xbox or game</p>
<p>2) As already mentioned make sure you have the latest updates</p>
<p>3) Try installing the game on a friends xbox to see if it sticks at the 42% mark to rule out the game being an issue.</p>
<p>4) If a friend has the game try their copy on your xbox and see what happens</p>
<p>This will at least give you some evidence to go through if its an xbox or disc issue.</p>

                    Since upgrading to windows 10 on both my own and child's laptops, although I have set time limits for my child, they are not working at all and they can access the computer 24/7.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;despite both the child account and mine in the family setting showing
 the time restriction. I know the over the shoulder extension is not there which is very frustrating and should be re-instated, but I cannot figure out why the time settings won't work. I&nbsp;could not find any posts about this related to windows 10 so please help

            <p>I had exactly the same problem - have upgraded from 8.1 where everything worked like a charm - after upgrade to Windows 10 safety limits were working for one kid, but for the other - not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interesting thing is that reports did work correctly - so quickly I did realise that my son is using his PC much longer..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today - quite frustrated already - I found the solution - </p>
<p>I'm skipping the part of MS account creation for the kid, then approving adding to the family on my son side - that was the obvious part which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today however - checking my son account settings on PC sice --&gt; Settings - User account - I have realised that there was an active option to 'Verify' the account - it was just a matter of clicking that option, entering my son's password and... magic - parental
 control did start to work finally.</p>
