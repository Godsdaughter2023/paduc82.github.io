<h2>            Viglen connect Windows 10 Tablet. Not booting.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Viglen Connect tablet with Windows 10.</p>
<p>It has crashed and will not boot beyond a blue page. 'Recovery'</p>
<p>Your PC needs to be repaired.</p>
<p>There isn't enough memory to create a ramdisk</p>
<p>Error 0xc000017</p>
<p>You'll need to use recovery tools</p>
<p>Press the Windows key to use a different operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My tablet does have a windows key button. Nothing happens when I press it.</p>
<p>2. I cannot move away from this window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I have created a Windows recovery drive on another device.</p>
<p>4. Nothing different happens when the USB is connected.</p>
<p>5. I've tried connecting a wireless keyboard, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For clarity (and because EVERY FIX seems to think I should be able to access other screens)</p>
<p>I cannot access any page beyond this one, UNLESS there is a code of key presses (power, vol up, vol down, windows key) that would cause another screen to load.</p>
<p>So, is there a magic sequence? Is there some way of connecting from another device using a usb cable?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Peter.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The tablet is said to respond to a Reset so I'd attempt that if none of the other repairs here help:  <a href="https://forums.techguy.org/threads/viglen-connect-10-big-problems.1201356/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.techguy.org/threads/viglen-conne...</a>
<br />
<br />The Reset should preserve the drivers, but if not or you need to Clean install from bootable media I'll provide a user uploaded the drivers here which you can download and browse into to try to pick them up:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update-winpc/viglen-windows-10-connect-tablet-needs-resetting/5cf9d28f-aeec-4a91-93c2-628523b4eba7">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and keep us posted on how it goes.

<p>Yes. It asks me to press the Windows key. I have done so in various ways/lengths of time. Nothing happens.</p>

            Peter, I found this with some possible keys to press.  It also best summarizes your situation and options with that tablet:  <a href="https://www.computerforum.com/threads/viglen-connect-tablet-windows-10-install-failure.242211/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerforum.com/threads/viglen-co...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can force a Clean install from bootable media using a USB adapter, hub, keyboard and mouse, then here is how to manage 32gb drives best:

    <title>Please fix incompatibility of Windows 10 Troubleshooters with Temp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qwinnepe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please fix incompatibility of Windows 10 Troubleshooters with Temp Files on Ramdrives &#40;Errors&#58; 0x80070057 and 0x80004005&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Thought I'd post this to&nbsp;help people avoid having to search for hours to figure out this problem&nbsp;like I just did, also a request to Microsoft to fix what would on the surface seem easily fixable:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to run *any* diagnostic tool that comes Standard with Windows 10 Pro, I get the following error.&nbsp; (This one as an example&nbsp;came from&nbsp;Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Troubleshoot audio playback, but it happens with
 all troubleshooters:</p>
<p>
</p><p>An error occurred while troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem is preventing the troubleshooter from starting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Package ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AudioRecordingDiagnositc</p>
<p>Path:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unknown</p>
<p>Error Code:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x80070057</p>
<p>Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Engine</p>
<p>User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Deleted for privacy)</p>
<p>Context:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elevated</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried downloading a couple of different diagnostic tools from Microsoft, such as Appsdiagnotic10 or WindowsUpdateDiagnostic, I get the same thing but with error code 0x80004005 instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searched for hours for an answer and finally found this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/problem-with-windows-diagnostics-troubleshooting/d3b293c7-043c-4170-90ff-51f2be3645db</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Here's an unexpected answer, I have been searching google for literally hours for this and no one had it but I accidentally figured it out when a Fixit didn't work and referred to a temp file, My temp path I changed in the environment variables to point
 to a Ram Drive, Seems Trouble Shooter doesn't play nicely with Ram Drives so I put it back to C:TEMP and HAD to reboot (not sure if it would work with temp path set to an external hard drive). Very annoying, I set it to Ram Drive because its faster and it
 doesn't matter if it gets fragmented.&nbsp; So many people go on about sfc/scannow which can't possibly fix the problem because its not a cause of files being corrupted."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do also have my environment variable&nbsp;temp files on a Ramdrive.&nbsp; Ramdrives for temp directories are exceedingly useful for saving wear and tear on&nbsp;(in my case extremely expensive:&nbsp; $1000 for an internal PCI Intel 750 1.2TB SSD) Solid State Drives, among
 many other reasons.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see any programmatic reason why the troubleshooter should absolutely require your temporary directories to be on C: drive except for, well, a badly written hardcoded path&nbsp;somewhere.&nbsp; Please fix this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, while we're at it, please add the capability of redirecting the Microsoft Edge cache files to another path as well, like Internet Explorer has long been quite capable of doing.&nbsp; I would like to switch from IE to Edge but can't because of that issue.&nbsp;
 One would think that Edge should not have *less* advanced features than IE.&nbsp; That's not an upgrade.</p>

            Thank you. This is a known issue by Microsoft's Windows 10 Lackeys. I don't have a RAM Drive but an SSD with an SDHX card in my laptop. The problem is the same with the same error. Since I want my variables off my SSD. Thank you very much.

            <p>Thanks so much! &nbsp;I had TEMP and TMP pointing to a directory on a drive I had removed. &nbsp;This prevented the troubleshooter from running, and all my recycle bins from working, and prevented me from installing any new drivers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able (in 2016, on Windows 7 64-bit) to set it to a different drive, not to the C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows should not throw away error messages like that! &nbsp;At some point in each of these processes, they tried to write something to TEMP, and got an error. &nbsp;They should have saved that error and reported it back up the call stack, not thrown it out and reported
 a different error!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Throwing away error messages is usually due to code that catches errors. &nbsp;This is because most coding languages will report the error correctly if they crash normally, but code that catches errors within a program will usually only know where the error was
 caught, losing the error (unless that specific error is checked for). &nbsp;Catching errors is nearly always a bad idea that makes code more buggy, because the way coding languages implement it assume code errors other than those checked for in the catch don't
 occur.</p>

<h2>            Qualcomm Atheros AR9002WB Wireless Adapter can&#39;t switch on after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a Gigabyte Q2532N Laptop with a Qualcomm Atheros AR9002WB-1NG Wireless Network Adapter which wont enable after upgrade from Win 7 Home x64 to Windows 10 Home x64. &nbsp;The wireless adapter was working fine in Win 7. &nbsp;Ethernet LAN is working fine in Win
 10. &nbsp; Windows 10 installed a current driver for the wireless device. &nbsp;I followed a link from a MS site and found a slightly more current driver - but that also does not work. &nbsp; I have run the network troubleshooter, which advises me to switch on the wireless
 adapter by pressing the button or switch on the computer, however pressing the button does nothing (blue LED illuminates only while pressing on the button but has no affect on the wireless adpater). &nbsp; I am running the latest bios for the machine (211) albeit
 that it was released in Sept-2012.</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help</p>

            <p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;I have tried the solution you suggested and also those in the link you provided. &nbsp; I tried several versions of the driver in various compatibility modes, and whilst they successfully installed, they did not resolve my underlying
 issue that I cannot turn my wifi on - neither by pressing the wifi button on the laptop, nor by trying to switch it on in the windows 10 wifi settings. &nbsp; (as a test I did borrow a friend's usb wifi adapter and this worked successfully to get a wifi connection
 - so as a last resort i guess i can purchase a usb adapter myself). &nbsp; &nbsp;I noticed that in addition to the wifi button on the laptop not functioning, the adjacent mute and volume buttons also do not work (however I am able to control the volume/muting within
 windows 10 volume mixer). The volume buttons (as well as the wifi button, were functioning fine in Windows 7 x64) &nbsp; This might point to a different issue perhaps?</p>
<p>Hope you can provide some more guidance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards TerryBob</p>
<p>

            <p>A few thoughts..</p>
<p>I suggest you visit Toshiba's support website look for the latest drivers and firmware for your specific model. &nbsp;Update to the latest firmware version for your model if you are not already on it, then check to see if that fixes your problem.</p>
<p>If not, then look for relevant drivers for your model - i believe some Toshiba models have a "Toshiba Function Keys" driver - look for that and install the latest version - maybe they have a Windows 8/8.1 driver that will help.</p>
<p>If that fails - you could also raise a ticket through Toshiba support website - they may or may not be interested in helping depending on the age of the machine.</p>

<p>Perfect, Terrybob.</p>
<p>I've been picking away at this all weekend (for a friend's laptop) your solution finally worked for me.</p>
<p>Given I've just "upgraded" to a driver (version&nbsp;1.00.0069) from 2012, I'm not altogether happy that it wasn't sitting in the production version of W10 from 2016...</p>

                    <p>Every <span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt;</span> file this thing downloads it encrypts it. Why, I didn't set it to do that, even a
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>picture I download it and go to look at it and it's a bunch of letters on a page and I cannot find out how to change it. The
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt;</span> windows media or what ever it is called that is suppose to hold pictures, now it can't access some of the pictures that were downloaded from a camera all at one time. To store a file is to burn the
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>thing. Once stored it is gone, it deny's permission to files to me, I am the sole owner of this computer, no one even comes near it, It is in my Electronics shop in my basement. I don't worry about other fooling
 with my computer. Does Microsoft think that every son of a **** in the world works in a **** office and wears a
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>necktie? Well I've news for them some of us are technical minded and deal in things like Electronic devices and research of such. We don't play games, we don't need the
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>news, could give a **** less about sports or who's **** who in Hollywood. To us the computer is just another tool like a Volt meter, Oscilloscope, signal generator and so on. We need to access e-mail keep up with
 web site sales and parts ordered. I have a new web site to sell Electronic parts and when they gave me the information I needed to access it to finish building it. I saved these files, now windows can't open them. I can not and
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>sure will not put up with **** like this, it is costing me money and I mean a lot of
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>money and if you think i can't have windows and all traces of Microsoft completely erased in an hour then you need to look and see what iolo technoligies has to offer for stripping hard drives. Surely (though
 I can't find it ) windows has some kind of system to run to straighten it's <span style="font-weight: bold">
&lt;removed&gt; </span>files out. All I've found that has worked so far is the <span style="font-weight: bold">
&lt;removed&gt; </span>"delete button" If you've got anything that will straighten your
<span style="font-weight: bold">&lt;removed&gt; </span>software and make it usable then let me know if not, I'm going to check out other OS. Got a friend that is retired from DuPont 30 years as a computer programmer and he swears by his MAC and tells me a idiot for
 using Microsoft and I agree with him. He doesn't have problems like this. I know this is wasted time but I can pretend I told Microsoft their best equipment was a piece of ****. Col. Dana Gillespie A MAC SHOPPER!!!</p>

            If you would make it easier or possible for that matter to get a straight answer from Microsoft then I wouldn't have to google for Microsoft help. Don't refer me to pages of other people's unanswered questions, that just tells me you're not doing anything
 to fix the problems that are being posted. I've &nbsp;heard Microsoft had all kind of tools to fix all kinds of problems. If so where is the tool box hid? Try making it available to idiots like me who have got everything stuck in Microsoft. Hire some tech's to
 answer direct queries. Instead of creating new junk work on what you've got until it works. Every new upgrade presents a new set of problems. You haven't got the
 built in software that would fix any problem that might occur be worth? I can answer that, it would be the biggest selling thing that Microsoft ever has or ever will come up with. Want to know why my questions are vague, why go into great detail about a problem
 that is going to wind &nbsp;up in a pile of other questions that don't make a <span style="font-weight: bold">

<h2>            Microsoft windows 10 recovery not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows 10 recovery usb.&nbsp; Created on a computer running windows 10 in November 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hard drive on my HP Envy laptop failed (unfortunately appears to be a common problem).&nbsp;&nbsp; I installed an SSD and attempted to reset from my windows 10 recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The result.... it recovers to windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; No clue why.&nbsp;&nbsp; One or the other HP or MS sucks at software recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I get my system back to Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Once a system has Win 10 installed and activated you can do a clean install to a new drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use the Media Creation tool you can make a bootable flash drive to do this.&nbsp; Make sure and get the correct Bit version of your OS.</p>

            <p>Recovery drives only work on the computer that created them. The hidden Recovery partition on the computer is used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the Create Media tool to make your own install disk or thumb drive. Get the same version of windows 10 you activated before on the laptop. As long as your windows 10 was activated it will install and get the activation key from the MS servers. Just skip
 the question that asks for a key and choose activate later. You must do a Custom Install so you can delete the partition with windows 8 before installing 10. Follow the instructions on the site--</p>

            <p>as u see from the picture, the middle one is my lang (ENG-UK ET) &amp; as u see i set it from the options that it would always chose the middle one, but sometimes it still chooses the one above first from the list (ENG- UK), so i want the (ENG-UK) gone so PC
 can never chose that again</p>
<p>
</p><p>(ENG-UK ET)=ENG-UK with Estonian keyboard, on Lang Bar it just shows ENG ET</p>
<p>i have input method &amp; all is correct, the issue is PC choosing the one with out input that does not exist, as u see it does not exist in Lang option from second picture, in options there is just 2 &amp; in Lang Bar there is 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i chose Lang ENG-UK it goes to Lang Bar &amp; when i add Input it creates a new (ENG-UK ET) what is the right one (it should have changed the old one like in options not create new), but the old remains, the one with out input (ENG-UK), in options when
 it changes (ENG-UK) to (ENG-UK ET) &amp; does not create new, its a bug that it remains in Lang Bar, it needs patching, but my question is, how to remove (ENG-UK)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also good instructions, but this work only when there is no bug with it, bug like i have, what i explained, my eng is not 100% so its bit hard to explain, but i hope u understand what i mean

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for clarifying the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In you previous post, you have informed that your system language was set to ENG UK ET but when you booted your system the other morning, it was set to ENG UK. So, before proceeding to any other troubleshooting step, I would suggest you to perform System
 Restore to get back the previous settings configured in the system. Restore the system to a recent point in time so that you don't lose any important program or app recently installed.</p>

<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap

(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click

            when i first time booted it was ENG-US ET, then i changed it to ENG-UK ET, but ENG-UK remained on Lang Bar from creating ENG-UK ET (like i explained before) &amp; sometimes on boot when windows open i see ENG-UK (but not awry time), cause its first on the
 list despite my settings u see on picture, so system restore is impossible, it mite just restore to ENG-US ET but it was 4 month ago so i doubt i even have restore point to that time, i think Lang area need a patch, new 2 days it has stayed on ENG-UK ET<br />

            <p>&amp; i suspect that u do not fully understand me, not word by word, cause of my imperfect English</p>
<p>
</p><p>third party service? well if PC creates (Create maybe a wrong word, leaves the old) a double from me going in the ENG-UK settings to add keyboard input lang ET to the ENG-UK, its clearly a bug, i only asked how to remove that one, that is with out keyboard
 (ENG-UK) it no longer exist cause i gave it keyboard input &amp; its ENG-UK ET new, i hope i don't half to make picture guide with arrow &amp; stuff to explain this :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 1 choosing lang (ENG-UK in my case)</p>
<p>Step 2 Clicking on ENG-UK ption &amp; adding keyboard input (its ET in my case)</p>
<p>new when i add input it leaves the ENG-UK on lnag bar list &amp; creates a new lang ENG-UK ET what i created, it leaves the old version in lang bar</p>
<p>
</p><p>i write again cause it happened again, at boot PC chose the first from the lang bar list (ENG-UK) despite my settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>also i feel like my changing lang did not change lang at all, cause when i write in web &amp; use ENG-UK words not ENG-US words i see red line under a word, that means i made spelling error in ENG-US, but its not spelling error its just UK work not US, &amp; second
 changing PC lang requires PC restart, i remember that from old PC, but PC did not ask restart after changing lang, so lang system is broken
</p>
<p>
</p><p>clean boot i leave for PC experts &nbsp; </p>

            <p>maybe there is trace of that Eng-Uk in registry, option to delete it from there? i mean the first Language from the list off 3 from the picture, i just want to know how to remove that invisible Language, the extra that is not shown in the second picture<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>i tried even adding new Language &amp; then changing them to remove the invisible Language, but awry time i add Language &amp; Input method it adds a new1, example i chose Eng-Au &amp; when i click on option &amp; add Input method Fin it leaves the Eng-Au &amp; creates
 Eng-Au Fin</span></p>

<p>does this mean that my default display lang has been eng-us, that was set on first boot, i thought that if i Est to Uk in will be Uk &amp; Est Keyboard
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 question can changing display Lang cause issues with Programs &amp; Software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i meant this, when i change Lang in this settings</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c176d36b-efad-4a54-9307-d79c31516218" /></p>
<p>will it cause issues? BDW does it changes programs &amp; software Lang Verison, i mean they are installed Eng-Us &amp; if i chose UK the programs will be UK versions? or does it change the hole Win Lang Version? just curious about it</p>
<p>
</p><p>BDW i was able to del that what was invisible cause i found out that both Lan under ENG-UK were Keyboard Lang, Lang settings is a bit bugged, but when i removed 1 keyboard lang later after downloading Lang Back &amp; that removed the invisible, the invisible
 lang existed cause i had 2 keyboard langm i thought that 1 is display &amp; other1 keyboard, i was not thinking much cause i was thinking all should be sett when i booted my PC first time, that i don't need to download lang back cause i so a lot of lang in options,
 so i did not pay attention to the meaning of Input </p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to Xbox Live because I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t accept the Terms of Use.</h2>
                    
<p>Since the update to the Xbox 360 Dashboard in November 2011 I have not been able to connect to Xbox Live. With this update, as I am sure you know, came a new terms of use. Unfortunately I can
 not accept the new terms as you claim to not be able to retrieve the information (specifically this is the parent account, the e-mail and password). When I try to accept them here, entering the e-mail and password simply brings me back to the terms, where
 when I accept them AGAIN I am taken back to entering the parent e-mail address AGAIN. I have tried multiple accounts but apparently no e-mail I know is that of the parent account. Its almost as if the parent account is deleted from records or something.<br />
&nbsp;I've tried so many e-mails but I can't seem to find the right parent account. The reason I don't remember is because the Xbox used to remember it, and I just had to enter the password. But now it
 just says "Can't retrieve information from Xbox LIVE." and will let me enter passwords but not an e-mail in the blank e-mail box. I know our connection is fine as every other account on the Xbox can connect great. And I can't look in "My Account" or wherever
 to try and see if the parent is shown there because to do that requires accepting the terms of use, which I can't do. I've been registered since 2009 and because of the Dashboard update/new terms of use from 2011 I can no longer do anything requiring Live.<br />
I have gone through 2 e-mail conversations, and 2 of the support chats. Only one was helpful, but still did not solve my problem. In fact I was pretty much told it couldn't be solved and that this
 is a fairly common problem. Is there no way to make it so I have to create a new parent instead of it trying to constantly find a parent that it can't seem to find? If not you can expect to never suck money out of my wallet again (I will be joining the league
 of Sony consumers), because you support is (mostly) worthless and this is a big issue. I had a $60 XBL Gold expire in the time period, I can't play Indie games that I PAID for, I can't update any of my games, I can't access any special content for games, I
 can't see my friends, I can't do anything because of this problem and no one can seem to do anything to help me.</p>
<p>I have spent hours trying to fix this, I am not about to let my money and time I have put into this account go down the drain. PLEASE HELP!!!<br />
And thank you if can, and please don't even try to help if all you can say is something stupid. (Sorry for sounding angry but I am, and have a pretty damn good reason to be.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Kool! I see you are having trouble remembering the log in information for the parent account attached to your account. One easy way to determine this is to sign in to the suspected parent account on the console and look under Family. If there are
 any children attached, their avatars will show up there. Aside from that, we don't really have a way of looking up what parent account is attached to your account at this time.<br />
<br />
At the absolute worst, once your account reaches 18 years old, you can simply promote the account to a full adult account and then accept the Terms all on your own. I'm not suggesting that "wait until you're 18" is the best course of action, but I want to let
 you know that this account isn't gone forever if you can't remember the parent account.<br />
<br />
Please do let me know if you find the proper parent account or if you encounter any other issues along the way. Thanks!</p>
        </p>

<p>Okay well its good to know that I can promote it still, even though I can't accept the Terms. Its only a few months away so it won't be that bad if I have to wait. I have an idea what the Gamer Tag for the parent account is, but it is locked with the Windows
 Live ID linked to it so I can't check to see (since I don't know what the e-mail is anymore, and it actually says something like "This account requires you to enter your Windows Live ID password to sign in." And then takes me to entering an e-mail instead
 of the password. Which strengthens my suspicion that it is the parent since on my account it can't find the e-mail and for this one it can't either.)</p>
<p>If there is a way to find out what the e-mail for the WLID for the Gamer Tag is then I would be good, but I don't know how to do that.</p>

<p>When you go to accept the Terms of Use, if you're on the console, the first password it wants is yours. Then, it should show the parent Windows Live ID, which should give you a starting place to go reset the password. Good luck! :)</p>

<p>Okay well like I said, the problem is that it can't find the parent account. I don't have a password so I don't know why you say the first one is mine. I sign in, it takes me to the terms of use, I press accept, it says that your parent account must accept
 them, and then it says "Can not retrieve content from Xbox Live" and closes the pop up.</p>

<p>Hey again Kool! OK, so you turn the console on, sign in, get the Terms pop-up, and you accept. Then you get a message saying that a parent must accept them for you, and is there an option here that you select or accept? What is the full message and options
 here? If you can, posting screenshots here will help us see what you are seeing as well. Thanks for getting back to us!

<p>Sorry for not having replied in so long. I've been busy with other things (and playing on my computer instead of the Xbox). I made a call just after you replied on here, I believe I found the parent account but two people I talked to could not even get it
 to pull up in the databases, like it didn't exist. I know for a fact it was Xbox Live enabled, as it said so on the account.
</p>
<p>I forgot the support ticket number from the phone call. But I have one from the most helpful online chat &nbsp;I had so far.</p>
<p>Support Ticket Number: 1172204139</p>
<p>Actually... These may be them, its from March sometime I believe. 1172815838 and 1172877959</p>
<p>The second one may be the guy who apparently, even though I told him the EXACT same things as the first person, said the information I gave him did not match the account. Also I'd like to just mention that the whole thing that they can't tell you even what
 you messed up is the stupidest freakin idea ever. Just sayin.</p>
<p>Sorry if I get upset talking about this, but since that update in November I haven't been able to use my account. My account with 26204 gamer points. My account with around 50 Rockband songs, maybe 3 full downloaded games, and numerous indie and arcade games.
 All of which, as of recently, no longer work. </p>
<p>I don't know if I mentioned earlier, but when I tried to log in, and it said accept the terms, after I pushed accept and it loaded the parent e-mail pop up for a bit another pop up appeared saying: "Cannot retrieve information from Xbox Live at this time,"
 or something similar, and gave me the code 8015d080. Now during the phone call I was told this means my account is corrupted and I will probably just have to start I new one. I did some Googling just now and found out it normally means that it is deleted and
 irretrievable, usually due to the deletion of the e-mail associated with it or not having played for 3 months. However, neither of those apply to me. I had played the day before this occured, and my e-mail STILL works, because I can sign in here. That is why
 I believe the parent account is messed up. Which people kept arguing against it seemed.
</p>
<p>Here is what was said about aging up the account, which I am still unsure if it can be done offline or not:</p>
<p>Rick: When I turn 18 I can have the parent account removed right? Or will that not work with this problem? If I set my age right it should be fine in May.</p>
<p>Valerie J: Yes, your account will age out of child account status.</p>
<p>Rick: And it won't need parental approval or anything to do that?</p>
<p>Valerie J: No, you will only need a new credit card to add to the account when you promote it to an adult account</p>
<p>And Rick is my dad's name, so it does remember a little of the parent account, which I find strange... I know I put my name and not his.</p>
<p>Again thank you so much for helping me. I will try to get screenshots later, I won't be home until midnight. Actually a video might be more helpful unless I take screenshots of each screen/pop up, but the e-mail one doesn't always last long.</p>

<p>Oops don't think I made that very clear.</p>
<p>First I sign in.</p>
<p>Everything goes okay and then the Terms pops up.</p>
<p>I press A over View Terms of Use.</p>
<p>It loads for a little.</p>
<p>The parent e-mail box pops up for about 3 seconds. E-mail portion is unselectable, while all password and sign in are fine. If I select password it takes me to the enter password screen as shown under 4. I can stay there and enter passwords just fine, but
 if I wait on the Parent E-mail pop up it will close.</p>
<p>Which then leads to the error, #5.</p>

                    Does anyone know where to find a driver for the Oki C5500n printer for Windows 8.1?&nbsp; I can't use the upgrade because I don't have the original installation.

<h2>            CPU fan constantly running on a band new xbox one s</h2>
                    <p>The CPU&nbsp;fan on my two-week-old Xbox&nbsp;one started running yesterday and it's been on since then whenever the Xbox&nbsp;is on. It doesn't&nbsp;matter what the unit is doing. &nbsp;It started as soon as I turned it on this afternoon. It had been off and cool for 15 hours. The Xbox&nbsp;is well ventilated. I completed all of the updates when I did the initial&nbsp;setup. Is this a known issue or did I get a defective unit?</p><p><br /></p><p>Also when I am playing Minecraft with my girls the Xbox&nbsp;loses connection with the server once a day. Not sure if that is relevant.</p>

<p>☝️Same<br />
</p>
<p>I have the same problem. It's gotten much worse over the last year. It's NOT clicking. No performance issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a super loud fan on CONSTANTLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally resetting the unit will stop the fan for a little while but it really doesn't go away which sucks because it's the hub of our media room. All tv and streaming go through this box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's well-ventilated and so is the power supply. I blow dust out of it frequently. in the internet offers no solution because anytime I try to search for the problem I am instead presented with the clicking noise issue which is discouraging. Any
 threads I have found with this issue have little or no reply let alone the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

 only take me to deleting it from my computer not an external hard drive.

<h3> jspur1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Please Help..My eBay purchased software is pirated and I have to get proof of piracy through Microsoft.</h2>
                    I bought a used laptop from eBay with win 2000 pro and came with no disks.&nbsp; I like to have my own disks so bought what sounded like a good deal on a NEW win xp pro, COA, key, etc.&nbsp; It was supposed to come from Calif but when the payment ended up going
 through, it was to a different seller name and came from China.&nbsp; I filed a paypal claim as Item not as described but then told them that through checking Microsofts How to Tell site on counterfeit, I think this is fake.&nbsp; Seems like a label on the disk and
 not the embedded color.&nbsp; This software also says for distribution with a new PC only.&nbsp; Also when I google the last 5 digits of the key, the whole key comes up and says it is a mass volume license number that is all over Chinese webs.&nbsp; Paypal says that since
 this is being disputed because of counterfeit I should get a reputable evaluation on company letterhead so they can make a decision.&nbsp; I filed a report with Microsoft "Report piracy" and had all the details and pictures of what I got, also explained my need
 for a letter.&nbsp; I offered to mail any info. or the disk if needed.&nbsp; I received back an automated thank you for reporting and a report number but then it added that they cannot respond personally to claims because of investigations.&nbsp; I know Microsoft would be
 the only place to know for sure if this is pirated software but how can I get in touch with someone personally that may help me to get it evaluated by Microsoft and then a confirmation letter?&nbsp; Or is there any other place I can take this software to that will
 also be able to tell?&nbsp; I have a time limit with paypal to come through with my proof and I don't know what to do.&nbsp; Obviously I'm not using this software and so can't go through any of the online validation processes and besides, supposedly this copy skips
 the validation according to what I am reading in googled sites.&nbsp; Please help.<br />

<p>I use both the Android and desktop (Windows 10 version 1703) versions of Skype and they both experience the same symptoms starting from yesterday (around midnight local time). &nbsp;Both could log on but were stuck at connecting. &nbsp;No message was received and
 messages sent were stuck in sending status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I checked the Android Play store and there was an update for the Android version. &nbsp;And after the update the Android Skype resumed to normal operation, receiving messages and being able to send messages again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the desktop (Win 10) version still doesn't work. &nbsp;I checked against the Windows Update and the system is at the latest. &nbsp;Also checked on the Store and there is no new update for Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the Skype is blocked because of different version. &nbsp;Surprise is that MS release the update for Android version sooner than the Windows version and the question is, when the update will be released.</p>

<h2>            adobe pdf converter printer download</h2>
                    Hi people,<br />
When trying to print a document in a pdf format, the "pdf converter" printer has dissapeared form the printing options. Does anybody know how to restore it or where to download it from? Is it a tool included in Windows7 or in any other free Adobe product? The
 fact is that I was used to print office documents in pdf and suddently it has dissapeared from my computer and I don't know how to recover it.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I see that you are not getting the pdf print option while you try to print a document.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you able to locate Adobe in control panel under Add or Remove programs?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If yes, try uninstalling and reinstalling to check if that works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If no, then try downloading the same from Adobe website:</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.adobe.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/downloads/</a></span></p>

            Hi, that cable will work fine. I have used cables other than the cable that came with the Xbox on more than one occasion. The cable provided by Microsoft doesn’t contain anything magical such as Unicorn hair, it’s a regular copper cable.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of the actual plug, the One S is multi-voltage, which means you can plug it in to any electrical socket in the world and it will work, no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you can either get an adapter for the plug, or you can contact Microsoft for power cord for your region.&nbsp; Either way, you're good to go.</p>

<h2>            Reset my computer and Windows won&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;bought a&nbsp;new&nbsp;HP&nbsp;laptop with Windows 8 four years ago. Later&nbsp;there was free upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>I decided to restore my&nbsp;computer&nbsp;to it's original setting using the option "Delete all files".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it has reset to it's&nbsp;original settings and it has Windows 8 but windows are not working and&nbsp;it says "Product key used is not working". There is not product key on the laptop. There never was a product key. Windows were already installed when I bought
 it. Brand new from HP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thank you for your reply. Greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not my intention to go back to Windows 8 or 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I had to reset my computer. It didnt give me any option to reset and keep windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when it was restored back to it's factory settings it went back to Windows 8 which were installed when I bought the laptop.</p>
<p>However now the issue is that it doesn't recognize the embedded windows key that you are referring to. It says that the windows key is eliminated (error code:&nbsp; 0xC004C003). It prompts me to try another key or buy a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am confused... The embedded key is for windows 8 that came with the laptop or because I upgraded to windows 10 now the key is only for windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with this logic, If I install windows 10 for free it will recognize the key and will work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I explain clearly the huge issue I am facing here as basically now the laptop is useless as the Windows OS is not working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>C.</p>

            Microsoft has the integrated Flash player locked down to only support some sites.&nbsp; I don't believe there's much you can do if your site is not working. I found some sites like CBS.com were failing to display video until I adjusted my IE security settings.
 I may have been able to just add CBS.com to trusted sites, but I ended up turning off most of the IE security settings until it worked.&nbsp; Until Microsoft gives users more control over their "Flash Whitelist" we're pretty much out of luck.

            I am glad Microsoft locked flash player down. Consumers spend billions of dollars every year on anti-virus software and most of the exploits are from Flash. I don't like having flash on my Windows 8 and RT. Flash wears out components inside computers.
 Computers will run very hot when watching Flash videos.

            It's not exactly the fault of flash if a computer is working hard; software video decoding takes a lot of horsepower. While I do agree that flash is to blame for some malware attacks, if you are using a trusted site, there is no reason to block it. Eventually
 websites may stop using flash, but during this transitional period, flash is sure nice to have as an option. Users should have some way of allowing flash on sites they trust in IE's options. Hacking an xml file is not a great solution.

MS don't put that in the marketing material. Seriously, two tablets side by side, which one do you choose... the one that plays&nbsp;silly videos. Understand the market, the Surface is failing all over the place. No flash (effectively), no Outlook, no 3G, no GPS,
 no full HD (the others have retina),&nbsp;massive price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come on I don't believe the RT implementation of flash can't be locked to just play video. Why not just whitelist the caption and active content functionality, like it was in the original Windows Media Player, a higher level privilege. Just playing MPEG
 video should be allowed for any site and properly sandboxed so it would NEVER be possible to exploit (fixed channel, data to video and sound output, nothing else, that's it - worst case&nbsp;hack is just corrupt video or sound on the exploit site itself).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are going to do this, at least provide a user visible way of opting in for any website. This is just as bad as that IE control on Windows Servers. What happens in practice is people add the sites to trusted sites which in the end gives the site more
 permissions than what the user wanted, then is an easy exploit all over the place, encouraging the user to increase the "attack surface" (I know they have to read that secure code book at MS, at least when Bill G was around). Every site with any kind of useful
 content ends up with maximum permissions which is a weaker security permission than the traditional (everything works except...) blacklist approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OMG, this is just a total "fail". @MS - Do something about it please, and soon!</p>

            This has been my biggest complaint about my RT Surface. Using this for online classes, I am unable to access most of the tools required for course work, such as my e-books. This was a terrible, terrible decision. Anyone know how to contact MS to try and
 get them to add a site or two?

We know the problem already, this is no solution. And from the MSDN article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"For Windows RT, only sites that are on the CV list for Flash can play Flash content in either Internet Explorer&nbsp;10 for the desktop or Internet Explorer&nbsp;10 in new Windows UI. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see it's the decision to prevent even RT Desktop IE from displaying flash from any site which is the issue, we are stuck without that. Nobody cares if it's a good user experience, they just want it to work!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you seen all the negative comments on that MSDN page? 100s of people saying the same thing, "this is a joke", "windows junk", etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The debug domain registry key doesn't help because it only supports one site. I heard there is also a way to hack the whitelist but then you no longer receive compatibility list updates either which is beneficial to some extent for the old HTML site compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are stuck without flash on RT because of a silly design decision everybody hates.</p>

            <p>Yes, this is really silly and one of the reasons I bought RT is because it supports Flash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a hack that allows you to update the whitelist to include sites that MS omitted.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To fax more than one recipient at the same time, type multiple fax numbers in the To box and separate them with semicolons. You can also pick recipients from your Windows Contacts folder by clicking To, and then double-clicking each contact. Make sure to
 save your recipients' fax numbers in the contact information.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To view more information about the progress of the fax, including whether it was sent or received successfully, click View details in the Fax Status Monitor.<br />

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.

            Thanks, but the issue is not that.&nbsp; The contacts have a personal fax and a business fax, I want to send it to the person's business fax.&nbsp; When I select people there is no option to select which fax to send it to for everyone.&nbsp; By default it seems to send
 it to everyone's personal fax number, when I don't want it to.&nbsp; It needs to go to their business fax.&nbsp; Where is the option when selecting people, or after selecting people to use either the business fax, or the personal fax only?

            Hi I think the point is being missed.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the fax modem or anything else.&nbsp; When you are windows Fax and Scan, then create a new fax, and then select the contacts you want to send it to.&nbsp; How do you select which fax number you want
 to send it for the recipients?&nbsp; There is no place where to select between personal and business fax number to send it to.

<p>I have purchased a new computer with Windows 7 Home Premium software. </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried installing my Lexmark X4550 Printer / Scanner software onto it without success.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It appears as Lexmark Fax, but will not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On interrogating this I have tried downloading the updated Lexmark Drivers, but get a message saying that Windows Update will not allow this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I overcome this.</div>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 hanging for 5 minutes on the &#39;Surface&#39; splash screen when the device starts</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently (within the last 2 week) my Surface Pro 3 has been hanging on the 'Surface' splash screen (black background white letters) when it turns on. It can take between 2-10 minutes for the spinning Loading wheel to appear and finally boot to windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've tried to fix it</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I have run Windows updates and downloaded the latest firmware</li><li>Utilized the reset Windows feature with a fresh install</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Both of those options have done anything to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi ebeisecker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We may need to check several factors and perform a series of troubleshooting to get to the bottom of this issue. When you see the Surface logo, does it show that an update is being installed? It's possible that an update is being installed or the device
 has not completely installed the update it recently downloaded. To solve this, force the device to shut down. While the Surface is on, press the power button for a full 10 seconds, or until the screen goes off. On the next restart, the update it may be trying
 to install will be applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend that you remove all peripheral devices connected to the Surface when you boot it up, including the Type Cover, and see if the bootup process will be faster. Let me know what you find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also clear the contents of the <strong>Prefetch </strong>folder which stores the bootup files. There could be files that are corrupted and affect the system's performance. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assuming you have reconnected the Type Cover, open the <strong>Run </strong>dialog by pressing the
<strong>Windows key </strong>+ <strong>R</strong>. You can also right-click on <strong>
Start </strong>and choose <strong>Run</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>prefetch </strong>then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>Once you have the folder up, press&nbsp;<span><strong>Ctrl</strong>&nbsp;</span>+&nbsp;<span><strong>A</strong></span>&nbsp;on your keyboard.</li><li>Press and hold&nbsp;<span><strong>Shift</strong> +&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Delete</strong></span>.</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<span><strong>Yes</strong></span>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>On the next restart, the system will recreate the files needed for the bootup process. It may take a minute or two but the succeeding restarts should be faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you need more help, please update the post. I'll be notified when you do and I'll get back to you the soonest I can so we can make sure the issue gets resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello Ruz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see any update trying to be applied when I turn on my Surface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following suggestion</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Powering off my Surface by pressing the power button for 10 seconds</li><li>Clearing the Prefetch folder contents</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Both of those didn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, removing the Typecover did appear to make the boot time faster. Is there anyway to fix this? Having to remove the type cover every time is a bit of a hassle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Du you have same firmware updated?</p>

<p>It looks like same MS wrong firmware strikes again. Tomorrow I will try to download older driver package and hope it will stick, but my guess MS will push same firmware with update again. If it works I will post here. Unfortunately I could not find way to
 stop updates from been downloaded or "Cherry pick" good ones. Also I suggest to look for system restore if it was turned on.... try rolling back to pre update state. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will probably need a audio capture program, and proper input methods to play the cassette into the computer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may even need a analog "Audio Capture" device...</p>

<p>You can use the built-in Sound Recorder to record an input audio signal and save it as a *.wma file that Windows Media Player can then burn to CDs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info about Sound Recorder, click Start, then click Help and Support.&nbsp; Type Sound Recorder into the search box in Help and support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For burning the wma files to CDs, see <a href="http://www.hootech.com/freeware/burn-wma-to-cd.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.hootech.com/freeware/burn-wma-to-cd.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need a cassette player that you can connect to the input of your computer's sound card.&nbsp; See

    <title>Pinned website on the start screen not showing up - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pinned website on the start screen not showing up</h2>
                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pinned a website to the start screen of my Windows 10 PC (Anniversary Update)&nbsp;but it is not showing up. It initially&nbsp;did appear when I&nbsp;pinned it, but when it was moved to the location I wanted it&nbsp;at, it just disappeared never to be seen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then
 I tried again to pin the website&nbsp;but that yielded&nbsp;no returns. I looked all over just incase but nothing. I was having issues with Onenote and Translator live tiles also disappearing when moving them around but since they appeared on the App List, I was able
 to repin them until they finally stuck around on the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is a known issue, but any help would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add extra pinned sites to the Start screen afterwards. I also tried checking in tablet mode but the pinned site for that particular website is no where to be seen and Edge won't let me pin the same site again. I'm&nbsp; assuming it was a glitch
 somewhere. Tried restarting and shutting down and turning the PC back on but no luck. I also tried&nbsp;switching the "show more tiles" setting on and off in the hopes that the particular pinned site tile would appear but there was no luck.

            Exactly the same thing has just happened to me, just after a long clean install and reinstall of all my software. This is infuriating. Any solutions yet?
