            Hi Graham.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible fixes for Sleep, based on ten years troubleshooting it almost daily.  If you need help performing any step just ask back:
<br />
<br />First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You might want to try Hibernate to succeed Sleep, or use Hibernate in place of Sleep - it's just a deeper sleep that actually powers off because desktop stored in RAM during sleep is written to hard drive hiberfile then powered off.  
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can definitely have Windows 10 as your operating system. Since your previous operating system is not from Windows, you will need to purchase Windows 10 from a retail store and clean install it over Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional information and steps on how to have Windows 10 on your laptop, you can refer to

            <p>Do NOT upgrade your XP machine until you are absolutely sure that you will be able to get Windows 7 drivers for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above is more difficult for a laptop because hardware can't be swapped out or added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A computer running on generic drivers, especially the video part,&nbsp;is a real dog and you will be wishing that you had left XP on it.. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The last full driver set was for Vista. You are on the edge for Windows 7, and despite claims, not everything that works for Windows 7 will work for Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check each element of your machine with the device manufacturer websites, i.e. video, sound, LAN etc
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are no official Windows 8 drivers, you may end up running on generic drivers which do not give best performance especially re video..

            <p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are unable to play bejeweled blitz on facebook with the Google chrome browser.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any change to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Did you check with Internet explorer to find out if its a browser issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue occurs only in Google chrome, I would suggest you to visit the link for better support on the issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.google.com/chrome/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.google.com/chrome/?hl=en</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue occurs in&nbsp;more than one browser then it's an issue with the game server. You would have to contact the game support.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Controller for Windows Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tangavin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Controller for Windows Issue</h2>
                    <p>So today I tried to use my controller and turns out it won't sync even after holding the pairing button with the receiver. Note that it work last time and now it doesn't. I am using Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried these following steps to fix the solution,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Reinstall the driver from device manager, "Xbox 360 Controller for Windows Version 10.0.17134.1 [4/10/2018]" and the receiver one "Xbox 360 Receiver for Windows Version 10.0.17134.1 [4/10/2018]"<br />
2. Use a USB 2.0 port instead of 3.0<br />
3. Installed Xbox 360 Accessories<br />
And it didn't fix the syncing at all. The light is still blinking....<br />
<br />
So I check what was change sort of the events that happened. I don't understand what went wrong but this showed up,<br />
</p>
<p>Device USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0291\5&amp;356b5377&amp;0&amp;3 was configured.</p>
<p>Driver Name: null</p>
<p>Class Guid: {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}</p>
<p>Driver Date:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver Version:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver Provider:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver Section:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver Rank: 0x0</p>
<p>Matching Device Id:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outranked Drivers:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device Updated: false</p>
<p>Parent Device: USB\ROOT_HUB30\4&amp;2720bdb3&amp;0&amp;0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service xusb22 for Device Instance ID USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0291\5&amp;356B5377&amp;0&amp;3 with the following status: 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Management concluded the process to install driver xusb22.inf_amd64_e41db3fe2103ee21 for Device Instance ID USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_0291\5&amp;356B5377&amp;0&amp;3 with the following status: 0x0.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm guessing there wasn't an update to the driver and therefore it is causing the syncing problem since windows doesn't recognize the ID?</p>

<p>Hello, fella.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try going back to the previous version of Windows in recovery. I mean, usually when you install something new on your pc, Windows will make a backup file with the configuration listed in for cases like yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem may come from a Windows actualization or maybe a program. So, that would make it. But, if you don´t have a recovery backup (that´s not the name, but I can´t recall) maybe try by removing the device in the device manager section, then their drivers,
 restart the pc, search for the newest drivers on the Microsoft website, and install again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be just an issue with the receiver itself.&nbsp; Microsoft hasn't made the Xbox 360 gaming receiver for years. All the ones sold as new on the web are third party knock off's made in China. Don't fooled by their deceptive packaging, they use cheap components
 and they will fail eventually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else works, either replace the receiver or switch over to the Xbox One pad.&nbsp; They can work wired, or wireless by the more standard Bluetooth method.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 April Update - Intel Graphics Driver problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 April Update - Intel Graphics Driver problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
I'm having a problem since I updated to the Windows 10 April 2018 update. When I try to open WPF applications, such as Visual Studio, I get nothing but a blank screen. This problem seems to have to do with the Windows 10 April update and the Intel HD Graphics
 drivers that are installed on my computer. The problem did not occur in version 1709 or any previous version. Visual Studio loads normally when I disable hardware acceleration in the Visual Studio settings, and other WPF apps load normally too when I disable
 hardware acceleration system-wide using a registry tweak. These applications also seem to work normally in safe mode. I also tried reinstalling, installing the latest version and installing the version from my laptop's manufacturer's website of the graphics
 driver, but nothing seems to work other than going back to version 1709 or using the registry tweak. I'm currently on version 1709 because I reverted back.<br />
<br />
Is there a way I could solve this, or should I wait for this to be solved by Microsoft or Intel?<br />
<br />
Laptop:<br />
</p><ul>
<li>HP Pavilion 15-p287nd</li><li>Intel Core i5-5200U with Intel HD Graphics 5500</li><li>Windows 10 x64 version 1709 (reverted back from 1803)</li></ul>

<p>Hello Dadof5,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your quick reply. I had a few problems while installing the driver. Trying to install the driver using the .exe returned an error.
<a href="https://imgur.com/a/h33dOFD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/a/h33dOFD</a> The error roughly translates to: "This computer doesn't meet the minimal requirements for installing the software." I think this is the case because my processor
 is not mentioned on the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be safe to install it manually via the device manager? Is there another solution?</p>

            Unfortunately many users are having similar issues with the update to 1803 I would recommend to see the following guide to return to a previous version of Windows 10<br /><br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/download-iso-older-versions-windows-10-iso-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/download-iso-o...</a><br /><br /> Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

<p>let's&nbsp;hope they'll fix it soon. Until then, I'll roll back to 1709 or keep using the registry tweak.</p>

<p>[quote]Fans of the first Darksiders are already familiar with Vigil’s fiction – the eternal war that rages between the forces of Heaven and Hell. With Darksiders II, Vigil looks to deliver a richer experience as players&nbsp; explore more dungeons, talk with
 a variety of NPCs, and experiment with a detailed loot system. The horseman War has been sidelined, so it’s up to his brother, Death, to travel through the world of the Abyss and attempt to restore humanity after its destruction during the Apocalypse.[/quote]</p>

<p>The original was quite good, I dont get why people ignored it. Takes about 20 hours from start to finish, longer if you want to 100% it. I always recommend it.</p>
<p><br />
It had all of the essential elements to make it a great game, my only complaints were that they could have spent a bit more time polishing up the combat system with new finishers (they get old), tweak the weapon experience gain. That's it.</p>
<p><br />
Mechanically it was really good and combined with its visual presentation from Joe Madureira (X-Men, Battle Chasers) it was something pretty unique.</p>
<p><br />
This may be a Day 1 for me considering I got the original game on sale @ BestBuy for 9.99 one weekend last year.</p>

<h2>            lost power during refresh on a Win 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>After I found the refresh did not complete, I see the message, "Install was not successful, restart to continue", or something like that.&nbsp; When I restart it goes back to same menu.&nbsp; Some other events occurred, however I do not have those details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I created a Win 10 Media Creation Tool on a Flash drive and now when I turn on the PC, it goes to boot mgr, I select USB boot, and while I see the flash drive being accessed, it loops back to boot mgr.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to a corrupted Windows installation file. For us to efficiently assist you, could you tell us if you have tried to plug the USB drive into a different USB port?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For isolation purposes, we suggest that you try using a different USB drive to create Windows 10 installation media on another computer.</p>

    <title>How do I stop persistent Windows 10 File Backup -- it is not turned on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gwen101  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop persistent Windows 10 File Backup -- it is not turned on</h2>
                    <p>Windows backup has continually failed since the November Windows 10 upgrade, and in the process, used a terabyte of space for the corrupted files. &nbsp;Therefore, after multiple attempts to solve the problem, I deleted them and turned off Windows backup and
 used another program instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, despite that it was turned off, win10 started giving me pop messages saying my backup drive was disconnected -- it was not. I could not find a way to stop the the pop ups, so I relented and ran windows backup manually, hoping it would leave me alone
 afterwards. Now, although the files are there taking up a lot of space in the backup drive, Windows is still giving the same pop-ups, but, worse, despite that backups are not scheduled, it is now telling me they will be saved to my hard drive until my backup
 drive is connected (but it is connected -- I can copy to it easily, and so can other programs) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this strange error, which <em>it</em> only <em>perceives</em> as an error, It's wearing out my SSD! (not the hard drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I prevent this? I just want it to stop running! Aside from not scheduling it, what can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I need my password please for my Account Email removed for privacy</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi, my e-mail account {removed email address} is currently locked. I have no idea why this happenned. It has always been
 my primary e-mail and I never had a problem signing in with that account.<br />
<br />
However, (since yesterday) when I tried to sign in as usual, it said "You've tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect e-mail address or password." I also had the same problem when trying to log on to Windows Live Messenger, which told me my ID/password
 was wrong as well.<br />
<br />
I am absolutely sure that I entered the correct e-mail address and password. I've been using this e-mail daily without any problem for years. Moreover, even if I really typed my password incorrectly for the first time, it would not be possible that I've "tried
 to sign in too many times with an incorrect e-mail address or password."<br />
<br />
I firstly thought that my account {removed email address} might be hacked and my password was changed, so I tried recover my password by sending a password reset request to my alternate e-mail which is this e-mail {removed email address} (the e-mail I'm using
 to type this letter right now). It was done. I've got the password reset form for my primary e-mail {removed email address}.<br />
<br />
I changed the password, and it confirmed that the password reset was completed. I then tried to sign in to my e-mail with the new password, but it did't work. It still says "You've tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect e-mail address or password."
 I also tried signing in with the old password and it didn't work as well. I sent the password reset request to my alternate e-mail again, changed my password again, and it still doesn't work until now.<br />
<br />
My e-mail {removed email address} is really important to me. It is my primary e-mail. I am really urgent and really need help about this. Please help recover this e-mail for me or reply me with some advices to this e-mail (alternate e-mail) {removed email address}.
 I sincerely thank you in advance for your feedback</span></p>

 to type this letter right now). It was done. I've got the password reset form for my primary e-mail {removed email address}.<br />
<br />
I changed the password, and it confirmed that the password reset was completed. I then tried to sign in to my e-mail with the new password, but it did't work. It still says "You've tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect e-mail address or password."
 I also tried signing in with the old password and it didn't work as well. I sent the password reset request to my alternate e-mail again, changed my password again, and it still doesn't work until now.<br />
<br />
My e-mail {removed email address} is really important to me. It is my primary e-mail. I am really urgent and really need help about this. Please help recover this e-mail for me or reply me with some advices to this e-mail (alternate e-mail) {removed email address}.
 I sincerely thank you in advance for your feedback</span></p>

<p><span>Hi, my e-mail account{*** Email address is removed for privacy ***} is currently locked. I have no idea
 why this happenned. It has always been my primary e-mail and I never had a problem signing in with that account.<br />
<br />
However, (since yesterday) when I tried to sign in as usual, it said "You've tried to sign in too many times with an incorrect e-mail address or password." I also had the same problem when trying to log on to Windows Live Messenger, which told me my ID/password
 was wrong as well.<br />
<br />
I am absolutely sure that I entered the correct e-mail address and password. I've been using this e-mail daily without any problem for years. Moreover, even if I really typed my password incorrectly for the first time, it would not be possible that I've "tried
 to sign in too many times with an incorrect e-mail address or password."<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 &#38; Steam Gaming - most games broke</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro (64 bit), the following Steam games will no longer launch:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rocketleague (d3d9.dll missing)</p>
<p>Left 4 Dead 2 </p>
<p>Bastion</p>
<p>Borderlands 2 </p>
<p>Don't Starve </p>
<p>Gimbal</p>
<p>Terraria</p>
<p>Starbound (access violation detected at 0xeb314d3e, Runtime Error!, and Stack Trace errors with Direct3DCreate9Ex)&nbsp; OpenGL works!</p>
<p>Dishonored&nbsp; (filename not found d3d9.dll, kernel32.dll, ntdll.dll, and gameoverlayrenderer.dll))
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed the most recent AMD drivers for Radeon 7850's (Catalyst 15.7.1, 64-bit), installed numerous direct x files, and I'm honestly about ready to downgrade to Windows 7.&nbsp; Not to mention the Realtek 5.1 channel sound issues.... I haven't had this
 many difficulties with a Windows release since ME.&nbsp; What the hell..... </p>

<p>
</p><p>If you recall when you download a game, it also includes all of the dependencies for that game to work. Uninstall the game, reinstall the game, and then do a reboot for good measure. Try the game, and see if you still experience the trouble. It's possible
 that some of the games dependencies were lost in the switch between operating systems, and/or replaced with "newer" versions, such as directx and etc...</p>

            When I upgraded from Win7 to 8.1, I found a lot of older games in Steam wouldn't run until I pulled up the properties for that game in Steam, then went to game files and selected the option to verify the game files integrity. At which point and in every
 case, it would re-download a large chunk of the games files. Give that a try.

<p>Already did on a few, like Left 4 Dead 2, Terraria, and others.... no change. &nbsp;Starbound worked in OpenGL, Saints Row 3 worked in DX10/11 mode, but not DX9 (the launcher lets you choose which to run it in). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I since figured out how to get rid of those IIS accounts (had to delete the profiles under the Users folder) and rolled back successfully to Windows 7. &nbsp;All games are launching again as expected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to wait a few weeks (or longer), or keep an eye out for others with this issue, for updates.&nbsp;</p>

            The only other thing I can think of is to create a shortcut to the game executable and try it in Win7 compatibility mode and also run as admin. That's even if Win10 has compatibility mode. Win8.1 does so I'm betting Win10 does. This would be similar to
 WinXP apps having trouble running in Win7 without compatibility mode enabled.

<p>It does have compatibility mode. Tried both Win 7 and 8, as well as running as administrator. I even went as far as trying to re-register the file d3d9.dll (and got an odd error).&nbsp;</p>

    <title>LinkedIn on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LinkedIn on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I'm having all kinds of problems with LinkedIn on my Windows 8 desktop, but the LinkedIn works fine on my Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; There has to be some sort of issue between LinkedIn and Windows 8.&nbsp; I have been back and forth with LinkedIn tech support and they
 have been unable to help.&nbsp; Anybody else having the same problems, or aware of a solution?&nbsp; Two of the specific issues that I have encountered are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; When I hit "Network" then "Contacts" on Windows 7 I get a list of my contacts, but on Windows 8 I get a blank page that says contacts at the top.&nbsp; I can't get a list of my contacts on the Windows 8 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; When I open the profile of someone else, and click on the blue number of their connections, I get a listing of their connections on the Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; Nothing happens on the Windows 8 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sure that there are other issues, but this is what I have noticed so far.&nbsp; Any solutions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<li>Open IE and click Tools &gt; Internet Options</li><li>On the Advanced tab, click the bottom Reset... button.</li></ul>

</p>
<p>Also if you haven't already done so, get the update to Windows 8.1 (free update in the Store app) which fixes a TON of problems.</p>

<h2>            Slow Twitter with Windows 10</h2>
                    I have noticed that when I type in a Twitter post, and I have gotten to Twitter using the new Edge, the typing is very slowed and sometimes actually stalls. Posting on Twitter via Chrome has no such slowing. Is this possibly because with Windows 10 they
 are collecting everything you post?&nbsp;

    <title>Can&#39;t activate XP Repair, installation ID doesn&#39;t work on the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ewool  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t activate XP Repair, installation ID doesn&#39;t work on the phone</h2>
                    Hi All, I recently had to run a repair of Windows XP Home because of a driver problem, and finally was able to get back to the start up screen and try to log-in, but it won't let me log-in without activating (I assume some confusion because it's been installed
 on my computer for more than 30 days, but the repair made me have to reactivate). &nbsp;So I tried booting in Safe Mode, and was able to log in there in the version without networking. &nbsp;Unfortunately, when I try to activate by phone (no network connection, the
 ethernet driver failing was the cause of all this to start), the automated thing won't take the installation ID that shows up in the activation page. &nbsp;I know I have a valid product key and the original disk, as I used it a year ago to re-install on a new hard
 drive, but I have no way of actually inputting the product key! &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any guesses on how I can try to work around this to get on long enough to activate online (I can use a USB wireless stick, but the computer needs to be started up for it to establish the connection), or why the crazy long installation ID doesn't work?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks very much,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Eric</div>

It would be best if you visited <a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/1464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the kaspersky website here</a> and used their instructions to completly remove their software. Trying to uninstall using add or remove programs sometimes will not work for things as
 complex as anti-virus software.<br />

<h3> brothahill666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue Screening Daily</h2>
                    <p>I have had my computer for almost a year now.&nbsp; During that time, I may have experienced the blue screen once or twice.&nbsp; As such, I did not find cause for concern just yet.&nbsp; However, after applying the free upgrade to Windows 10, I began to experience one
 or two blue screen per day.&nbsp; After about a week, it began to occur even more frequently.&nbsp; Uncertain as to the cause, but with the only major change being the upgrade to Windows 10, I backed-up files which I wanted to keep and performed a clean install of Windows
 7 Home Premium (64-bit) which I had been using prior to the upgrade and had&nbsp;been pretty much a flawless operating system.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the blue screen issues persist as a daily occurrence.&nbsp; These blue screens can be, but are not always the same.&nbsp; Thus far,
 I have seen the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) driver_irql_not_less_or_equal</p>
<p>2) pfn_list_corrupt</p>
<p>3) page_fault_in_nonpaged_area</p>
<p>4) memory management</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran chkdsk multiple times to test if it was a hard drive issue.&nbsp; I have also ran the memory diagnostic multiple times.&nbsp; Neither have ever found errors.&nbsp; My computer specs are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit)</p>
<p>Intel i5-4670 3.40 GHz</p>
<p>MSI GeForce GTX 770</p>

            I'm not over-clocking anything.&nbsp; So that isn't an issue.&nbsp; As for the two tests, I've downloaded Memtest86+, but have not attempted it yet.&nbsp; Driver verifier, however, is proving problematic.&nbsp; I've gone through the steps provided in the wiki and everything
 seems to be running properly.&nbsp; The issue is that my computer freezes before it blue screens again.&nbsp; The mouse cursor stops and keyboard loses all functionality, forcing me to restart the computer.&nbsp; I've tried this off and on for about 6 hours and this is the
 result each time.&nbsp;

            <p>1) I uninstalled Intel Smart Connect Technology (ISCT)&nbsp;and then attempted to reinstall from the motherboard drive and utilities installation disk.&nbsp; Each time that I attempt the reinstallation, it appears to complete and then says to reboot the system.&nbsp; When
 I look through the installed programs list in control panel, it isn't listed.&nbsp; When I load the motherboard installation disk again, ISCT is listed as uninstalled.&nbsp; Is this a necessary program?&nbsp; If so, do you know how I can get it to install again?&nbsp; Also, the

    <title>Problem typing window switches - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisingram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem typing window switches</h2>
                    I have a problem, when I am typing in some windows programs - the window will continually switch off from the active window, consequently interrupting my text, and forcing me to click back in the window to start typing again.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems to happen all the time in word and when typing in adobe software too and has become extremely frustrating and detrimental to my productivity. I am using a new laptop with corei7 so nothing to do with processing performance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried updating the keyboard drivers which are up to date. Any ideas on what might be causing this problem?

<p>Hi Marilyn:&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped having that error message when Avast and Hotmail were not active at the same time. I'm wondering if the mail scanner in Avast when its functioning might not like it when I'm inside Hotmail, especially when I'm attempting to send an
 e-mail to someone.&nbsp; Thanks, ---- Wordsmith 2009</p>
