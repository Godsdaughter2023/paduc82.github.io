<h2>            crysis 1 Had No problems Black screen now.</h2>
                    <p>I have seen a lot of anwsers to questions stating that crysis 1 gave crashes to black screens on different o.ses I had windows 98 XP and Vista and my copy of crysis 1 never gave me a problem unless I used too much resouluton that my graphics card could not
 handle.So its fustrating to know that it seems that people that anwser dont see that this may have some thing to do with the fact that in the crysis 1 file that list the operating systems to start up to will not have windows 7 or some of the newer graphic
 cards. I do however try to run in direct 9 mode and with windows compatatbility for xp service pack 2 and 3&nbsp; becaused I liked X.P more. I would get a stopped responding and a D3d10 .dll fault&nbsp; as if I was running in vista. Now i know windows 7 is direct 11
 my video card is a direct 10 and my motherboard is rated to opporate windows 8 could&nbsp; this be a problem or does every thing has to be for direct x 11., or can you see something wrong with this system.please someone help.</p>

            OK - I quote your newer thread so I can read all the information on one page - Do stick with one thread on a single topic in future. It avoids confusion and repeat suggestions.<br />
<br />
 only one that says it works in 32 bit, All others, say they can get it to work in ultimate 64 bit, why is this. Im using windows 7 professional 32 bit. Oh, also instead of using&nbsp; I.D.E im using A.C.H.I sata set up.in my bios could this have something to do
 with it. as im not running in parrellel but in serial.data flow."<br />
<br />
</span>Nothing to do with AHCI<span style="font-style: italic">,&nbsp;</span> 32 vs 64 bit, or your motherboard being Win8 compatible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Compatibility mode does not make Win7 run like XP.&nbsp; Also, it's not up to you to determine what<br />
is a suitable compatibility setting via your bias towards XP.&nbsp; Use what works.<br />
One odd thing with this game is it will run in 32bit mode with no compatibility setting, but requires compatibility when using the 64bit .exe - I'm using Vista sp2 with the 64bit&nbsp; .exe.<br />
<br />
<br />
The game settings you choose are what determines if the game uses DX 10 not the OS.<br />
Some of the <span style="font-style: italic">Very High</span> settings are DX 10. When the gpu is not DX10 capable these options would
<br />
not be available. <br />
That Vista was first to use DX10 and Win7 is first to use DX11 does not mean they don't also use<br />
DX9. Check your System 32 folder and you will see many d3dx9&nbsp; files.<br />
Monopoly$oft seems to think that it is good marketing to just advertise the DX10 -11 concept with<br />
Vista and Win7. A confusing marketing concept.<br />
<br />
With that cleared up - Tell us exactly what is or is not happening.<br />
eg - Crashes to black screen when ? When loading or while playing ?<br />
Is this the only game with problems ?<br />
Are you still using the same settings as when you played the game on XP or have you tried<br />
using higher settings ? <br />
- Have you installed all the 'Important' Windows Updates. There are several<br />
gaming related updates in addition to sp1 which is a must have.<br />
- Have you installed recent graphics and audio drivers ?<br />

<p>Seeing as this has a 37 minute and a 1:07 minute option to watch, it's probably the way the site is developed,</p>

<p>I saw a youtube listing, have you tried to watch anything there ?</p>
<p>I'd add that silverlight is a new and I feel bazaar application,</p>
<p>If you pause the video it also stops the download or streaming, this is a very strange thing to happen compared to any other application known, but since micromanagement designed it, I'm not surprised it's a flawed application,</p>

<h2>            Failure to complete debugging &#39;Runtime Error&#39; after receiving a Just-In-Time Debugging pop-up</h2>
                    
<p><span>I apologize for the length of this message. I’m not at all tech savvy, and I don’t know what information relating to my problem is important for you to have and what is superfluous.
 So, I’ve tried to include everything. But, I’ve tried to organize it so you can find the important information fairly quickly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>A Summary of My Problem:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve been having a problem with my computer, a Dell XPS 400, since about April 13, 2010. (My operating system is Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Edition Version 2002 with
 Service Pack 3.) I believe the problem started shortly after I installed an automatic Jscript or Java Script update. The problem is that I receive notice of a Script error but the debugging procedure that’s provided doesn’t finish the debugging process. To
 be more specific, I receive a pop-up entitled “Just-In-Time Debugging” with the message, “An exception ‘Runtime Error’ has occurred in Script”. When I follow the directions to debug, I’m taken through a series of windows and dialog boxes. But, the debugging
 process doesn’t finish. Instead, the following message appears: “msxml3.dll: The system cannot locate the resource specified”.—(A much more detailed description of the debugging procedure I’ve followed is provided later under the section entitled, “A Detailed
 Description of the Debugging Procedure I’ve Followed When the Just-In-Time Debugging Pop-up Appears”. It includes the code that’s displayed when the debugging procedure stops and the message, “msxml3.dll: The system cannot locate the resource specified”, appears.)—The
 JIT Debugging pop-up only appears under my logon. It does not appear under my wife’s logon. We are both listed as “computer administrator” under “User Accounts”. The JIT Debugging pop-up usually appears when I log in, but not always. (Specifically, it usually
 appears during the startup of Skype.) It has also appeared a few times while visiting websites. And, it appeared once when McAfee Virtual Technician, (MVT), was being installed and once when MVT was being initialized. (MVT then reported an error: “Microsoft
 JScript runtime error ‘800a01a8’; Object required; /mvt/DownloadIndex.asp,line 60”.) The JIT Debugging pop-up appears even though “Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)” and “Disable script debugging (Other)” are both checked/ selected under Internet
 Explorer &gt; Tools &gt; Internet Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Browsing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>What I’ve Done So Far to Try to Resolve the Problem:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My first step was to contact Dell Technical Support by phone. The Technician who worked with me ran a diagnostic check by having me push the F12 button when the “Dell” logo
 appeared after I restarted my computer. He said the problem (or bug) was in the operating system,(OS), and that the problem could be fixed by removing the existing OS and then installing a clean version of my OS. He suggested that it would be easier to do
 this if I had an external hard drive (which I didn’t have). So, I ordered one. While I was waiting for my external hard drive to arrive, I received some updates from either Microsoft or McAfee or both. For about a day and a half after receiving the updates,
 the JIT debugging problem went away. But, then it returned. I called Dell Technical Support again and told the Technician I was assigned about these recent developments. He checked with McAfee and said McAfee was aware of my problem and was working on it and
 that I should contact McAfee. I called the McAfee phone number I was given and was directed to a website, “security.mcafee.com”. From that site, I installed and ran McAfee Virtual Technician and it identified one problem, “DAT out of date”.—(As I stated earlier,
 during the installation of MVT, the Just-In-Time Debugging pop-up appeared. The debugging procedure would not complete. So, I closed the JIT Debugging pop-up.)—The MVT then led me through the fix for the “DAT out of date” problem which included the removal
 and reinstallation of McAfee Security Center. After this fix was completed, I used the MVT to scan my system again. MVT then found another problem. This was the error I mentioned in the previous section, the one that was reported as “Microsoft Jscript runtime
 error ‘800a01a8’; Object required; /mvt/DownloadIndex.asp,line 60”. I then had an online chat session with a McAfee Support Technician about that error message and the JIT Debugging problem. He did a remote check of my computer and concluded “Right now I can
 see that your McAfee is up to date and [your] computer is fully protected. At this point I can say this issue is not related with McAfee. Your system files (Jscript) are corrupted, at this point I would suggest you contact Microsoft and correct Jscript and
 system files and check this issue, is that okay?” I then read through the help section for My Computer and tried using System Restore, but it didn’t work. It wouldn’t go back to the McAfee Security Center version present at the restore point. (I think this
 was due to a registry problem.) I then did a search at Microsoft Answers for “Just-In-Time Debugging” and read through the results. I also read through the Internet Explorer help section, “What should you do about Internet Explorer script errors?” under “Handling
 Errors”. I then checked my “Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)” and “Disable script debugging (Other)” settings and, as I mentioned in the previous section, I found they were both checked/ selected. And lastly, I’ve now contacted you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>What I’m Hoping You Can Tell Me:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What’s going on.</span>—What is wrong with our computer? That is, what is causing it to perform this way? And, why is this problem only affecting our computer under my logon?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to fix this problem</span>.—For example, do I need to remove and reinstall my OS as the Dell Support Technician suggested? Or, do I merely need to supply some missing resource as is suggested by the message, “msxml3.dll:
 The system, cannot locate the resource specified”? (And, if so, how is this done?) Or, do I need to correct some corrupted files as the McAfee Support Technician suggested? (And, if so, how is this done?) Or, should some other remedy be applied?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What created this problem.</span>—Where did the problem come from?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to avoid this problem in the future.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How serious a problem this is.</span> That is, what consequences could result if this problem continues, and how significant is this?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>6)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If there are any special precautions I should take while this problem exists.</span>—For example, if the problem is basically due to spyware, should I avoid typing/ entering any sensitive personal information on my keyboard
 such as my name, Social Security Number, or bank account number even while on secured sites? Or, should I avoid installing any further updates until the problem is fixed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>7)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">What a proposed fix does.</span>—I would greatly appreciate a general explanation of any fix you recommend. For example, is the proposed fix one where the computer is simply adjusted to ignore or not check for insignificant
 Script errors? Or, is it one that removes malware or repairs a major flaw that could cause a system crash?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>A Detailed Description of the Debugging Procedure I’ve Followed When the Just-In-Time Debugging Pop-up Appears:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In the JIT Debugging pop-up, just below the error message, “An exception ‘Runtime Error’ has occurred in Script”, there is a list of possible debuggers. Only one debugger
 is listed. It is “New instance of Microsoft Script Editor”. Below the list of possible debuggers is a blank check box and next to the check box is an option: “Set the currently selected debugger as the default”. The last things in this pop-up are below the
 check box and option just mentioned. They are the question “Do you want to debug using the selected debugger?” and a “yes” and a “no” box/ button. When the “yes” option is selected, the JIT Debugging pop-up disappears and a new window partially opens that
 is entitled “Microsoft Script Editor [design]” and, within this window, a modal dialog box opens simultaneously. It is entitled “Step Into Remote Procedure Call”. Underneath the title of this dialog box is “Process”. The current process listed or named is
 “[2112]C:\Program Files\Dell Support Center\bin\sprtcmd.exe”. (Yesterday, the number in the process name was “3032” instead of “2112”. And, before that it was “3700”.) Below this in the dialog box is “Choose the program types that you want to debug:”. Below
 this in the dialog box is a small box with a check in it, and next to this checked box “Script” is shown. Below this in the dialog box is “The following programs will be debugged:” and “Script” is shown as the selected program. When “OK” is selected at the
 side of this dialog box, both the dialog box and the window it’s in disappear and a new, fully opened window appears that’s entitled “Miscellaneous Files - Microsoft Script Editor [break] — VBScript — script block”. Below this title, there are a couple of
 toolbars, and yesterday, below the toolbars was “<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">P</span>rogram [3032] sprtcmd.exe: Script program
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">T</span>hread [1364] Thread 554”. (I didn’t check that line for changes today.) Below this is a large box with the title, “VBScript – script block”. The large box contains a bunch of computer code. (This computer code
 is provided below at the end of this section. This code has remained the same for both the “2112” and “3032” process&nbsp;numbers and perhaps also for the “3700” process number.) A modal dialog box opens simultaneously within this window and is entitled “Microsoft
 Visual Studio Debugger”. A yellow triangle with an exclamation mark is displayed within this dialog box, and next to this symbol is the message: “msxml3.dll: The system cannot locate the resource specified”. Underneath this message within the dialog box are
 the option boxes, “Break”, “Continue”, “Ignore”, and “Help”. Selecting the “Continue” option changes the message in the dialog box to “msxml3.dll: Unspecified error”. Selecting “Break” afterwards makes the dialog box disappear, but nothing further then happens.
 Clicking the exit symbol, (the red square with the white “x” in the top right hand corner), of the remaining window, (the one with all the code in it), causes a new dialog box to open within the window with all the code in it. This new dialog box is entitled
 “Microsoft Script Editor”. It asks the question, “Do you want to stop debugging?”. If “no” is selected, the new dialog box disappears and nothing else happens. (The only window then displayed is the one with all the code.) If “yes” is selected, both the dialog
 box and the code containing window disappear, and I’m returned to the original “Just-In-Time Debugging” pop-up. Clicking on the exit button of this pop-up makes it go away. But, it returns later, usually the next time I log on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The computer code that’s displayed in the window entitled “Miscellaneous Files - Microsoft Script Editor [break] – VBScript - script block” is presented below. There was a
 yellow arrow next to one line of code that was not reproduced when I copied and pasted the code. So, I represented this missing arrow with a “►” symbol.</span></p>

<p><span>The above description applies to all instances/ appearances of the JIT Debugging pop-up except for those instances that occurred during the installation or initialization
 of McAfee Virtual Technician. The only differences then were that the process named in the “Step Into Remote Procedure Call” dialog box was “[1148]C:\Program Files\McAfee\Supportability\MVT\MvtApp.exe” and that the code was different in the “Miscellaneous
 Files — Microsoft Script Editor [break} — VBScript — script block” window and that the “Microsoft Visual Studio Debugger” dialog box within the just named code containing window had a different message. That message was “Microsoft VBScript runtime error: Active
 X component can’t create object: ‘McContentManager.McContentTransfer’” (I haven’t presented the computer code that was associated with these exceptions because I wasn’t able to reproduce and copy it.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Other Problems that Have Occurred Since April 13th that May or May Not Be Related to the JIT Debugging Problem:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Trusted Sites List problems:</span> Whenever the McAfee Virtual Technician is installed or initialized from the site, “security.mcafee.com”, three sites are automatically added to my Trusted Sites List. They are “about:internet”,
 “<span>http://*.mcafee.com</span>”, and “<span>https://*.mcafee.com</span>”. The presence of
 “about:internet” on my Trusted Sites List causes a pop-up window to appear that otherwise never appears when visiting several sites I frequently visit. (It also seems to slow down my computer considerably.) The pop-up is entitled “Security Warning”, and the
 message is “The current Web page is trying to open a site in your Trusted Sites List. Do you want to allow this?” Below this message are the following: the current site, (for example, “<a href="http://barefootted.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://barefootted.com</span></a>”),
 “Trusted site: res://ieframe.dll”, a “yes” and a “no” button/ box, and a warning, “Warning: allowing this can expose your computer to security risks. If you don’t trust the current Web page, choose No”. (There is a yellow Microsoft shield symbol with an exclamation
 point in it that is next to this warning.) I have always selected the “No” option. Removing “about:internet” from my Trusted Sites List makes this security warning pop-up no longer appear when the same sites are visited later. (Its removal also returns my
 computer to its normal speed.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">“DAT out of date” problems:</span> The MVT twice found and corrected “DAT out of date” problems. Currently, MVT is not finding any new “DAT out of date” problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problems running the MVT when it’s opened from my desktop icon:</span> The MVT seems to work fine and currently finds no problems when it is opened from the site, “security.mcafee.com”. However, when I open McAfee Security
 Center from my desktop icon and then, from there, open the MVT and try to run it, it doesn’t proceed through the normal scanning process but instead immediately displays the error message, “Microsoft JScript runtime error ‘800a01a8’; Object required; /mvt/DownloadIndex.asp,line
 60”. (Could the appearance of the JIT Debugging pop-up during the installation of MVT have something to do with this problem?)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem with Windows Media Player Database:</span> I received a pop-up entitled “Windows Media Player Database Corrupted” once. The message in the pop-up was “The library database is corrupted. The problem does not affect
 your digital media files or the ability of Windows Media Player to play the files. When you exit and restart the Player, a new database will be created after which you can add your files to the library again.” Below this message were “Click OK to exit the
 Player” and an “OK” button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While my main concern is the&nbsp;failure to debug the&nbsp;runtime/ Script&nbsp;error, (i.e., the JIT Debugging problem), if you have any insights into these other problems, I’d appreciate
 your comments on them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>I'm sorry but that was way too long. You need to address one item at a time. To solve the JIT Debugger popping up:</p>
<p>Control Panel&gt;Internet Options&gt;Advanced. Put a checkmark in "Disable Script Debugging (Internet Explorer)" and "Disable Script Debugging (Others)". Apply/OK out.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't take care of the issue, in the Debugger itself:<br />
<br />
1. Use the Tools menu and click Options.<br />
2. In the Options dialog box, select the Debugging folder.<br />
3. In the Debugging folder, select the Just-In-Time page.<br />
4. In the "Enable Just-In-Time debugging of these types of code" box, clear the boxes next to Managed, Native, and Script*. Click OK.<br />
<br />
*On a client's computer with this problem I wasn't able to clear one of those items (don't remember which) but clearing the other two boxes took care of the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Malkeleah,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>The first remedy you suggested doesn't work. Script debugging has been disabled throughout the course of this problem for&nbsp;both&nbsp;"Internet Explorer" and "Other".</p>
<p>I have two concerns regarding the second remedy:</p>
<p>1) The options I have don't seem to correspond fully with the ones you described. The Debugging folder contents are different. The path I followed was: Microsoft Office Word &gt; Tools &gt; Macro &gt; Microsoft Script Editor &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Debugging. But, when
 the Debugging folder was opened, there was no Just-In-Time page. Instead, the contents were "General", "Edit and Continue", and "Native". There was nothing whatsoever&nbsp;about Just-In-Time Debugging under either "Edit and Continue" or "Native". However, under
 "General", there was a button entitled "JIT Settings...". When I clicked on that button, a "JIT Debugging Settings" dialog box opened. Within this dialog box there was a check box style option to enable JIT debugging for Script. That option was checked. I
 didn't try unchecking it because I didn't know if I was in the right place or if the consequences would be what you intended.</p>
<p>2) Can disabling JIT Debugging cause problems?</p>
<p>I'll contact McAfee about the McAfee problems.</p>
<p>I hope you can advise me regarding my two concerns about the second remedy.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Noel,</p>
<p>I did as you suggested. But, I'll have to wait until tomorrow to check the results. Currently, the JIT Debugging pop-up is only showing up once per day during my initial login. By the way, in going directly from re-enabling script debugging to restarting/
 rebooting to disabling script debugging, I encountered three&nbsp;script/ runtime error messages. It that unusual or a bad sign?</p>

<div>Not at all unusual - especially if you're running with a web page as </div>

<div>Most active web pages will trigger a JIT error - that's why the setting is </div>

<p>Noel,</p>
<p>That's a relief. Once script debugging was again disabled, the non-JIT Debugging pop-ups stopped showing up. However, the JIT Debugging pop-up showed up again this morning during my initial login. So, while the procedure you suggested was certainly worth
 a try, it didn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>What should I try as a next step?</p>
<p>Also, what do you think of the idea of changing the JIT Debugging setting in Microsoft Script Editor so that it's disabled? (Currently, it's enabled.) Is the JIT Debugging function an important one,&nbsp;(for example,&nbsp;stepping in at the last moment and stopping
 a major problem from happening). Or, is it instead just a tool for developers to use to find and correct minor, non-critical programming flaws? Please forgive me if I'm asking a very rudimentary question. When it comes to computers, I'm a babe in the woods.
 Before I try this option, I'd like to have some assurance that doing so wouldn't be curing a symptom and leaving behind a serious problem to worsen. To draw an analogy, I don't want to give a&nbsp;coughing patient with lung cancer cough syrup as the remedy for
 the problem.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions that are related to my JIT Debugging problem that aren't fix-it problems:</p>
<p>1) Is it safe to enter sensitive/ personal information (such as a debit card number) on secure sites while I'm having my current problems? I'd like to order&nbsp;a few things&nbsp;online but have held off on doing so because of my uncertainty on this issue. (I've
 subscibed to McAfee's security services since I first got my computer. I just used the "Scan" function in my McAfee Security Center to do a full scan of&nbsp;my computer, and nothing was found. But, could my current problem be due to some missed malware?)</p>
<p>2) While I'm having the JIT Debugging problem, is it OK to install new programs, for example, one that allows digital photos from a newly purchased camera to be downloaded or one that's used to back-up computer files to a new external hard drive? Or, would
 there likely be problems with the&nbsp;installation?</p>

<div>"what do you think of the idea of changing the JIT Debugging setting in </div>
<div>Microsoft Script Editor so that it's disabled? (Currently, it's enabled.)"</div>
<div>The question is - why is it enabled? It may be a function of MS Script </div>
<div>editor (I wouldn't know - I've never used it)</div>
<div>Generally the debuggers only give useful information to developers - the </div>
<div>rest of us can stare at the results for weeks without making any sense at </div>
<div>all :)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The problems you're having are, I suspect partly because you have the Script
<div>Editor up and running - simply don't use it, or better uninstall it, if you </div>
<div>aren't actually doing anything productive with it. </div>
<div>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa189846%28office.10%29.aspx</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I doubt very much that your debugging problems will have any effect on the </div>
<div>system itself - I'm pretty sure it's just a setting gone agley.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Download, update and run MalwareBytes Anti-Malware from </div>
<div>www.malwarebytes.org - see if that finds anything.</div>
<div>If not, then you're probably good to go WRT secure sites and installing </div>

<p>Hi Noel,</p>
<p>Thanks for once again responding. Sorry for my delay in getting back to you. I was goofing off outside in the beautiful weather this weekend.</p>
<p>I tried disabling JIT Debugging in Microsoft Script Editor for about 1 minute, and things got really slow on Internet Explorer. So, I re-enabled it, and IE sped back up to normal. I have no idea why this is the case. But, it does appear that having&nbsp;JIT Debugging&nbsp;enabled
 in MSE serves some beneficial function.</p>
<p>I had an online chat with a McAfee Support Tech about using MalwareBytes Anti-Malware and was told that it would interfere with McAfee. So, I'm reluctant to give it a try.</p>
<p>I did read some more about runtime errors, debugging, and&nbsp;debuggers, and I think your assessment is correct. My problem is caused by my computer's settings or files and not malware.</p>
<p>Assuming my problem is caused by corrupt files (e.g. JScript), do you have any recommendations for a fix?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is with all the minecraft clones? have seen another minecraft clone, including this one. I think the other one is called forgecraft: Miner (Not to sure if this is the actually name). Now there are exactly two minecraft clones out there. To me, it seems
 like there is a who can make a better minecraft game contest going on here? Even though i did not play minecraft, i am going to have to say that the the real minecraft is probably better than any of these minecraft clones. I could be wrong though. Anyways,
 I actually would also like to know what is different about this.</p>

<h2>            Delete files with long file names without having them go to Recycle Bin</h2>
                    Running Win7 X64. I recently installed Seagate Dashboard backup software. After some slow loading problems, it is now working properly. Somehow, I created 3 different full back up files on my external drive. I tried to delete two of these (around 150GBs
 each) without success. Windows says the file names are too long for the Recycle Bin to handle. Is there anyway to delete these (preferably the folder that holds them) by bypassing the recycle bin? Thanks for your help.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows uses a naming convention called Long Filenames (LFN). The LFN system supports file names up to 255 characters.
<span>You might get an error when copying or deleting a file with a very long file name if the location where you'll be moving the file has a longer path than the file's original location, for an instance, the Recycle Bin.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to delete a filename that is too long, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer </strong>and navigate to the directory where your files are located.
</li><li>Press and hold <strong>Shift</strong>, then right-click on an empty area. Choose<strong> Open command window here</strong>. A Command Prompt window will open, focused on the directory you’re in.</li><li>Enter the following command in the Command Prompt window: <strong>DIR /X</strong></li><li>If the directory contains more files than can be displayed on a single screen, use the command
<strong>DIR /X /P</strong> instead, so that it will pause at every screen length so you can examine the file list. This command will list all the directories and files in the current directory, and it will also list the old 8.3 filename for all the files and
 directories. (<em>An 8.3 filename is a filename convention used as an alternate filename to the long filename for compatibility with legacy programs.</em>)</li><li>Issue a <strong>DEL</strong> command for the file: <strong>DEL FILENAME.TXT</strong><br />
(<em>Replace <strong>FILENAME.TXT</strong>&nbsp; with the name of the file you want to delete.</em>)</li><li>Windows will delete the file without complaint. You can run <strong>DIR /X</strong> again to check the directory in Window Explorer.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>
<p>

<p>Go to File Explorer, locate and select the files/folders, hold down the shift key and hit the Delete key. That removes them completely and they do not go into the recycle bin.</p>

<p>I suggest you remove all wireless connections from your computer (after writing down the proper settings if the ones there actually are proper) and start over from scratch&nbsp;setting up the&nbsp;wireless connection and the network connections as well.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then I would contact your ISP and explan the situation and request their assistance.&nbsp; I've done so myself many times and they've been very helpful and usually resolved the problem (unless it was something on their servers or on the
 line itself).&nbsp; Have them walk you step-by-step through the installation process (seting up another account if that makes things easier) and see if you've missed a step somewhere.&nbsp; Have them remotely test your modem for problems.</p>
<p>There may be a problem with the wireless card drivers. <span>
<span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices
 with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do sp fpr tje wore;ess card amd&nbsp;the router if it comes with any at least and&nbsp;any
 you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How was your computer wiped out?&nbsp; Was it an electrical surge?&nbsp; There may be damage to some of the devices (like the wireless card) caused by the same incident but not detected
 until now.&nbsp; If you have a spare wireless card or can borrow one, then we could test if the card itself is the issue by swapping it between computers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you have any other computers connected to the wireless device or to the router and are they working?&nbsp; Maybe someone with a wireless laptop can drop by for a visit and see
 if that computer can connnect wirelessly - then we can suspect the wireless device and/or the router.&nbsp; Do you know how to access the settings for the wireless device or the router from your PC - contact the manufacturers to see if there is a way and then verify
 the settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Keep me posted.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

    <title>COA NOT VALID ACCORDING TO WINDOWS. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maggie43uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            COA NOT VALID ACCORDING TO WINDOWS.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I was given a Dell PC desktop, (2005) running XP Pro.&nbsp; Did a clean re-install using a genuine HP recovery disc for XP Pro. All Ok up to Finalizing stage when the COA was requested.&nbsp; I entered the 25 digit numbers from the COA GENUINE product key stuck to
 my casing but a text box appeared saying it was not valid. The original and only OS ever installed on the PC was genuine. The re-install disc is genuine&nbsp;so what is the problem please. thank you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also for your information I would like to add that many people using PC &amp; Laptops now are getting on in years and like me find reading these tiny number &amp; letters very difficult, especially when it is almost impossible to tell the difference between:</p>
<p>8 &amp; B&nbsp; : &nbsp;Q &amp; O or 0&nbsp; :&nbsp; 1 &amp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; and probably several more combinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two of the blocks of digits on my COA had 8 or B but im still now sure which even with the help of a mag light and magnifying glass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stuck on casings, low to the floor, in awkward
 positions, and poor light.&nbsp; However I have tried every available of combinations of 8 &amp; B with no success.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your advice and comments on this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            As you have discovered, one cannot use an HP disk on a Dell computer.
<div><br />
<div>If you are able to obtain a non-branded (aka System Builder) OEM XP Home installation CD (not easy), then you can use the key on the Dell's COA sticker.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are able to obtain a Dell-branded OEM XP Home installation CD (fairly easy), then System-Locked Preinstallation kicks in and you won't even need to enter the key at all since it will have been pre-activated. :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT:</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might have success (no guarantees) with the Windows Product Key Update Tool. See:<br />

            <p>Thank you so much for all your help, advice and links.&nbsp; I have looked at the links and will study them more when and if I can get this PC up and running, or if all else fails.&nbsp; Sorry I was such a bumkin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right. I got a dell CD&nbsp; It says.&nbsp; REINSTALLATION CD&nbsp;&nbsp; Win XP Pro Service pack 2.&nbsp; Tried it and worked ok until it began the set up procedure when this error appeared. i386.&nbsp; Using my laptop I looked it up on the internet and found&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>C:\\I386\\VALUEADD\\MSFT\\NTBACKUP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the installation will not let me access the start button, programmes, internet or keyboard, it has provided access to a white bar and is requesting the info to find the filei386.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please could you tell me if the file path is what the installation is looking for and if it is correct, so I can type it in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if I have got this all wrong perhaps you could advice what to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>many thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh forgot to say that on my first attempt with this disc all went well but it did ask for the COA but again refused to accept it.&nbsp; Only got as far as the above&nbsp;error on my second attempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also the PC is not useable because even with no disc in the CD, on start up, it begins the installation set up procedure every time.&nbsp;&nbsp; ensured the bios was set to start from the HDD drive but the outcome was the same.&nbsp; I assume this is because the HDD was
 formatted.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I must have done something wrong or the HP disc has caused problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been told that I can contact microsoft by phone and once they verify that the OS is genuine they will give me a cose that will work??????????</p>

    <title>WiFi goes out randomly, but also regularly when coming back from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stev1der  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi goes out randomly, but also regularly when coming back from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to find an answer that solves my issue anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I have the latest drivers when I attempt to update my drivers. I've deselected the setting for allowing the computer to put the device to sleep. Those seem to be the most common suggestions for Windows 10 computers. This is an ASUS Desktop PC G11CB_G11CD
 Series computer that came with Windows 10 installed and it's been reinstalled on it. 16 GB RAM, Intel i7-6700 3.4 GHz processor. I'm on Frontier FIOS at 100/100 speeds and a speedtest just verified that I'm getting about that on WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, at random times, I'll just suddenly lose access to the internet. It can happen during gaming, during web browsing, you name it. Suddenly for some unknown reason, it simply fails to load a new page or freeze action during gaming and after a few moments,
 it will reconnect, sometimes under 30s, sometimes not at all. Sometimes, a run of the troubleshooter will reconnect access, sometimes it won't and I have to reboot the computer. My WiFi connected printer will go offline as well and then reconnect, if I do
 successfully reconnect at all. Sometimes a reboot of the computer works, sometimes I have to go over to the router and reset it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to these annoyances, there is a very regular habit of this machine not automatically connecting to the sole WiFi access point with a password implemented (and the only one in known networks) when coming back from sleep mode. Despite this machine's
 settings being such that the power management tab has nothing selected. I've tried deselecting "connect to suggested open hotspots" but that seems to make it impossible to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes troubleshooter works, sometimes it SAYS it fails, but connects, and sometimes I have to go into the WiFi settings and choose to connect. If that works, then I know I don't have to restart, but I shouldn't have to tell the computer to connect after
 I've already been connected. I know it's not the internet, because WiFi only iPads in the house do not have this issue at all and remain connected to the internet access, even if my computer has decided to not recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be possible that it's happening at least once a sitting and sometimes more? I thought maybe it was my iPhone getting push notifications, but even if it's powered down or not even in the house, this is happening. I'm at a loss. As I mentioned,
 I've tried just about everything I can think of, but this is a REAL hassle and has been happening for several months now. If there's something new to try, I'd be willing, but as I mentioned, I've read and tried several "solutions" that haven't worked. The
 drops and the sleep mode disconnects are too frequent and inconvenient. I see others having this problem, but those solutions for them aren't working for me. What are some likely culprits? What should I try?</p>

<p>There were no changes of which I am aware when this started happening, but this has been happening for a long time now. It has been a recurring hassle that I've dealt with by using some of the methods provided in the article linked, though I didn't get those
 suggestions for my attempts from that particular article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm receiving error messages only when using the Troubleshooter method, but even then, the error messages don't seem to make sense because sometimes I'd get the error message, but it would still reconnect me. Other instances would just see outright failure
 and require a reset by unplugging the modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a firewall, but I tried everything in "Things to try first" on down to roll back the network adapter driver. I did not try that, nor did I try uninstalling the network adapter driver and restart or using the network reset to reinstall network
 devices. I suppose I should try those, but according to the "update the network adapter driver" step I have the current recommended driver and I have internet access, it just cuts out randomly and then when coming out of sleep mode, it won't reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently moved and through two days only had to restart the modem once, and that might have been related to a 5G outage on the modem and not the previous problems at the old address. I'll try using a network reset and uninstalling the network adapter
 driver steps before commenting again, though, as those are the last two things in the article I have not tried.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - doesn&#39;t wake up when I lift the lid of my laptop</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10 in the free upgrade a few months ago now. I'm so frustrated! I (like many of you) don't have the time to turn my laptop off then back on again and wait for it to load every time I want to use it. I've read forums, tried suggestions,
 adjusted settings&nbsp;and just not getting anywhere.&nbsp;PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!

    <title>Task Manager Not Working Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melo_0311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manager Not Working Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my Windows to the new Windows 10 and when I went to open some of my apps they do not open.</p>
<p>A little icon appears on the task manager(bar) on the bottom of the screen but nothing pops up on my desktop. I click on the icon on the task manager and it only gives me the option to close the app and "pin this program to task bar" I am not able to open
 or view anything at all, I've tried opening settings with hot keys and with the new search engine and I click it through there and again nothing opens.</p>
<p>I am not able to access my settings nor my control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be due to some .dll file corrupted. I would suggest you to run SFC scan.<strong><br />
<br />
</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press ‘Windows + X’ Keys.<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Click <strong>‘Yes’</strong> if it prompts for permission.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<span><br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            <p>They appear to be some type of temp file, where exactly are they located, the file path?</p>
<p>Have you run disk cleanup?</p>
<p>You can check the file properties to see if that gives a clue to their origin, you could also delete say 3 of the oldest, and then check whether everything operates as expected</p>

    <title>Deleting a gamertag associated with my Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rba4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting a gamertag associated with my Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to delete a gamertag associated with my Microsoft Account ?</p>
<p>My main gamertag is associated with an Microsoft Account I created years ago when I bought my 360.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sold that console years back and I spent two years without a Xbox and forgot about that account because I only used it for that...&nbsp; I had an other email provider at that time which was my main one.</p>
<p>I then bought an One X and set it up with my current Microsoft Account which I use daily and created a new gamertag … but then I found that old account credentials and used it on my new console.</p>
<p>Now, I want to transfer that gamertag to this current Microsoft Account to centralize everything.</p>
<p>I read that if I created a new gamertag it's not possible to transfer the current account ?</p>
<p>Is it possible to delete this new gamertag (it has 0g) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help and sorry if it's not clear, English is not my primary langage..</p>

<p>Hey there RBA4, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this problem. So as you mentioned in regards to linking your two accounts together, So you won't be able to merge your accounts but you are able to Change the Primary email address to the account. Go ahead and take a look
 at the support article for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12407/microsoft-account-how-to-manage-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Managing aliases on your Microsoft account</a> for further information in updating your accounts primary alias.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

<p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the input but it seems <span>existing Microsoft account addresses cannot be added as aliases...</span></p>
<p><span>It means I am stuck with two Microsoft account, the one I use daily for emails, onedrive etc... (but with the gamertag I don't use)</span></p>
<p><span>and the other that I only use for the gamertag.</span></p>
<p><span>I wish that in the future it will be allowed to at least delete a gamertag that has no Gamerscore.</span></p>

<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list of processes, select Cortana then click End Task.

    <title>XONEX repeatedly crashes, error code given does not exist on knowledge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt_kirsche  say:</h3>
<h2>            XONEX repeatedly crashes, error code given does not exist on knowledge base, require help</h2>
                    &nbsp;I should begin by saying that I am part of the Insiders program. However apart from the error code 0x97e10bca I have repeatedly been getting I have also seen error code 105 yadayadayada alot over the last days which points - according to this forum -
 to a HDD failure and therefore a warranty case.<br />
<br />
I was supposed to go on the help page and enter the error code in the subject line, only to find out that this error message did not even exist in the database. So I am at a loss if my XONEX is simply at the end of its life cycle, if its the OS since I am in
 the alpha program and a reset would at least make it usable again (I had to do that once before, and did not exactly find it to be an enjoyable experience) or if my console is simply in the slow, agonising process of dying. Often I need to completely reset
 the internal power surge protection by completely cutting off power repeatedly before I even make it to the start screen. Then, if I am lucky I may be able to play one of my games, only without all the DLC (for example Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition does not
 have Duke Nukem anymore, even though the DLC is still listed under "manage addon").<br />
<br />
That about sums it up. The code 0x97e10bca does not seem to exist, all I have found is 0x87e10bca, which supposedly is a store issue. I am sure a store issue would not cause so many problems (having to reboot repeatedly, purchased content not available or games
 not starting at all).<br />
<br />
Most hilariously, I cannot even report the problem using the Insider App, as it crashes as well (or well, the "report problem" feature remains stuck at "Collecting information" or the app just shuts down with the same error code as all my other apps / games.
 I cant make heads or tails of it. Anyone here who had the same problem? Any help would be much appreciated

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. You can go and report the issue on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
insider forums</a>. This is for the insider program. Before doing any troubleshooting I would report there, this may be an issue with the update for insider. You can also see if others having the same issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hey man just talk to some xbox support guy, I had the same error, heres what he told me to do that worked for me hopefully it works for you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This might only work if you’re using wifi and not hard wired with ethernet cable but still worth a shot to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstalled all the apps that did not work.</p>
<p>2. Then go to settings&gt; all settings&gt; network&gt;network settings&gt; GO OFFLINE, then a forget network button will appear and click that.</p>
<p>3. Then hard shut off your xbox holding the power button for 10-15 secs until it
<strong>
[Mod removed- Inappropriate]&nbsp;</strong> down completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Then unplug the xbox from the wall for at least 3 mins&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Turn it back on, reconnect to internet, and reinstall your apps and it should work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Gamerscore Decrease - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornerscout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamerscore Decrease</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm posting here to bring light to a new issue and hopefully get some information. Sometime Saturday, my Gamerscore decreased by 60 and the problem doesn't seem to be fixing itself like it normally does. I was busy all day Saturday and didn't get
 on, so I don't know when exactly the problem came about. From what I have seen on TrueAchievements, I am not the only person dealing with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess what I am asking is: Is this the usual gamut of issues that comes with a new service update? This seems to happen on a regular basis, especially for people with a much higher than average Gamerscore. Has anyone else been affected by this? Does
 anyone know the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please don't bother giving me the usual spiel in the replies about fixes. I've already done them all. I've had a high Gamerscore for years and have experience all of these issues before. This is not the first time I have dealt with this stuff. I've
 tried everything under the sun, from redownloading profiles to unlocking achievements on different platforms to force a synch. Xbox.com itself is reporting that my Gamerscore is lower than it should be. I'm just wanting to know if anyone has information as
 to <em>why</em> and how long we should expect to wait for a fix this time.</p>

            Like you said it sometimes resolves itself.&nbsp; Have you tried performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until
 the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

            Yes, as I also said, I've tried these fixes. My Gamerscore on my One AND Xbox.com are in synch, and both say I've lost 60G.

<p>I don't know exactly what happened, because according to my Achievements hub, Xbox.com, and TrueAchievements, I haven't actually lost any achievements. Just Gamerscore. For the sake of clarity, here is all the Gamerscore I have gained since the day before
 this drop apparently happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">October 26th, 2018</span></p>
<p>13 Achievements (1,000 G) in Midnight Deluxe.</p>
<p>10 Achievements (1,000 G) in Haunted Halloween '86</p>
<p>7 Achievements (400 G) in Another World: 20th Anniversary Edition</p>
<p>1 Achievement (20 G) in Human Fall Flat</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This put me at exactly 296,000 Gamerscore.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">October 27th, 2018</span></p>
<p>I was busy all day and didn't play my Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">October 28th, 2018</span></p>
<p>I notice that my Gamerscore has dropped to 295,940. Thinking it was some minor bug causing it not to "stick" to my profile, I unlock:</p>
<p>1 Achievement (50 G) in Bulb Boy</p>
<p>It goes up to 295,990 G.</p>
<p>Not wanting to risk unlocking a bunch of achievements and having none of them count, I don't play anymore that day.</p>
<p>Thinking it may have to do with my Preview Program membership (Beta ring), I leave the program and force my Xbox One to download the latest console update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">October 29th, 2018</span></p>
<p>Still no sign of it fixing itself. Read a solution that a backwards compatible Xbox 360 achievement will force a synch.</p>
<p>1 Achievement (20 G) in Jurassic Park: The Game.</p>
<p>Still nothing. Fast forward to now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume it is a bug and will fix itself eventually, I was just hoping for some information about it. I don't get a lot of free time to sit down and complete games, so when I do have free time, it's beyond frustrating that my Gamerscore is messed up and
 I can't play games in fear of unlocking achievements that will be locked again if/when this is fixed.</p>

            Do you mean Gamerscore? I posted about it in a reply to someone else here. All of my played games are displaying the correct Gamerscore. The total has dropped, but no achievements are missing.

<li><strong><em>The Applications tab in Task Manager shows a list of programs currently running. A set of rules determines whether a process appears on this tab or not. Most applications that have a taskbar entry will appear on this tab, but this is not always

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade failure without any error message</h2>
                    <p>Lenovo Y510P running Windows 8.1 upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two attempts at upgrading to Windows 10 failed with no error message given. &nbsp; Each upgrade attempt ran for well over 10 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since upgrading to Windows 8.1 a few months ago, the Windows Update function stopped working. &nbsp; I would install updates via the PowerShell ... which is also how I tried to do the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to get around this would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp; Thanks!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The below &nbsp;is from the PowerShell screen showing the two attempts at the upgrade:<br />

<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software.
 If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>SFC (<strong>System File Checker)
