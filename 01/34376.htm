<h2>            Rented a movie but it&#8217;s in the wrong language.</h2>
                    <p>Rented the movie Blade Runner 2049. For some reason it’s in Japanese! I checked the purchase and it says the audio is English. In no way does it state anywhere that’s it’s in Japanese.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>no just gave up watching it. Not very enjoyable experience watching all the A-list actors with random Japanese voice overs. Felt like I was watching a knock-off or something.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can right click on PNG file, select Open with &gt; Photos. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that Photos app came pre-installed with Windows 10. If you still can't find Photos app on your system, install it from Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set Photos app as default app for .png files:</p>

    <title>Windows App Store List of Downloaded&#47;Purchased Apps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows App Store List of Downloaded&#47;Purchased Apps</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8, I could easily go into my account in the Windows Store (apps) and see a listing of all of the apps that I ever purchased &amp; downloaded or the free ones that I downloaded. That was very helpful when I had to reformat my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went looking for that list today. I have Windows 10. Getting to "my account" in the Windows Store was really difficult because it seems to be essentially hidden. Anyway, the only the apps that I purchased were listed. That's helpful, but I need the listing
 of free apps that I've downloaded, because there are way more free apps that I own, vs. purchased ones. After trying for an hour, I could not find the list of the free apps I had previously downloaded. It would be great to have access to this listing again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find this list in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
The <strong>Store</strong> app in Windows 10 has a <strong>My Library</strong> feature that shows you all of the apps, games, music, and movies &amp; TV that you installed on all devices while signed in with your Microsoft account. My Library in the Store makes
 it easy to quickly download and install an app or game owned by a Microsoft account to any account (local or Microsoft) on any Windows 10 PC or device.<br />
<br />
<strong>My Library in the Store can be useful if:</strong><br />
</p><ul>
<li>You want to see all the Windows apps you own for your Microsoft account.</li><li>You <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">uninstalled a Windows app</span></strong>, and would like to reinstall it.</li><li>You would like to install and app owned by your Microsoft account to another local account or Microsoft account.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp; For a single print job only, you may be able to change the setting in whatever application you're using to print.&nbsp; For example, in Word 2016 (and at least several earlier versions), there's a "Printer properties" link just below the printer selection
 box.&nbsp; Clicking that link gets you to the same printer driver choices, but I believe that changes made this way will not become defaults, but only be used for the job you're printing.</p>

&gt; settings or the friggin' list of installed programs!<br />
<br />
<br />
Any application that's been properly designed for use on Windows 7 <br />
would either give the person performing the installation the option of <br />
making the application available to all users, or do so automatically, <br />
by default. This is entirely the responsibility of the application's <br />
programmers, and beyond Microsoft control. So, the easiest way, of <br />
course, is to use an application that's designed for a multi-user OS. <br />
But, sadly, that isn't always an option, where businesses must rely on <br />
legacy proprietary applications.<br />
<br />
If the legacy application you're installing places its shortcuts <br />
only in the Start Menu of the person performing the installation, all <br />
that you may have to do is move those Start Menu entries to the same <br />
location in the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs <br />
folder and/or the C:\Users\Public\Public Desktop folder.<br />
<br />
Further, such an incompatible application may offer additional <br />
"challenges:"<br />
<br />
You may experience some problems if the software was designed for <br />
Win9x/Me, or if it was intended for WinNT/2K/XP,Vista/Win7, but was <br />
improperly designed. Quite simply, the application doesn't "know" how to <br />
handle individual user profiles with differing security permissions <br />
e changes to <br />
"off-limits" sections of the Windows registry or protected Windows <br />
system folders.<br />
<br />
For example, saved data are often stored in a sub-folder under the <br />
application's folder within C:\Program Files - a place where no <br />
inexperienced or limited user should ever have write permissions.<br />
<br />
It may even be that the software requires "write" access to parts <br />
of the registry or protected systems folders/files that are not normally <br />
accessible to regular users. (This *won't* occur if the application is <br />
properly written.) If this does prove to be the case, however, you're <br />
often left with three options: Either grant the necessary users <br />
appropriate higher access privileges (either as Power Users or local <br />
administrators), explicitly grant normal users elevated privileges to <br />
the affected folders and/or part(s) or the registry, or replace the <br />
application with one that was properly designed specifically for <br />
WinNT/2K/XP/Vista/Win7.<br />
<br />
Some Programs Do Not Work If You Log On from Limited Account<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q307091<br />
<br />
Additionally, here are a couple of tips suggested, in a reply to a<br />
different post, by MS-MVP Kent W. England:<br />
<br />
"If your game or application works with admin accounts, but not with <br />
limited accounts, you can fix it to allow limited users to access the <br />
program files folder with "change" capability rather than "read" which <br />
is the default.<br />
<br />
C:\&gt;cacls "Program Files\appfolder" /e /t /p users:c<br />
<br />
where "appfolder" is the folder where the application is installed.<br />
<br />
If you wish to undo these changes, then run<br />
<br />
C:\&gt;cacls "Program Files\appfolder" /e /t /p users:r<br />
<br />
NOTE: On Win7 Icacls.exe provides better control.<br />
<br />
If you still have a problem with running the program or saving settings <br />
on limited accounts, you may need to change permissions on the registry <br />
keys. Run regedit.exe and go to HKLM\Software\vendor\app, where <br />
the key that the software vendor used for your specific <br />
program. Change the permissions on this key to allow Users full control."<br />

<br />
That has nothing to do With Windows 7 Networking and Getting Online and more to do with your wireless router (whatever make &amp; model it is and its configuration) and your printer (whatever make &amp; model it is and its configuration) - so you may want to refer
 to the documentation, web page of the manufacturer(s) and such for those devices.

            My approach to a similar situation was to configure my printer to not use DHCP, but to have the IP address manually specified.&nbsp; My router has a separate range for static IPs vs. DHCP-assigned IPs, so I assigned the printer an address in the static IP range
 the router recognizes.&nbsp; I then adusted the IP value on the port in Windows to use that static IP so the port always points to the printer's IP address.

<h2>            BF3 &#38;quot&#59;Shortcut Bundle&#38;quot&#59; - refund</h2>
                    
<p>I'm asking for assistance from the support team. First of all excuse my language as english isn't my mother tongue.</p>

<p>Tonight I bought the Ultimate Shortcut Bundle for Battlefield 3. I know this will get me a lot of hate (have seen other threads...) but I play BF3 1-2 times a week. I cant spend the time to get all the unlocks because my working times won't allow it.</p>
<p>So when I saw that you can get "ALL" the weapons and unlocks for all the classes I thought it would be a good idea to buy the pack and get to know all the weapons - I wouldn't have made it before BF4 comes out if I did it the legit way.</p>

<p>Regardless of my motivation for this purchase: I want my money back. The description clearly falsly advertises that you get all the weapons and perks for all the classes, which isn't the case and I do not think I got the product I paid for. If necessary,
 I cant get you the whole list of weapons that got unlocked and of those that didn't.</p>

<p>After reading a few threads regarding this I got to know that all the weapons that were released in the DLC packs are not included. This is NOT stated in the advertising text. I have would have known that before I clearly wouldnt have bought the shortcut
 bundle. I dont know who is responsible for the text that describes the item you purchase, but this is not good business practice and - even though I dont think 30-50 bucks is worth the trouble - I also think that if someone was to go all the way to a court,
 it could be decided this way.</p>

<p>@Support: Please contact me via PM to resolve this issue. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly you have received all of the weapons and unlocks for all of the weapons for the base Battlefield game and did not receive the weapons from the DLC packs.</p>
<p>The DLC was not designed to do this. It was intended to unlock all of the weapons etc, in the base game ie without the inclusion of DLC weapons this is both because this pack was released before all of the DLC and people may not have these other DLC's.</p>
<p>Also note that they do in fact specify exactly what you will receive upon purchase.</p>

<h2>            Windows did not detect a properly installed network adapter</h2>
                    <p>I suddenly had an issue connecting to the internet.&nbsp; I ran the troubleshooter and got the message that&nbsp;Windows did not detect a properly installed network adapter. and that I should re-install the driver if I have a network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a similar post, but from 2016 - in that post, it was recommended to download a particular .msi file from Microsoft to a flashdrive, but the one mentioned is not listed - I tried picking&nbsp;<span>SurfacePro3_Win10_18362_1901002_0.msi, but my
 Surface Pro3 said it was not compatible. </span><span>I have Win10 on the Surface pro 3 - which driver should I select now?</span></p>

<p>Go into device manager. Does it show the Marvel wireless Network Adapter or not?<br />
If yes, uninstall it and when prompted, delete files. Do not reboot yet. Run the<br />
17134 MSI. Restart. Any change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If device manager does not show the adapter, can you boot to the UEFI and<br />
disable and then enable the Wifi wireless? And does that make any difference?</p>
<p>Boot to UEFI:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Shut down your Surface and wait 10 seconds.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Press and hold the volume-up button on your Surface and at the same<br />
time, press and release the power button.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The Microsoft or Surface logo appears on your screen. Continue to<br />
hold the volume-up button. Release the button once the UEFI screen appears.</p>

    <title>Numerous Incorrect Password attempts in Recent Activity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander1812  say:</h3>
<h2>            Numerous Incorrect Password attempts in Recent Activity</h2>
                    <p>For the past couple of weeks my PC has apparently been sending wrong passwords to my Microsoft Account about 6 times every minute it's online. I know it's my PC because the IP matches successful attempts I manually enter. It hasn't really been an issue until
 today when "multiple incorrect logins" locked me out of my 360.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I looked up similar threads on this site and found mostly people running Windows 8 are experiencing and solving similar problems. This would be great, but I'm running Vista and their solutions don't apply to this machine.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>According to the Recent Activity page these attempts are coming from Firefox and Internet Explorer. This is really strange because I've never used Internet Explorer to sign in to my Microsoft Account, ever. So it shouldn't have any information to send on
 its own. The same issue occurred in April. Back then I tried replacing Firefox with Chrome, in case Firefox was causing it with saved passwords. Nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted a question here around then, but didn't get any help because I mistakenly believed I was running XP and support for that has stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The activity finally stopped when I did a system restore to a week prior. That is, until the end of May. That's when I looked at my Recent Activity page and saw it had started again. Tried another system restore but the furthest back I could go was a day
 and that didn't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been ignoring it since then because it wasn't actually signing in without my knowledge and it wasn't locking me out of my account, until today.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Clearing the cache and deleting cookies did nothing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated,<br />
</p>
<p>Alex<br />

<h2>            I need further installation for Intel &#40;R&#41; HD Graphics Driver&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OS: Windows 10 Home 64-Bit (10.0, Build 10586)<br />
System manufacturer: Dell<br />
System Model: Inspiron 3531<br />
Processor: Intel (R) Pentium (R) CPU N3530<br />
<br />
GRAPHICS DRIVER:<br />
Intel (R) HD Graphics<br />
Version: 10.18.10.4276<br />
Driver Model: WDDM 1.3<br />
</p>
<p>In the properties menu of the graphics driver, it says:</p>
<p>Device PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_0F31&amp;SUBSYS_06671028&amp;REV_0E\3&amp;11583659&amp;1&amp;10 requires further installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure what this means, but the graphics on my computer have been malfunctioning since a few months ago. There is an extremely decreased framerate for my applications, and glitching in videos. There is also cut up audio when the framerate drops but
 I don't know if the two are related. I do not think that this is only because of my internet, because it was perfectly fine a few months ago. I used the Intel Driver Update Utility, which allows me to install the driver setup for the Intel (R) HD Graphics
 driver Version 15.something, but the actual driver is never replaced because when I open the setup, it always ends up re-installing the 10.18.10.4276 version. Also, I've received system update messages that prompt me to install a new Intel Graphics Driver
 Adapter, but the actual installation process crashes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please help me fix my horrible graphics, and thank you in advance(:</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;I'm pretty much sure that I've read almost every topic about problems with this adapter and still couldn't find a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My problem seems like the same for everyone with this product, windows recognize the adpater; I've installed the latest driver for 8.1, everything okay until now but after a period of time (something like 5-15 minutes) It's just stoped, the adapter is still
 connected but it changes to limited connection, when doesn't just stop working. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I've tried to uninstall the driver, make some changes like the power managemant for the adapter and etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'll upload some images to a better acknowledgement</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash, whern you are up and
 running again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>

<h2>            Some buttons not working on Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to Windows 10 a few weeks ago. In the past couple of days some buttons on my mouse have stopped working, most notably the right-click (which is very annoying) but also the magnify buttons on the side (less annoying).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver is up to date and I've tried various other troubleshooting suggestions to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what might be the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any advice.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ray.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Device Manager, choose the Mouse device, from Driver tab try to Roll Back and then Uninstall driver, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            May be a silly question, but have you tried another mouse? Just want to cover the obvious since "various other troubleshooting suggestions" doesn't hint at was has been attempted.

            Honestly it just sounds like the mouse is starting to go bad. If other mice work and this one does not, I would simply replace it.

            You will need to unjoin from the domain and join a workgroup instead. If you want to join an existing workgroup, you will enter the workgroup name or you can create your own workgroup name.
<br />
<br />
Go to System, right click and go to properties. Click "Advanced System Settings."<br />
Click "Change" under the System properties. Click on Computer name tab,&nbsp;then select a workgroup rather then a domain.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. &nbsp;

            Wouldn't you be able to check warranty status online? I would think as you go through the registration process it would tell you if the S/N has already been registered or not.

            So still curious. Can I sell this on EBay without the receipt and still promise the buyer they have a warranty? I have no idea when it was purchased.

    <title>Windows XP intermittently hangs on shutdown. Stuck at screen with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donriesbeck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP intermittently hangs on shutdown. Stuck at screen with default windows background color, and the mouse pointer.</h2>
                    We are an OEM that builds electronics assembly systems, in our machine is a PC running Windows XP Professional that provides the interface for the operator. A few of our systems have begun to intermittently hang on shutdown.&nbsp; So far we have seen it on
 three machines.&nbsp; There have been no changes to the hardware, or drivers we are putting on these machines.
<br />
<br />
The PC is supposed to shutdown to the point were it says "It is now safe to turn off your computer" but it hangs when the only thing on the screen is the default windows background and the mouse pointer. The mouse moves, but that is it. It doesn't respond to
 ctrl-alt-del, or any other input.<br />
<br />
This has been reported 5 times, and in all cases there is nothing in any log file that seems to indicate where the problem might be.
<br />
<br />
I assume we have a bad driver or device, but the problem only happens once every 5-10 shutdowns, and only after the machine is powered on for some time.<br />
<br />
I just turned on verbose status messages, but they haven't shut the machine down since.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is: Is there some way to get windows to log all shutdown events? I'd really like to know what it was doing when it stopped.&nbsp; Can anyone else think of something I can look at, or a better way to debug this?&nbsp;
<br />

            re: a suggestion on 'proving' that new monitor is the source of the problem<br />
disconnect it, plug in a 'regular' non-touchscreen type<br />
shutdown/restart in SAFE MODE, make sure the old monitor isn't showing up in device manager [what we used to call a ghost]<br />
if it IS there, delete it &amp; uninstall the sw that came with the touch screen<br />
reboot into normal mode<br />
try a shutdown<br />
if you get the old orange IT IS NOW SAFE..., tell the vendor about THAT.<br />

    <title>Shuffled tracks from a playlist in WMP with crossfading activated, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark bo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shuffled tracks from a playlist in WMP with crossfading activated, crossfading works fine then stops functioning on one song at random, then reactivates itself for the next few songs.</h2>
                    <p>Crossfading problem in Windows Media Player Windows 7</p>
<p>When playing shuffled&nbsp;tracks from a playlist in WMP with crossfading activated, I find&nbsp;the crossfading&nbsp;works fine for about 4 or 5 songs then stops functioning on one song&nbsp;at random, then reactivates itself for the next few songs. There dooesn't seem to
 be&nbsp;pattern to the number of songs which play ok but it seems to rarely crossfade more than about&nbsp;5 in sequence before stopping to restart again after the next song.
<br />
<br />
I have tried turning it off and back on again but it makes no difference. The playlist was ceated in Vista and copied across with the wma files. Naturally the problem causes periods of silence at the end of the particular song in what otherwise should be continuous
 music. <br />
<br />
The problem is not caused by long periods of silence at the end of some music files, as&nbsp;it is clear from the blue progress bar in WMP that the next song is not starting untill the previous one has fully completed and that crossfading&nbsp;didn't work at the end
 of that particular song.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how this can be overcome would be appreciated</p>

<p>Hi mark bo,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>If crossfading doesn't seem to work, try the following:</p>
<p>Be sure you are playing Windows Media Audio (WMA) or MP3 files that are stored on your computer or on a data CD, rather than playing songs directly from an audio CD. Crossfading does not work with audio CDs.</p>
<p>Test crossfading with songs that were ripped at the same time. Crossfading might not work if the files have different sampling rates or bit depths, different numbers of audio channels, or if any of the files contain other kinds of streams in addition to
 audio (such as video, script, or HTML).</p>
<p>Check that you are playing files that were ripped with the same copy protection setting. For crossfading to work, the files you are playing must either all have copy protection turned on, or they must all have copy protection turned off.</p>
<p>Test songs that have reasonably high volume at the beginning and at the end of the song, because crossfading reduces the volume during those sections.</p>
<p>Move the overlap slider to the far right (for the maximum amount of overlap) for the best chance of hearing the overlap on a wide variety of songs.</p>

<p>If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may try reinstalling the Windows Media Player and see if that can fix the issue.</p>
<p>1. Open Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features.</p>
<p>2. Click Turn Windows features on or off in the left pane.</p>
<p>3. Expand Media Features, uncheck Windows Media Player. Click Yes to continue, and click OK to quit. Then Restart the computer</p>
<p>4. Open Turn Windows features on or off again. Turn on the features Windows Media Player. Restart.</p>
<p>5. Launch Windows Media Player to initialize the program.</p>

            Dear Urmesh, Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
To answer the points you raise, all files are wma and stored on the hard disk. They&nbsp;were ripped on the same vista&nbsp;PC all with the same copy protection settings. The crossfading problem wasn't present with these files when they were played on the old Vista PC
 with WMP and everything worked OK.<br />
<br />
I have tried reinstalling WMP as you suggest but it has not solved the problem.<br />
<br />
After listening carefully over the weekend I find that the crossfading stops consistantly&nbsp;only on every fourth song, whether in shuffle play or not. I find it difficult to believe that this is a problem with the media files when this problem didn't occur in
 vista with the same files. For it to be repeatedly occurring with just the fourth song suggests&nbsp;that there may be a bug with my&nbsp;Windows 7 WMP<br />
<br />
Any othe suggestions would be appreciated. Can I also request anyone else reading this to try it out and let me know if the crossfading problem happens to them,&nbsp;as if its only happening to me then I may do a clean reinstall of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Mark

Hi Andy. Well a year on I still have the same problem. And from elsewhere in these forums it looks like others are experiencing it too. It can only be a fault with WMP in Windows 7, but nowhere does Microsoft seem to acknowledge the fault. Apparently SP1 for
 windows 7 is due shortly maybe this will deal with the problem although Microsoft have indicated that SP1 will only contain updates that&nbsp;have already been released, none of which have solved the problem.</p>
<p>If you are reading this thread and agffected by the same problem, then please post a messgae to that effect. The more people who raise this as an issue the quicker Microsoft may do something about it.</p>

            I have a similar crossfading problem also, I used to run Windows XP Media Center edition which used WMP to play MP3's. I upgraded to Windows 7 recently.Now crossfading is broken in WMP as you say and it doesn't work at all in W7MC. It actually seems to
 ADD silence. This is very sad in a program that worked fine before and makes the program unusable for parties.

<p>Hi Tim</p>
<p>You ask Solarboy2 how the crossfading is broken. My posts above describe in detail how the crossfading is not working as it has done in the previous versions of WMP. The music plays fine it is just the way that WMP overlaps (or doesn't to be more precise)
 the music which is the problem.</p>
<p>If you search "Crossfading" in these forums you will see that many other people are reporting the same problem with the latest WMP in Windows7 and I notice&nbsp;that you have also replied to some of those posts. Of all the ideas suggested to solve the crossfading
 problem, none of them work because this is a bug in the latest version of WMP and needs Microsoft to acknowledge it and issue a fix for the programme.</p>
<p>As I said above if anyone&nbsp;is reading this and&nbsp;is experiencing the same problem please post a message here. Hopefully Microsoft will take note and fix it for us all.</p>

<p>I report the same problem as of February 2011 (all updates installed). 64 bit Windows 7 Enterprise running on an ATOM. CPU utilization is low even though volume leveling and Quiet Mode are enabled. As one track ends and crossfade begins (when it does work)&nbsp;CPU
 is still low.</p>
<p>I notice one thing odd. On some tracks the progress bar is way off. The song ends long before WMP realizes it is over. This "silence insertion" at the end of some tracks has the effect of making it seem like crossfade is broken. In my case the silence can
 be huge; 30 seconds or even longer. If you play the same song over it will work correctly so it isn't bad data. It is possible that nothing is wrong with crossfade per se, perhaps random silence insertion is the root cause.</p>
<p>All my files are WMA although some are CBR and some are VBR lossless.</p>
<p>On older computers with older versions of WMP crossfades worked flawlessly with the same songbase.</p>
<p>In addition to this issue I have one other annoyance. Using Remote Desktop to control a computer that is running WMP breaks it 100% of the time. This has been reported and complained about for years by lots of people and still there is no fix. I have to
 use VNC to access my "music server" because of this stupid failure to make the "leave audio alone" checkbox work.</p>
<p>This isn't the Enterprise Software business where 90% of the features that 90% of the customers want is good enough. If MSFT is going to be successful in Media it has to deliver 150% of the features that nobody even knew they wanted until they see them in
 action. Please, fire the entire WMP team and start over.</p>

    <title>Does Xbox One Support Changing Channels using Direct Number Buttons - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Does Xbox One Support Changing Channels using Direct Number Buttons &#40;for Over-The-Air Xbox Tuner&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have a Hauppauge Digital TV Tuner (for Xbox One) in order to watch live TV. Everything works great with it and with OneGuide. I also have a Logitech Harmony Home Control Remote, which controls everything great within the Xbox One. However, I can't
 change channels dialing the numbers on the remote. Is this a setting within Xbox or possibly OneGuide?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Just for greater clarity, essentially my TV is just a monitor and I'm using the Xbox One with the Hauppauge to do all the TV channel selection.</p>
<p><span><span>Also, I've noticed that the Xbox One Media Remote doesn't have a number pad, which I find curious. Maybe Xbox doesn't support changing channels using direct number buttons.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>Xbox One is almost the perfect Over-the Air TV option, however, not being able to dial the channel directly is quite frustrating. Any thoughts or advice would be helpful. Thanks!</p>

<p>I have a similar setup with a Logitech Harmony 650 and am seeing the same behavior. Also found I couldn't type my zip code using the number keys on the remote but the number keys on the remote works just fine for entering my pin for account settings so I
 know the remote is sending the commands. </p>

<p>The Xbox Media remote should give you this capability but I've seen some reports that it isn't working correctly since the NXOE update. &nbsp;I'm sure it will get fixed though</p>
