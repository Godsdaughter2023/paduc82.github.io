<h2>            Can not turn off auto billing&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to turn off my automatic billing because I can't afford to pay membership every month. But whenever I press the button to turn off auto billing, it take me to a page that tells me:</p>
<div>Help us protect your account</div>
<div>We'll send you a security code to verify your account. How do you want to receive it?</div>

<div>I select it to be sent to me by e-mail, but the e-mail never arrived. I waited for over a week but still nothing happened.</div>
<div>I am receiving all my newsletters and game news from X-Box like normal but it doesn't seem to want to send me the e-mail to verify my account so that I don't get billed every month.</div>

                </div>

<p>Hi check to make sure the email you have set up in your security proofs is the email you are checking. From the link below.</p>
<p><a href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/.../manage</a>.</p>
<p>Also how are you trying to cancel your auto renewal, you can do this on xbox.com as well. If you go to "my account" when you log into xbox.com you will see an xbox live title under there, there should be an option for auto renewal. Click that to turn it
 off.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>if you can't disable auto renewall yourself, you can also contact Xbox Support to do it for you, to contact them use <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And like mentioned above you will probably need to update the security proofs, but any change will take at least 30 days.</p>

<p>It sounds like you need to Update Your Microsoft Security Information. That process is detailed here
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/security-proofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../security-proofs</a></p>
<p>After that, you should be able to stop auto-billing automatically. You can contact Xbox LIVE Support
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/</a> - but updating your security information is very important, and you should have been prompted to do this numerous times from your console before this issue
 came up. </p>

<p>Hey there Naroso! &nbsp;I'm going to agree with Buffy here: first steps will be to update your proofs (and check your spam filters to make sure it's not catching anything from us.) &nbsp;If that doesn't get you in, you can get a call from Support to get it all sorted.
 &nbsp;Cheers!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you also tried to reproduce the issue in Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;a workaround, I would suggest you to try opening the websites in Internet Explorer and check if the issue persists. If the issue exists, try opening the websites in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Harkanwar</p>
<p>I&nbsp; have discovered as I fiddled around, that it is possible, having first opened Edge, to then open sites with IE, by clicking on the 'burger' menu icon in the RHCorner of the screen.</p>
<p>This then allows the banking site to open. (I presme this is what you mean by your first sentence? - unfortunately, when I first queried the issue, no one explained that I had
<em>automatically </em>got IE10(or possibly11?) as well and it was accessible in this manner. The help page just said I needed to install IE10, but then wouldnt let me do it!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway Its now sorted i hope, thanks</p>
<p />

            I have a similar problem, so I just use Chrome. My credit union asks for verification every time I use Edge, but only my account number and password in Chrome. The verification is supposed to be a one time thing so that they recognize your computer, but
 that information is somehow blocked or deleted with Edge. I see no answers for this when I do a Bing search.

            <p>Hello Leslie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret&nbsp;the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check if you are able to start Windows in Recovery Environment.<br />
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn938364(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE)</span></a><br />
Refer to the section <em>Entry points into WinRE</em></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Once you are able to access the Recovery Environment, perform a System Restore.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshoot &gt; </strong><strong>Advanced options &gt; </strong><strong>System Restore</strong></li><li>If prompted, click/tap on an administrator account you want to provide credentials for.</li><li>If this is your first time doing a System Restore, click/tap on <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>If you had previously done a System Restore, select (dot) <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select a restore point that you would like to restore Windows back to.</li><li>Review what will be affected by using the selected restore point. When finished, click/tap on
<strong>Close.</strong></li><li>When you are ready to do a System Restore with a selected restore point, click/tap on
<strong>Next.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If it still does not help,&nbsp;I suggest you to download the <strong>Windows 10 ISO
</strong>and create a Media Creation tool from&nbsp;another computer and then perform a Repair using the same ISO media.</p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Refer to the section <strong>Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool&nbsp;</strong>in the above article for creating the tool).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></p>

<h2>            Resident Evil 5...&#38;quot&#59;DLC&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I;ve just downloaded the remastered RE5 from the Xbox Store. The info said that the game comes with all available DLC for free. I checked this out &amp; as far as I can tell, I am missing&nbsp;a large
 chunk of the DLC. There's no Lost in Nightmares or Desperat eEscape that I can see, nor are there 4 bonus costumes - just 2 -&nbsp; or extra figuers; where these things should be there is the "?????" that the game showed on the 360 for DLC you hadn't purchased.</span></p>

<p><span>Do I have a faulty download or am I missing something obvious here?</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks for any help anybody can give :)</span></p>

<br />
<br />Whether or not you are able to calibrate the Touch screen depends on the make and model of the device you are using.
<br />
<br />Can you tell me please the make and model?

            Hi OldFezzi, just a clarifying question: when you go into the properties of one of your&nbsp;MP3 files, can you see the "Length" field populated with a value?

            I assume that would be under the "Details" tab. &nbsp;"Length" shows up in the top section where there are no numbers but does not show up in the lower part that actually shows the file size, etc.

            <p>that's right, if the data isn't shown here then it cant be shown in explorer. it could be the way the files were created, did you download them or rip them direct from a CD?</p>
<p>

            <p>Windows Media Player - right clicking on the piece loaded does indeed show the length - first item on the list.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Richard. &nbsp; OK, the scan seemed to run just fine and left this lengthy log file. &nbsp;How would I tell if the program made repairs? &nbsp; &nbsp;At the end of the scan it told me that it had found some corruption but said I had to consult the log. &nbsp; the word "corrupt"
 does not appear in the log. &nbsp;However, there are numerous failed and warning lines, none of which make sense to me. &nbsp;Examples:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;"Failed to start upload with file pattern"</p>
<p>"Failed to send all unsent reports"</p>
<p>"Failed to start standard sample upload"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there's a long list of "Failed to internally open package" &nbsp;followed by ""Unrecognized Packages' and other warnings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other suggestion, repairing the operating system seems to be ony for windows 8 and I have 7 home premium.</p>

<h2>            Acer Aspire One, XP tries to start then goes to Blue Screen....does this over and over. Tried A Lot of ideas on other post with no luck. Can not use cd, has usb only.</h2>
                    My daughters acer aspire one aoa150 with windows xp will start up, it goes to screen showing it was shut down and to choose, safe mode, last known config, normal,....ect. I've tried all of them, including command promp one, but same thing happens everytime....looks
 like it's going to start up xp, shows xp logo, then a sudden flash of a blue screen for 1 second, then restarts itself.....it'll do it over and over and over again until you shut it off. It is an acer aspire one, it has no place to put a cd...only usb. I can
 barrow a xp cd off a friend, but not sure what to do once i have the cd, or if thats what i even need? please help. I can't afford to take it any place to get it fixed. Thank you for your time.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you restart the computer after unplugging all the external devices if any?</span></p>
<p><span>You will need a CD drive for further troubleshooting, or you may want to contact the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>However, you can do the following steps to disable automatic rebooting and to get the blue screen error:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 My Computer and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Advanced tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Startup and Recovery, click Settings to open the Startup and Recovery dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Clear
 the Automatically restart check box, and click OK the necessary number of times.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 your computer for the settings to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Now make a note of the error message you get after the blue screen and let us know.</span></p>

Please provide additional information about your system:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
What is your system make and model?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
What is your XP version and Service Pack?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot,&nbsp;AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If you don't hvae a CD drive, that might slow you down since you are going to either boot on a CD attached via an external USB CD drive you will need to buy/rent/borrow or remove the drive temporarily and install it in another system. &nbsp;I would suggest you buy
 an external USB DVD drive so you wil have it if you need it again some other day for something else.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Fill in the blank: &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
My system was working fine until _________________________________________.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then choose it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
Depending on the severity of the error, a dump file may or may not be created, but there will&nbsp;always be some good information on your screen to get started.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know&nbsp;what your BSOD looks like.</div>
<br />
Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.<br />

<p>Thank you for trying to help me! Here is all the information you needed from me. I done my best to explain everything, but if I forgot some info you needed, or if your not sure what i'm talking about, just let me know.</p>
<p>System Make &amp; Model: Acer Aspire One AOA150-1029 AOXPHSTUS1, 2X512/120GB US&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP version: Professional (Not Sure Which Service Pack though)</p>
<p>The Acer Aspire One Has no CD drive, it has a few USB ports. <br />
I've read about putting XP Installation disc on a USB flash drive and using that to boot and fix the problem. I tried downloading and using WinToFlash utility to create a bootable Windows flash drive. No luck using that one though.<br />
When i tried booting from the USB flash that was supposed to fix my problem, I still can not get it past the XP&nbsp; logo....looks like it's gonna work, but ends up blue screening me again....also, when trying to boot thru USB flash drive, It shows 2 options....one
 has stuff to do with partitions Editing, deleting, ect....the other option that'll allow me to arrow down and select shows Boot Windows XP Proffesional. I tried selecting that and I believe it said, no partitions are set.<br />
I don't know anything about setting partitions, so i stopped and returned to the other boot options cause i didn't want to mess anything up.<br />
I still have the flash drive, so if you have any suggestions on still using it to boot XP, I'm willing to listen.</p>
<p>This is not the 1st time the acer aspire one acted up like this. My oldest daughter had it 1st. Not sure what she done to it then to make it not boot? She had a family member on her Dad's side fix it. It originally had XP home edition, but the person she
 had fix it put XP Proffesional on it...I have no way of asking the person. But once fixed, my oldest daughter gave the acer aspire one to my youngest daughter (oldest got her a real laptop while waiting on the acer to get fixed by her relative). So, my youngest
 daughter was using the acer...it was working fine...then she said she thinks it was doing an update possibly, when done she shut it down. When trying to start it back up again, it was doing this wont boot, blue screen mess.</p>
<p>BSOD Information you wanted me to get:</p>
<p>Unmountable_Boot_Volume</p>
<p>Technical information:<br />
Stop: 0x000000ED (0x8634DE30, 0xC0000006, 0x0000000, 0x0000000)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your time and effort helping me try to fix my daughters acer. If she didn't need the dang thing, I'd throw it out the window. But she does, and I can't afford to buy her a new one. Again, thank you!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To boot the computer with the USB device, you need to check if the boot priority in BIOS is set for it.</span></p>
<p><span>Check in the user’s manual to change the settings in BIOS.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>:
 Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>If not, you may have to contact the<a href="http://support.acer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">computer manufacturer</a> for more help.</span></p>

<p>If you've had the problem a couple times, then it sounds likely that you will have it again.</p>
<p>Booting on a USB memory device can sometimes work, but the science of it seems rather sketchy to me and there are too many "if", "maybe", "might be" words involved.&nbsp; I don't need something to try that might work maybe sometimes - I need something that I
 know is going to work all the time.</p>
<p>You can also post a message out in the Acer Support forum and see what they say.&nbsp; You can't be the first Acer user with this problem of how to boot on something when your hard disk won't.</p>
<p>To ease the frustration around this incident and what sounds like might be future incidents (and just to make things easier all around), I just tell people to spend the ~$35 to get an external USB CD/DVD drive for booting emergencies, then they also like
 it even more later when they realize it comes with an extra bonus that they can now burn CD/DVDs to store their precious digital memories (pictures, documents, etc.).&nbsp; Jut unplug it and put it away if you are not using it, whip it out when you need it.</p>
<p>You should be done with this problem by now.</p>

            I would start a new question and in the new question you create, provide this information:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />

            i had the same issue where any booting would lead to Windows XP blue boot screen so upon booting i held alt + F10 which allowed me to reformat through the Acer eRecovery manager this was a option for me since i had very little on the drive itself only
 being a month old.<br />

<h2>            Software Installation Issue due to compatibility</h2>
                    <p>Dear Folks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows 10 on my laptop, and I am intending to install an engineering software (CYPE Engineers 2017) in my computer. When I am clicking on the installation file, the file won't open up, but instead a message pops up which looks exactly the same
 as the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/595a2f6a-24c3-4f8c-9d82-b40172e006b9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/595a2f6a-24c3-4f8c-9d82-b40172e006b9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried modifying the compatibility options of the file, such as color mode reduction, 640*480 resolution, disabling fullscreen optimization, and ext, but unfortunately none of these methods or loopholes have solved my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not really a tech savvy person in computers and windows, and I do need to have this software installed, so if you could help me with this issue with clear instructions, I would really appreciate your assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access

<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and check to see if you can install that application
<br />

            Hi Steve
<br />
<br />You could try downloading it from the Microsoft Update catalog and install it manually:
<br />
<br />KB4487017 - Microsoft Update Catalog
<br /><a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4487017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search...</a>

<br />
<br />I noticed you are still on Windows 10 1803, you should bring your system up to version 1809:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br /> Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?
<br />Check this List to Determine if Your Computer is Compatible with the Windows 10 1809

<br />
<br />	perform the following tasks:
<br />	12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10

<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 on a Drive with Limited Space

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />

You could try downloading it from the Microsoft Update catalog and install it manually:

<br />
<br />
I noticed you are still on Windows 10 1803, you should bring your system up to version 1809:
<br />
<br />
First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant: <br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />
If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable. <br />
<br />
Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10 <br />
<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-computer-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-comput...</a>
<br />
<br />
Download the Media Creation Tool Now <br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />
Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator. <br />
<br />
<br />
Accept the End User License Agreement: <br />
<br />
Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />
Click Next <br />
<br />
If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC.
<br />
<br />
Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next. <br />
<br />
Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro. <br />
Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />
Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />
Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />
Downloading the ISO file <br />
<br />
An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then
 burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.
<br />
<br />
Creating a .ISO file <br />
<br />
For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. <br />
<br />
Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. <br />
<br />
Wait while the .ISO image is created. <br />
<br />
Performing the upgrade: <br />
<br />
Once you have the Windows 10 ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification. If setup does not start automatically, click Start
 &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />
Click Run setup.exe <br />
<br />
Wait while setup is initialized. <br />
<br />
You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />
Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues. <br />
<br />
Accept the End User License Agreement. <br />
<br />
Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready. <br />
<br />
Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />

<br />
<br />
Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />
This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />

After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.

</p><p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only trying to fix my Dell Laptop Core 2 Duo with Windows 10 1803 Cumulative Updates. I have no problem downloading and installing the updates. It's when the rebooting and when it reaches the end at 98% completion, I got the message that says unable
 to complete and it is now undoing the changes etc. The history updates has the error 0x800f0922 on KB4487017. I tried to do the manual update from the MS Update Catalog and got the same result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I am also having this problem. I see people all over the web looking for this same answer, and Microsoft wants everyone to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My PC has been upgrading properly for years, so how could my Windows installation be corrupt now? The update plain fails no matter how you try to install it. How did all of these machines get corrupted at the same time (I have Malwarebytes and Norton)?
 Did an earlier Windows update cause this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Normally I would just wait for the next cumulative update to see if that fixes the issue (Worked almost every time when I was doing tech support) but unfortunately this is trying to update almost daily, and is getting quite annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am going to try to find an answer and get back to you, unless one of you find it first.</p>

                    <p>Alright so,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got the Get Windows 10 icon in my icon tray, and I went to click on it to reserve Windows 10, but the window opens, says "Please Wait" for about 0.5 seconds, then closes immediately. I tried to open it several more times and it still won't open. Eventually,
 I right clicked on the icon, and selected Reserve Upgrade, and I think it's reserved now, but I have no idea of verifying that because I can't open the Get Windows 10 page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know why this is happening and how to fix it?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>After looking about no 3rd party retailers seem to have Anytime Upgrade Keys for 7 to professional.
</p>
<p>When I try Anytime Upgrade system that's built in and use the "go on-line to choose the edition of Windows7 that's best" an error box comes up reading "An error has occurred in the script on this page. Line 0. Char 0. Error Script error. code 0." with a
 URL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try the store I can't find anything either. Am I to assume that Microsoft no longer sell upgrades between versions of windows 7?</p>

            <p>That is the best way to get 7 pro and use the other for win-10 </p>
<p>Do not have 7 pro connected while upgrading to 10 home completely remove the drive with 7 pro until after the upgrade and probably clean install of win-10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your happy with the win-10 install and it functions okay,</p>
<p>Disable fast start up in windows 10<br />
Use Winkey+X and Power options<br />
On the top left click on change what the power button does<br />
Click on the link top center to change settings currently unavailable<br />
Uncheck use fast startup recommended</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that connect the win-7 pro disk and dual boot if you wish too,</p>
<p>I prefer to use one disk at a time and never have both connected at the same time.</p>

            <p>Anytime upgrades have long past gone</p>
<p>Well unless you're interested in win-10 that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plenty of win-7 pro's around on Newegg and Amazon but they aren't upgrades only oem/ system builder.</p>
<p>Which you could buy one and a new ssd/ hdd to install it on and use the original win-7 to upgrade to win-10</p>
<p>Then upgrade that to win-10 pro for 99.us.</p>

<h2>            How many partitions are ideal for a well-working pc and does pc get affected by numerous partitions&#63;</h2>
                    I have almost six partitions(Including C:Drive). Boot time takes a bit longer than usual boot time taken by Windows 8.1 and sometimes some programs go on 'Not responding' state during operation. Does numerous partitions of the drive affect the performance
 of the pc? How many partitions are ideal for a well-working pc? Is it strictly advisable to have less partitions? Is my six partitioned system bothering my pc?

            <p>The fewer, the better.&nbsp; Having separate partitions means that the reader arm on the hard drive has to constantly move around to many different places to reach the partition for whatever data you are accessing.&nbsp; That physical movement of that arm if BY FAR
 the slowest part of any computer, and will cause bottlenecks as each program or part of the system asks for data from the drive, all those requests have to wait in line while the drive head moves around to all your partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having totally separate drives is different.&nbsp; In this case, every drive has its own reader, they can all read data simultaneously with no waiting for other reads and writes to other drives to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This single partition setup is what Windows is optimized for.&nbsp; You'll get by far better performance if you have only one, unless you want to go get true fully separate drives (not partitions).</p>

            Thanks for the sound explanation of the situation and the terms. Thanks a ton. And by the way, do you think the numerous partitions I have done in my pc are affecting the performance of my pc? I have five partitions(excluding the C:Drive). So, is this
 the reason for the slow boot performance? Will I face any grave problems if I maintain these numerous partitions? Please help.

<p>If the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant becomes stuck or unresponsive at various percentages: 0%, 32%, 62%, 87%, 99%, please wait at least 4 to 7 hours. If you are updating through Windows Update, when the download reaches 99% disconnect from the Internet LAN
 (Ethernet) or Wi-Fi then proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>If setup does not progress, close the wizard then restart your computer. Follow the instructions to upgrade manually using the Media Creation Tool or the Windows 10 ISO file.

<h2>            Performance and Graphic Differences</h2>
                    
<p>My brother and I are having trouble deciding on whether to get a 4gb bundle or a 250gb bundle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We don't want to worry about any features being added and removed from the consoles since the beginning of its time as we have all the essentials we need, we have no plans on getting a Kinect anytime soon, and we're very optimistic about the problems ahead
 of us should we get the Xbox 360 S console. We have an Xbox 360 Pro console that has permanently bit the dust due to internal hardware damage (not malfunction), and the only thing we use to manage data are a removable USB storage device and a memory unit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back then, we used to have a 120gb hard drive which had only 5 gigs of save data packed inside. The only remaining majority of free space that has ever been used in the hard drive was to install Xbox 360 games, which I've barely ever noticed what differences
 or benefits it brought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leads me to wonder, during the times that the Xbox 360 consoles have been changing from different form factors to different features being added and removed, has there been any improvements to the performance in which a game or app is being loaded,
 from all medias (disc, hard drive, USB storage device)? This usually makes or breaks a decision on whether or not we should wait and save up for a bigger hard drive only for the intention to install and play an Xbox 360 game off the hard drive, or purchase
 the 4gb bundle right off the bat without worrying about this very feature. We wouldn't want a decaying hard drive.</p>

<p>Having the HDD will allow you to play backward compatible games, and to use the full range of options for certain games, such as Halo: Reach.<br />
<br />
Also, installing games to the HDD reduces disc-drive noise considerably, as well as reducing load times. All in all, I strongly recommend picking up the console with the HDD.</p>

<p>There are no performance differences between the Slim and the older models of the 360, the underling hardware is the same.&nbsp; You won't see faster frame rates or better graphics and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 360 Slim is far more stable from a reliability point than previous models, it is also quieter.&nbsp; If you like to download lots of demos, arcade games and DLC I wouldn't go for the 4GB model, it won't fill your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for installing games, I would highly recommend this.&nbsp; Not for the loading improvements, but to reduce the wear and tear on the DVD laser, these drives while reliable are still prown to failure over extended time periods.&nbsp; When you install a game, the
 disc is only read for a few moments for verification then the game will run entirely from the HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appart from some Arcade games that have been removed, I can't think of any features that have been removed.</p>

            Reprogramming shouldn't be necessary. :-) Repeatedly asking for a password suggests that your wireless connection is being&nbsp;disconnected by some process on the computer. In the normal way of things if you've set it to auto-connect to a certain WiFi network
 it will do just that, even on reconnecting after a dropped signal (ie. rebooting your router). If you disconnect it manually however the setting reverts to asking for your password again. I've had similar issues in XP when using 3rd party firewall software.
 One of them would disable the WiFi connection during boot-up, others would randomly break off the WiFi connection during ordinary use.
