                    Assuming that I accepted the Microsoft OEM System Builder License, can I, as an assembler or a refurbisher distribute the software to my own new PC without pre-installing the operating system using OPK. After all, I am the end user.

            Windows 7 System Builder licenses are to be used by certified System Builders who are reselling licenses. Technically, you are out of compliance if you are the one who is using the license. There is nothing preventing you from using it, just that you are
 not adhering to the distribution procedures. <br />
<br />
OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
<br />
- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard<br />
<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
OEM licenses are to be installed by professional system manufacturers only. Under Microsoft's OEM License Agreement, they are not to be sold to end-users under any circumstance, and are to be preinstalled on a computer using the OEM Preinstallation Kit (OPK)
 before shipment to the customer, and must include at the very least the manufacturer's support contact information. They are, therefore, designed for installation only on a single computer and are not transferable, even if the original computer is no longer
 in use. This is not usually an issue for users who purchase new computer systems, because most pre-assembled systems ship with a preinstalled operating system. There are few circumstances where Microsoft will allow the transfer of an OEM license from one non-functioning
 system to another, but the OEM System Builder License Agreement (SBLA), as well as the OEM End User License Agreement (EULA) do not contain any allowance for this, so it is entirely up to Microsoft's discretion, depending on the situation<br />

<h2>            where is the bitstream lossless audio for bluray playback</h2>
                    
<p>We now have a bluray player built into the xbox one but no lossless audio for A/V receivers. True we have pcm, but like most home theater owner's , I want my receiver to do.the decompression, and the little light to say master dts hd or true hd. This was
 a day one option for the other console, why has this not been added yet. This is a huge deal for home theater owner's.</p>

<p>I dont think its an overstatement at all. True pcm is loseless , but it comes down to what you want to do the decompression. Most home theater owners dont spend $1000 and more to have the player do it. I dont understand why the isnt an option, I can buy
 a 69 dollar bluray that can send loseless through bitstream but my 500 dollar xbox one can't. Especially since my ps4 has done it from day one.</p>

<p>It does not matter one bit whether the player does the decoding or the audio receiver does it. &nbsp;All decoders work the same. &nbsp;It's a straightforward process. &nbsp;If someone ever thinks they hear a difference, it's the placebo effect.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can buy a $10 calculator or a $200 calculator, but if they both do division, they both do division. &nbsp;The results from the $200 calculator doing division aren't going to be any "better" or more "accurate" then the $10 calculator.</p>
<p>The Xbox One has to decode all audio signals it receives into PCM, because it is always ready to mix audio on the fly, incase the user snaps something, or whatever. &nbsp;It will probably never output a lossless compression codec. &nbsp;Considering it would be completely
 pointless, I hope Microsoft doesn't waste any resources on implementing it.</p>

<p>I would partial agree with some of what you have said, but think you may need to do more research. Testing has found that when the audio is sent bitstream ( uncompressed) to an av receiver and the component is allowed to do the decompression, there is a
 better level of detail and clarity. If this wasnt the case, why just leave the components as pass through , like they were early on in the bluray life cycle. It does matter to those people who are truly into nice home theater and spend the money for good equipment.
 Even the ps3 started with just pcm and eventually went to bitstream with the slim. Even if you look at this option on most bluray players its called audiophile bitstream. Its like the xbox one took a step backwards. I have both, and its sad I have to switch
 to my ps4 &nbsp;to watch a movie through my equipment the way I like. If I was a person with a nice home theater looking to buy a next gen console and one did bitstream and the other couldnt, this would worry me. You ask 99% of home theater audiophiles and they
 will say the same.</p>

<p>Show me a link to this testing. &nbsp;I would like to see some double-blind, volume-matched testing showing that people can hear the difference between PCM and bitstream output on a blu ray player.
</p>
<p>People think because they are aware of the placebo effect that they know better and aren't affected by it. &nbsp;Research has shown the exact opposite to be true, that being aware of the placebo effect makes people more prone to it.</p>
<p>Nearly everything I've read on the subject says that all decoders work the same. &nbsp;Decoding is a straightforward process, just like a calculator doing division. &nbsp;Most expert opinions I've seen have said there will be no difference in audio quality between
 selecting PCM or bitstream on the player, or if there are any small differences (and I mean small) it would be in the receiver treating PCM and bitstream signals differently and one format isn't consistently better. &nbsp;Most recommendations I've seen are for
 PCM anyway, because if you ever listen to secondary audio tracks you can only get lossless audio with PCM. &nbsp;If you listen to secondary tracks with bitstream selected, you are limited to basic Dolby or DTS. &nbsp;So I would seriously doubt that 99% of "home theater
 audiophiles" would recommend bitsream output.</p>

<p>However, you can also get the player to decode TrueHD/DTSMA to MPCM or pass out HBR bitstream (supported by both source and receiver). In such cases, we aren't comparing like for like. I believe this is what desray is talking abt. The bitstream output (decoded
 by the receiver) does seem to offer "tauter" bass and clearer sounds. Why this is so? I have postulated that this is due to errors/jitters introduced on HDMI cables with MPCM whereas bitstream audio is reclocked after decoding by the receiver. But not everyone's
 convinced.</p>
<p>There are quite a few forums that talk about why, and have there own comparison results. Here is a snippet from one forum with a one reason for it to go through the receiver.</p>
<p>I believe audiopholics has a good comparison, ill see if I can find it.</p>

<p>If you have some good scientific evidence that people can actually hear a difference, I would like to see it. &nbsp;It is true that the HDMI signal (not the cable, but the signal itself) can introduce some jitter with PCM. &nbsp;Bitstream would be immune to jitter,
 as you've said. &nbsp;However, everything I've read has determined this to be negligible and that of all the things that affect audio quality (speaker placement, room acoustics, DAC, etc.) it would almost certainly be the least important. &nbsp;It would really surprise
 me if there was scientific evidence that it could be heard.</p>
<p>I don't really put much stock in unscientific conversations amongst audiophiles. &nbsp;It's all anecdotal evidence with murky descriptors like "warmer", "tighter", or "flatter" that are hard to quantify. &nbsp;With how powerful the placebo effect is, especially in
 the home theater environment, I just can't put any trust in it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, science says that the difference between 48khz and 192khz isn't audible to the human ear as both can perfectly reproduce all frequencies that the ear can hear. &nbsp;Yet, many audiophiles still tout the importance of 24/192 audio, often using vague descriptors.
 &nbsp;But when blind, volume-matched tests are done, people can't hear the difference between a source 24/192 audio file and the same file downsampled to 16/44.1. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll chime in on this first </p>
<p>"Similrly, you can buy a $10 calculator or a $200 calculator, but if they both do division, they both do division. &nbsp;The results from the $200 calculator doing division aren't going to be any "better" or more "accurate" then the $10 calculator."</p>
<p>I'm guessing that you do not have a science, math, or engineering degree. Yes, your $10 solar calculator will yield the same result when you punch in 4 divided by 2 as my fancy (ie expensive) graphing calculator. But once I got passed my core math classes
 in college such as calculus and actually had to start using all that math to solve problems that entailed solving multiple equations simultaneously, or performing single/double/triple integrals you bet your mom's furry backside that I wasn't using my cheapie
 solar calculator (yes I had one of them too). </p>
<p>As for the pcm vs bitstream argument. Technically there should not be a difference perhaps as they both yield "lossless" audio. However if I have choice (and thankfully I do) between having a player decoding a signal vs my fancy surround sound processor,
 your mom's furry backside is coming off the bench again. It's mostly a question about the components in the player (in this case the Xbox one). Are they capable of decoding the signal as well as my processor? Is the analog circuitry in the player as good as
 the circuitry in my processor? Had Xbox and Playstation not utterly rushed these "next gen" consoles to the market, and IF they'd have included the best components regardless of price I would perhaps think that the Xbone would be able to yield sound as good
 via pcm as my processor, at least good enough that I couldn't honestly discern a difference. But let's be honest. The consoles were sadly rushed to the market. And they were built using bargain components. The components might not be bargain quality compared
 to the norm in consoles but they are most certainly bargain components compared to that of my processor.

            <p>Hi Sudarshan,</p>
<p>I am a computer illiterate gamer. I am playing the game, Borderlands 2 through Steam.</p>
<p>I purchased dlc and received an error message alluding to the KB ... and could not obtain my dlc. Steam later came across and accepted responsibility for the error message. The inability to get my dlc was Steam's error, not Windows.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and effort. I evidently don't have an update problem. My only problem is having to play my game through Steam.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>Clint</p>
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>The laptop is #1, and there are two identical external monitors that Identify (in Control Panel) show as #2 and #3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 64-bit, fully patched up through and including February 2017 "Patch Tuesday".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seeking one of the following outcomes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The System Tray appears on all monitors</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The System Tray appears on just the laptop monitor.</p>

<strong>Identify</strong> to show the number of your preferred monitor)</li><li>Check the <strong>Make this my main display</strong> box.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try this method:</p>

<p>The first suggestion was not applicable because the laptop screen was already screen #1 and was already marked as the main display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second suggestion worked, although it was not necessary to uncheck Lock all taskbars because none of the taskbars was locked to begin with. &nbsp; I also did not lock the taskbar after drag-n-drop of the taskbar from screen #2 to screen #1 because I do not
 want my taskbars to be locked.</p>

<p>Let's simplify the question. In a two-monitor, extended display setup, the taskbar can be configured to display on both monitors. That works. But the system tray only displays on the "main display" and there can only be 1 main display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to have the system tray display on both (or all) monitors in an extended display configuration?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox has stopped connecting to Live</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Hi guys,</p>
<p><span>Last night my Xbox (Elite) suddenly lost connection to Live and is still the same this morning.</span></p>
<p><span>Now I have tried resetting the Xbox, router and modem but nothing. I have also followed the tips Xbox.com on resetting the connection etc etc but it still does not connect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Now the weird thing is my dads Xbox is fine and connects to Live. I've tried playing with my HD in his Xbox and that works, and I've tried my Xbox with no HD and it still does not connect, so it looks like its a problem with my actual console.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I've tried switching the ethernet wires around but no joy there either.</span></p>
<p>The error report I get is:</p>
<p><span>W:0000 - 000B<br />
X:4000 - 1001<br />
Y:0000 - 0000<br />

            <p><span>Hi Rita,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better, I would like to know what is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you are facing could be due to the display driver is out dated. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if that helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display adapter driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>
uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display adapter driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the display adapter driver. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method did not help to fix the issue, I would suggest you to<strong>
</strong>go to the computer manufacturer website and download the latest display adapter driver. If the display driver is not available for Windows 10, try installing the available driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with the status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            Upgrading from windows 10 32bit to 64 bit and resulting activation issues</h2>
                    I received a free upgrade to windows 10 from my copy of windows 7 ultimate. I had been running a 32 bit edition of windows, but my pc is more than capable of running 64 bit. I would like to change to the 64 bit version, but am worried that I will not be
 able to activate windows afterwards. Am I wrong?

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.

<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to

<p>Hello&nbsp;StudMuffin565,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for keeping us updated. The account needs to be downloaded from Xbox Live. We need to make sure that your console's connection to Xbox Live is good. We suggest going to the<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 network settings </a>and testing the multiplayer connection. Does an error message appear? Also, select detailed network statistics in the network settings and let us know what your download and upload speed are. Be sure to let us know the results!</span></p>

<p>Hello, I have had the same problem and nothing works. I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Restarted Xbox</p>
<p>2. Removed account and tried to add account back in (didn't work)</p>
<p>3. Factory Restart (still can't add account)</p>
<p>4. Test internet connection (working and no problems)</p>
<p>5. Test network connection/multiplayer connection (working and no problems)</p>
<p>6. Test NAT type (NAT type i "open right now," which I assume means working and no problems)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along with this thread, I also followed the info recommended on a previous iteration of this

<h2>            Windows 7 BSOD - MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS ntoskrnl.exe</h2>

<p>
</p><p>Today I had to remote in (Teamviewer) to a computer at work and then allow a technician to remote into the machine at the same time (GotoAssist). After about 15 minutes we both lost connection--the machine crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking at the minidump but can't find any other information other than that it's a "MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS" error and the file was "ntoskrnl.exe". I can't seem to find any specific driver information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, I noticed you got a lot more info from the dump file than I did: I used bluescreenview from nirsoft. Is it just that bluescreenview doesn't give as much information as the debug tool you used?</p>

<p>mclark765</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from the Windows debug output, all the prerequisites seem to match what is described in the article that was written&nbsp; prior to the release of the hotfix. You are going to have to determine whether or not you want to apply it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When and if you decide to apply the hotfix, it will have to be sent via email to inbox. Clicking on the button does not automatically install the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for nirsoft bluescreenview, it does provide some good information but not as much as WDBG,&nbsp;and it's not always accurate.</p>

<br />
<ol>
<li>how to optimize your hard drive manually on the desktop in windows 8 not the start screen</li><li>&nbsp;on the bottom right of the desktop on the task bar&nbsp;there you will find file explorer click that to open it.</li><li>then&nbsp;&nbsp;click on the computer Icon on the left side&nbsp;and a list of all your attached hard drives will be listed</li><li>&nbsp; right click windows (C:) and then mouse to properties and then click tools.</li><li>&nbsp;then click on optimize&nbsp;</li><li>a window will open&nbsp;and you can analyze or optimize your hard drives from there...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>hope this helps</p>

            <p>Defrag/optimise (to my simple mind) is an "app".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you search <em>Apps</em> for "defrag" you will get an app called <em>defrag</em> which is the command line utility that does nothing when you just click on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you search <em>Settings</em> for "defrag", you see an app called <em>Defragment and optimise your drives</em>, which then gives you access to the defragmenter (optimiser)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very confusing, and another example of the retrograde search function in Windows 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows 7 both the above defrags appear in search results so at least then you can see that there are two functions.</p>

    <title>Timeline in Task View only shows 3 days and current PC for on-premise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Timeline in Task View only shows 3 days and current PC for on-premise domain-connected PC</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When I hit the Task View button, my Timeline is on, but only showing 3 days and only showing pages and documents from the current PC, not the other 2 I regularly use. Each is isolated from the others. If
 I scroll down to the bottom, it says (see screen capture below), "Sign in with a Microsoft account and you'll see up to 30 days in Timeline and be able to resume activities from this PC on your other devices." Hitting the blue "Sign in" button just goes to
 the "Your info" page in Settings. In Settings, I can confirm I'm properly signed in to both my personal Microsoft account and Office 365 accounts. I also happen to be the domain admin and I'm not aware of any changes I can make to Group Policy that would affect
 this. I've seen other reports of this same problem (always for on-premise domain-connected computers), but no solutions. Seems like a bug, but has anyone found a work-around to get this going?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note that I do see recently accessed documents from other computers in Outlook's Attach file drop-down, which properly is showing a list based on activities across all computers, so this does not appear
 to be a security feature (since the same list of files is available elsewhere).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Kapil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. I had actually already tried that a few days ago and posted in the comments at the bottom of the page that it didn't seem to apply to domain-connected PC's. For us, Timeline is running, it's just limited to only showing at most 3 days of activity
 and it's not syncing with other PCs. See my original post above for more details on the specifics of our situation. This appears to be a common problem for users with an on-premise only domain connection. I don't know if Timeline works for any users with on-premise
 domains, but at least so far, everyone I've found who gets the message I posted above (including all users at my company) are on domain-joined PCs (and an-promise, not Azure-joined).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you're expert at the Timeline feature specifically. Any further ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Colin</p>

<p>Just had a problem with my Xbox 360 which I purchased in Australia before I moved to Singapore. Ended up having the console replaced with a refurbished console set with Singapore as the location. Now when I power it up I get a message saying that a system
 update is available from Xbox live. When I click yes to apply the update I get a message saying can't download the update, status code as per the thread title. I'm using a wired connection, when I test Xbox live connection I get ticks for network and internet
 but the same upgrade message after that, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>cannot uninstall games apps in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            cannot uninstall games apps in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    When trying to uninstall the games apps that come preloaded in Windows 8.1, I right click them and then click "uninstall" which seems to work for the other apps I have tried to uninstall. &nbsp;However, instead of uninstalling the app, I am taken to the Uninstall
 Program section of Control Panel, and the apps are not listed there. &nbsp;I previously uninstalled the apps through the Control Panel, but they still appear on my Start screen. &nbsp;How do I remove them from the Start screen also?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>edited by these additional comments: &nbsp;I attempted to repin the apps to the Start page and then uninstall them from there, but that didn't work either.</div>

            I have a similar problem that may be able to help Microsoft help with your problem. I recently installed a game on my PC but cant run it due to compatibility issue so I uninstalled it. hint hint both fallout 3 icons.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7f4541af-ad6b-47ab-990b-1111e57cf9ef" />It
 is no longer on my computer but the icon for the game is still showing in the start/app menu you get from the down arrow that displays all the things currently on my PC.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a92012d6-6bf0-4004-8089-aa8afaf5cac8" />If
 I click on the icon I get these options: "Pin to Start", "Pin to Taskbar", "Uninstall", "Open New Window", Run as administrator" and "open file location". When I select "open file location" it takes me here.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10545b30-50f7-4a56-81d5-5aa711707a3f" />as you can see they are unspecified but cant remove them even though they are no longer installed. So I believe that what they
 are asking and I know that I am asking is how do I remove the Icon from that menu.

<p>it is because you can only purchase stuff from the marketplace like games, game add on content and media. &nbsp;you can ONLY buy live with a credit card or paypal or a store bought Live gold card. &nbsp;Since when you buy Live on a console you are buying a subscription
 and you need a recurring payment on file to pay for the next installment.</p>

    <title>Windows Update will not download updates in Windows 7 coincident with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update will not download updates in Windows 7 coincident with high CPU usage by svchost &#40;wuauserv&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer runs an Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz processor with 3 GB RAM and an ATI Radeon graphics card.&nbsp; It has performed quite well for many years, but is currently unable to download updates for Windows 7.&nbsp; The svchost process is consistently using about
 50% of my CPU power.&nbsp; I have traced the CPU usage to the Windows Update service (wuauserv).&nbsp; The high CPU usage instantly drops off when I terminate this service.&nbsp; The problem started about 2 to 3 months ago, which was about the time I received the invitation
 to be notified when Windows 10 was available.&nbsp; I have always kept my computer in tip-top shape with the latest Windows updates and with Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Firewall enabled.&nbsp; The firewall on the modem/gateway is enabled as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last weekend, I decided to download the Windows 10 upgrade in hopes that upgrading to Windows 10 would take care of the svchost issue.&nbsp; However, Windows 10 failed to install early in the installation process.&nbsp; I then ran a repair install on Windows 7, but
 the svchost (wuauserv) high CPU usage problem persisted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I decided to perform a clean install of Windows Vista, which was the operating system that came with the computer.&nbsp; After installing Vista and prior to downloading the Windows updates, I had no issues with high CPU usage from Windows Update.&nbsp;
 However, after downloading Service Pack 2 for Vista and restarting, Windows updated the Windows Update agent.&nbsp; After Windows installed this update, the svchost problem was suddenly back!&nbsp; At this point, I upgraded back to Windows 7 from the upgrade CD.&nbsp; The
 svchost high CPU usage issue persisted to the point that my computer would not download any updates for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather frustrated, I completely wiped my hard drive, did another clean install of Windows Vista, then upgraded to Windows 7 without installing Vista Service Pack 2.&nbsp; Overnight, Windows Update downloaded 200 updates for Windows 7.&nbsp; However, when I restarted
 the computer to allow the updates to install, only 90 updates succeeded.&nbsp; The others failed.&nbsp; It was also at this point that I noticed the return of svchost and its high CPU usage via wuauserv.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point forward, I have not been able to download any more Windows updates.&nbsp; Whether I set Windows to automatically download and install the updates or attempt to manually do the process myself, the updates refuse to download.&nbsp; I have read about
 many others with this issue.&nbsp; Some have apparently had success with the Windows Update Troubleshooter and Windows Update Agent.&nbsp; For some, running Microsoft Fix It took care of the issue.&nbsp; Others had some success with renaming the Software Distribution folder
 and letting Windows create a new one on restart.&nbsp; None of these steps resolved my issues.&nbsp; I have also run the System File Checker, but it did not find any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also aware of a couple of recent updates (KB3050265 and KB3065987) that have addressed issues with high memory usage that many IT professionals had experienced with Windows 7 machines on their networks for months.&nbsp; Neither of these updates resolved
 the ongoing issue on my computer.&nbsp; Tonight, I read about a couple of recent "microcode" updates for AMD and Intel processors (KB2818604 and KB3064209) that I may attempt next.&nbsp; However, I am not holding out any hope at this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is someone who knows how to resolve this svchost/wuauserv high CPU usage problem, please help!!&nbsp; It is hindering the installation of my computer's remaining Windows 7 updates, which is preventing the upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Any insight is greatly
 appreciated!<br />

            <p>Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the article you referenced does little to solve my problem.&nbsp; I am aware that I can permanently disable services within Windows, including the Windows Update service.&nbsp; However, that totally defeats the purpose of
 having security updates to begin with.&nbsp; My computer lacks over 100 remaining Windows 7 security updates that just will not download no matter how many hours I wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read where others have had similar problems in the past.&nbsp; As I mentioned, I personally have not encountered issues with high CPU usage by svchost/wuauserv until earlier this summer.&nbsp; At first, I figured the operating system had just become corrupted
 and needed a fresh install.&nbsp; I have done that and a lot more.&nbsp; One thing I failed to mention in my original write-up was that during all this, I also managed to totally replace the hard drive in my PC with a new solid state drive.&nbsp; There were some errors that
 were beginning to show up on my old hard drive, so I figured it was as good a time as any to get a new one.&nbsp; The latest install of Windows 7 occurred on a brand new hard drive.&nbsp; Yet, I'm still having issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After dealing with this problem in depth for over a week now, it is quite apparent to me that something has drastically changed.&nbsp; What that is, I'm not exactly sure.&nbsp; However, I would like to see a solution that actually
 a brand new hard drive without running into problems downloading the very basic critical security updates--and the solution is to disable the Windows Update service altogether--I consider that a major
<p>
</p><p>Until this point, my plans were to upgrade this PC to Windows 10, give it to a relative, and buy a brand new 2-in-1.&nbsp; However, until Microsoft actually comes up with a permanent fix for this issue that many others have also experienced, I will be placing
 my plans on hold for the time being.</p>

            I'm experiencing identical issues with a random Windows 7 fresh install. &nbsp;I've tried 2 different install media even thinking it may be something slip streamed into the Dell OEM disc. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;50% SVCHost OVERNIGHT!

            <p>After a week and a half of troubleshooting this problem, I finally resorted to an unconventional method in order to resolve the issue.&nbsp; As it turns out, there are free programs online that you can download in order to install Windows updates.&nbsp; Some of the
 programs still use the Windows Update installer, while others use their own stand-alone installer.&nbsp; In order to get past this issue, I had to download a stand-alone installer program like Autopatcher.&nbsp; This is available from www.autopatcher.com or www.autopatcher.net.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation is pretty much self-explanatory.&nbsp; When the program is run, it first downloads a rather large file that contains a compilation of updates.&nbsp; Next, the program will display all the updates available for your computer.&nbsp; Be forewarned that in
 order to get the updates to install, you will have to kill the Windows Update service.&nbsp; Once you do this, Autopatcher will be able to install about 2 to 4 updates at a time before the svchost.exe CPU usage problem rears its ugly head.&nbsp; Every time this happens,
 you will have to kill the Windows Update service to get the updates to resume.&nbsp; This will result in several updates (those that were installing each time you killed the Windows Update service) not being installed.&nbsp; However, these can be installed on subsequent
 passes with Autopatcher.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will likely need to make several passes with Autopatcher in order to install most of the updates.&nbsp; Your situation may be different, but I eventually got to the point where Windows Update was actually able to find and download updates itself without the
 svchost.exe CPU usage issue getting in the way.&nbsp; If you are persistent and patient, after many computer restarts in order to finish installing updates, hopefully you will be offered the upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me tell you, once I was offered this upgrade, I took it without hesitation!&nbsp; The upgrade to Windows 10 was a very smooth and relatively painless process--at least for me.&nbsp; After using Windows 10 for a couple of weeks, I have become a big fan of the operating
 system.&nbsp; In fact, it is likely that I will end up purchasing a new 2-in-1 PC with Windows 10 once computers with the new Intel Skylake processors are released.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to admit, this entire process has really soured my opinion of Microsoft.&nbsp; There is something terribly wrong with the operating system (both Windows Vista and Windows 7 in my experience) when you can't even install updates due to a problem with
 Windows Update itself.&nbsp; As for why this is occurring, I haven't the slightest idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I have a feeling there are many Windows 7 users that will just resort to buying a new computer because their old computer is being crippled by the very service that is meant to keep it secure.&nbsp; And to that end, the conspiracy theorist in me
 wonders if that's not at least an underlying goal of all this.&nbsp; Intentional sabotage to boost the bottom line...I would certainly hope not.<br />

            <p>Very recently I've been dealing with the same issue (never experienced it before). I had to do a clean install of Win7 SP1, and updating it was a very painful process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, it was getting stuck at checking for updates, even waiting for 2 hours did not help. What worked for me was Windows6.1-<strong>KB3102810</strong>-x86. After that update had been installed, updates were discovered within 15-20 minutes (which is
 still too long).</p>
<p>Installing these updates was an unbelievably slow process (which had to be interrupted, because it consumed 2 GB of memory and started swapping - so badly, even mouse pointer couldn't be moved).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that all these updates (200+) are installed, checking for updates can take HOURS, during which svchost will completely consume 1 CPU core (thread).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out many are experiencing issues with windows update right now, and it looks like this is caused by MS servers being overwhelmed with Win10 downloads.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alex, thank you. That update you mention seems to solve the Windows update blocking my system was suffering (Acer Extensa 5635ZG, W7Pro SP1) after a re-installation of the OS in a disk partition. After some trouble, yesterday my system detected and downloaded
 the first 25 updates (SP1 included) but got stucked after that. Three hours ago, I manually downloded and installed said&nbsp;<strong>KB3102810</strong>&nbsp;update and now my computer is downloding and installing 221 new updates (approximately 900 Kb). This process
 is taking some time, though —now it's installed 125 out of 221 in two hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the CPU usage, well, maybe still too soon to say, but it seems that the update has worked as well, the&nbsp;<strong>scvhost&nbsp;</strong>that contains the&nbsp;<strong>wuaserv&nbsp;</strong>has passed from 45-50% CPU usage to round 5%. Now it's&nbsp;<strong>TrustedInstaller.exe</strong>&nbsp;which
 is using 50% of the CPU, but I guess it's because it is in fact installing a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Edit [Update]:</span></p>
<p>It has installed 165 out of the 221 listed updates. The worst part is that again the&nbsp;<strong>scvhost&nbsp;</strong>that contains the&nbsp;<strong>wuaserv&nbsp;</strong>is using 50% of the CPU. It looks like it went down before because the system had already found the updates
 and was going to install them so the <strong>wuaserv </strong>search wasn't required anymore. Now Windows Update says the the PC is updated (the white tick on a green shield), but still
<strong>wuaserv </strong>is consuming half the CPU.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Can&#39;t access the Internet or create User Accounts, getting the error message &#34;The User Profile Service service failed the sign-in&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Windows 10 - Can't access the Internet or create User Accounts</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my Microsoft account (Admin) to be a local account.&nbsp; When&nbsp;the system&nbsp;restarted, it did an update.&nbsp; Once that finished,&nbsp;the Start Button doesn't work and I have no access to the Internet.&nbsp; I have both Firefox and the MS Edge installed and&nbsp;Firefox
 gives me an error message that says "Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible", and MS Edge doesn't open at all.&nbsp; Through the help of another computer, I was able to search the web for assistance and tried several suggestions
 which brought back the Start Button, but&nbsp;there's still something wrong because it&nbsp;takes up to&nbsp;2-3 minutes before&nbsp;it opens.&nbsp; I tried to create new local user accounts, and when I login to those, it gives ne the error "The User Profile Service service failed
 the sign-in".&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, basically, I can't access the internet from my local Admin account and I can't get into any other new account that I create.&nbsp;Going into Safe Mode gives me the same results.&nbsp; I originally upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and for months, didn't have any problems
 until now.&nbsp; It's too late for me to revert to Windows 7, other than doing a restore from my Windows 7 restore disks.&nbsp; I'd rather not do that since I have all my programs setup and it takes a lot of time to redo it.&nbsp; But if there are no other options, I may
 have no other choice.</p>
<p>After spending much of the day today trying to fix this, I have exhausted everything.&nbsp; Can someone&nbsp;please&nbsp;assist in how to solve this without reverting to Win 7 restore from disks?</p>

            <p>None of the suggestions worked for me.&nbsp; This all started when I removed the Microsoft Account from my PC and setup a local account because I needed to send the laptop into HP for service and needed to have it available to them without a password/account.&nbsp;
 Once I switched to the local account and the laptop rebooted, it corrupted something.&nbsp; I just decided to send it to HP as is and asked them to restore to my original OS that came with the laptop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This does not give me a comfort level of upgrading from Win 7 to Win10, after this incident.&nbsp; Now I have to think twice about upgrading to Windows 10 once HP ships my laptop back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No further assistance is necessary since I will be receiving a clean image of the OS (Windows 7) - which is unfortunate because now I have the laborious task of installing all of my apps and set everything up.</p>
