    <title>Skype messages get stuck in &#34;being send&#34; mode - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype messages get stuck in &#34;being send&#34; mode</h2>
                    <p>My Skype messages get stuck in "being send" mode (or "Wird gesendet" in the German interface I'm using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware that Skype had a problem with this issue earlier in February, but claims this was solved. However, for me, the issue still appears on 100% of messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's a rundown of the fixes:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The issue is definetely with the Skype Win10 app and not the account. I can send messages fine on web.skype.com</p>
<p>2) The issue is definetely with teh Skype Win10 app, and not&nbsp; with the network. If I connect the same machine to another network, the messages are still not going out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Resetting the app in Windows 10 allows me to successfully sent messages again. However, this ability is lost after a few hours and messages are getting stuck in send mode again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Uninstalling and reinstalling has the same effect as resetting the app. Temporarily works again, but loses the ability after a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few aspects that might make my situation special:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) The account uses 2factor auth&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The user is used on both a Windows 10 desktop and a Win10 mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm essentially out of ideas. Also googling this issue gives me anecdotal confirmation that others still experience this after the fix that was rolled out by Skype, but nothing I can put my fingers down. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Lewis Grover,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may remove the software from your PC and pass it to the new user. You can try the installation of Windows Vista on another
 PC only if you have completely removed Windows Vista from your PC. You won't be able to use the same copy on two different computers at the same time. It will affect the Product Activation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However as long as you remove Windows from the original PC and then sell it, it is legal and shouldn’t have any problems.
 In some cases it wouldn’t automate the activation automatically and the new user would have to call the free number to have it manually activated.</span></span></p>

<p>You can't connect to an IMAP server using POP3. The port is right, but the protocol is wrong.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Touch Screen Missing &#40;Error Code 45&#41;</h2>
                    I have an Asus Touchscreen Laptop and ever since I bought it (more than a year ago) the touch screen has been totally fine. Today, however, I went to use the touch screen and it wasn't responsive. I went into device managers (which was acting sort of strange--it
 kept reloading itself) and tried to find it and see if I had disabled it. However, my HID-compliant Touch Screen is entirely missing. I then told it to reveal hidden devices and finally found it, but I could not do anything with it short of uninstalling it.
 I ran an update but none was available and I also received an error message stating that no touch screen hardware was connected, which is obviously not the case because my screen is still here and fine. I then uninstalled it, believing that once I restarted
 my laptop it would reinstall as it should, however it did not and now I am left entirely without the driver and I have no idea how to fix this. Please help, and thank you in advance!

    <title>AC3 Unrecognized Disc Error &#40;Long post&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> just a triple  say:</h3>
<h2>            AC3 Unrecognized Disc Error &#40;Long post&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Today (Christmas day, obviously) I received AC3 for the Xbox360. Inside the case there are two discs, from which I understand the first (Disc 1) to be the single player disc and the second (Disc 2) to be the multiplayer. Pretty simple, right?</p>
<p>So the first thing I try and do is load up the single player disc onto my console. So, I insert the disc, it whirrs and shudders, and nothing happens for about a minute. After the minute, the console says the disc is "unrecognized". It is not the only issue
 of its kind to do with AC3, so I try the second disc.</p>
<p>Works like a charm.</p>
<p>At this point, I've done everything under the Sun. I've unplugged the HDD and the Disc 1 worked! - just like the Xbox troubleshooter tells you to do. Thinking the disc could be installed, I use a USB HDD cable to connect my HDD with my Xbox without having
 to plug the HDD into the Xbox directly (as this restarts the console, giving me the problem again) so I can install the game to the HDD so it won't have to read the whole disc. The disc doesn't even get read - the Xbox simply says it's unreadable.</p>
<p>Now I'm getting stressed. So, once again, I go onto the Xbox troubleshooter (which, by the way, is useless. "Clean the disc" no way, this is some serious scientific malarkey going on here. "Try another game" and this will help me play AC3
<em>how</em> exactly?") Getting to the "try removing any memory devices step", I clicked yes, as it did... for a while. The troubleshooter then told me to use another memory unit. Really? So, I have to go out and buy a USB memory stick and/or new HDD? No, it's
 not the HDD. The HDD works fine, always has, probably always will. Therefore, I click the "No, this did not solve my issue" button. The troubleshooter then asks to try another game, which I do (Disc 2). This works, so, I click "yes". Then this gets me into
 an infinite loop. "Check the disc for marks" - No, the disc is unmarked and clean. "Try another game" - Yes, this works. "Clean the disc then" - No, it's unmarked, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Naturally, I take to the internet. The internet solves 99% of the problems I have to do with anything let alone my Xbox360. There have been many posts not only on the official Xbox forums but also fan forums about Disc 1 not working but Disc 2
<em>does.</em> So, naturally, I insert the second disc, which, as stated above, works.</p>
<p>Let's do an overview here.</p>
<p>My Xbox360 is exactly 4 years old today. I have never had any RRoD (luckily) or problems with it since I bought it. Everything has worked swimmingly. I had also bought an old Xbox360 a year ago to familiarise myself with the hardware, to understand why there
 are, especially, heating problems with it (who knew sticking a massive sheet of metal over the top of the cooling system would make something overheat huh?!) and I have never had a problem with that either (in fact, I've hooked it up to my network so my friends
 and I could play LAN games together, but we'll stick to the issue).</p>
<p>I opened my new old Xbox360 after all of this (the one that I rarely use) (OH NO SUPPORT! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUN. *Waits for replies from support saying it's my doing and nothing to do with the console*) and cleaned the laser with a slightly damp cotton bud
 and left the laser to dry for around 2 hours. After the two hours, I put everything back together and it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>So, here is my problem.</p>
<p>Disc 1 works when the HDD isn't plugged in. Disc 2 works fine whether it's plugged in or not.</p>
<p>So, support, is it the disc or the console?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Bump: I just got back because I was out. I've just ejected/reinserted my disc and it is read that it is AC3 (which it never did before). When I start or try installing AC3 the console says, "This disc is unreadable."</p>
<p>1. Clean the disc with a soft cloth.</p>
<p>2. Restart the console.</p>
<p>It's BRAND NEW.</p>
<p>Edit #2:</p>
<p><br />
So I ejected and reinserted the disc AGAIN and launched it straight away. This time it disconnected me from LIVE and downloaded an update.</p>
<p>Will try installing after this (THIS IS NECESSARY FOR ME. My Xbox360 is extremely noisy when discs are not installed.</p>

<p>Edit #3:</p>
<p>As soon as the update installed, the game quit and said the disc was unreadable.</p>
<p>I'm getting a little peeved at this. I understand that it's Christmas day and that not many Xbox LIVE support staff will be online but you are a £multimillion corporation and can easily afford some staff to do some overtime.</p>
<p>Edit #4: The game launched and got to a screen of the game which reads, "Inspired by historical events and characters...." (there's more) then my whole console locked up.</p>
<p>Edit #5: The game's been launched again after a quick restart and I've gotten to the Start screen at the moment. More updates on installation and more soon.</p>

<p>Hey Just a Triple,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have a friend with the same model Xbox 360 as you? &nbsp;If so, would they let you borrow their hard drive to use on your console, temorarily, for testing? &nbsp;You could also try taking your hard drive and the game to their house and try with your drive on
 their console.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes a local game shop will help you out with this, if you ask them.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know what you find out.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply &amp; bump. I had many things out my hands that I had to sort out before I could return to solving this.</p>
<p>So, it is possible to get Disc 1 working but when I do I can only play for a couple of minutes (the longest period of time was 2 hours) and even this is after removing / reinserting the disc around 10 - 20 times (50 must've been the most, by which time I'd
 lost the will to live).</p>
<p>"If you able to install, that will help.</p>
<p>AC3 has caused trouble for many. You may need to take it back for a new copy if a solution can't be found."</p>
<p>No, it is not possible to install the game. When I try, the disc is read as unreadable and takes me back to the dashboard. Also, from what I've read, those who take it back do not get their problem fixed - they simply have a new copy of the game.</p>
<p><span>"<span> Do you have a friend with the same model Xbox 360 as you? &nbsp;If so, would they let you borrow their hard drive to use on your console, temorarily, for testing? &nbsp;You could also

<p>I will try, but as my post reads, I've tried it in another console, to no avail.</p>
<p>Another method I've had of loading the first disc is to insert the second disc and when the menu loads up to press B, attempting to go into singleplayer mode. The game prompts me to insert Disc 1, which I do. After only 3 or 4 reinserts of the disc the game
 loads. But, as I said, not for long.</p>

<h2>            Unable to install Windows Update error code 8E5E0147.</h2>
                    <p>OT: Update for Windows 8.1 for x64-based Systems (KB3012199).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 and IE11 on a Toshiba Satellite laptop model S855D-S5120. Several days ago I got a notice that I had an important Windows update that needed to be installed (KB3012199) that had not installed properly (I have my computer&nbsp;set to automatically
 install Windows updates). I tried at least a dozen times to install this update manually and ever time I got&nbsp;error code 8E5E0147. One of tow things would happen when attempting to install the update: either I would show 0 MB total and 0% complete or 10.9 MB
 total and 5% complete. When I got the 10.9 MB total and 5% complete that's as far as it would ever get. I let the update run for over a hour and the 5% complete never changed. I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter which would indicate there were several
 issues fixed but running the update again obtained the same results: 0 and 0 or 10.9 MB and 5%. I several other recommended troubleshooting/repair programs (I didn't write them down but one had something to do with DISM and another system health (I think)).
 Anyway, I even downloaded a package of files entitled "All supported x86-based versions of Windows 8.1" and tried running it but it did the same thing as when I ran the update as it loaded so far then went no farther. I am not a computer whiz and I am somewhat
 apprehensive getting too deep into my computer. I went on line and searched to see if anyone else was having this problem but came up empty. Maybe I didn't word my search correctly?? Can anyone shed some light on this mess? So far as I know I have had other
 updates download and install correctly. </p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are not able to install update KB3012199. This update might not install if a system file is damaged. The update has&nbsp;<span>prerequisites</span>.</p>
<p>To install this update, you must first install update&nbsp;KB2919355 in Windows 8.1.</p>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2919355</strong></a></div>
<p>Follow the methods below and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong> Reset Windows updates components. Login as an administrator.<br />
a. Visit <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a><br />
b. Click Microsoft Fix it and run it successfully.<br />
c. Restart the computer once the tool is run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If method 1 does not work, try method 2.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Method 2: Run System File Checker tool.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If method&nbsp;2 does not work, try method 3.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 3: Perform clean boot and install the Windows updates including optional update.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you
 boot the machine.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Anish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your assistance. I have tried everything you outlined to no avail. It seems no matter what I try it has no affect. I try to run the KB3012199 update and it either runs continually with no change in the content or percent downloaded just as
 I initially outlined in my original message. You mentioned that I must first download and install KB2919355 which was installed on 9/24/14. According to my update list I haven't downloaded and installed any updates since 12/18/14 when 3 updates were installed
 and these were KB3025390, KB3013769 and KB3013816. I should mention that when I ran the Fix it program there were two issues corrected (I neglected to write them down) and both were fixed. I rebooted and tried running the updater again with the same results.
 When the update failed to run I tried the system file checker. I tried several times to run the SFC but each time I was told another similar program was already running and I had to wait until it stopped. I waited about a half hour and still got the other
 program running message. I&nbsp;didn't think the Fix it program could still be running so to clear whatever was stopping me from running SFC I shut down and restarted my computer. When I did run the SFC it finished and&nbsp;indicated no problems were found. I tried
 the clean boot and the same story with the updater. I did some more research using the links you provided but some of the information got way too deep for me&nbsp;to follow. Anyway, I don't know if this failure to install issue with this KB3012199 update will&nbsp;prevent
 any future updates from installing and I don't want that. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry about the breaks in my reply but I forgot to mention that I have been unable to find anything that explains what the error code 8E5E0147 even is. It doesn't pull up when I query the code either on the Microsoft support site or the internet. On
 the internet I get a lot of "I'm having problems installing Windows updates and keep getting error code 8E5*0147" but no one seems to have an answer as to exactly what this error code means and why it's causing problems. Also,&nbsp;whenever I try and run the updater
 it usually runs for about 30 to 45 seconds and I get a message telling me there was&nbsp;a problem installing the update but not much else. To say this is frustrating would be an understatement.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ran the DISM command and tried downloading and installing KB2919355 but with the same results as all the other times. I reviewed the last suggestion you offered but to be truthful, I was not comfortable attempting the use of the System Update Readiness
 tool for Windows 8 and 8.1. I am not that well versed in exactly how to do this and I certainly didn't want to chance messing my computer up worse. My limitations&nbsp;along these lines is nothing short of "Don't even THINK about it!".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The only security software I have installed and running is MacAfee which I have been using for a long time and have never experienced any issues using it. I did have my laptop in the shop several months ago because I was having issues I could not deal
 with. I had some portions of Windows that were not functioning as they should be and I did not have the technical abilities to correct them. As an example I could click on my computer "settings" and could not access anything...period. My "restore" function
 would get to the screen indicating it was initiating but then would simply remain at that point and never continue. Several times I left the computer alone for up to an hour and the screen never changed from initiating. I had been working another issue on
 this forum when I found these functions were not working correctly and the individuals I was working with recommended I have my computer checked out. I did this and the repair facility I had taken my computer in to had to completely uninstall and reinstall
 Windows 8 then 8.1 and all the required updates. My computer has been working fine until this upgrade issue came in to play. I had upgrades that downloaded and installed just fine until this particular one popped up. I did do some research and if I read everything
 I found correctly it appears more people than just me are having very similar issues with updates that won't download and install.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just responded on this post several hours ago but something new came up that I needed to get out to you. Shortly after I sent my last reply I was informed that there were&nbsp;new updates that needed to be installed. There were 9 total and I initially
 selected all and clicked install. My computer rebooted and began the process of downloading the updates. The download began and&nbsp;the first one downloaded right away but then on number two it froze up. I let it run for almost a half hour but never got passed
 two. I didn't really want to do it but I knew I was going to have to shut down and restart. Anyway, after a l-o-n-g restart (probably because I shut down during the update) the computer booted back up. I went back to the updates screen and changed my selected
 update method from automatic to notify me and let me select. I selected search for updates and after a while got the same list of 9 once again. On looking at the updates I noticed that number two was the infamous KB3012199 which had been causing me all my
 problems. I selected all the remaining updates&nbsp;which were&nbsp;KB3021764, KB3019978, KB3023266, KB3019215, KB3022777, KB2934520, KB3004365 and KB3024463 and selected install. Every one downloaded and installed without a hitch. I have no idea what the issue is with
 KB3012199 but&nbsp;it will not download and install. I even ran the Update Troubleshooter again and it showed 5 fix actions (I didn't write them down and I should have)&nbsp;then I rebooted (not sure if this was necessary but....). I attempted to run KB3012199 again
 but no&nbsp;luck.&nbsp; I get either 0 bytes selected and 0 bytes installed or 10.9 MB's selected and 5% installed. This time when I tried running KB3012199 I got the 10 MB's/5% so just for the heck of it I let it run while I ate dinner. I returned to my computer almost
 an hour later and it was still showing 10.9 MB's/5%...no change at all.&nbsp;It would appear there is some underlying issue with KB3012199 that is preventing it from downloading and installing. Since I have my update selection now set for notifying me of any updates
 and letting me select them I guess I'll just have to ignore KB3012199 if I want any updates to download and install. Seems like a ridiculous&nbsp;way to do things but I don't see any other choice.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do appreciate your assistance with this issue but&nbsp;a system refresh for one update that will not download and install seems a bit drastic. If I should go through all this and still have the same problem what have I gained. I'm by no means a computer
 whiz and I hesitate to undertake this measure when it will result in reinstalling Windows all over again which is exactly what was done when my laptop when into the shop for repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>. . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>No need to address anything other than the fact you are going back to Windows 7 and likely, therefore, do not want to then go back to Windows 10 ASAP . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>While there are applications written by others ** out there that do what I am about to show you - you don't get to see what they are doing, so I personally cannot recommend such a method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy and paste the text below (and above) the obvious markers into a text file, save it as 'DisableGWX.reg' (&lt;-- changing even the file extension - if you cannot see it, you'll have to change your Windows Explorer view a bit to make this easier)
 and then use that (right-click on it, MERGE it into your registry) to disable the upgrade 'pushiness' you are seeing.&nbsp; Restart to get the full effect.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>---------------- COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE ----------------</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GWX]<br />
"DisableGWX"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate]<br />
"DisableOSUpgrade"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade]<br />
"AllowOSUpgrade"=dword:00000000<br />
"ReservationsAllowed"=dword:00000000</p>
<p>---------------- COPY EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE ----------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that is done, you should be without the notification and your Microsoft Updates should return to it's normal state.&nbsp; If you ever want to upgrade to Windows 10 again (remember, it is a work in progress and if you upgraded already on that system
 and activated - then there is a license for Windows 10 you will never have to pay for tied to that individual machine for the life of that individual machine) you could likely use the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media
 Creation Tool</a>&nbsp;to do so *or* reverse the registry values above (all dword:00000001 becomes dword:00000000 and all dword:00000000 becomes dword:00000001) and save that file and MERGE it again.&nbsp; Restart and you are back where you were before.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>*TIP* for everyone out there.&nbsp; One thing I have not seen advertised about the 30-day rollback option you have with Windows 10 is that *if* you run the&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media
 Creation Tool&nbsp;</a>at any point in those 30 days, it BREAKS the ability to rollback - even if you did it just to create an ISO image so you would have installation media to keep.&nbsp; This is because that tool recreates the '$Windows.~BT' and '$Windows.~WS' folders
 on the root of your C drive and those two folders and their original contents after the upgrade along with the 'Windows.OLD' folder (the only 'visible by default' one of the three) are all necessary for the rollback process to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a little 'reflective', but pictures (animated ones) might be worth at least whatever number of words are above this line . . .</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<span>. . . and JUST IN CASE someone doesn't know how to (in Windows 8.1) set up their system so they can see File Extensions (the letters after the period in the filenames) --&gt; here's a GIF showing you how:</span>

<h2>            Password Reset Wizard</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I'm having trouble with my Password Reset Wizard. I used Windows 7 Professional laptop to download my reset disk on a USB drive to use on my Windows 10 laptop and I didn't use my original Administrator because it wouldn't work so I created a new administrator
 and it worked! However when I try to use this Password Reset Wizard I can get passed the second step but then a message says "An error occurred while the wizard was attempting to set the password for this user account". What do I do? And yes I forgot my password
 to my windows 10 laptop.</p>

            <p>ok let's cut the technical ****&nbsp;</p>
<p>if your computer is old&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't even try to upgrade&nbsp;</p>
<p>because I did with my 2006 motherboard</p>
<p>and it didn't end up very well.!!</p>
<p>so the FREE windows 10 offer already cost me $660 dollars</p>
<p>that I spend to build a new gaming rig.</p>
<p>because windows 10 crush my old motherboard....!!!</p>
<p>and obviously windows 10 it run way much better with a motherboard was released in 2014
</p>
<p><strong>DUH..!!!!</strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>microsoft stated that&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you're running windows 7 already</p>
<p>you shouldn't have any issues to upgrade too windows 10</p>
<p>and we trust them for then end up with a dead computer or laptop</p>
<p>what microsoft forgot to told us is the TRUE compatible requirements&nbsp;</p>
<p>to run windows 10 without any issues</p>
<p>the bottom line is;</p>
<p>your old computer may run just fine with windows 7</p>
<p>but since is too old when you upgrade to windows 10</p>
<p>it will malfunction or totally stop working&nbsp;</p>
<p>because your old computer fail to fulfill the compatible requirements&nbsp;</p>
<p>that you need to correctly run windows 10</p>
<p>and you can find many video on youtube</p>
<p>where the people who upgrade to windows 10</p>
<p>they end up with a dead computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>so if your computer is old</p>
<p>I will just leave alone</p>
<p>especially if you already have a CPU that is not supported for the OS upgrade</p>
<p>just don't do it</p>
<p>and instead invest your time </p>
<p>and money to put together a new PC build or just buy a new computer</p>
<p><br />

<p>some computer don't have that option</p>
<p>how I know?</p>
<p>because my secondary windows 7 computer ( a HD)</p>
<p>doesn't have any option to enable or disable what you said in the BIOS</p>
<p>and I even try anyway to install windows 10 from my USB flash drive</p>
<p>it's just not working..!!</p>
<p>so again what microsoft say about windows 7 users</p>
<p>that they shouldn't have any problems to upgrade is not true..!!</p>
<p>because in order to correctly use windows 10</p>
<p>you need the right CPU and computer components .</p>
<p>so everything it may work perfectly in windows 7</p>
<p>with CPU released in 2006 but is not the same thing with windows 10</p>
<p>final considerations</p>
<p>from my own upgrade experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won't upgrade to windows 10 in a old computers</p>
<p>because if you even manage to upgrade too windows 10</p>
<p>you may have serious performance issues&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to create another admin account, logon to the new admin&nbsp;and try to rename&nbsp;the folder.<br />
If you are able to rename a folder in the new admin account, then that means your old admin account is corrupted.</p>

            <p>A lot of people are experiencing this.&nbsp; It's the interplay between having your Desktop background set as Slideshow &amp; automatic selection of Accent color from the background.&nbsp; Every time the background changes, so does the Accent color.&nbsp; This causes Explorer
 to send a "Refresh" message to all open File Explorer windows.&nbsp; So go to</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Color</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and turn off <strong>Automatically pick an accent color from background</strong> and choose a static accent color.</p>

    <title>SkyDrive does not sync and clutters file system on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainer meier  say:</h3>
<h2>            SkyDrive does not sync and clutters file system on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    On my freshly installed Windows 8.1 Pro system I log on using domain account and roaming profile (initially a Windows 7 profile and I am roaming between Windows 7 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro). On Windows 7 the Skydrive Desktop Applicattion perfectly syncs
 %Userprofile%\SkyDrive folder but on Windows 8.1 the %Userprofile%\SkyDrive folder remains empty (except desktop.ini which is placed there).<br />
The ModernUI SkyDrive APP also just shows desktop.ini.<br />
<br />
Even worse Skydrive seems to randomly create new folders named "SkyDrive.old" "SkyDrive (2).old"...<br />
<br />
So currently my User Profile contains:<br />
SkyDrive<br />
SkyDrive.old<br />
SkyDrive (2).old<br />
SkyDrive (3).old<br />
...<br />
SkyDrive (48).old<br />
<br />
And SkyDrive seems to continue creating copies of SkyDrive folders at random timestamps.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to fix this or is it another annoying but I have to live with and delete all (hundreds per day) SkyDrive*.old folders before I log off to avoid syncing them to the raoming profile server?<br />

            <p><span>Hello Camus,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have 4 GB of space left on your PC because of the
<strong>windows.old</strong> folder holding all the previous operating system files and folders.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you upgrade to Windows 10, the previous Windows files and folders are automatically stored in
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder. This folder is kept by Windows only for one month. After one month Windows 10 will automatically delete the folder. So you can restore previous Windows version only within one month after Windows 10 upgrade. Also if you
 run Disk Cleanup in Windows 10, make sure to uncheck "<strong>Previous Windows installation(s)</strong>" option. If you don't uncheck it, Windows will delete all files and folders present in
<strong>C:\Windows.old</strong> folder and you'll be unable to rollback to previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write back to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>But I'm afraid that is not the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my OP, I download Media Creation Tool to create a USB Install Disk for another PC ,not for my own PC. And I noticed that my "Windows.old" folder is only 553KB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the lost 10GB is all about Media Creation Tool. When it finishing making my windows-10-install-USB-disk, it costs me 10GB disk, and I can't get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to get back my 10GB disk?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>I suggest you to perform <strong>
disk cleanup</strong> to delete the un-wanted and un-necessary temporary files located in your PC by following the steps from the link below.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When performing Disk Cleanup, check the appropriate options so that you do not delete the restore points present in the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup: </span></strong><span>(Also applies to Windows 10)</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If you are still facing the issue, run the check disk commands by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong>, then choose
<strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong> from the context menu. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type in the command prompt <strong><span>CHKDSK /X
</span></strong><strong><span>(X is the drive which you want to perform check disk command on)</span></strong> and press
<strong>ENTER </strong>to scan the disk.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span> The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform
<strong>chkdsk</strong>.<br />
Once <strong>chkdsk</strong> completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> While performing <strong>chkdsk</strong> on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>

            When you use the cleanup tool do you scan for system files as a second step. Also change the setting in File Explorer to show hidden and system&nbsp;then protected files&nbsp;and then take a look at the C:\ drive in File Explorer and see if there are any large folders.

    <title>Can your console get hacked on xbox live&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can your console get hacked on xbox live&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing a game of COD: Black Ops 1 last night and entered a game that had clearly been modified. I filed complaints on the people responsible and continued playing in other lobbies. My xbox worked fine this morning but when I turned it on this afternoon,
 I got the red ring of death. Is it possible the players could have attacked my actual console with a virus or something?</p>

<p>No, they cannot infect your console with a virus or anything that can cause the red ring of death, your console just happen to get it at that time. I would check out
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/flashing-lights/flashing-lights-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../flashing-lights-solution</a> if you have a old console. Answer the questions to see if you need to arrange for a repair or replace anything. Post here with the results and I can tell you if your console needs to be repaired or if anything
 needs to be replaced.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem. But no, no user is able to force your console to overheat. To play it safe never join a private game, you may get a suspension or ban if you are found playing those type of games often. If you play public matches you will
 not encounter anything "wonky"</p>
<p>The moment you notice a modded lobby, disconnect and restart your console. I hope this little bit helps. You can always &nbsp;check and see if your console is still under warranty.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick replies. I knew it was kind of a crazy question but I just wanted to make sure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm getting three rings and have tried the tests with the power supply so it looks like its the console. &nbsp;Not sure what else it could be? The system is over 5 years old and pretty much gets daily use. I sent it in once for repair maybe 3 months after I got
 it and never head a problem with it again until now. I bought the extended warranty every year up until this past one which is just my luck. It served me well though.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            You should <span style="font-weight: bold">never</span> uninstall an application by going to C:\Program Files and simply deleting the folder for the application.<br />
<br />
If there is no "uninstall" link in the application's entry in Start &gt; All Programs, you should uninstall it by going to Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs.&nbsp; Select the application and click the "Uninstall" button.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, you need to stop the application before you uninstall it.&nbsp; That's the case with iMesh.&nbsp; See --&gt;
<a href="http://support.imesh.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/28/0/uninstall--install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.imesh.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/28/0/uninstall--install</a>
<br />
<br />
Although the body of your question doesn't mention using Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs, the subject line does.&nbsp; So, if in fact you have tried that method and iMesh wasn't listed there, then either<br />
<br />
reinstall iMesh and see if it then appears in Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
download free <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Revo Uninstaller</a>.&nbsp; Stop iMesh as described and then use Revo to uninstall it.<br />

<h3> castor norbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            How unlock a file .icm linked to error 1603</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I am trying to install 'Adobe Master Collection CS4' in my laptop HP dv6 with windows 7, but the installation stops in the middle of the process, with this error...'AdobeColorCommonSet RGB' Error 1603. According to Adobe, this error is because '<span>The
 installer is trying to install the "sRGB Color Space Profile.icm" on top of an existing copy, which is locked.'<br />
I have two files located in <em>System32/Spool/Drivers/Color</em>,... 'sRGB Color Space Profile.icm._adbNEW' and ''sRGB Color Space Profile.icm._adbOLD' both dated&nbsp;earlier than&nbsp;when I&nbsp;bought the laptop. I installed the 'unlocker ccollomb' suggested by Adobe,
 twice, but this application doesn't even open in windows 7 (it's probably&nbsp; corrupted because the original web page is showing an error&nbsp;now), then I installed two more unlocker (UnlockerIT and File &amp; Folder unlocker) nither works in windows 7 or don't allow
 to access these .icm files.<br />
I have spent two days looking for a solution in internet following many suggestions:<br />
I uninstalled two products I had, Adobe Fireworks CS3 and Adobe Bridge CS3 to avoid any conflict.<br />
I cleaned up all temporary files and registry and rebooting many times.<br />
I modified the color management as suggested in this forum.<br />
I used Adobe WinCS3clean but for some reason the process is interrupted (Maybe windows 7 is not supported, the instructions coming for XP and Vista only).<br />
In short nothing allow me to install 'Adobe master collection CS4', always with the same error mentioned above.<br />
The only action I haven't done yet is uninstall all the Adobe products pre-installed for HP.<br />
But before that I want to know if somebody knows how unlock these .icm files in <em>
System32, </em>or another solution to avoid this error during the installation.<br />
Right click on these files doesn't give me an option to 'uninstall profile' or 'unlock' in windows 7. In fact I don't know the consequences of unistalling or deleting these files.<br />
Any help will be appreciated. Thanks.<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi Castor Norbert,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span>I would suggest you not to delete any files in the system32 folder. The file you are mentioning may hamper your drivers installed and other applications.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may use the Windows Installer clean up utility and then try to a fresh install. This should remove all the files not required and associated
 with earlier versions. Please use the link below to download the windows clean up utility:&nbsp;<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>You may even try installing the application in clean boot state.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To perform the clean boot follow the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try to do install the application
 in this clean boot state -</span></strong><span>
</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue gets resolved check which non-Microsoft service is causing the problem; referring to the article and following other steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>After you have finished
 troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>You may even contact Adobe for further support on the issue -<br />
</span><a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.adobe.com/support/</span></span></span></a></span></p>

<h2>            Autoplay and refresh</h2>
                    <p>Hello Mocrosoft Staff and Community,</p>
<p>I am having a problem with my brand new Windows 10 PC and I hope that you can help. I have installed Power DVD 17 by Cyberlink as my media player for DVD's. I have selected all of the relative files in Autoplay to use Power DVD. When I put the DVD in my
 Pioneer DVD Blue Ray player and close it, nothing happens. Then, when I check "My PC" it shows my DVD Drive "E" empty, the pc is not refreshing. When I do a manual refresh the "E" drive then shows the DVD content and Power DVD opens. I have had a computer
 geek over to try and fix the problem but says I should just wait for the new IOS coming in a few months. Also I had Advanced Sysytem Care Pro on this PC and only ran it once but my repairer said it has deleted certain files from my PC to corrupt the refreshing
 ability of the PC.</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>
