<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t talk to some friends on XBL after new dashboard</h2>
                    
<p>Two days ago I didn't have any problems talking to friends but since the new dashboard update they can't join my private lobby. I'm using a wired connection and have rebooted my router, so I don't know what else I can do. UPnp is enabled (which has opened
 port 3074) so does anyone else have any suggestions?</p>

<p>that doesn't have anything to do with the new dashboard. it's because you restarted your router. you now have an open connection while your friends probably have a restricted or moderate connection. have them reset their routers and you should be fine.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player doesn&#39;t want to play sound on Windows 8</h2>
                    My windows media player and VLC doesn't want to play sound. I have already tried to delete the files under the windows media player folder so that WMP can rebuild its data base but that didn't work. I also did "turn windows feature on or off" without any
 succes. VLC and WMP plays video fine but not the sound. I had tried to unistall WMP but says i don't have permissiom, i bought the laptop with Windows 8 already installed.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Riaan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on this forum. I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a better understanding, I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Does this happen with all the video file types that you play on Windows Media Player and VLC Player?</p>
<p>2) Are you able to hear the sound when you play the MP3 files?</p>
<p>3) Are you able to hear all the system sounds (Sound when the computer boots, shutdown etc.) from Windows 8?</p>
<p>4) Are you using an external speaker or is it an inbuilt speaker?</p>
<p>5) If this has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be multiple reasons why this happens. Normally, users does not notice the volume level over the players. The volume bar on the players would be sometimes turned down too low or muted. The same hold for the system volume which can be adjusted
 by clicking on the speaker icon on the taskbar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have an external speaker, then make sure your speakers are plugged in to the appropriate connection on your computer and working correctly. This could also be due to some issues with the Sound Card Drivers installed on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us try some troubleshooting steps for Windows Media Player and check if that helps. Let us first try running the Playing Audio Troubleshooter and check the status of this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Run the Playing Audio Troubleshooter</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the
<strong><em>Playing Audio Settings</em></strong>. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Click on “<strong><em>Playing Audio</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t help, then try the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: Change the Audio Settings to allow Applications to take exclusive Control of the Audio Device</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to allow applications to take exclusive control of device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Go to the Desktop Interface. </p>
<p>b) Right-click on the “<strong>Speaker</strong><span>”<strong> </strong>icon</span> from the system tray on the taskbar and select the option “<strong>Playback devices</strong><span>” from that list</span>.</p>
<p>c) On the “<strong><em>Sound</em></strong>” window, under the “<strong><em>Playback</em></strong>” tab, make sure that the speaker device is enabled and is set as the default device.</p>
<p>c) Select the speakers and click on “<strong><em>Properties</em></strong><span>”</span>.<br />
d) Click on the “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong><span>”</span> tab and check “<strong><em>Allow applications to take exclusive control of the device</em></strong><span>”</span>.<br />
e) Click on “<strong><em>Apply</em></strong>” and then “<strong><em>OK</em></strong><span>”</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try the following method and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 3: Check the Audio Settings and Disable the Audio Enhancements on the computer.</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Right-click the system tray volume icon from right hand side of the taskbar and select “<strong><em>Playback Devices</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;On the “<strong><em>Sound</em></strong>” window, under the “<strong><em>Playback</em></strong>” tab, select the audio output device that you have the issue with and then click on “<strong><em>Properties</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;On the device properties window, click on “<strong><em>Enhancements</em></strong>” tab and select the “<strong><em>Disable all enhancements</em></strong>” check box.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Click on “<strong><em>Apply</em></strong>” and then “<strong><em>O</em>k</strong>”.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;Now check if you still face this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Please get back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Close all the programs and tabs that are currently open and follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Open
<strong>Run</strong> command by pressing <strong>Windows key + R </strong>on your keyboard, type
<strong>%temp%</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. These are the files and folders that are no longer being used by Windows, and is safe to delete it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>2.</strong> Press
<strong>Ctrl + A, </strong>and<strong> </strong>press <strong>Shift + Delete </strong>
on your keyboard to delete all the folders, click on <strong>OK.</strong> Or you can select the files and folders which you do not need, by right clicking on the folder and selecting
<strong>Shift + Delete</strong> option.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you're prompted that there are hidden files in this folder, just click on
<strong>OK</strong> to bypass the message. A few hidden files hanging out in the <strong>
Temp </strong>folder probably aren't important enough to worry about.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may receive an <strong>
Error Deleting File or Folder </strong>message while the files are being deleted. This just means that one of the files is in use by a program right now. Click
<strong>OK</strong>, close all open programs, and repeat the steps above. If you still receive the message, try restarting your PC and repeating the process again.</span></p>
<p><span>Also I suggest you run Windows defender or any Anti-virus software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue that you are facing might be due to corrupted file and folders.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows
 system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Would love to know what other peoples machines are running at and under what conditions especially an I7 16gb pro 2017 which is what I have.</p>
<p>When converting a dvd to digital format, web browsing (10-12tabs) and using onenote my temps have hit 92C and usually stay between 72-80C ambient temp is 78 CPU load is roughly 45% but hits 90% once in awhile and ram usage is between 2-6gb . Is this normal?
 if so whats the hottest your machines get and under what conditions? Whats the max temp while still being safe?</p>

<h2>            PROBLEMS IN FINDING CONTACTS</h2>
                    <p>I had skype on my iPhone 6s. It was updated and now I do not have any of my contacts on the phone and it does not sync with the skype on my laptop.</p>
<p>Any attempt to find my existing contacts results in asking for access to my phone-book and trying to make these my skype contacts. Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>
<p>A second issue. - In the past, I could search for persons on skype who weren't my contacts and then establish them as contacts on request.</p>
<p>Now, a search only results in a search of my existing contacts. So, how do you add a new contact?</p>

            <p>thanks for reply.</p>
<p>I ran the win troubleshooter and it found a change to a hardware device,&nbsp; which was a printer driver. It was missing in the printers section (how ?) as I could still print documents, so it was robbing a printer driver from somewhere else ? I don't believe
 a missing or corrupt print driver is really behind the kernel power 41 error. There has to be something else, as this is power related.</p>
<p>Going into the event viewer; yes the kernel 41 shows as a critical error; but also window update failure 3</p>
<p>Event 131; 7031; metastage data failed.</p>
<p>I want nothing to do with cortana; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">it doesn't work with mixed languages and keyboards
</span>and have it disabled in the setup.. Are the updates are trying to activate it ?&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Programs no Running without UAC OK. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cst.tommo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs no Running without UAC OK.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to Windows 10, I have a 3rd party program, from OWL (an Electricity Usage Monitor) which when the App (this was on the PC before the upgrade to Windows 10)&nbsp;is run requires me to accept that the program can make changes to my PC,
 this is a pain every time.</p>
<p>Due to the recent update to Yahoo Messenger, which has resulted in a total degrade/destruction of the Messenger&nbsp;Service, I decided to change to a different Messenger Service (until hopefully Yahoo Management see sense and reinstate the old), I picked AIM
 from AOL, it looked much the same on the Internet as Yahoo, but did not want to run it every time in MS Edge, so I looked for a Windows App on the AOL website. There was one so I downloaded it.</p>
<p>After the original opening&nbsp;on installation (everything seemed to go ok), I closed AIM, right clicked on the desktop icon and selected 'pin to start' then deleted the desktop icon, I rearranged start to accommodate the App and then clicked to run AIM; nothing
 happened ??!!</p>
<p>The only way I could&nbsp;get it to run&nbsp;was to right click on the App, select More, then 'Run as Administrator', USC opened on clicking Yes 'program can make changes to&nbsp;my PC',&nbsp;the App opened. I Closed AIM, clicked it; again nothing happened, had to do the above
 again.</p>
<p>Knowing a little about programs; I went into the folder containing the .EXE file for AIM and went into Properties, then Compatibilities and clicked&nbsp;'Run this Program as an Administrator'. The App now runs, but not before UAC asks me to say 'Yes' to the program
 being able to make changes to my PC.</p>
<p>What is the point of making an App/Program run as Administrator if you have to approve through UAC all the time?</p>
<p>How do I stop UAC asking me for permission every time, without turning it off? Is there a&nbsp;UAC Screen where I can&nbsp;identify App/Programs that are not MS specific (3rd party) as not needing my permission to make changes to my PC?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            accidentally edited registry without backing up...can&#39;t run any .exe files</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first post here and it's for a major issue I caused for myself...I was attempting to troubleshoot a problem with .exe files not opening. I am running on a Windows 10 machine but thought this old Windows 7/Vista solution might work for me. Little
 did I know I would end up being incredibly stressed out.</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2688326#bookmark-fixitformealways</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the manual options and as you can guess, I edited the registry values for .exe files. Unfortunately I forgot to back up my registry and even without rebooting all .exe files were instantly unusable--I can't even use a system restore. Upon clicking
 any .exe the system simply prompts me to choose an app with which to open it. It would be a simple fix if I could go back into regedit to make a modification, but that's a .exe, as well as any fix-it software I might be able to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please help me figure this out? I've restarted my computer and explorer.exe seems to be loading fine, so I think my machine can still open them successfully? Any help would be greatly appreciated, as I have no idea what to do. I've considered
 editing a .reg file and importing/uploading it but since the system is always using the registry files I can't copy it over, at least as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't believe I made such an error today :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!!!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response AntonyJose, but your answer is not helpful at all. You post a link to how to use regedit.exe, but as I explicitly mention in the original post I cannot open regedit, or I would have resolved this problem already. Let me try to explain
 the problem a different way.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">If you'll look again at the link I posted, I change a property of .exe files themselves. If you go to the properties of a .exe file, under the General tab there is a "Type of file". I don't know how to
 post screenshots but instead of saying "Application (.exe.)" it says "&lt;myjunkvalue&gt; (.exe.)" where &lt;myjunkvalue&gt; is what I changed the registry value to--this is the value in the help link I posted in my original post.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Perhaps a better question would be: how can I change the "Type of file" to be read as "Application" again by the OS? Or alternatively, how can I have the OS open a .exe file as an Application again? Even
 if there is a one-time way to open a .exe file as normal again I can fix my issue.</span></p>

            <p>What about trying to start in troubleshooter mode. At the login screen hold down shift and click power&gt;restart. (power icon bottom right)</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there you might be able to launch just a command prompt and regedit might work from there. I don't know if your changes to the registry would affect the system when the UI isn't loaded.</p>

                    <p>I am trying to sort this out for a friend who is using a 9 year old Dell laptop running Windows Vista. A month ago&nbsp; his grandson deleted his Skype account and it had to be reinstalled. Since then he has tried skype to skype video and phone only calls with
 multiple recipients and no matter what we try, we cannot hear any sound.</p>
<p>We have;</p>
<ul>
<li>ensured that there are no issues software/hardware at the other end</li><li>tested the sound with other programmes - no problem with speakers/headphones</li><li>uninstalled and reinstalled skype</li><li>called several contacts, always the same, they can hear us, we can't hear them</li><li>tried both with and without video</li><li>ensured internet speed at both ends is adequate</li><li>made several test calls - no sound</li><li>tried several different browsers - chrome, firefox, explorer</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I learned Windows Vista requires Skype 8.9.0.1&nbsp;<span>for Windows Desktop and something called
</span>DirectX (v9.0 or higher) but whenever we download Skype we are only offered Skype 8.11.0.4.

<p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I was in his house using his Compaq Presario Notebook PC series pre_installed with Genuine Windows Vista Home Premium Edition (sorry I said Dell earlier). His audio drivers have been updated recently. I have just advised him to update to the latest version
 of windows explorer - previously he was using chrome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, when I call him (or he calls me) on my iPhone, iPad or PC, I can see &amp; hear him, but he can only see me, can't hear anything. This is happening with all his other callers also.</p>
<p>The problem only exists with his laptop, my windows 10 PC etc all Skype fine. He cannot hear anything when he runs a test call either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span>You might even be able to add multiple tuners (for example, two individual tuners, one dual tuner, or one combo tuner) to your computer. Multiple tuners enable you to record one channel while
 watching another or to record two shows simultaneously</span></p>

            hi Swathi,<br />
<br />
As I asked, I have a 3rd tv tuner ready to install, but will W Media Center recognize it. I have been told that WMC Vista Prem only recognizes 2 tuners. I was hoping to add a 3rd tv tuner card and have WMC recognize it too as a 3rd tuner so I could record 3
 TV shows at the same time. I am now recording 2 TV shows at the same time. <br />
Thanks in advance.

            Yes, thanks, your timing was great and it confirms what I was told. I was searching Microsoft Windows sites and found the same info there
<strong>"Windows Media Center supports a maximum of two analog TV tuners and two digital TV tuners per computer. (If your setup includes Digital Cable Tuners, the maximum is two Digital Cable Tuners.)".</strong> Oh well I wonder about W7, more than 2 tv tuners,
 does anyone know in W7???? I also wonder why they can't or won't support more than 2 tv tuners?????<br />
<br />
Thanks again

            This is just a guess on my part and could be completely wrong, however, my best guess would be that since, if I understand it correctly, you can only have a single source, antenna or cable, you are already splitting the signal in half. You are also recording
 two channels even if you are recording one and watching the other. This is why you can rewind a live TV show.&nbsp; If you split the signal a third time, not only would you weaken the signal again you'd be attempting to record three shows at once.&nbsp; Depending on
 your system and the hardware you have, this might just be more than the average system could handle.&nbsp; Again, this is just a guess on my part, but, I hope it helps.

            Thanks again, I am using an 8 output AMPLIFIED splitter and "the crazy person that I am" I am recording 6 TV shows at the same time on my 3 Media Center computers, each with 2750GB HDD (2-500gb, 1-750GB, and 1-1000). Yes I am trying to learn new stuff,
 I'm retired and just playing. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for your input.

            Retired myself, but, on a fixed income so not a lot of playing anymore!&nbsp; (was retired a few years back for health reasons)&nbsp; You must have a super antenna or cable signal!&nbsp; Nothing wrong with playing.&nbsp; You may also want to check out Tom's Hardware, the
 web site not the old hardware stores, and NewEgg's Eggpert forums with computer questions.&nbsp; Just FYI.

            I use both of them, including Microsoft's forums too. No antenna, just Comcast Cable. And as for the&nbsp;8 output cable splitter I got it on eBay for $28.00 including shipping, brand new, works great. I also got my 4 TV tuner cards on eBay at an average of
 $30.00 and my high power refurbished Gateway Media Center Computers (FX7029E, GM5457E, and 838GM) over the past 4 years from TigerDirect.com at an average of $600.00 including 3&nbsp; different 22" Acer X Series LCD displays (1 new and 2 refurbished, I just can't
 seem to turn down a bargain)&nbsp;. Bought my Segate HDD's from Newegg.com, usually best price, free ship, and no FL sales tax(much better than Tiger). I use them for my hobby of watching the stockmarket and doing some five to ten minute day trading when the trends
 look good to me, it's been bad since last September but it has been improving lately.<br />

Thanks again

<h2>            How can I get 25 cents off my Xbox live cart price&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to buy “the evil within” while it’s still cheap before january, the game is $6.60 but all I have is $6.42... is there some kind of discount code or something to take off 25 cents? It’s so aggrevating to have to add atleast $5 just because I need 25 cents... if anyone can help me before it goes back to 19.99 that’s would be the best christmas present ever.&nbsp;</p>

<div>I am not sure at what stage you right click. If I drag and drop, then the operation is finished. If I right click on the original file or folder, it does not give an option to Copy Here. I tried copying the original folder or file first, then going to
 the destination folder and I could paste using a right click, but I could not find Copy Here. Are you using Windows 7?</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I am using 7 and this applies to XP and Vista as well. If you left click, drag and drop, the process is over. If you right click, when you release the mouse key you should see a pop-up with the options to Move Here, Copy Here and Cancel. Left click is fine,
 the right click just gives you a chance of redemption if the files end up in the wrong place.</p>

<h2>            Samsung laptop touchpad not working after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have updated my laptop from Windows 8.1 to 10, and right after that, my touchpad (Elan Smart-Pad ver. 11.7.33.1)&nbsp;no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the method in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/touchpad-is-not-working-after-windows-10-upgrade/1d59fac3-7a24-480a-8b5f-15da5bdcad80?auth=1">

<p>
</p><p>I also tried enabling my touchpad under the Settings and indeed the cursor works and moves but the "left" and "right" button does not work at all. Worse, each time I reboot my laptop, my touchpad stopped working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please. Otherwise I will have to revert back to Windows 8.1 which is not what I want. =(</p>

    <title>My Hard Drive With Windows 10 died. How can&#47;should I reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan242  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Hard Drive With Windows 10 died. How can&#47;should I reinstall it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Turned on my computer last night and heard a crunching sound coming from my hard drive before it finally kicked the bucket. I immediately ordered a new one and need to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to Windows 10 about a month ago from a pre-installed copy of Windows 7. The Windows 10 OS was activated during the install, but I don't have a product key for it, nor did I think one was needed. I still have my Windows 7 product key which is listed
 on a sticker on my laptop. I currently have no media to install Windows 7 with. There was a recovery partition on my computer, but the laptop's manufacturer had the bright idea of putting it on the drive that died, so that's a no go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would be my best option for me to re-install Windows 10? Do I have to install windows 7 with the original product key and then upgrade? Or can I just do a clean install of Windows 10 using an ISO made from the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply Sayed, but I may not have been clear in my original message. Basically, I had to install Windows 10 on a new drive since the one I originally had upgraded it on died. Running Recovery wouldn't work because my original drive could
 no longer be read, I did create the Windows 10 ISO, but I installed it as a new Installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, because I had already upgraded and activated Windows 10 prior to my hard drive dying, I was safe. It appears Windows 10 activates itself based on your system's computer ID and doesn't need a specific key to install. Since all I did was change
 the drive, and not my motherboard, cpu, etc. stayed the same, Microsoft recognized the computer and activated my newly installed copy of Windows 10. No need to re-install Windows 7 and upgrade all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's great that Windows 10 activates this way. No matter how many times your hard drive dies, you'll still be able to legally install a copy, providing you upgraded to Windows 10 and activated it before the hard drive blew up.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, Ajay -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry i didn't reply sooner, &nbsp;but reinstalling was easy. &nbsp;I followed the instructions in this article. -http://www.howtogeek.com/224342/how-to-clean-install-windows-10/ and a few of the steps in the reply to my original post</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have a bootable windows 10 install dvd available, you'll be able to boot it up and install it on the new drive as long as the drive is in the computer you originally installed and activated Windows 10 on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I tried to reinstall Windows 10 on a new hard drive (it was running on my old hard drive last week until it died) but it won't recognize that my computer was running Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7) for some reason. &nbsp;I've tried to call Microsoft all
 day but keep getting disconnected when I am being transferred to technical support. &nbsp;I tried to use their chat option, but the technician only tells me that the free period to upgrade to Windows 10 has ended, even though I told him a few times that I had Windows
 10 on this same computer, albeit a different hard drive, just last week. &nbsp;Do you happen to know what I do in this situation? &nbsp;Is there a step I'm missing or something? &nbsp;Do I have to start again from Windows 7 (using my activation key) and then use the Windows
 upgrade tool to get back to Windows 10? &nbsp;Is there a way to get my Windows 10 key from a dead hard drive or an outside source?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I had Windows 8, then 8.1, on my first hard drive. &nbsp;When that drive crashed and I was told I needed a new one, I took the new hard drive, the installation disk with the activation key, and computer tower to have it repaired. &nbsp;The gentleman couldn't find
 my activation key, which was printed on the envelope with the disk, so he downloaded Windows 7 and upgraded to 10 from there. &nbsp;I have the key he used to activate Windows 7 to do the upgrade to Windows 10, but do not currently have Windows 7 on a usb. &nbsp;When
 that hard drive would not read after a week, I obtained a replacement drive and attempted to use my Windows 10 usb to download the operating system. &nbsp;After being unable to use the drive, and not knowing Windows 10 had been upgraded from something other than
 my Windows 8 key, I put my Windows 8 disc in the drive and installed that. &nbsp;When I could then not upgrade to Windows 10, I contacted the gentleman again and he told me about using a different key. &nbsp;I tried to upgrade again to Windows 10, using the activation
 key I had from Windows 7, and also trying to have the computer validate the key itself, but I have had no luck.)</p>

There are many pdf to doc converters in the net. Some are free, some you have to pay for.<br />
<br />
I use this and it works for me : Free PDF TO Word Doc Converter 1.1<br />
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Free-PDF-To-Word-Doc-Converter/3000-2079_4-10792870.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Free-PDF-To-Word-Doc-Converter/3000-2079_4-10792870.html</a><br />
<br />
If you don't want to install any more softwares than you have to, you can use the Online convertion.<br />
Here are 2 examples :<br />
