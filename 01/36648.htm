                    I purchased a a key&nbsp; for win's 64 bit&nbsp;7 Ultimate full off an auction website on 4/24/10 to install on my laptop&nbsp;but the download&nbsp;link seller provided&nbsp;doesn't want to work and&nbsp;seller says&nbsp;the link is only good for 24hrs and that sometimes it doesn't work
 ,I have used the link before when I purchased &amp;&nbsp;downloaded the 32 bit version of the same Win's 7 system on my desktop and had no problems getting link to work then&nbsp;,I have checked my Bitdefender&nbsp;security suite system and it's not blocking it,and when I click
 the security bar at top of window and allow it to download the&nbsp;file the link&nbsp;won't work,I need a solution for this problem before link expires on4/23/10.

<p>If they only offered a key that Windows 7 key was probably illegaly sold to you. Get a refund - NOW.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Store and Digital River are the only two sites authorized to sell downloads of Windows 7.</p>

<p>Windows 7 Illegal Sales on eBay<br />
<br />
Many sellers illegally offer Windows 7 product keys for a very cheap price on ebay. If you see Windows 7 being sold well below the retail price for only the Windows 7 product key and the install software is not included do not buy it. There is a reason it's
 so cheap - don't waste your money.<br />

    <title>Disable full screen view when window dragged to top of screen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prskater  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable full screen view when window dragged to top of screen&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to disable the function by which a window is expanded full screen size when dragged to the top of the screen?
<br />
<br />
I imagine some people find it useful to have a full screen for their programs, namely graphic applications. But when I am arranging my screen, I like to place the top of the program right on the top edge of my screen. This is something I can't do now- without
 activating the full-blown full-screen behavior.<br />
<br />
Help!<br />

<p>VCRuntime140.dll is a component of the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime library.&nbsp; Typically, it should be installed by whatever application you're trying to run that is causing the error message.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the file is present, you have one sort of issue.&nbsp; If it's not there, you have to get if from someplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try uninstalling and re-installing whatever application is causing the problem.&nbsp; A well-packaged application ought to include everything it needs, without assuming that the user already has necessary files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise you can download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package.&nbsp; I don't know which one your application might need.&nbsp; Take your pick here (I'd go with 2017 ... just because):&nbsp;

            I was finally able to install the redistributable package only after installing the Visual C Community. Am running Windows update now but it appears to be the same problem; stalls out on checking for updates. Will let it run and see what happens.

            Hi TakingCactus 
<br />
<br />I am sorry to say, Windows 12 is an Internet myth, there will be no Windows 12 
<br />
<br />When support for Windows 8 ends, Microsoft will re-brand Windows 10 to just Windows 
<br />
<br />The model Microsoft are using going forward is, twice yearly a new version of Windows (called a Feature Update) will be released. That feature update will include any new Functionality and features available for Windows and will deprecate older features 
<br />
<br />That way, once your PC is up to date, you will always have the latest version of Windows. This is something like the Office 365 model, with the one exception, Windows 10 feature updates are free and there is no subscription .

            By default, the Disk Defragmenter should be running daily.&nbsp; Typically it's around 1:00 a.m. every day.&nbsp; You can check this by going to Start --&gt; Programs--&gt; Accessories --&gt; System Tools--&gt; Disk Defragmenter.&nbsp; Or, you can get there by pressing your Windows
 Key and the "R" key to bring up a Run.. box and typing defrag.exe and clicking OK.<br />
<br />
As I'm currently on a Windows 7 computer, I can't guarantee that you can change the schedule from the defragmenter window.&nbsp; However, you can perform a manual run from the window.<br />
<br />
*** I can tell you that in Windows 7, you can configure the schedule, and I believe that you can from Vista as well.****<br />
<br />
If this doesn't answer your question, please provide more specifics such as where you're trying to schedule the defragmenting from (inside of Defrag or "Scheduled Tasks") and what messages you're receiving if any.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you, and have&nbsp;a great day:)&nbsp; <br />
Patrick.

<h2>            Unidentified Network</h2>
                    <p>I own a HP Pavillion 500 PC. There have been quite a few issues with my ethernet cable in the last month, saying there was an "unidentified network".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the last few times, I just unplugged the cable and it fixed itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time it came up with '"Ethernet" doesn't have a valid IP configuration', I've tried everything. Here is a list of things I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting Router</p>
<p>Unplugging and replugging the cable.</p>
<p>Restarting PC</p>
<p>System Restore</p>
<p>"netsh" sollution</p>
<p>"ipconfig" sollution (doesn't show a default gateway)</p>
<p>I cannot connect to the default gateway unless you're wondering whether the internet is blocked.</p>
<p>I'm using the <span><strong>Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest a sollution because really nothing is working for me.</p>

    <title>Unable to connect to college WiFi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> enr0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to connect to college WiFi</h2>
                    I'm getting really annoyed.<br />
<br />
Okay, so I see my junior college's wifi, I click on it, it prompts me for the username and password.<br />
<br />
I type in "student" and "4wifi" and it should be as simple as that. But...<br />
<br />
First of all it seems to try to do something for a sec or two and then just goes right back to asking me for the username and password.<br />
It does this several times (maybe 3-5 times)<br />
THEN it tells me that it can't verify the server's identity! So it gives me two options, "Connect" or "Don't Connect"<br />
obviously I click connect and what do you know? It asks for the damn username and password again. No error messages or anything.<br />
But then there's other times where from that screen it says "verifying and connecting" and simply never connects.<br />
<br />
I've searched online everywhere but no one can solve my problem!<br />
I'm trying to find a way to disable the use of certificates or whatever so that it won't complain about the server identity but I don't even know if it's possible.<br />
<br />

    <title>Have to reboot modem every start up and when computer sleeps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rlong66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have to reboot modem every start up and when computer sleeps</h2>
                    <p>Just set up HP Envy with Windows 10 (first time working with 10), Comcast Xfinity service, and Netgear CM600 modem. Main problem is upon start up or waking from sleep the modem has to be reset by disconnecting the cable from the computer or modem for 1 minute;
 originally shut down the modem to fix but found out this was not necessary. Obviously working around the sleep problem was easy but still a small pain upon start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everybody tells me its the modem but it works fine once I disconnect and reconnect. During first week, I had to change two Window settings to prevent Windows updates from being blocked; basically had to do with Comcast internet being metered and the settings
 for metered internet had to be turned off. Are there modem settings I also need to change for metered internet and Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            Hello 
<br />How are you, based on your problem, I found this information that helps you 
<br />
<br />The first thing I can recommend is to make a factory reset of your computer and try to connect it if it presents the same problem we can try placing another modem. if it continues to fail it could be a synchronization failure, check if you have the antivirus activated, firewal. Through the support of Netgear you can test the equipment is also an option.
<br />
<br />We can also fix or use the problem repair, check drivers, in windows 10 to see if it is not a system failure

 week, but can't believe I may have had so much trouble because of a couple of checked boxes.</p>

<p>OK, worked for two days and then had to start disconnecting the modem again. From your instructions and also what I had seen with searches, the power setting looked like the easiest fix so that is what I did first, unfortunately did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the troubleshooting next, Windows could not find anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing I did the update driver. Rather than giving me a list of drivers to roll back to, it just went ahead and updated, and then after gave me the option to roll back. So I took a chance and re-started the computer with the update, and everything started
 up ok. Big difference is even when I could get the connection to work previously, my OneDrive icon was always grey and said not connected. Now its white and says up to date. So hoping this is what was the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will see if holds up more than two days this time.</p>

<p>Had no problems since updating the driver, internet working fine and now have router hooked up and running.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the advice, I was taught a long time ago never to update drivers as a last resort because one of quickest ways to mess up a functioning computer was to update a driver for no reason, so would have been the last thing I would I done.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have realised after the recent Windows 10 Update that startup has been delayed. During startup I have monitored task manager and 100% of the disk usage is by COM Surrogate.

<h2>            High DPC latency &#40;usbport.sys, directx&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have seen this issue reported by dozens of people over dozens of websites but I have yet to find an adequate fix to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 Pro Version 1803 Build 17134.590.&nbsp; I have recently noticed that if I attempt to play games while I'm voice chatting on a discord server, the game lags horribly and the audio in the voice chat stutters and breaks up badly.&nbsp; I began
 to research the situation only to find that it is everywhere and that no one seems to be able to completely fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed the most recent device drivers for all of my devices, but this has had no effect because the driver in question is used by a Microsoft default device (Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller, Standard OpenHCD USB Host Controller).&nbsp;
 I run LatencyMon in order to get the stats for my system, and it has been an eye opener.&nbsp; I'm not really sure why I have these Microsoft host controller drivers installed when I installed the actual drivers for my motherboard, but it is really really really
 making my life difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what information you need from me and I'll supply it.&nbsp; I could just do a huge info dump but I'd rather just give the relevant data as needed instead.</p>

            HI SFPsychoDane ... How do you know that?
<br />Meaning what utility are you using to view that information?
<br />Also, try rebooting your DSL modem and your PC.
<br />And if your outlook is connected to say gmail then go to a browser login to your Gmail account.
<br />See if there is a large file that is trying to download or lots of messages?
<br />Could be your email got a virus and is getting hundreds of messages and outlook is trying to sync them.

            I don't even use outlook . .&nbsp;<br />
I do have a Hotmail address, but I don't even have Windows Edge open nor do have my Hotmail page open.<br />
Also I have no large emails after such activity.<br />
But I notice the activity in my task manager and it tells me the process that is using all the bandwidth&nbsp;

            yeah that's odd.
<br />Try this.
<br />Go to Mail and click accounts.
<br />Remove all the accounts that you have in there.
<br />Reboot.
<br />Does it still persist?

    <title>Repeated, machine-gun beeping instead of single beep Win 7 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dspeakes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeated, machine-gun beeping instead of single beep Win 7 64 bit</h2>
                    Recently I had a Dell Inspiron 1750 laptop computer with Win 7 and 64 bit processor.&nbsp; I had a problem with it early on that I didn't bother reporting to Dell because it was intermittent.&nbsp; When pressing the Caps Lock or Num Lock key (with Toggle Keys "on")
 sometimes I would get the appropriate single beep indicating on or off . . . and sometimes the beep would "stick" and continue beeping until I either muted the sound completely, changed the volume level, or activated some other sound which would override and
 cancel the repeated beeping.&nbsp; (The KEY didn't stick, just the beeping wouldn't stop.)&nbsp; Mostly I just kept the sound muted.&nbsp; (I did not know that "toggle keys" was a controllable feature at that point -- it came from the factory with "toggle keys" in the ON
 position.)<br />
<br />
Eventually the computer developed a display issue so I sent it in to Square Trade for repair and also told them about the beeping.&nbsp; Their solution was to turn off Toggle Keys.&nbsp; Not amused.&nbsp; But I also noticed that occasionally when scrolling a screen where
 I would hit the "top" or "bottom" I was hearing a repeated beeping from the system speaker/motherboard/whatever it is instead of a single, end of page beep.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I sent it back in for service again when I realized the display problem was recurring, and again asked them to FIX, not TURN OFF the beeping.<br />
<br />
It came back unchanged, I warrantied the computer out (sent it back for a refund, for those who may not be familiar with Square Trades warranties) and replaced it with a similarly-equipped Toshiba Satellite, also with Win 7 and 64 bit.<br />
<br />
It was music to my ears to hear a single beep for Caps Lock and Num Lock.&nbsp; For about a week and a half.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Today I hit the Caps Lock key and it went off like a machine gun, exactly like the Dell had been doing.<br />
<br />
Pardon me while I deliver a primal scream..................<br />
<br />
I have googled and searched to no avail and can't find any instance of anyone else complaining about this on a Win 7 machine.&nbsp; Am I just lucky?<br />
<br />
I can't believe I'm having this same problem on both a Dell manufactured in the first two months of Windows 7 and a Toshiba manufactured two years later.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; I don't want to just mask the symptoms; yes, I know I can turn off Toggle Keys, and I have done so.&nbsp; But I WANT it to beep for Caps Lock and Num Lock, and I know it is doing the repeated beep NOT through the speakers for other things that
 should give a single beep.&nbsp; So it's not a Toggle Keys thing, it's just most evident there.<br />
<br />
Help!&nbsp; No, I haven't called Toshiba yet.&nbsp; I'd like to hear what the REAL experts -- other users -- have to say before I get their techies on the line.&nbsp; Since the problem occurred on two different brands, I suspect it's either a Windows 7 problem or it's a hardware
 problem on a part used by both manufacturers.&nbsp; I'm somewhat savvy with computers but by no means a geek or techie.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help, suggestions, or sympathetic clucking noises.<br />
<br />

 that software is not stable on Win 7/64 bit.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If someone finds my post because the same thing is happening, they should try turning off that "background" sampling software and see if the problem stops, and report it to their representative.&nbsp; In the meantime turning off Toggle Keys or muting the computer
 will calm it (and you) until you can decide if uninstalling the software is the best solution<br />
<br />
I just realized that the software in question had been installed on the new Toshiba only Friday, and the computer had behaved prior to that and only started malfunctioning today (I may not have had occasion to press Caps Lock yesterday).<br />
<br />
(To clarify my first post, the Dell computer was warrantied out due to the display problem that persisted, NOT the beeping problem.&nbsp; I would have kept it and muted the computer if it had only been that.)<br />

</li></ol>
<p><span>We understand your concern however, you won’t get a product key in free upgradation. It’s the same product key of your previous OS. All you need to have is a legitimate Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 or Windows 8.1 with all Updates.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There are only a couple of reasons for asking for a key.&nbsp; A clean install before upgrading, or an OS that does not qualify (enterprise, etc.)</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking question in Microsoft Community. I will give my best to help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that you receive blue screen error: 0x0000006f when you start Windows 7 64bit.
</span><span>If I am wrong, please let me know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>For better understanding of the issue, answer the following questions.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What is the make and model of the computer? </span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may perform the methods suggested below and check if they help you fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Try to start the computer in safe mode and perform hardware clean boot.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Refer this link to start your PC in safe mode with networking:</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Perform hardware Clean Boot and check whether Blue Screen of Death error occurs or not.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Hardware clean boot is a troubleshooting technique that allows you to get the computer up and running with minimal hardware (disabling Display adapter, network adapter and sound card devices) so that you can perform diagnostic tests to determine which
 hardware of the normal boot process are causing problems. </span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Start button”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on “Computer” menu and choose “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right Click on Sound Card, modem, Network Adapter, Display Adapter, CD/DVD drive and click disable. (If you are playing game online, please do not disable network adapter)</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Then enable the drive one by one to determine which is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Once you found the device which is causing the issue, please uninstall and reinstall the driver for the device and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: Download and install the updated device drivers from the manufacturer Website.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Microsoft doesn’t recommend you to leave the computer in Hardware clean boot mode. So, please set your computer to normal boot mode after performing the troubleshooting steps by enabling all the devices.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>How to set your computer back to boot normal:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Start button”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on “Computer” menu and choose “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right Click on Sound Card, modem, Network Adapter, Display Adapter, CD/DVD drive and click Enable.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: It is always recommended to install driver from the respective manufacturer website. Please download and install the driver from the manufacturer Website.</span></b></p>

With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so.

    <title>Windows Explorer freezes when plugging in external hardrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahyt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer freezes when plugging in external hardrive</h2>
                    Hi everyone, I have a brand new dell precision 4400 with 8G memory, and it comes with windows 7 64bit.
<br />
Whenever i plug in my external hard drive the window explorer just freezes(the green ribbon shows up, moves very slowly, and eventually stops at some point), If i am lucky i can click into a few folders, but after a few clicks it would freeze anyway, nothing
 stops the freezing or closes the windows explorer except unplugging the hard rive. This shouldn't be the problem of my external hard drive since it works perfectly well on other computers, and i also tried 4 other hard drive on my laptop and the same problem
 occurred to all of them.&nbsp; I searched online and tried all possible solutions, including: disable Windows Search, disable thumbnail display, etc, but none of them worked. I found a post saying it's a "issue in the NVidia chipset with 64bit EHCI buffer handling
 on systems with greater than 4 Gb RAM" so I installed the suggested hotfix kb976972, but it didn't work either. Does anyone have some idea about this?<br />
<br />
Thanks!

<p>Hi<strong> SarahYT,</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
A) Does the issue occour when you connect the device to a different port?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to connect the device and check if it is enabled from the device manager or not.<br />
<br />
<strong>The System File Checker tool</strong><br />
To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files
 by using the correct versions.</p>
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
1. Cick Start,and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
2. Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. <br />
&nbsp; If&nbsp; you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
3. At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved. If the issue that you are experiencing is not resolved, use the procedure that is described in the "The System Restore tool" section.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a workaround you may perform an online scan on your computer and check for the issue.<br />
<br />
Now visit the below provided link to perform an online scan on your computer.<br />

<h2>            Nero 7 install problem</h2>

 I get a message, Could not access network location %APPDATA% \. I'm not familiar with this problem, can anyone help me with this headache please.

            first use this tutorial to install. <br />

<br />
Second, there are issues with Nero 7 and Vista, I would recommend you go to a nero version that is Vista compatabile. Also in that pdf in that link is a clean up utility you can use. Clean up with the util prior to reinstalling.

<p><span>I am very anxious to discover this console, since I like streaming services. The only flaw is that probably the games will all be digital and non-refundable, theoretically have also done some tests and everything works, but since it should exit the
 normal version, this console will not go out on the market before, unless they come out popular games like fifa, cod, halo, maybe there is some chance that comes out in 2019 but I do not think it would be nice, and they should not put the gold. The console
 will virtually keep it, or rather more than a console insert 4 motherboards in the case of the project, and play titles in streaming to 4 other consoles from streaming or mobile devices,</span></p>
<p><span>These houses will possibly have everything in one, like cooling fans and even a single power supply, without USB outputs, HDMI, and without an internal hard drive almost certainly. Downloading</span><span>&nbsp;videogames on the cloud may be slower, but
 I would not exclude it because the cloud does not know how it's done. For the rest, all the controllers should be connected in their own box,&nbsp;</span>and have a receveir WiFi , built-in receveir or ethernet support.</p>
<p><span>It would cost even or even less than Nintendo Switch, but it mounts all the essentials for healthy gaming fun</span></p>
