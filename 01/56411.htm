<h2>            Receiving an error at startup error&#58; C&#58;&#92;Program Data&#92;sytem 32&#92;gameux.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error</h2>
                    <p>*Original title: <strong>gameux.dll error</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently been receiving an error at startup related to gameux.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Program Data\...\gameux.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error.&nbsp; Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contract your system administrator or the software vendor for support."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I later discovered that my Norton 360 had quarantined the gameux.dll file a couple of weeks ago marked as high risk Trojan Horse.&nbsp; After scanning that file in Norton's quarantine folder, it seems it is not a problem and was not actually a virus.&nbsp; Then I
 looked in the windows System 32 folder and found that the gameux.dll file is actually still there.&nbsp; Maybe Windows repopulated it.&nbsp; Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be working.&nbsp; Maybe an incompatible version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to put the old file in System 32, but ran into "TrustedInstaller" owner issues, which I didn't want to change without a little more guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas of where I should go from here?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>I'm not sure if you saw my updated post, but I'm pretty sure this issue stems from Norton 360 marking the gameux.dll file as a possible virus.&nbsp; It quarantined the file.&nbsp; Windows apparently repopulated the Windows\System32 folder with a new gameux.dll file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a couple of programs may have been pointing to the old quarantined gameux.dll file.&nbsp; Norton had put it in&nbsp;a hidden folder located in c:\programdata.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I deleted this quarantined version of gameux.dll and problem solved.&nbsp; No more errors on startup!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you receive a&nbsp;flash screen error after installing Windows 10. We will help you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may arise due to the driver conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to plug in an external monitor to the pc and restart the computer to check the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open Task Manager by pressing <strong>Alt+Ctrl+Del</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>File</strong>.</span></p>

<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Restart your computer.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>I also suggest you to perform SFC scan after updating the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong><span> is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Press the <strong><span>Windows button + X</span></strong> on your keyboard, a mini dialogue box will appear.<br />
2.&nbsp;Choose Command Prompt (Admin). You must run the command prompt in Administrator level.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the command prompt type <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong> and hit enter.<br />
4.&nbsp;If everything went okay and no errors were found, restart your computer and see if the issue re-occurs.</span></p>

<h2>            Computer shuts down unexpectedly</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>While watching streaming video on ie 8 (mlb.tv), after a while an error message box will appear for a couple of seconds and then the laptop completely shuts down.&nbsp; I am using Windows Vista.&nbsp; The computer doesn't shut down while simply browsing the internet,
 only when streaming video.</p>
<p>I can't read the entire message fast enough before it shuts down, but what I've gleaned is something about<strong><em>autocomplete ie explorer.</em></strong></p>
<p>I disabled autocomplete in tools - internet options - content - autocomplete, but it's still happening.</p>
<p>Any ideas or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<div>Hi <strong>KCLionsFan</strong>,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First I would suggest you to disable any security program on your computer and check if it resolves the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After checking for the issue you need to re-enable the security program on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the above method did not fix the issue and as you have tried all the possible methods to resolve issue to no avail I would suggest you to try to perform Internet Explorer Optimization on your computer and check for the issue.<br />

    <title>Why can Win10 Nodes Will Check In With WSUS But Not Pull Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t.m. builder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can Win10 Nodes Will Check In With WSUS But Not Pull Updates &#40;0x8024401c&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have a Windows Server 2016 running WSUS (WID Database). The nodes on my system are all Windows 10 Professional. They are configured through group policy to check the Server 2016 for updates. The nodes and server are not behind a proxy in anyway.</p>
<p>Based on the WSUS Console it shows all the nodes are checking in when I press "Check for Updates". When you look on the node it throws the following message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for informaiotn, this may help: (0x8024401c)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have googled this error and I have found little information or none at all for this error. I have tried all of the suggestions I could find but nothing has resolved this issue. What I can make out of the last .ELT file when I open it with word is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There was an error communicating with the endpoint at <a href="http://fqdn:8530/ClientWebService/client.asmx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://FQDN:8530/ClientWebService/client.asmx</span></a>. There was an error receiving the HTTP reply. The operation did not complete within the time allotted.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I do a <code><span>Get-WindowsUpdateLog</span></code> in PowerShell I just get a long list of updates it can't find. No actual communication information.</p>
<p>I can get to that link if I put it in to a browser and the firewall is not blocking WSUS. What am I missing? Can anyone supply me with any other information. I am also still learning how to actually read ELT files using the correct procedure.
</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong> Attempting to run the Characters and WDK10 on the client to interpret the ELT files better.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> Running the <code><span>tracefmt.exe</span></code> tool gives me the following Error:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cannot Open logfile for reading</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This happens on everyone. I do see from TraceView from the SDK tool kit that all the events show system times and No Format Information found. Is it connected and not getting this data or is it just looking for all these updates?</p>

    <title>Removing the bing search box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ijustwanttoaskaquestionnotfilloutabunchofstuff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing the bing search box</h2>
                    Hi;<br />
<br />
All the questions I have seen about removing bing have involved changing to a different search provider.&nbsp; I just want to get rid of the extra bing search box, as I see no reason for it and it takes up room I'd rather have for seeing long url's.<br />
<br />
How do I get rid of this box (and how do I get rid of the favorites button on the tab bar)?<br />
<br />
Thanks;<br />
<br />
Amy

            Well, first, I'll start by telling you that the search box is a great functionality in Internet Explorer. You can directly search in your favorite search engine (Bing or otherwise) without having to first navigate to the engine's web page. Having said
 that, if you still want to get rid of it, this is how:<br />
<br />
If you have Internet Explorer 7 you'll need to access the Windows Registry, click the Run... button in the start menu, if its not there, press
<strong>Windows + R</strong>. (The Windows key is the one with the Windows logo in your keyboard)&nbsp;Then type
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong> and press enter.<br />
<br />
You should see a window named Local Group Policy Editor<br />
<br />
Select Local Computer Policy.<br />
Go to User Configuration.<br />
Select Administrative Templates<br />
Then go to Windows Components<br />
Select Internet Explorer<br />
<br />
Then on the right you should see a lot of settings, select the one named Prevent Internet Explorer search box from displaying, set it to Enabled.<br />
<br />
Next time you open your Internet Explorer it will be without the search box.<br />
<br />
As for the favorites button, a right click on the bar in Internet Explorer, deselect the check mark in Favorites bar. That should do the trick.<br />

            Thanks for that first.<br />
<br />
As for the second, nothing happens when I right click on the bar.&nbsp; Also, why can't I right click on the back and forward buttons to skip forward and back in history in this browser?&nbsp; Even the little down arrow next to the forward button doesn't do anything.

<h2>            My Logitech headphone no longer connects to my Dell under Windows 10</h2>
                    My Logitech wireless headphone no longer connects to my Dell running Windows 10.&nbsp; They worked since last June, but now I cannot connect them wirelessly using the bluetooth software that came with the computer.&nbsp; Occasionally they show up as connected but
 after several seconds they revert back to disconnected.&nbsp; The trouble started after&nbsp; Microsoft Technician, when trying to fix my Bluescreen problem
<p><span><span>1.<span> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>disabled Google, Apple, Adobe and Dell services (and possibly Bluetooth and other services), causing numerous shortcuts to disappear from my desktop, and claimed to have fixed the problem which he blamed on the system cache.&nbsp; The blue screen
 problem has not gone away and now I cannot connect my headphones</p>

            <p>Could you tell what model computer you have and what handles your Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth?&nbsp; Since Dell has so many models available, please be specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Bluetooth disconnects are you getting any tones?&nbsp; Some older equipment has been caught in the upgrade changes.&nbsp; If you system is older, it might be one of those.&nbsp; If that is the case the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth adapter may be easy to replace.&nbsp; I assume
 you have the latest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth drivers and keep in mind, on my system Dell posted two new Bluetooth drivers only 3 days apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us what you think is causing the Blue Screens?&nbsp; Have you posted those dump files in another thread for scrutiny?

            <p><span>I have a Dell XPS 8900 computer running Windows 10.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>Purchased this computer at the end of May 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>And yes, we are aware<br />
of the issue with the drivers but we do not know which driver version is<br />
the latest.&nbsp; Our driver is from July 2015 and it is Version 12.0.1.654.&nbsp; We<br />
run the update software and it says we have the latest driver.&nbsp; This driver<br />
used to work.&nbsp; Looks like there are later ones but the DW 1560 Bluetooth<br />
4.0 LE update we ran says we have the latest driver.<br />
<br />
We have a relatively new NetGear NightHawk modem (also purchased in </span></p>
<p><span>June 2016)</span><span> router which had been working fine for our wifi connections
</span></p>
<p><span>and still seems to be </span><span>working fine on all our computers EXCEPT the Dell
</span></p>
<p><span>running Windows 10.&nbsp; None of our other computers are running Windows
</span></p>
<p><span>10 by the way.<br />
<br />
As for the Bluescreens, we have no idea what is causing the problem.<br />
Microsoft said they fixed it.&nbsp; They did not.&nbsp; We tried on line fixes but<br />
that did not work either.&nbsp; We have tracked the messages we have gotten and<br />
I have attached the list just so you could see the two "diagnostic"<br />
messages we have gotten -- they keep reoccuring.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attention in this matter.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 seemed to download ok....then killed my Dell XPS 8100 Deskstop</h2>
                    <p>Reserved my copy of 10, and when clicking on the logo Thursday morning in my system tray, it indicated it was ready to be downloaded, so I started the download. It completed the copying of all files, and started the main download. I observed it until about
 78% and I had to leave. When I returned 4 hours later, the computer monitor had a low light glow, and I could see my mouse arrow, but the computer was dead. I force-closed the computer, waited a few minutes, and restarted. I momentarily saw the Dell logo,
 then saw a non colored Windows logo with a small progress wheel that stayed on the screen for about 3 seconds, and then back to the low glow on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a few additional times of restarting &nbsp;the computer with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came on this site and read post after post, and didn't see anyone complaining about an issue like mine, so I got in line to get help. Told me that it would be approximately 215 minutes and I waited. 3 hours and 20 minutes later, I received a message saying
 the help had closed for the day and I was welcome to try again Friday during their opening hours. What?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote a post on this site pretty much saying what I have here. 3 additional hours later a moderator responded by providing a link which contained workarounds for about 40 different failure issues. For the next 3 or 4 hours I tried many of them with no
 success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was then midday Friday. I scheduled a call back which stated it was a 300 minute wait, and I scheduled it. At 4:00pm, I received a callback from a female who wanted me to try 3 basic procedures I had already tried, she informed me she could go no further,
 and suggested I call Dell for driver updates?? I asked her if there was another level of help and she said there was, but the earliest &nbsp;time was about 33 hours, or 7:00am Sunday, which I scheduled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS 8100 THX Tri Studio PC desktop running Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;Can someone help me get my computer restarted? I struggle on the phone due to throat cancer so I do much better with written posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add that will trying one of the fixes Friday morning, I was able to get what I think was the start page of Windows 10, but none of the icons were responsive. When I restarted the computer, it was back to a dead computer. Because I had stayed on the
 start page for so long, I couldn't recall the sequence that got me there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate a response. Frustrated......&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I just upgraded my dell 8100 xps machine. &nbsp;Lots and Lots of problems. &nbsp;I downloaded Windows 10, decided not to wait for the notification. &nbsp;The prescan reported only one issue with my computer, which was an AV product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update went ok...but there were driver problems on my video card: Geforce 740. &nbsp;The network card kept getting disabled so I uninstalled an and reinstalled the card. &nbsp;Works ok now. &nbsp;Several programs such as SQL compact had some issues but uninstalled
 as I was not using the compact version anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still sorting through the event logs to determine if I have cleaned up all the issues, but its almost stable after 3 days of working on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Dell site, and &nbsp;was surprised to see Dell says that the xps line isnt supported with windows 10. &nbsp;I am not sure how much help Dell will be. &nbsp;I am debating getting a new machine....but probably not a dell. &nbsp;I am really disappointed my machine
 with an Intel i7 Processor 20 gigs of ram and isnt compatible. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with trying to get the machine running.</p>

            <p>I would like to provide an update to my earlier post. My Dell XPS 8100 is up and running, in spite of Dell indicating the XPS would not be compatible with the Windows 10 update. I would love to take credit for getting 10 to work, but 5 hours with support
 staff and then an additional 4 hours Sunday morning with an awesome Microsoft guy named Vergel made all the difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem was twofold. I had previously had my monitor set up as a split screen or a dual monitor. While I had not used it in that format for about a year, it was still setup that way. That, and the driver issues with Dell, is what caused my system to not
 come up. Windows 10 had downloaded correctly, but the Dell video driver issues and my monitor setup, &nbsp;caused my issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With such a huge rollout for Microsoft, I can attest it was a long weekend for support staff. After 4 days, and with some generic drivers in use in the meantime, my hat is off for the folks who helped me get up and running.</p>

            <p>My 8100 initially installed OK but on reboot the network wouldn't work (Broadcom integrated). Tried many different resolutions (1 day). Eventually ended up taking the machine back to 8.1 (which isn't supported but everything works!) and my user profile was
 corrupted in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bad job Microsoft! This should be an easy process - restore (to a previous saved point) just doesn't work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took me another day to reinstall my PC (windows restore wouln't work either...) from an Acronis image...whew!</p>

</p><p>What I have seen with most problems with Dell is with the drivers.&nbsp; I don't have the expertise to specifically give you the steps, but with the limited exposure I have had it seems the drivers have been the cause in many of the issues with owners of Dell
 computers, especially the XPS models.</p>

            <p>After a week with 10 working (kinda) with generic drivers, the first automatic update changed that and resulted in everything blinking on the start page and in the system tray. After a 2 hour hold on the support line, I got no help and was actually told
 I should probably revert back to my previous OS if I didn't like the "lack of support" I was getting. Really?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was enough for me. I reverted &nbsp;back to 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;I'll try again once it seems the kinks have been worked out. I have to say the 3 or 4 days I had 10 up and working I liked it......just didn't last. And best of all I had 2800 songs corrupted in my
 ITunes account, with Apple telling me "it was my fault" and Microsoft Support telling me "sorry your experience wasn't more positive". Ya'll think?</p>

<h2>            AppFabric 1.1 won&#39;t install in my Win 10 Enterprise 64bit desktop</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting an error with AppFabric 1.1, running on Windows 10 Enterprise 64bit, immediately after all of the files are unpacked: "Either the version of this package is not compatible with the version of Windows you are running or this package is corrupt....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the file a couple of times, so it's unlikely that the install is corrupt. I have had similar install issues with this install of windows 10 where I've had to create a registry key "<span style="color: rgba(44, 45, 48, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer\SecureRepairPolicy</span>"
 and set it to "1" to install SQL server and VS2015.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern. It seems that you are getting an issue with network driver. To help you with this, we would like to know more information about the computer. Please answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did this issue start? </li><li>Which version of Windows are you using? </li><li>What is the exact error? Are you getting it through the PS4 or the computer? You can provide us the screenshot.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can perform the following troubleshooting steps: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure that you have a strong internet connection. As we know, we are using ICS to turn our computer as a router so that another device can connect to the hosted network. That being said, we need to update your network adapter driver to resolve the issue.
 Head over to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the set of troubleshooting steps that you can perform.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that your computer support ICS, you can follow steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type in <strong>Command Prompt</strong> on <strong>Search</strong> bar. On the result, right-click on
<strong>Command Prompt </strong>and choose <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.
</li><li>Type in <strong>NETSH WLAN show drivers </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. If it is supported you can see,
<strong>Hosted network supported: Yes</strong><br />
</li><li>To create hosted network, type in <strong>NETSH WLAN set hostednetwork mode=allow</strong><strong>ssid</strong>=(create your own SSID or name)
<strong>key</strong>=(your password) </li><li>(e.g. <strong>NETSH WLAN set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid=</strong>name<strong> key=</strong>password)</li><li>Once done, type command <strong>NETSH WLAN start hostednetwork</strong></li><li>To stop it, <strong>NETSH WLAN stop hostednetwork</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response and the result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

    <title>Blue busy wheel flashing next to cursor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamhlavacek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue busy wheel flashing next to cursor</h2>
                    <p>I have seen the other threads for this problem but nothing helped. This started right after I upgraded to windows 10, so I'm not sure if that had anything to with it. The wheel is constantly flashing next to my cursor. In addition on the task bar a white
 box appears and disappears from time to time that matches the flashing, almost like a new program is being opened but then closed before it appears. This is seriously slowing down my computer and causing other problems. I tried typing this into the support
 on my computer, but I couldn't type because of the slowness. I'm typing it on my phone it's the only way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive seen the posts about ending background tasks or getting rid of certain programs all together to fix it but I don't have those tasks going or the programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help me, I can barely use my computer now because of how slow this problem is making it.</p>

<h2>            stuck in startup repair</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>I was trying to partition my memory card for my android phone and had installed mini partition tool/wizard to do so from my desktop running windows 7 ultimate 64 bit edition. While doing this somehow I had to restart my pc and at first it prompted me to
 choose between "startup repair" and "start windows normally"option and I chose the normal startup option but it disint start and went into this startup repair loop. I have tried all the options that the system recovery option gives and nothing works, thus
 here I am trying to find a solution for this. I have really tried all the options and looked up some for video tutorials on youtube as well but all in vain. So please,can anybody tell me whats going on and how am I suppose to fix this prpblem. Thank you in
 advanve and please make it asap because I was going to upgrade my HD but now I am confused as what is wrong with my pc and to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>Thanks!!!</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To boot using your Windows 7 disk, we need to access BIOS to change the boot sequence of your computer, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Power on the system. </li><li>As soon as the first logo screen appears, immediately press the F2 key, or the DEL key if you have a desktop, to enter the BIOS.</li><li>Then on the Boot options select your CD/DVD drive as the first option.</li><li>Hit Enter or Ok to save the changes and restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p>You can also press F11 to enter the Boot Menu then select your CD drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Boot from a Windows 7 installation disc to the Windows Recovery environment mode, and then try to run Startup Repair and check if you are able to boot normally.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, proceed to Method 1.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may use the Bootrec.exe tool in the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>A master boot record (MBR)</span></li><li><span>A boot sector</span></li><li><span>A Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store </span></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>When you are troubleshooting startup issues by using the Windows RE, you should first try the Startup Repair option in the System Recovery Options dialog box. If the Startup Repair option does not resolve the issue,
 or if you must troubleshoot more steps manually, use the Bootrec.exe </span></p>
<p><span>Use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment to troubleshoot and repair startup issues in Windows:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, please proceed to Method 2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open command prompt tool in the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/what-are-system-recovery-options#what-are-system-recovery-options=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>c:\</strong> with the letter of the drive for which you want to run the chkdsk utility. If the hard drive is
<strong>d:\</strong>, then type that instead.</span></li><li><span>After the "chkdsk c:\" command insert <strong>/f </strong>to fix errors on the disc volume or
<strong>/r</strong> to recover bad sectors and then press Enter.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer once <span>&nbsp;</span>chkdsk is completed.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive, it will try to repair that sector, if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;thank you so much for replying so fast to my quieries,and the problem is that I cant boot in from the cd as it doesnt give me the option to boot from the cd when I insert my windows 7 dvd. It always goes to the start up repair screen whatever I do. So thats
 why I have been searching for other kind of options rather than booting from a dvd. So,what should I do next???</p>
<p>thanks!!</p>

            You would have to do a clean install of Windows 10 Home. Otherwise, restore factory settings.
<br />How to do a clean install is here:

            I am by the way quite curious to know how the OS got changed to Enterprise(we have seen a few questions before)
<br />Do you remember changing product key or you took your laptop to support center/repair shop?

            Hi Levi, the only option you will have is to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 Home . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            My Game AND My Xbox Freezes&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>i have <strong>fable 2</strong>. i got pretty far in the game and when i want to continue a quest ( any in that matter) the
<strong>game freezes, and so does my console</strong>. the game only freezes in places other then where i last left off. so basically when i travel to any other place, other then where i last saved the game i&nbsp;have to &nbsp;turn off my xbox and turn it back on inorder
 for it to work...</p>
<p>i wanted to know if the game has the problem or if the xbox cant read the disk any further.</p>
<p>oh and it only happens with one account, im not sure about the others, because i only&nbsp; play the game on one account.</p>
<p>i just wana know whats up =(</p>
<p><strong>~thanks~</strong></p>

<p>I remember having an issue with that game where any time I went into the Reliquary in Oakvale I believe I ran the risk of freezing while saving. To be honest I don't remember how I got around it, but I would suggest getting the latest title update and trying
 to narrow down where the glitch occurs in order to avoid it.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>My Computer updated automatically just after Christmas. Since I have no access to the start button or the task bar. I have made NO changes to my Computer. This was as a direct result of a faulty upgrade, which in fairness should have been properly tested
 before it was forced upon me. I cannot now access any files on my PC and would like this issue sorted out immediately. I have tried the various forums and all I can see are very elaborate solutions that you need to be a software engineer to understand and
 execute.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to reverse this alleged upgrade or am i stuck with a useless PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me as soon as possible as this situation is rediculous and not of my making.</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you have created a System Restore point to the earlier point before this issue persists?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I suggest you to perform System Restore and check if it helps. <span>
When you perform a System Restore the time and date would be changed on your computer.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Restore:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such
 as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
</span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file
 loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I recommend you to refer to the Microsoft article to perform System Restore:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Recovery options in Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></a></p>
<p>Refer: <strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Kindly update the status of this issue for further assistance.</p>

            <p>Microsoft is being irresponsive and irresponsible when it comes to this issue which seems to be affecting a large number of customers.&nbsp; I myself have restored windows 10 about a dozen times and re-installed the apps and after a couple of days, the same thing
 happens as the windows button becomes inoperative (left click) again.&nbsp; How incompetent can the Microsoft programmers be?&nbsp; I really miss XP!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One on demand games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I posted in a different discussion about this but what are they going to do for people who purchased games in the xbox 360 marketplace? It would be nice to know that they'd somehow give a voucher to get at least 50% on the same game for the xbox one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems like I'm going to have to keep the 360 around to play good ol' Skyrim and Halo 4.</p>

<p>[/quote]Games on the Xbox 360 (both discs &amp; digital) are NOT compatible with the Xbox One; this was the answer Microsoft's reps gave to us when people asked about the arcade games months ago. Any games that will be on the new console that were on the Xbox
 360 will be remakes or improved versions &amp; therefore will not be compatible (Minecraft Xbox One Edition, Battlefield 4, &amp; CoD Ghosts just to name a few). For these games you will have to pay full price for a brand new copy. However, in some cases (as with
 the latter 2 mentioned), you can take your Xbox 360 copy &amp; trade it into Gamestop &amp; pay only $10 more for the Xbox One edition - unfortunately, this promotion is only temporary &amp; will not last forever - this is a benefit from the retailers, not from Microsoft.
 In addition, certain DLC you purchase, such as a season pass, will be available across both consoles with only a single purchase - this is a benefit from the developers, not from Microsoft. Otherwise, there is NO backwards compatibility at this time or that
 is planned in the near future. I hope this answers your question...</p>

<p>I don`t remember the cars handling so badly or the shooting being so difficult in the original.</p>
<p>The cars seem to spin at the least little thing,or they won`t take a corner.</p>
<p>The first shooting section of the game drove me mad, all you had to do was shoot some bottles, i couldn`t line up the sights and kept missing.</p>
<p>I really hope they have made that section with the remote control planes easier, if i don`t give up before i get there.</p>

<p>^^ Yeah as soon as I finished shooting the bottles I turned auto-lock on in the options. The cars handle fine though IMO. Ease off the gas instead or braking.
</p>
<p>But lol... I'm dreading the RC plane bits, especially chasing those vans. I HATED it. The game seems easier than I remember it so far though. Only mission I've failed is the Life's a Beach dancing one. Annoying.</p>
<p>OP the game is the same. Improved resolution, and draw distance... but still terrible pop-in, and some new bugs, mostly with the sound for me. Radio DJs get cut off mid-sentence and a song will start. Cutscenes lose all sound. But meh... it's not bad enough
 to put me off, and I paid so little for it... can't complain.</p>
<p>My advice. Get it while it's cheap. =)</p>

<p>I didn`t see the auto lock option, i will have to turn that on.</p>
<p>The problem i seem to have with the cars is that when they don`t seem to want to fully turn a corner i tap the handbrake and the cars just spin.</p>
<p>I know its something i just need to get used to, but its just irritating at the moment.</p>
<p>Those planes drove me mad years ago on the ps2.</p>

<p>According to Eurogamer, GTA San Andreas on the 360 is a port of the mobile version, which is either the one for iOS devices or Android.&nbsp; The developer has taken the graphics a little step further than the mobile ports with better draw distances, but what
 is clear is that this version of the game is not a port of the PS2 version or the original Xbox version.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-gta-san-andreas-on-xbox-360-is-a-mobile-port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-gta-san-andreas-on-xbox-360-is-a-mobile-port</a><br />
<br />
Apparently it's also locked at 30fps, which is odd because the Xbox 360 should easily be capable of running&nbsp;this old game at 60fps.&nbsp; Although to be fair, at the price their selling it, it's still worth a go.&nbsp; It's the same price as the mobile versions at the
 moment.</p>

<p>The remote control airplane section that Owen is talking about, is a little easier if you land the planes first behind, or in front of the vehicles, then shoot them up a notch. Made things easier.</p>
<p>As for the driving...</p>
<p>In GTA III the cars felt great but could topple for next to no reason. </p>
<p>Vice City they stuck to the road like a scalextric track but were fun overall.
</p>
<p>San Andreas the cars were better in that each car truly felt different to drive, but the handbrake was a bit extreme. Best to stick to normal break and go buttons.
</p>
<p>GTAIV the cars felt like they had no abs but with an automatic gear shift. Tricky but once mastered it was a great drive.</p>
<p>GTAV. To me they have the balance perfectly. Each car feels different to drive but going for the faster supercars can get twitchy.

<p>It's totally worth it. It is pretty fun and you won't play it for 7 hours at a time like gta online (Mainly because san andreas has no multiplayer feature). A great way to waste away until your latest game for gold in finished installing.

<p>I played gta SA on the playstation 2 but was never able to play the game on the original xbox. I got a pirated copy on the PC and modded it up, and after that, the remastered edition came out on Apple stores. With that said, this is just a port from the
 apple mobile devices. There is a ton of new things added but the main thing is probably the graphics. They are not next gen....not even current gen, but the graphics and polygons that were there are now sharpened and enhanced. But....the mechanics on the other
 hand are love/hate. You either love them, or you hate them. The manual aim for consoles has always been "pull my hair out" difficult, but switch to manual aim and you'll shoot a police instead of the bad guy. Auto aim has a mind of it's own but manual is even
 worse. The dring is different. The sections in which you used to press A are switch with the Trigger button. So, riding a bike used to mean mashing A to ride faster and now you hold down the left trigger (Which is not as realistic). Apart from a few instances,
 you will have a blast with this game. Helicopters, planes, and cheat codes for when you 100%, which will take you a while, because the map is on par with gta 5 and there is a TON to do. This game is the last gen version of what GTA V is now. Of course, it's
 a love hate thing so if you love this type of thing, get it. if not spend your 5 bucks on slender the arrival</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>What is the model number of the computer?</span></span></li><li><span><span>As Shenan asked, do you see the webcam physically connected to the machine?</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>In device manager, you may locate the webcam under imaging device or</span></span><span>unknown
 device.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Type devmgmt.msc in start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;In device manager, browse to imaging device or unknown device &amp; check if it is listed there.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Open Device Manager</span></a></span></p>
</span>
<p><span><span>Hope the information helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards<br />
