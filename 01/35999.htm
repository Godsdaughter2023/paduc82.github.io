<h2>            Help&#33; Account Hacked&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Some **** has hacked my account, bought 6000 MS point (then gifted them away! How can I find out who to?) and then bought a freaking family gold 12 Month pack (about 2 weeks after I bought a 12 month gold for me! via code from local store) And I've found
 myself nearly Â£120 out of pocket. I'm going to call MS tomorrow morning first thing, will they be able to sort it or will I need to go to the bank to get my money back? As I never wanted or actually bought any of these things and can't really afford to be
 that much out of pocket and really need this sorted quick! What else (if anything) do I need to do/can I do?</p>
<p>I'll be removing my card info as soon as I've dealt with this too I think as I can clearly no longer trust them!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>a service alert means that there is a (known) issue on xbox live and it is not something on your end. It will get fixed by Xbox or Microsoft people.</p>
<p>You don't have to do anything and there isn't anything wrong with your xbox console, the only thing you may want to do is to check this link for information about the service alert: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status</a></p>

    <title>&#34;Turn Off Display After 15 Minutes&#34; only works occasionally on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jawone  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Turn Off Display After 15 Minutes&#34; only works occasionally on new HP All In One desktop running Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a new HP "All In One" desktop. There is no separate tower and monitor. In the past, I'd leave the PC running all night (to do virus scans etc) and shut off the monitor. This is not possible with this unit, so the dealer suggested using power options
 and setting to "Turn Off Display After 15 Minutes" and also selecting "Never Allow Computer To Sleep". This plan appeared to work for a short time. Lately, the monitor does not turn off after the aforementioned 15 minutes. So I end up having to Shut Down.
 Also noticed that my Screen Saver does not engage on these occasions either. Am I missing a step somewhere?<br />

            I had tried a number of these steps short of the clean boot. I have discovered that the problem occurs when the screen is left on my desktop. If I have my internet browser, or a program such as i-tunes open on the screen, my screen saver kicks in at the
 correct time, and the display shuts off at the preset 10 minute mark. I don't know why this is significant, but this is how it has happened lately. Thanks Basith.<br />

            Basith: I have the display set to turn off after 15 minutes, and the computer to never sleep. One night the display turned off as scheduled but came back on about 2 AM. My son, who is the IT person for a good sized company suggested that I turn off my
 mouse when I'm done. This seems to have helped the problem. Can you explain further your suggestion on the CONTROL/ALT/DELETE ? Thank you.<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">Hello. <br />
<br />
I grabbed the Legendary Edition of Halo: Reach a couple of days ago for a nice bargain and I have redeemed the code on Xbox Live, however there appears to be no option for the Flaming Helmet in the Armoury section.<br />
<br />
The code worked when I redeemed it with the information stating it was the Legendary Edition Bonus Content code with the Flaming Helmet and Elite Armour. But they appear nowhere. Help! :(</span></p>

<p>Do you have Bungie Pro? If you do, delete the 'Bungie Pro' file in your Hard-Drive. (Don't worry, it's nothing useful, just a recipt)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, you can also try to delete the 'Bonus Recon Helmet' (as it's included with Legenday)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Here's an article on what a VDM file is (and I doubt you have the program that creates it):
<a href="http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/vdm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/vdm</a>.&nbsp; I could find no information on this dll in Bing, Google, or the Microsoft Knowledge Base (which often means it is malware or some type of created program - which may
 also be malware of a different sort).&nbsp; You can try to delete the file using the normal Vista delete command (but I guess you've already tried that and it didn't work).&nbsp;
<span>
Try using one of the following free products to delete the file.&nbsp; File Assassin </span>
<span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 or without Force Delete: </span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></a></span><span>)
 or Unlocker at: </span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.<br />
<br />
</span>You could be infected with malware.&nbsp; <span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because thatâs good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
I realize this is a lot of programs, but no one program is good enough to catch all forms of malware so you need to try several especially when you suspect an infection.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there's not much that you can do about it, the PowerShell menu needs to be fixed, is not working how it suppose to according to multiple users.
<br />
<br />As a workaround use this shortcuts.
<br />
<br />For Ctrl-M.
<br />
<br />Use alt + espace + e + m
<br />
<br />For Ctrl F.
<br />
<br />Use alt + espace + e + f
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hi Gabriel, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting. I will help you all I can.
<br />
<br />The Specs from the System/Motherboard Maker should tell you if it is included on your system. Or ask in their forum.
<br />
<br />If not included you can add Bluetooth with a USB dongle such as those from BlueSoleil or other makers available from local or internet retailers.
<br />
<br />BlueSoleil
<br /><a href="http://www.bluesoleil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bluesoleil.com/</a>
<br />
<br />================
<br />
<br />If it has Bluetooth you need to troubleshoot it :
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - "Bluetooth" and "Hardware and Devices" troubleshooters. 
<br />
<br />Check with your System/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.
<br />
<br />Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect the Bluetooth operation.
<br />
<br /> =====
<br />
<br /> Good idea to update all the major drivers :
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low-level chipset drivers, and the major onboard and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot  - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />If the computer currently supports Bluetooth AND the drivers have been
<br />updated as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Some troubleshooting methods: ALL apply to Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - "Bluetooth" and "Hardware and Devices" troubleshooters.

<br />BluetoothView is a small utility that runs in the background and monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around you. For each detected Bluetooth device, it displays the following information: Device Name, Bluetooth Address, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, First Detection Time, Last Detection Time, and more. BluetoothView can also notify you when a new Bluetooth device is detected, by displaying a balloon in your taskbar or by playing a small beep sound. - FREE
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/bluetooth_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/bluetooth_viewer.html</a>
<br />
<br />BluetoothCL is a small console application that dumps all current detected bluetooth devices into the standard output. For each Bluetooth device, the following information is displayed:  MAC Address, Name, Major Device Type, Minor Device Type, and optionally the company name of the device (if external file of MAC addresses - oui.txt is provided) - FREE

<br />
<br />BluetoothLogView is a small utility that monitors the activity of Bluetooth devices around you, and displays a log of Bluetooth devices on the main window. Every time that a new Bluetooth device arrives to your area and when the device leaves your area, a new log line is added with the following information: Device Name, Device Address, Event Time, Event Type ('Device Arrival' or 'Device Left'), Device Type, and the company that created the device.

<h2>            Windows 7 Computer ZT Only showing backround screen in the login menu</h2>
                    <p><strong>&nbsp;background screen showing unable to repair or reboot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>When I booted my computer, and logged in, it opened up taskmanager to close some startup items&nbsp;to ease down my CPU, and when I clicked on the desktop to open up and application, i got this message saying: Explorer.exe is not responding. and it gave
 me a choise to close explorer. I figured that</strong></p>
<p><strong>it was windows explorer, the internet browser.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When I closed explorer.exe, everything disaperred, only leaving the background. So I figured rebooting my PC would fix the problem, but when I booted it up, it only showed the background of the login menu.</strong></p>

            <p><span>Hi Tyler P,</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
 You can try to start the explorer.exe process from task manager by clicking file, clicking run, and then type explorer.exe and click OK. Check if it works.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Check
 if you are able to boot the computer in safe mode without any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Turn the computer on or Restart the computer
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Start tapping the F8 key. The Windows Advanced Boot Options Menu appears. If you begin tapping the F8 key too soon, some computers display a "keyboard
 error" message. To resolve this, restart the computer and try again. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Ensure that the Safe mode option is selected.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Enter. The computer then begins to start in Safe mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer the link below for help.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b><span>Perform a clean boot and check if the issue persists. You can refer the link below.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista

Make Microphone&nbsp; as your default playback device.<br />
<br />
Right click on Speaker icon present in the taskbar.<br />
<br />
Click Playback devices.<br />
<br />
Select Microphone and set it as default device.<br />

Imagine i'm in a call, my mic is streaming my voice picked up by the mic, but instead, i want it to play the sounds played on an external device (like an mp3) basically, turning my mp3 into a mic that plays the songs i have.<br />

<p>Hello there fellow gamer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue with being able to redeem a code onto your account, as it is showing that you need to login while being logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this occurring through an Xbox One console, or are you attempting this through our Xbox website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is on the console, we suggest <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">removing and then adding the account</a></strong> to ensure that the
 account properly syncs to the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. That may very well be the issue. Pre paid codes work for the region the code was bought in. For example: If my account is Canadian, but the code I bought was from the United States, then the code would not work for my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, your account region must match the pre paid code region.</p>

<h2>            I want to remove the administrator password</h2>
                    I have tried the options listed in previous questions. <br />
<br />
I am the only one using the machine. When I try this<br />
a) Press<strong> Windows key + C</strong>, select <strong>settings</strong><br />
b) Click on <strong>Change PC settings</strong>, select <strong>Users</strong><br />
c) Click <strong>Change password</strong> under <strong>Sign in options</strong><br />
d) When prompted, type your current password and leave the new password empty.<br />
<br />
It shows the current password and below the fields for new password and it does let me continue.
<br />
<br />
I have tried all the other options and it still requires a password on waking up.

<h2>            Lost PS&#47;2 Keyboard and mouse on Upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>I suddenly lost keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; USB keyboard and mouse didn't work either.&nbsp; Decided to to do a Windows XP repair.&nbsp; I have a PS/2 and a USB keyboard and mouse pluged in.</p>
<p>I get to the point where I have to enter the product ID key and the keyboard stops working.&nbsp; The PS/2 mouse and USB keyboard doesn't work either.&nbsp; ONLY the USB mouse works.</p>
<p>I am able to recover the data if I wish, by using Ultimate Boot CD, but I would much rather be able to get the machine working again.&nbsp; I can't bare the thought of having to go through all the installations again.</p>
<p>I have done a disk scan for damage and virus and it comes out clear.&nbsp; I am able to use the PC with Ultimate Boot CD fine, but the the keyboard stops working as soon as I go to enter the product ID key!</p>
<p>Any ideas to get this fixed please?</p>

            Can you right click on the file &amp; change the .exe1 to .exe?
<br />You may have to turn on âshow file extentionsâ if not.
<br />Open Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization. Now, click on Folder Options or File Explorer Option, as it is now called &gt; View tab. In this tab, under Advance Settings, you will see the option Hide extensions for known file types. Uncheck this option and click on Apply and OK.

            Hi R0bertCZLP
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, temporarily turn on 'File Name Extensions'
<br />
<br />Then right click that file and choose rename
<br />
<br />Remove the last character from the file extension, so it just reads exe
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>No, I do not use it. <strong>[mod removed]</strong></p>
<p>People are able to get 1600 microsoft points for free each time they use that method. It is not Xbox live rewards and it is certainly not bing rewards. Please report the glitch shown in this video to xbox or tell me how to. Please do not use this, I want
 to make sure that the people who discovered this do not tell it to anyone (and I have not used it). I use bing rewards (much faster)! Anyhow thanks for noticing this!</p>

<p>Hey there Dog! The video is suggesting that you send your WLID and password to someone via email, something that we will never ask you to do, and can only lead to your account being compromised. I highly recommend reporting this video on YouTube for scamming,
 and make sure you stay clear of what it suggests. Let me know if you have any questions on this, thanks!

[/quote] There is no glitch. This email in the video isn't even a valid Xbox one. Emails the end with @Live.com are for customers to use. Who ever was behind the video simply created an email address that fools anyone foolish enough to fall for this scam into
 thinking its an official MS one. It isn't, the script is fake. All they are after is your Live ID and password. They will then steal your account.

<p>These scammers on YouTube&nbsp;also tend to create many fake&nbsp;YouTube accounts so that they can comment on their own videos.&nbsp;This then makes the video look more real to anyone who is inclined to take up the offer.&nbsp; Don't believe the comments, for the most part,
 they are just as fake as the video.</p>

<p>Now before you read this, you need to know there is still hope for some software improvements/changes. However, improvements within Microsoft have a very small probability, because Microsoft changed nothing after all the distain the Xbox 720/Adam Orth/Super
 Dae rumors caused. Microsoft had 3 months after Sony's PS4 event to change things for the better, but they didn't care enough to do so.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That's the Microsoft I do not want to support. I'm just showing the Microsoft's screw ups, spin, lies, and conflicting reports to paint a picture for everyone. You decide for yourself, because I already know what I think.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>RUMORS!!!! No way they be real, right?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[View:http://www.gamestitch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Adam-Orth.png]</p>
<p>[View:http://i.imgur.com/IWPsqOR.png]</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= So, you thought he was just joking, and being dumb online, huh? He later resigned over this, or Microsoft forced him to leave the company. The sad thing is, Microsoft saw all the backlash even before he posted these tweets (With earlier leaks from Super
 Dae) but Microsoft did NOTHING to change for the better. Hopefully they will after all the backlash they are getting now (Besides the weaker tech) but are they showing it so far? Lets see if their arrogant attitude of forced online DRM checks are very real,
 and that #DealWithIt attitude.</p>

<p>"Microsoft dismisses Xbox One online requirements and used-game fees as 'potential scenarios"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Reports of Xbox One's online requirements and used-game fees are no more than "potential scenarios" and not concrete details, Microsoft told Polygon via email."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"While Phil [Harrison] discussed many potential scenarios around games on Xbox One, today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail," Microsoft told Polygon."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Initial news from Wired stated that those with second-hand or used games would be required to pay a small fee before being able to play."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Additionally, Kotaku spoke with vice president Phil Harrison during today's event, where Harrison told the publication that users would need to connect to the internet every day. Microsoft could not confirm these details."There have been reports of a specific
 time period â those were discussions of potential scenarios, but we have not confirmed any details today, nor will we be," Microsoft said."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Microsoft said earlier today that Xbox One would not require an always on internet connection. The statement is echoed on Microsoft's Q&amp;A page, which says that the Xbox One does require a connection, but does not always have to be</p>
<p>connected."</p>

<p>"We're designing Xbox One to be your all-in-one entertainment system that is connected to the cloud and always ready," the post reads. "We are also designing it so you can play games and watch Blu-ray movies and live TV if you lose your connection."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= So they never once deny what Phil Harrison said, just water circling the toilet, and point to Always Online not being mandatory. They don't even try to give a clear answer about the.. you know, ONLINE DRM? Microsoft did confirm that you have to download
 a game and not use the disc = So what does that tell you? They also talk about the extra FEE to play used games not being the case, and how they will ENABLE you to be able to sell your game at retail. Later in this thread I'll show you why they said it that
 way. Now on to more mandatory Online DRM truth givingâ¦</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The next day (May 22) Phil tries to clear the air at a different site, but does some ridiculous spin that shows you the real truth anyways</p>

<p>Wired: "Iâve heard that if your Xbox One does not connect with Xbox Live at least once a day, the machine becomes inoperable and youâre not able to play any of the games that youâve paid for. Is that true?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "I donât think thatâs what was said. Let me try and clarify what is happening.So, there is a lot of anxiety about âwhat if my Internet connection goes downâ and you donât have connectivity for a period of time. There are a host of features which
 will be usable without an Internet connection â watching movies, playing certain single player gamesâ¦ all of which will operate offline. We expect most of the more advanced experiences, like online multiplayer games, or games which have a lot of connected
 featuresâ¦ those games wonât operate if you donât have an Internet connection. We designed the system to take advantage of a connection to the cloud, and all that that means. But no, itâs not required that you are connected all the time, every second of every
 day."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "There is some technology about how often, or how frequently the device has to âpingâ, but that has not beenâ¦ we have not talked publicly about that yet, but it will be very user-friendly."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= So you don't think that's what you said in the Kotaku article, but waitâ¦you did! Then you try and hide it here with answers to a question that was never asked? "But no, itâs not required that you are connected all the time, every second of every day" =
 That wasn't the question Phil.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Page 2 in the same May 22nd Wired article from above, you show the real truth again???</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "For players who donât have consistent access to online connectivity due to their particular location or poor quality of service, how much functionality will they be able to get out of the Xbox One?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "So, Xbox One is designed to have an internet connection. You will recall what I said earlier about it not requiring one all the time, but just like many devices that we have in our lives todayâ¦ they are an extension of the Internet"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Wow Phil, and there you were trying so hard to not let it be known with a clear answer. So over two different articles (With different dates), you confirm what many gamers DO NOT WANT? Do you see how he lies, and tries to spin the truth while confirming
 you will NEED an internet connection? Fact is, you did talk publicly about how often the Xbone has to ping with the Cloud (It blew up in Microsoft's face) so you had to lie, and spin it here? You and Microsoft failed.

<p>Phil Harrison tries to clarify game ownership, second-hand sales and always-online in Xbox One (MAY 22nd)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-22-phil-harrison-tries-again-to-clarify-game-ownership-second-hand-sales-and-always-online-in-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.eurogamer.net/.../2013-05-22-phil-harrison-tries-again-to-clarify-game-ownership-second-hand-sales-and-always-online-in-xbox-one</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "What we're doing with the digital permissions that we have for Xbox One is no different to that. If I am playing on that disc, which is installed to the hard drive on my Xbox One, everybody in my household who has permission to use my Xbox One
 can use that piece of content. [So] I can give that piece of content to my son and he can play it on the same system."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer: "Harrison then explained what happens when you want to take that game beyond the borders of your own home and into a friend's place."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "I can come to your house and I can put the disc into your machine and I can sign in as me and we can play the game," he explained."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "The bits are on your hard drive. At the end of the play session, when I take my disc home - or even if I leave it with you - if you want to continue to play that game [on your profile] then you have to pay for it. The bits are already on your
 hard drive, so it's just a question of going to our [online] store and buying the game, and then it's instantly available to play."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "Some bits of the system will work offline," he said. "I think the key point to make is that Xbox One requires an internet connection, but it does not need to be connected all the time. We think that most of the biggest games on Xbox One and most
 of the games and experiences and services you want to use will be internet-connected."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer: "Everybody got that? Xbox One requires an internet connection, but not all the time."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "I don't want to trivialize the issue because I know people are passionate about it, but I think most people will realize that the vast majority of content and experiences that they will want to enjoy on Xbox One will be the ones that have an online
 connectivity," he continued."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Thanks for thinking FOR me Microsoft. :^|</p>

<p>Microsoft sent an E-Mail very early to Wired??? (MAY 21st 1:30 PM)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/05/xbox-one-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.wired.com/.../xbox-one-analysis</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "Thereâs one feature of Xbox One from which we can infer quite a few conclusions: You can install any game from the disc to the consoleâs hard drive, and then play that game whenever you like without having to put the disc in."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Wired asked Microsoft if installation would be mandatory." </p>
<p>Microsoft: âOn the new Xbox, all game discs are installed to the HDD to play,â the company responded in an emailed statement."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "Sounds mandatory to us."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "What follows naturally from this is that each disc would have to be tied to a unique Xbox Live account, else you could take a single disc and pass it between everyone you know and copy the game over and over. Since this is clearly not going to happen,
 each disc must then only install for a single owner."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "Microsoft did say that if a disc was used with a second account, that owner would be given the option to pay a fee and install the game from the disc, which would then mean that the new account would also own the game and could play it without the
 disc."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= It just so happens that this Wired article with this information was approved by Microsoft in an E-Mail (That I bolded) So was it really a misunderstanding? Did Microsoft use Phil Harrison as a scapegoat for everything? Hmm, very interesting = Joke is
 on you Phil! Signed Microsoft.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= The owner of the second account would have to pay the fee, as in the full price of the game on his account. Funny, that's the exact same thing Phil Harrison said in the next article interviewâ¦</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lending a friend your game? He will need to pay full price of the game??? (MAY 21st)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://kotaku.com/you-will-be-able-to-trade-xbox-one-games-online-micros-509140825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">kotaku.com/you-will-be-able-to-trade-xbox-one-games-online-micros-509140825</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "You'll have to pay a feeâand not just some sort of activation fee, but the actual price of that gameâin order to use a game's code on a friend's account. "Think of it like a new game," Harrison said."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= So, the ONLY way your friend doesn't have to buy the game (At full price) is if you are there signed into your account. Funny again, because that's the same thing Major Nelson says in the Update of the article, and on his webpage...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Major Nelson Spinning the Used game policy, and to make borrowing sound like your friend wouldn't ever have to pay a FEE

<p>.</p>
<p>"We know there is some confusion around used games on Xbox One and wanted to provide a bit of clarification on exactly what weâve confirmed today. While there have been many potential scenarios discussed, today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox
 One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Beyond that, we have not confirmed any specific scenarios."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Another piece of clarification around playing games at a friendâs house â should you choose to play your game at your friendâs house, there is no fee to play that game while you are signed in to your profile."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= First - Oh my, how wonderful!!! Thank you very much Microsoft for ENABLING me to trade in MY game at a retail location. :^\</p>
<p>= Second - You don't want to confirm any other specific scenarios?</p>
<p>= Third - He says "should YOU choose to play YOUR game at your friendâs house there is no fee to play that game while YOU are signed in to YOUR profile." = Do YOU see it? So YOU have to be there in-order to allow your friend to borrow your game for free.
 If YOU are not there to sign into YOUR profile, your friend CAN'T borrow your game, unless he pays that full price fee of the game. "Just think of it as a new game," Harrison said." What an idiot, or is that how Microsoft thinks?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= [UPDATE] Major Nelson has an updated link in the post that doesn't add anything at all except EVEN MORE backtracking. lol</p>

<p>The Kinect is mandatory?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/05/phil-harrison-xbox-one/2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.wired.com/.../2</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "Does the device function if the Kinect is not attached?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "Kinect and Xbox One are one and the same. They are two parts of the equation. Obviously the Kinect sensor is used for Skype, for communication, for voice recognition, gesture and motion sensing and the rest."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "So as an example, if your dog comes in and somehow it knocks the Kinect down and breaks it, would you still be able to use the box if there was a particular game which did not use the functions embedded into the Kinect?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: "In that situation, I have no idea. [consults with assistant] What kind of dog is it?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Wired: "The dog from the Call of Duty video you showed today. That one."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Harrison: (laughs)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Nice lame answer there Phil.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>More on Kinect is mandatory</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/.../the-kinect-is-mandatory-and-cant-be-turned-off-welcome-your-new-motion-sens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.penny-arcade.com/the-kinect-is-mandatory-and-cant-be-turned-off-welcome-your-new-motion-sens</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Xbox's UK marketing director Harvey Eagle: "Kinect does require to be connected to Xbox One in all cases, yes," he said</p>
<p>Penny-Arcade: "So it sounds like the Kinect is mandatory. You canât unplug it, you canât turn it off, and you wonât be able to buy an Xbox One without the added cost of the motion sensing peripheral. It's always on, at least on some level. Listening to you.
 Waiting to be told to wake up."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= SHOCKED!!! Hey, that's not Phil Harrison! You can't use him as a scapegoat this time Microsoft. Now we're getting the same answers from multiple sources, and articles. For shame Microsoft by making an always on camera that's always watching/listening,
 giving Microsoft feedback? That's very intrusive to our privacy. So in-order for your system to work, Kinect needs to be working. Hopefully Microsoft's quality on Kinect is better than the 360 RRoD.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft possibly using Kinect as Visual DRM?</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: To address the question of the age of the patent. Yes, the patent is old. But we have been told by UK industry sources within the last month that this system will be implemented on Xbox One.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2: Microsoft has now issued MCV with the following comment: "Microsoft regularly applies for and receives patents as part of its business practice; not all patents applied for or received will be incorporated into a Microsoft product.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Can it get any worse? Now that is the very best excuse for having Kinect mandatory, with it always on watching/listning. Well at least Microsoft is telling the truth that they are not using that patent right, RIIIIGHT???</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>BOOM!!! The same site (2nd Article) that said MS refuted the claims of online requirements and used-game fees as 'potential scenarios" just made that all the more obvious (MAY 27th)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/27/4369782/from-xbox-one-to-xbox-none-the-risks-of-an-internet-required-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.polygon.com/.../from-xbox-one-to-xbox-none-the-risks-of-an-internet-required-gaming</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Video games, according to several sources familiar with the matter, will require some form of occasional online connection to verify a person still owns the disc. Without that reoccurring online handshake, the game simply won't play."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"While a small part of the parent in me might like the idea of not having to debate whether gaming will be allowed on a vacation, the notion that I don't get to make that decision if there's no internet, irks me."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"An internet requirement also means that every game purchase I make brings with it a shelf-life. At some point, it's fair to assume, Microsoft may decide they want to stop supporting that game or their new console. If a connection, even an occasional one,
 is required to play the game, what happens then to my library of titles?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"And let's not forget the console's camera peripheral. The Xbox One's Kinect, like the console itself, will be required to always be connected."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"The message seemed to be: If you don't like the Xbox One then stick with the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Don Mattrick, president of Interactive Entertainment Business at Microsoft, told me that the decision to require internet for the Xbox One was driven by a desire to create a console unleashed from the technical limitations of today's not-entirely-connected
 society. Microsoft had a decision to make, he said; either create a console planted in the present or look to the future and create a device built on the concept that one day the internet will be as available as electricity or telephone service."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= So there you have it ladies and gentlemen. Right from the horses mouth. Oh no, this isn't the easy to blame Phil Harrison. This is the Xbox leader himself, Don Mattrick. Not only does he confirm that online is required, he shows that "#DealWithIt" attitude.
 That same kind of attitude Adam Orth showed when he posted those Tweets above. The article also confirms Kinect required, and routine online checks. So even if Phil was giving a potential scenario, Microsoft proves (YET AGAIN) that there is a system like that
 in place. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft tries to spin it to show you can turn Kinect off</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>"It is not always watching or always listening," a spokesperson for Microsoft told me over e-mail while I was trying to nail down some facts for a story about next-gen consoles that ran in yesterday's New York Times.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"In the Times article, I reported that Microsoft says the Kinect can be turned off. The entire console can be powered down. This might seem obvious to anyone familiar with how consumer electronics work, but... let's face facts...the Xbox One has seemed,
 for the past week, to be a tad different than the average piece of consumer electronics."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Yes, you can turn the system completely off," the Microsoft rep said. "This would use no power and turn everything off. Weâll share more details about how it all works later." I believe this powering off involves the aforementioned power button."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= First - It's not always watching, means it does watch. Of course it's not watching when you turn the console compleatly off by unplugging it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Second - If you could truly turn Kinect off, you would be able to unplug the thing from the console, but you can't.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Third - Do you see how that Microsoft rep spins it? He says "Yes, you can turn the system completely off," after talking about Kinect. Well DUH AGAIN Microsoft. Of course you can turn everything off when you turn the F'ing system off! However, you do not
 say how it's completely off. Did you mean by pulling the damn plug? Even with the system off, if it's still taking power from the eletical socket, and the system/Kinect are still ON in a low powered state listening for you to say "XBOX ON" so it's stil in
 a monitored state UNLESS you compleatly pull the plug. = RIDICULOUS!!! </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You spin me right'round, Microsoft, Right'round, like a record baby, Right'round, 'round, 'round</p>

<p>= If you go to 10:42 in the above link, Andy McNamara (Editor-in-Chief of Game Informer) Talks about a movement in the gaming industry. How devs are upset with Microsoft, and how Sony is really embracing them.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= At 11:38 Jeff Gerstmann (Famous Game reviewer, and GiantBomb God) talks about Microsoft moving in the opposite direction with that stuff (Catering Developers) and how it's a flip of the last time around (Sony having the better system, and treating developers
 better?) That it's something Microsoft use to do. He also talks about retail, and how publishers are taking sides, and how some don't like what Microsoft is doing (I think he's talking about Microsoft's used game policy for the XBone, and how that will fragment
 relationships, and some publishers don't agree with Microsoft's control) He talks about more console exclusives because of this, and this is the big one... I think he's hinting that he doesn't agree with the way Microsoft is getting 3rd party exclusives, because
 of their DRM used game policy, and heres whyâ¦</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft/Publishers to receive cut of Xbox One pre-owned sales at retail</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>"Retailers will be free to charge whatever they wish for pre-owned Xbox One games, but both Microsoft and publishers will take a percentage cut of every sale."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= It talks about Microsoft's Azure system in place for retail stores (That sells used games) who agree with a Microsoft contract to use the system. Microsoft/Publishers will take a chunk of each used game sold (That means your games will be worth far less
 because of this control) </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Was this the MAIN part Microsoft didn't want anyone (Sony) to know?</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>"But that doesn't mean used games are dead. In fact, Harrison told us, you'll be able to sell your Xbox One games online."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"We will have a solutionâweâre not talking about it todayâfor you to be able to trade your previously-played games online," Harrison said.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= You're not talking about it, but you just said it twice! This info could be the first good thing in a sea of Xbone CRAP. However, the games are still reliant on having an Ethernet/Microsoft Server connection. Can I haz some Ketchup for my poop sandwich?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= It's all making sense (The Azure cloud service/mandatory online checks/Kinect always connected/Borrowing restrictions) I believe Microsoft/Publishers, are planning to bleed Used game retailers dry until they become extinct. Then they will have total control
 of all the content while having a used game system in place, so they get the lion's share from used game sales. It also makes it very easy for Microsoft to move everything to digital only on their Azure system... No wonder they're talking about 300,000 servers?</p>

 Xbox Live Arcade, or even issue updates on; it was a nightmare." while praising Sony for "...embrac[ing] a lot of that vibe thus far, as far as indie games go and whatnot. I feel like Sony's really embraced that vibe, and [the] homebrewed and homegrown movement

<p>.</p>
<p>"Last night during Sony's presentation unveiling its PlayStation 4 console, Sony's Mark Cerny made a vague promise that the system would be "the most open console" for developers to get games to players."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Let me ask another way, then. I understand that the PS4 is accessible from a development standpoint -- once you are a licensed PlayStation developer. What I'm wondering is if Sony is lifting any restrictions, perhaps? Or making it easier for a smaller developer
 to get onto the PlayStation 4 than it was for the PlayStation 3?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Sony Computer Entertainment World Wide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida, "Yeah, that we really want to do. We believe in smaller developers. They are very creative and they go out of the norm to do something really amazing. So we really want to make it

<p>= Looks like there was no reason for loyal Xbox fanboys to doubt Jeff Gerstmann, and Andy McNamara. It's a total reversal! Sony has changed for the better while Microsoft has became far worse.</p>

<p>After all the bad press - Microsoft Vows To Support Indie Developers on Xbox One</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://kotaku.com/microsoft-vows-to-support-indie-developers-on-xbox-one-510129167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">kotaku.com/microsoft-vows-to-support-indie-developers-on-xbox-one-510129167</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A report last week that the next Xbox console won't allow independent game developers to self-publish on the Xbox One gave people yet another next-gen Xbox thing to stew about. But Microsoft's Xbox chief says that Xbox One will have some sort of indie-friendly
 program"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"We're going to have an independent creator program," Don Mattrick, Microsoft's head of interactive entertainment (read: he's in charge of the Xbox), told me last week. "We're going to sponsor it. We're going to give people tools. We're going to give more
 information."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"That is something we thinkâI thinkâis important," he said of an indie program. "That's how I started in the industry. There's no way we're going to build a box that doesn't support that."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Of course you are, but will it be as good as Sony's and Nintendo's? If not, then try again because Indie devs are not happy with you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sony catches Microsoft off guard, and gets lucky doing so</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-spec-analysis-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.eurogamer.net/.../digitalfoundry-spec-analysis-xbox-one</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"In terms of the GPU hardware, hard information was difficult to come by, but one of the engineers did let slip with a significant stat - 768 operations per clock. We know that both Xbox One and PlayStation 4 are based on Radeon GCN architecture and we also
 know that each compute unit is capable of 64 operations per clock. So, again through a process of extrapolation from the drip-feed of hard facts, the make-up of the One's GPU is confirmed - 12 compute units each capable of 64 ops/clock gives us the 768 total
 revealed by Microsoft and thus, by extension, the 1.2 teraflop graphics core. So that's another tick on the Durango leaked spec that has been transposed across to the final Xbox One architecture and the proof we need that PlayStation 4's 18 CU graphics core
 has 50 per cent more raw power than the GPU in the new Microsoft console. Now, bearing in mind that we fully expect PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to launch at similar price-points, how did this disparity come about?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"The answer to that comes down to a specific gamble Sony made that Microsoft could not - the utilisation of a unified pool of GDDR5 memory. In the early days of PS4 development, only 2GB of this type of memory looked viable for a consumer-level device. As
 higher density modules became available, this was duly upgraded to 4GB. By the time of the reveal back in February, Sony had confidence that it could secure volume of 512MB modules and surprised everyone (even developers) by announcing that PS4 would ship
 with 8GB of unified GDDR5 RAM. The design of its surrounding architecture would not need to change throughout this process - one set of 16 GDDR5 chips would simply be swapped out for another."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Microsoft never had the luxury of this moving target. With multimedia such a core focus for its hardware, it set out to support 8GB of RAM from day one (at the time giving it a huge advantage over the early PS4 target RAM spec) and with serious volume of
 next-gen DDR4 unattainable in the time window, it zeroed in on supporting DDR3 and doing whatever was necessary to make that work on a console. The result is a complex architecture - 32MB of ESRAM is added to the processor die, along with "data move engines"
 to courier information around the system as quickly as possible with bespoke encode/decode hardware to alleviate common bottlenecks. Bottom line: if you're wondering why Xbox One has a weaker GPU than PlayStation 4, it's because both platform holders have
 similar silicon budgets for the main processor - Sony has used the die-space for additional compute units and ROPs (32 vs. 16 in One), while Microsoft has budgeted for ESRAM and data move engines instead. From the Xbox perspective, it's just unfortunate for
 Microsoft that Sony's gamble paid off - right up until the wire, it was confident of shipping with twice the amount of RAM as PlayStation 4."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= The added 4GB of GDDR5 RAM Sony put into the PS4 caught Microsoft off guard. Microsoft went the cheaper, less latency, more convoluted, less developer friendly route due to, get thisâ¦ 3 OS systems for things like TV/skype/Kinect SNAP integration at the
 expense of games, as I'll show you next.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft indirectly confirms: Xbox One OS uses 3GB RAM, 5GB RAM for games</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://gimmegimmegames.com/2013/05/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-os-uses-3gb-ram-5gb-ram-for-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">gimmegimmegames.com/.../microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-os-uses-3gb-ram-5gb-ram-for-games</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"He did this indirectly by not denying past rumors of the RAM being broken down this way. He was directly asked if 3GB RAM was used for the OS and he shyed away from answering, hinting that it may be true."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= It makes sense, because of the 3 OS systems running at the same time, taking up a Gig each of RAM. Also, the Xbone rumors have been nearly dead on.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>With the XBone running 3 OS systems simultaneously, it cuts into game resources. While PS4's OS usage is still a rumor, it is said to be using only 1GB</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://ps4daily.com/2013/04/playstation-4-developers-7-gb-ram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ps4daily.com/.../playstation-4-developers-7-gb-ram</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"However, according to a PlayStation 4 developer PS4Daily spoke to, they have access to âonlyâ 7 GB of RAM. The remaining 1 GB is reserved for the operating system and background tasks."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sony's PS4 GPU is over 50% more powerful</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/6972/xbox-one-hardware-compared-to-playstation-4/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.anandtech.com/.../5</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Sony gave the PS4 50% more raw shader performance, plain and simple (768 SPs @ 800MHz vs. 1152 SPs &amp; 800MHz). Unlike last generation, you don't need to be some sort of Jedi to extract the PS4's potential here. The Xbox One and PS4 architectures are quite
 similar, Sony just has more hardware under the hood."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= While it says 50% here, Microsoft's 3 OS running simultaneously takes up more GPU power as shown in the next article</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Xbox One uses 10% GPU power for all it's OS systems</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://kotaku.com/the-five-possible-states-of-xbox-one-games-are-strangel-509597078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">kotaku.com/the-five-possible-states-of-xbox-one-games-are-strangel-509597078</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Caveat: "this Xbox One development info was circulated by Microsoft to its partners at the beginning of this year. It may have changed, but based on what we saw this week, probably not in any major way"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1) Running: "The game is loaded in memory and is fully running. The game has full access to the reserved system resources, which are six CPU cores, 90 percent of GPU processing power, and 5 GB of memory. The game is rendering full-screen and the user can
 interact with it."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Calculations for both GPUsâ¦ So 66% more than 1.08 (90% Xbone GPU) is approximately 1.8 TFLOPS. (100% PS4 GPU) = PS4 GPU is approximately 66% more powerful.</p>

<p>"This week Digital Foundry analysed the relative power of both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and concluded that, on the face of it, Sony's console comes out on top. This has much to do with the 8GB of DDR3 RAM inside the Xbox One compared to the 8GB of
 super fast GDDR5 RAM inside the PS4."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"According to Gilray, this could see PS4 games enjoy a slight performance advantage over their Xbox One brethren."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"We might see slightly smoother framerates on PS4," he said. "We're working with Sony right now, and they're trying to actively push 60 frames per second, 1080p. You might get situations where the graphics will be a little, but not much, lower quality on
 the Xbox One. Or, you might get some fixed at 30 frames per second situations in 1080p. It depends on the scale of the game. If your game is going to push the heck out of the PS4, you might have to do some little tweaks [for the Xbox One version]. "</p>

<p>MIcrosoft: Wez rely on duh e-Cloudzzz!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://stevivor.com/2013/05/microsoft-xbox-australia-on-some-of-todays-lingering-xbox-one-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">stevivor.com/.../microsoft-xbox-australia-on-some-of-todays-lingering-xbox-one-questions</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft Xbox Australia spokesperson Adam Pollington: âItâs also been stated that the Xbox One is ten times more powerful than the Xbox 360, so weâre effectively 40 times greater than the Xbox 360 in terms of processing capabilities [using the cloud]. If
 you look to the cloud as something that is no doubt going to evolve and grow over time, it really spells out that thereâs no limit to where the processing power of Xbox One can go."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= That CLOUD based theory, and how it will boost Xbox One's processing up to 300X more than without? The real fact is, that's really unproven to say something like that. (Obviously Microsoft doesn't deal in any real facts) as most think it's certainly unfounded.
 It has to be reactionary FUD to try and 1-Up Sony out of pure desperation. Microsoft must know Xbox One is underpowered compared to the PS4... I'll show that next</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The reality of duh e-Cloudzzz</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>An example - "Booty says cloud assets will be used on âlatency-insensitive computationâ within games. âThere are some things in a video game world that donât necessarily need to be updated every frame or donât change that much in reaction to whatâs going
 on,â said Booty. âOne example of that might be lighting,â he continued. âLetâs say youâre looking at a forest scene and you need to calculate the light coming through the trees, or youâre going through a battlefield and have very dense volumetric fog thatâs
 hugging the terrain. Those things often involve some complicated up-front calculations when you enter that world, but they donât necessarily have to be updated every frame. Those are perfect candidates for the console to offload that to the cloudâthe cloud
 can do the heavy lifting, because youâve got the ability to throw multiple devices at the problem in the cloud.â This has implications for how games for the new platform are designed."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>= Do you really think multiplatform developers will code special processing use with help from Microsoft's Cloud for their multiplatform games when both systems are using similar CPUs? Does anyone really believe examples like that are enough to make up the
 GPU advantage? Well, that will be shown next...</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>*Verry long article*</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Xbox One will sit in your living room and burn through not the paltry 1.2 teraflops of computing power as was rumoured, but almost five teraflops - as much as the flagship Â£800 NVIDIA Titan graphics card. And then it will get faster and faster over time.
 At least, that's if the latest Microsoft PR campaign is to be believed. But how realistic is it to move game processing to "the cloud" and keep adding to the resources developers have available? Do Microsoft's claims have any basis in reality? Is this a tactical
 play to compete against the tangibly superior fixed-spec of the PlayStation 4 or is this really just wishful thinking?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>*Conclusion*</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"Microsoft needs to prove its position with strong ideas and practical demonstrations. Until then, it's perhaps best not to get too carried away with the idea of a super-powered console, and there's very little evidence that Sony needs to be worried about
 its PS4 specs advantage being comprehensively wiped out by "the power of the cloud"</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>= Their games may not be all that great, but I have to agree with him on those points. Personally, I don't like talking to electronics. I question... Could any movement while watching TV be detected by Kinect? And really, who wants to look at someone in

<p>"The backtracking and PR-spin posts since the Xbox One reveal have become blatantly obvious now and it appears that Microsoft wasn't ready for gamers to speak up and fight back. In fact, Angry Joe and his followers have gathered quite the pitchfork and torch
 crew informing any and everyone about the Xbox One's policies that strip you of your rights as a consumer!"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"If Microsoft doesn't like the bad press, instead of blaming gaming journalists for actually doing their job for once (and they really do deserve a hand in this case) they should just be honest. If they're really planning on going through with these anti-consumer
 measures they should just say so. At least I'll know right off the bat which console I won't be buying."</p>

<p>Look at what this all caused Microsoft!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[View:http://i.imgur.com/ypnhNx9.jpg]</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My opinion pieceâ¦</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I like being able to do as I wish with my games at anytime I want. Even 20 years from now, and I donât trust YOU (Microsoft), after how youâve handled things in the past. Especially NOW!!! Your DRM solution is crap. I expect trading in games, and buying
 used will completely die off with the extra charges the retailer has to absorb, or undercut the price of trade in. See, Microsoft's retail partners will have to cut costs somehow, and push those added fees onto their consumer base to make up those losses from
 added fees they are charged by using Microsoft's Azure system. Expect all your games to become worthless, just like all those XBLA games will become once Microsoft shuts down 360â²s servers. (They don't stay up forever) So how do you like buying digital content
 for a console that is reliant on Microsoft's servers staying up in-order to play your games 20 years from now?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Itâs VERY arrogant of Microsoft to not care about all the people in the World who cannot afford the added cost of the monthly Internet Fee, but can save up to buy a system for Christmas for their kids. Itâs also VERY arrogant to think every part of the World
 has access to the Internet, or it being reliable. It's all about the Have's of the World to Microsoft, and not about those who have not. No Microsoft, even though I have money to waste, my morals, and what I believe in will stop me from giving you a damn dime
 of my money ever again. Get a Damn clue Microsoft! Japan, and many parts of Europe WILL NOT support your crap of a console! You already lost before you started.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>People have to be clueless to think Microsoft's developers, and 3rd party developers will constantly be working to make games look better/fresh through the CLOUD service without an added FEE/Pay-Wall. Microsoft's Cloud ideas are not even known to be possible,
 and they talk like it can add 300% more processing capabilities? I can see right through your BS Microsoft. You know you lost that power advantage to Sony, and not by a little bitâ¦ but more like a significant amount.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The only reason Microsoft is pushing for the cloud is to push Digital content, and eventually make it mandatory to have to be ALWAYS ONLINE. If the game doesn't sell well enough, or online activity drops to a level they feel it's not worth supporting, they
 will kill the server for that game. That will kill your ability to ever play it again. Microsoft, you are forcing the issue, instead of letting physical discs die off slowly. I don't think many will like that.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The Issues that need to be fixedâ¦</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Mandatory online DRM - I don't want my gameplay reliant on your ability to keep a server up. Not an easy solution here, but how you're going about it is dumb for a console. How about you stick with online passes, and leave Single Player games alone until
 you can figure out a better way?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Kinect Mandatory - There is no reason why it should be mandatory. It's something you plug in, I don't want a camera that always plugged into my game console. I don't want to even buy the thing with it included in the cost of the console. You should be able
 to fix this problem through software, and a Kinect-less SKU that's cheaper.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Mandatory Installs - While this is a good thing, it should be optional in a console. People borrow, rent, and don't always have, or want to use up the hard drive space.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Stationary Hard Drive - Remember "Things break" Microsoft? So what happens when the internal Hard Drive goes out? You can't do those damn mandatory Installs, so does that render your console, and games useless until you get another one, or get it fixed?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No Included headset - Who was the bonehead who thought up this idea? I think you will reconsider this, because it's dumb not to included it while thinking Kinect will take its' place. How about you just offer Two SKUs? One with Kinect, and one without that
 includes a headset?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No Rentals - Nice, Xbone is only for the Elite people of the World who can buy everything. I find it morally wrong. Did the Movie industry do their best to destroy rentals?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Full game prices for a friend to borrow - You will not get more sales because of this, but you have pissed off a lot of people. Good business?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Licensed games - Many gamers like myself collect games, and play them years later. I don't want to buy any game that is reliant on your Cloud servers to run. That means the Xbone games have a limited shelf-life, for even Single Player games. Microsoft will
 not keep every server up once the replace the console.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Licensed CONSOLE - The Xbone needs to be hooked up to Microsoft's Azure server over the net, or it will render my system useless for playing games. I still have a SEGA Genesis &amp; SEGA CD that I still play to bring back memories. Nah, Microsoft, that's a HUGE
 deal breaker. A console should play ALL Single Player games decades later without a connection to a server.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No backwards compatibility - The big deal here is 360 XBL digital content that will not transfer over, so everything gaming related that you bought digitally has a temporary shelf life. It will all disappear once Microsoft cuts out the online portion for
 the 360 like they did for the Original Xbox. Sony is in the same boat here, but I have a feeling far more people bought content over XBL than PSN. Not only that, but many expected Microsoft to have full B/C by controlling the 360 tech after what happened with
 the original Xbox.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Big Ugly Glossy brick of a console - MIcrosoft, you go find a Mason somewhere and had him stick two different colored bricks together with superglue? The thing looks like a joke! It's bigger than the first 360, has no imagination, and is glossy PUKE!!!
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[View:http://www.blogcdn.com/www.joystiq.com/media/2013/05/130524xbox-one.jpg]</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Horrible design in Kinect - The thing freaks me out, really it does. I've seen better looking designs come out of the 80's. The thing looks like your 360 power brick, on ROIDS!!! Who wants this thing on top of your nice looking HDTV?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>[View:http://cdn3.sbnation.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/13588913/xbox_one_2.0_cinema_960.0.0_cinema_640.0.jpg]</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>No DVR - What is the point in calling it Xbox ONE if it really in't replacing anything? This was supposed to be the one (No pun intended) that did it all.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>NO Cable Box replacement - This is not helping people get rid of a bunch of boxes cluttering up their entertainment center, it ADDS to the clutter by having more wires</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>IR Blasters - Just crap. I don't know many electronic enthusiasts who like dealing with IR blasters strung around. They usually get a Harmony Universal remote that helps out with less clutter while making it very easy to control everything. I also bet you
 can't control the Xbone with a Harmony remote because Microsoft is so forward thinking.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Indie Devs - These are the developers of the future Microsoft, you screw yourself by making it worse for them. I shake my head because this is very simple basic stuff. You just need common sense, and some true gamers within the company to realize this. Mr,
 Ex-EA Goofy Man Don Mattrick, and Ex Sony idiot Phil Harrison are not cutting it!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Stop lying, spinning, or trying to hide the truth - It's a total insult to all your fans (What's left of them) and it makes you look like prepubescent 2005 Sony! Many Microsoft fans held you up high because you didn't try to swindle, contort, manipulate
 the facts. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Weaker tech - Microsoft, This was the #1 thing I feared during the rumors. You sacrificed power for Kinect gadgets, and a lame Minority Report OS for Tv. The MAIN reason I became an Xbox fan in the first place was "Power in a Console." I've never been a
 PC gamer, always been a console gamer. I like to buy the best tech in a console, and give my full support to that over any others, and I bet I'm not alone. You let me down for sure.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Arrogance - One of my pet peeves, and a reason why I disliked the old Sony. Now it's a total reversal like Geff Gerstmann said. Saying things like you think this is what gamers want, and and then saying "Core gamers will buy anything" shows your
 inability to see past your nose. Complete and total let-down, and in hated territory now.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All that adds up to a bunch of big screw ups from Microsoft, and their arrogant attitude. There is no other reasonable explanation really. If you still want the XBone, just be prepared for Used/Rental game services to become extinct, used games to become
 worthless while new prices stay high, and a console system that you are only licensing until Microsoft takes down the servers. That daily/Weekly/Monthly DRM check makes your system dependable on whatever Microsoft decides, and your online service quality.
 While Sony SAYS they will leave it up to the developers to do as they wish with their games, lets at least hope for that. You would think Microsoft's system is better because you have the option to sell your games. However, with Sony it's not 100% certain
 that every Publisher will lock out used games, and you will have the choice to support those that don't. Furthermore, there is no mandatory "Always Online" or "Online Checks" on Sony's platform that we know of at this moment, so it's up to us to support what
 is best for gaming going forward. If Sony does the same thing as you Microsoft, or anything like that... Then I hope gaming comes crashing down all-around the both of you!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So screw YOU Microsoft! Iâm not going to get Xboneâd by you!!!! This is the most anti-consumer product ever! Oh, and BTW, you're way too late. Somebody did it better, smarter, and earlier than you! It also doesn't need a huge bulky KInect monstrosity above

<p>I think its funny how many people don't actually understand how consoles work.... for example the ps4 gpu is about 15% more powerful teraflops don't mean everything... xbox 360 vs ps3 &nbsp;xbox 360 has 1 million teraflops while ps3 has 2 million I believe all
 together.</p>
<p>plus the most expensive card to date has roughly 4.5 to 4.8 million flops compared to ps3 1.83? but in honestly terms compared the most expensive card is about 20x better than ps4's gpu..</p>
<p>again we will see... gamers are just funny now a days. e3 will seriously set people straight or towards the other console either way.</p>
<p>And how bad ms treats indies one guys freaks out cause he wanted more money after signing a contract long story short it was just retarded.</p>
<p>many of you need to read the fine print or text when accepting anything for online or gaming even the Kinect (1) does this... it is mostly for updating and fixing minor issues that most people have in common like zoom in and zoom out features or even just
 waving. even the ps eye has it...</p>
<p>even some cell phone companys can listen to calls or voicemails specially when you phone in the help desk all to improve service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw sony will use drm because if they do not while splitting it with devs and publishers all will go to xbox one its a no brainer its a industry about money and to make more of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, and about Kinect...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Originally Posted by user RickNash of Sherdog</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't like to read, and who do not want to familiarize yourself with exactly what the problems are with XBOX One, don't read this post.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>First, you should all become familiar with the free and immaterial labour theses (there's a bit on these throughout). They're very much at play here.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've explained this in several posts, but the amount of controls placed on the consumer who purchases and uses the XBOX One is unprecedented for a gaming console. People who scoff at the Kinect and suggest that you "put a towel over it" are dodging the issue
 at hand. How ridiculous is it that you have to do that in the first place? Isn't placing the towel over it an admission that something is wrong? For some reason they don't want to admit it, and I don't know why. If Sony proposed something similar, I would
 be on their *** about it, too. This isn't about Microsoft vs. Sony (though they would love for you to keep the conversation about that, just like arguments about who's better between Democrats vs. Republicans when there are issues beyond ideological partisanship).
 It's far more political and much more far-reaching than just that. It's about the relationship between corporations who produce media technologies (or any technology, really) and the consumer, and who holds the power. What's being proposed by Microsoft with
 the Xbox One is an example of an insane shift in power where the producers of technology have an inordinate amount of control over how their products are being used, for their benefit only, through the control and exploitation of the consumer.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm going to make myself very clear here: I own an XBOX 360 and have loved the console for as long as I've had it. I'm not a fanboy of either Sony or Microsoft, though I'm more familiar with Microsoft products and most often always enjoy them. If I am a
 fanboy of one company over the other, then I'm a fanboy of Microsoft. My critical stance stems from having studied new media academically for quite a long while now. What Microsoft is proposing would be the realization of, quite literally, a kind of doomsday
 prophesied over the past two decades by new media scholars worried about the amount of power imbedded within new technologies, and their ability to exploit consumers who are unaware that they're being exploited. I did not purchase a PS3, and, prior to what
 Microsoft released in their reveal, I was ready to purchase their next gen. gaming console. That's not what they're releasing, though.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It should be made clear here, then, that the XBOX One is not a gaming console. What Microsoft is trying to do is what most every media company who produces hardware and software has been trying to do for the past several decades: create a convergent media
 technology wherein a user can gain access to all of the different forms of media. The XBOX One is, quite literally, everything you want media related in one box (thus, the name!). That's not the problem, though.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The problem is that they've fitted this technology with additional hardware and software that monitors your media consumption, your consumption of products (drinks, food, your use of second screens, your clothes, any other commercial product that's in view,
 and so on) while engaging with media, your heart rate, your emotional state. Do you know why they've increased the amount of servers used to service the XBOX One? Because they will need them to process data collected about you and anyone else who uses the
 product. They're collecting information about you and other users to sell to advertisers, but they're doing it in a way that's more invasive than any other form of data collection previously employed, including the recording of audience ratings for television
 stations (in doing this, television networks translate your viewing into advertising dollars for them, literally transforming your leisure time into a form of free labour that they profit off of), the tracking, storing, and selling of your search behaviours,
 or other behaviours, when using Google or Facebook, all of which is sold to advertisers for a profit. These aren't nearly as bad as what Microsoft is doing, though.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Unlike Google and Facebook, services provided for "free" to the consumer, you have to pay for Xbox One, and all ancillary software (I'll include in my definition of "software" any and all apps that give you access to additional media sources, including the
 Internet, television, music, and so on). You're literally paying Microsoft to mine you for information that is of interest advertisers, all so that they can sell this information and make an absolute shitload of money, which you pay Microsoft to do for the
 financial benefit of Microsoft and Microsoft only (other related corporations are probably involved, too, especially those who have offered to give Microsoft exclusive access to their content). Think of how ridiculous that is.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That you need to be connected to the Internet to play games, and to do anything on the XBOX One tells you all you need to know about the intentions of Microsoft and their want to have an always-on consumer base producing valuable information, constantly
 feeding it through the pipeline. The Kinect needs to be connected for the system to work. The used game market will be severely transformed, and not in a way that benefits the consumer. There is more, but I think the point is clear: Microsoft is controlling
 and monitoring the way in which you use their product far more than any other company has dared to do in the past. That's problematic, especially because of the ways they're proposing to issue control over your behaviour.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It strikes me as odd that anyone would give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt here, and would preach apathy toward the Kinect and any other piece of invasive software or hardware that comes with the Xbox One. Think of the differences between the Xbox One
 and the Xbox 360. What has Microsoft really added to this entertainment system, and whose bottom line do these additions benefit the most?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is one of the more aggressive attempts made by a technology company to exploit their consumer base, and sets a ridiculous cultural precedent for the future relationship between consumer and corporation.</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Just wanted to share this. I really believe NO ONE who cares about their rights as a consumer, and even as a respected and free human being, should support this console.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>
