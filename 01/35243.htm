<h2>            windows 10 mail app only spins when trying to open</h2>
                    after trying to open the mail app all that is seen is an envelope and &nbsp;the word mail with a spinning circle under it. it will stay like that forever. even after each windows update it still will not work. I am however able to use the app on another user
 account same computer&nbsp;without a problem. It has been like this since I upgraded the pc from windows 8.1. Is there a fix?

</span></p>
<p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with opening Mail App. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:&nbsp;<br />
1. Corrupt app.<br />
2. Missing App Updates.<br />
3. Conflict between antivirus software.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
1) Please make sure to re-enable Antivirus software after troubleshooting steps.<br />
2) Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<h2>            I need directx 9 on my windows 10</h2>
                    Hello, I need to install directx 9 to play old games, but when I try to run the installer, I receive this error message: "You must be running Windows 98, Millennium Edition,&nbsp;Windows&nbsp; Server 2003 Family ton install Directx 9.0.". You might say that it's
 because it's incompatible, but it actually is. I had a windows 8 that was running directx 9 and working perfectly and then it was updated to windows 10 it was still working, so it's compatible. But I bought a new computer with a fresh windows 10 edition and
 I need the directx 9, please help me.

<h2>            Microsoft Life CAM HD - 3000 - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new PC for the office which operates on Windows 10. Immediately after purchase I connected my Life Cam HD - 3000 to the new PC and it worked like a charm. A couple of weeks ago there were a few updates from Windows which were installed
 on my PC and from then onward it just doesn't recognize that the camera plugged into my computer. I have confirmed this by checking the device manager and by disconnecting and connecting the camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I take my camera to a different PC in the office that works with windows 7, the device manager sees the device but doesn't have the correct drive, which gives me the indication that the camera is working however windows 10 doesn't seem to be compatible
 with the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to download a driver for the product, nothing seems to be available for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are my missing something here, please advise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - WDDM 1.1 problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p>When looking to upgrade/reserve my copy of WIndows 10 there was a problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The button that let's me reserve the OS was not appearing at all, I had the program but no button to allow me to enter my email!</p>
<p>- When i check my PC, it tells me there is a critical issue. The issue is that a program i installed *iDisplay* is not compatible. The full name is iDisplay (Microsoft corporation - WDDM v1.1) I used control panel to remove iDisplay from my PC and the folders
 are now gone. However it still comes up as a problem when upgrading/reserving my copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My setup is:</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>i7 4930k Processor</p>
<p>GTX 970 Asus</p>
<p>16Gb Ram</p>
<p>500Gb SSD</p>

</p><p>Even though you might get this message, you can always run Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver.
</p>
<p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>Type: <strong>wuapp</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25b26fbb-13ac-4ae2-bb19-50476b171948" /></p>
<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

    <title>Unable to consitently turn on Xbox One X remotely - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kleinbird36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to consitently turn on Xbox One X remotely</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox One X is rarely able to turn on remotely - via the Xbox App or Smartglass. I have the Xbox hardwired to my router, and "Instant On" is enabled. I have tried a multitude of things - new Ethernet cables, different router, different Win10 computers (some wired, some wireless), system wiped the Xbox and started fresh, etc.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've also noticed that games and updates don't always auto-download like they're supposed to. Sometime it won't initiate until I have turned on the Xbox. I have it set to download these while in standby.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any help or ideas are greatly appreciated... I'm starting to think that there might be something defective with my Xbox One X.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

            <p>I'd give this a bump. I can never get my Xbox One X to turn on from the Windows app. If I start the Xbox and then use the app it connects fine. Game updates seem to be hit or miss. I've also been having issues getting media player to see my NAS. It's almost like my Xbox lives in it's own little world on my network but with wonky automatic systems. I wager it's some kind of router settings but I've ensured UPNP is enabled, tried renaming the xbox as recommended elsewhere to no avail. Kind of stuck.</p>

But once it is turned off, neither the SmartGlass or Xbox App are able to turn it back on.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I did talk with online chat support, and the things they recommended I had already tried, except testing a second Xbox, which I do not posses.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Things I've done:</p><p>- different Ethernet cables</p><p>- used wifi instead of hardwired</p><p>- factory reset Xbox and started fresh</p><p>- different router</p><p>- different Windows 10 PC's with the Xbox App</p><p>- Xbox on different network<br /></p> 
  <p>Thanks for the update on this.&nbsp;Also, does the current router you're using have two different active channels between 5GHz and 2.5GHz? Is your Xbox One X console connected to a wall outlet or power strip?</p> 
 </blockquote> <p>My router does broadcast both the 2.4 and 5Ghz bands. When I tried wireless I connected it to the 5Ghz band. I have tried both plugging directly to the wall, and to a power strip/surge protector.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Thanks for that info. To check, both your console and your mobile were connected to the same 5GHz band when you tried this? Also, do you have any kind of&nbsp;MAC filtering or AP isolation enabled on your router?</p>

<h2>            Unable to setup Windows Hello to use Fingerprint sensor</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">I recently had my laptop fixed (I did something dumb and needed to have a factory reset). I connected my hotmail account to my laptop sign in account and I wanted to set up the fingerprint reader as an option to sign into my laptop...
 however I cannot for the life of me figure out where to go to set it up... I've tried to look up the answer online but I have not found a solution that works.<br />
<br />
At first I thought I needed to install the HP Simple Pass, so I did that, but it only talks about passwords for websites... nothing about the computer log in...&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Then I found that there's something called "Windows Hello" but there is no "Windows Hello" listed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact model of the PC?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue might be due to missing fingerprint sensor drivers on the PC and that’s why Windows hello feature is not working.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check if you have the fingerprint drivers are installed on your PC or not.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press
<strong>Windows key + R</strong>. This will open <strong>Run</strong>. Alternatively, you can go to Start and search for ‘<strong>Run</strong>’.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In Run dialog box, type ‘<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>’ and hit enter.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check for the drivers if installed any.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If there are no drivers installed, you can download and install them from the manufacturer’s website.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the drivers are for older version of Windows you can install them in compatibility mode. Refer the article

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>I've been receiving the above message for the past few weeks but haven't been able to find a problem.</p>
<p>I ran the troubleshooter from the 'click here' in the red error box but this didn't find anything wrong.</p>
<p>I also separately ran the troubleshooter for the power as I did notice the battery had seemed to have drained quickly. Again, no problem identified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen detaches and reattaches without any apparent problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>It just seems odd that the computer seems to think it has detected a problem but then doesn't seem to know what it is :P</p>

                    <div>Can you solve this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently built my own computer and now I'm having trouble installing the operating system. I believe all the parts of my CPU are installed correctly because I see them in BIOS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I first tried to install the Windows, I did not set a partition for the only HDD in my computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now whenever I try to boot the Windows DVD, with the DVD ROM first in the boot order, the Windows Splash screen appears for about 5 minutes, then it goes blank for 10 minutes, then a BSOD flashes on my screen, and my computer restarts.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is something wrong with my HDD? My computer?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can give my computer specs for anyone who is willing to help.</div>

<h2>            OMG Tech Help - Are They Legit&#39; Or A Scam - Should ALL Remote Tech Services Be Avoided&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have had repeated BSODS ("Blue Screen Of Death") episodes for months, and have followed the steps / suggestions from the Windows Forum relating to Win 7 BSODS, but errors and BSODS persist.&nbsp; I have nearly lost access to the hard drive more than once (error
 reading / unable to access sector 00).&nbsp; Some messages have indicated driver issues (thus I repeatedly use the "verifier" program to ID driver issues, but it never runs past the initial restart); so I did a web search for a driver update utility, and the top
 of the list was a Driver Update download that is supposedly Windows Gold Certified and "high recommended."&nbsp; When I downloaded and began to install Driver Update, it required registration and purchase of the program to update old drivers, and THEN it required
 that I call an 855 number to have a customer service rep' REMOTELY activate the program.</p>
<p>I COULD have STOPPED then and there, but I have been getting desperate to get this PC fixed, and I live way out in the country far from any certified repair tech's.&nbsp; SO . . . yes: I continued -- made the call, and the "customer service" rep' remotely accessed
 my system, and (I say now) supposedly showed my a system log file revealing over 3200+ system errors that he says are leaving trace accumulative damage to my system, and could be caused by any number of issues, and he strongly urged that I get my PC "Tuned
 Up."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>He said MICROSOFT recommends PC's get a full-service "Tune Up" twice each year, and those cost around $300 via local technicians.&nbsp; He said my PC was in dire need of a full "OTR" -- "One Time Repair" -- including a full "Infection Sweep" and "14-Step Tune-Up."&nbsp;
 Also:&nbsp; he said my Kaspersky Internet and malware protection is not sufficient, because it does not actually fully block malware access to my PC, but identifies it after it is on the PC and then offers options, which can still leave residual or trace "damage"
 to my system that accumulates over time, therefore I should use their anti-virus, 98%-proof malware blocking (etc.) software that comes with their full service package -- i.e. -- unlimited 24/7 tech' support, remote repairs, live protection, system maintenance
 / updating, and those pricey "tune ups" as requested.&nbsp; He also said there is a 100% satisfaction or full money-back guarantee.&nbsp; At this point, we will see about that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ANYWAY&nbsp;-- I finally discovered he represents "<strong>OMG Tech Help</strong>" based out of Delray, Florida.&nbsp; ( omgtechhelp.com )&nbsp; Their annual fee for the above noted services is $300, but -- of course -- their "Black Friday" deal is another full year of
 service for" just" an additional $70 (plus $30 in assorted fees).&nbsp; It was LATE at night.&nbsp; I was super tired and frustrated and I can't afford to replace this PC right now -- not for all the money I've already poured into it (it's just a year old).&nbsp; So -- I
 HOPED / HOPE theses guys are legit' and went with the 2 years of service.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I type this on my OTHER PC, they have been remotely doing SOMETHING remotely on the PC in question for over 14 hours.&nbsp;
<strong>What should I do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Stick with these guys?&nbsp; Or cancel the plan, demand my money back, and then have to reformat my hard drive and start over?</strong></p>

            <p>Very high chance that it is a scam.&nbsp;You should cancel whatever their doing immediately. They have lied to you enough already, and they also rambled a lot of nonsense.&nbsp;(<em>for example:</em> Even if you have 3200 Event Viewer entries, they don't do any harm
 to you.) Although these people did <strong>not</strong> claim to be from Microsoft, as evidenced by your post, please note that Microsoft does

<p>If, upon further researching of the company or receiving more advice, you confirm that it is a scam: Yes, I do recommended finding out some way to get your money back, mainly because that money could be used to further fund the scamming business. They may
 refuse, in which case you may have to take it up with your bank.</p>

<p>I would avoid most, if not all, remote tech services.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your feedback / opinion.&nbsp; I should have known better.&nbsp; OMG Tech' may think of themselves as "legitimate" but their practices -- i.e. sales tactics and misleading statements regarding the Log file errors, etc.&nbsp;-- are deceptive at best.&nbsp;&nbsp;First I
 contacted the merchant payment service to cancel the payment (transaction still pending), and set up a full refund, then contacted OMG Tech' to cancel the service subscription and request a full refund.&nbsp; Then I contacted my bank and put them on notice to watch
 for the refund and prevent any other transactions with said merchant / vendor.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are a number of issues I am dealing with now -- i.e. -- could not get back into Windows (my pass word was no longer recognized . . . . Their technician obviously set his own to keep his remote access open, and I can only give him SOME "benefit of the
 doubt" that he was going to reset it to mine? . . . but I interrupted the process . . . ).&nbsp; So --&nbsp;for that and other security reasons, I used my system restore disk&nbsp;to revert back to a restore point a day before OMG Tech had any access to my PC.&nbsp; Since then
 I have run full system viral / malware scans, etc.&nbsp; Obviously, I still have to get these BSODS resolved ASAP, but I have gone back and made sure all drivers are up to date.&nbsp; My dealings with OMG Tech' and other remote tech' support services are done for now.&nbsp;
 Thanks again!</p>

            Hi!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I'd like to add that OMG Tech Help has actually helped me quite a bit with my computer issues. I too called them because I was prompted to do so if I wanted them to remotely activate my software. I speak from experience when I say that they are definitely
 NOT a scam and they stick to their refund policy if they are unable to help. My friend had a lot of issues going on with his computer and he signed up with them as well, but in the end, it ended up being a hardware issue. The technicians at OMG explained to
 him exactly what he needed if he wanted to keep his computer, but he simply wanted to purchase another one instead. Because of this, they immediately refunded his money no questions asked.<br />
<br />
Cameron had mentioned the popular scam out there now about fake Microsoft reps calling people unsolicited. This is mainly and Indian based con job. These guys don't do that at OMG (and are US based). I called them, as I believe PLMac did as well in order to
 activate my product.<br />
<br />
I don't usually post things on sites like this, but after reading these comments, I really just felt like I had to give my two cents. OMG has been great to me. Sure, I listened to what they said to me when I first called in and I decided to go ahead and purchase
 their services. I don't understand what the big deal is with having a company remote in to your computer in order to fix it. The alternative is to bring it in to a store and leave it with someone with whom I can't even see what they're doing. Is it not better
 to have the option of looking at what a technician is doing? A tech at a store can see your information as much as someone remotely accessing it.
<br />
<br />
Every big named company out there provides remote service (Dell, Apple, etc...). Again, a good thing about OMG is that they are US based, which is one of the big reasons why I went with them. I also looked them up on the BBB and of course, they are accredited
 with an A- rating. In my book, OMG Tech Help is a great company!<br />

            <p>I apologize for the way I sounded, but the way the original person described it gave evidence that it was dangerous, regardless of whether or not it was a scam. Yes, I would trust Dell or another manufactuerer with my PC, but their attempt at legidimate
 help is somehwat off, due to them lying about Microsoft recommendations, and the exaggeration of event viewer danger, I decided that that was enough to not trust them.</p>

<p>P.S. normally I have spellcheck, but not this time. In fact, I'm&nbsp;rarely even looking at the screen while I'm typing this.</p>

            Greetings PLMacNC, this post is solely my experience and as such I should add the disclaimer that results may vary. Admittedly I'm not too tech savvy which is why I ended up at the dreaded Geek Squad (wife's suggestion) when I first encountered the BSOD
 on what was my year and a half new HP system. They promised a full system repair and threw in some proprietary Malware Blocker software for $249 for the complete service. A few days later I had my machine back and guess what began occurring again? You betcha
 BSOD!
<div><br />
<div>I did a web search for Tech Support trying to find a resolution to my problem. I came across these guys that you mentioned like mid-summer. I contacted them directly and was pitched on an annual subscription for remote tech support for $199 which included
 some discount for being a Veteran and they suggested a lot of what you stated, a tune-up, full sweep, one time removal and even some additional Malware software as I had freeware versions of McAfee and Norton (you get what you pay for right?). Anyway, they
 initially went through my system logs and identified some possible issues as to what could've been causing my intermittent BSOD issue. Given my experience with the "Weak Squad" and what I'd already spent trying to fix it I was a bit leery of signing up for
 a something that I felt I couldn't tangibly evaluate (seeing as I'm no computer guy).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The agent brought up some good points (possible sales tactics or a canned rebuttal) about not being able to physically see what a technician is "doing" IF I dropped off for local repair service again and how that could become a bit cumbersome seeing as
 it is a desktop and not a laptop. I was given the same disclaimer about working being guaranteed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have to say that although the work took literally 2 days and numerous phone calls from them to me and from me to them to check on status to fully complete, I got the resolution I was seeking and they did keep me in the loop every step of the way. The
 initial technician I had did some trouble shooting and had me on the phone as I sat and watch what he did and explained to me how the error logs helped to identify when the error first started occurring and how an automatic windows updated done around the
 same time "could've" been the culprit. I guess it was a shift change and he put me on with one of their Level 3 guys who over the next day and a half went way above and beyond what I would think is the normal call of duty for this type of service and actually
 came in on his off day on day 2 to ensure I was handled by him. It turns out after much trouble shooting that the issue was with (after a failed operating system re-install) was a failing hard drive and he walked me through (over numerous calls) how to back
 up my data externally to import once I'd replaced it with a new one I picked up at my local Best Buy (the same place that gave me crappy service). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After about 5 months now, &nbsp; my computer is running smoothly and I've contacted them numerous times for basic support (trouble installing a new printer, issues with an unresponsive web browser and other problems) as I was promised 24/7 service for a year,
 and I do feel that I am getting my money's worth and then some. Regardless of how long it took I was just happy that my issue was able to be resolved and that these guys knew what they were doing and were able to communicate that to me in a language that I
 could understand.</div>

            I worked at OMG as an escalation tech almost a year ago. I left to peruse other ventures. While I wasn't a huge fan of everything internally, I do want to defend them with facts: All of the calls are inbound because the customers had virus' on their computer,
 it was not an accident that they contacted OMG. The converse side of that, is customers had already been 'duped' by malicious software or 'scare-ware' which they had installed (usually unknowingly). OMG was not the one's putting the software on those computers,
 the customer was. OMG gets activation calls for that software then the sales rep shows other issues that the software won't fix and why you need an actual person to fix most of the problems. The technicians are very skilled and able to fix most of the problems.
 While I don't agree with their tactics on getting customers, I can say that A. You called because you had an infection and B. the techs were qualified enough to fix it. At the end of the day, the customer had a computer that

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the mistake to call them, it the end of may. I had a trojan and I was affraid to lost all my programs, an paper. I am a french person and told them that I would like to speak with a french person to explain me everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very difficult...... I thing that I spoke with a man once, in all that awfull 2 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway.....as ususual...they made the bla bla&nbsp;you are going to loose every thing if u are not buying write away a check up and a clean up&nbsp; that will cost you around&nbsp; 129$&nbsp; but ......and then&nbsp; they put you on the hold on...</p>
<p>so...you accept the first one&nbsp; bill.....you pay of course cause (like me ) I told them stupidly that I had and accident I was stuck at my house, I'm old lady not much money.....so. and&nbsp; I was sick....</p>
<p>So they clean with&nbsp; my help cause you have to be there to help the guy&nbsp; that go on in your computer....he is asking u...think to do.</p>
<p>Some are nice..but there are one guy that that to me, and he was crying after me, because I was not doing what he was telling me to do.....but I didn't&nbsp; understand....and he began to tell me, I am crying after you as I am doing with my daugter when she is
 not doing what I am asking what to do....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had&nbsp; 2 computer to fix....one with one man&nbsp; nice,&nbsp; but, I had to work as hard as him and the other&nbsp; that was crying after me for 8 hours....I was&nbsp; crying like a baby after the night&nbsp; and all the rest of the weekend.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mad a complain to Aishan, because the man didn't made his job properly,&nbsp; and when back to see to job of his&nbsp; friend that was done, and undo i&nbsp;t on my&nbsp; second computer for......no raison.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It cost me for the first computer&nbsp; for the cleaner and the anti-virus waranty one year&nbsp; 499$ canadian</p>
<p>and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 239$</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But,&nbsp; today, I had&nbsp; call them back cause since a week I had problem and my computer is slowing down...</p>
<p>I called them back 5 weeks ago and they were telling me that I had no more waranty.....I had&nbsp; many problem and I forgot it...but today I call back and they told me the same think....no more waranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>They told me that because I call them a lot,&nbsp; because the&nbsp; first time&nbsp; that they were supposed to make the installation I had so much problem that I had to call them, first to&nbsp; report&nbsp; the man,&nbsp; second, to&nbsp; report the problem on my second computer and then
 to ask a refund for my second computer..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, they say that,&nbsp; I said&nbsp; that&nbsp; I ask them to end my waranty???????</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then for that.....they solve the problem by&nbsp; ending that by giving me 2 days hafter I had giving
</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So,&nbsp; I never been satisfy by them,&nbsp; there never made my transaction in french, never talk to me in french and....when I began to very get mad, the only real anwer I had it&nbsp; is&nbsp; the woman that past me the I supposed it is the administrator that take is big

            <p>The key part is anybody calling you is a scam, if you call them then it is down to where you found them and their attitude to you as a customer. This is much the same as any other trade even ones on the street. The only real way of getting some kind of assurance
 is recommendations and even then not those on web sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately there is a limit to what can be done remotely especially when it is a problem that stops the computer working. A face to face discussion with a local repair shop should produce better results overall.</p>

    <title>Hardware Virtualization Support but Disabled, even after forcing in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hardware Virtualization Support but Disabled, even after forcing in BIOS</h2>
                    <p>I am really at a loss here.</p>
<p>I have an Alienware m11x R3 (Bios version A05, the most current) and in the BIOS it has Hardware Virtualization listed as ENABLED.&nbsp; I ran Speccy and it states that Hardware Virtualization is Supported but Disabled.&nbsp; Windows Virtualization Tool also reports
 it is disabled.&nbsp; A quick search on the Internet offered the suggestion of disabling Virtualization in the BIOS, powering down the system (NOT reset) then re-enabling.&nbsp; I've disabled it and powered down for 5 minutes, then powered back on and re-enabled it.&nbsp;
 Windows still says Supported but Disabled.&nbsp; Tried disabling, powering down, booting into Windows.&nbsp; Powered down, re-enabled, powered down, Windows still says Supported but Disabled.</p>
<p>So I'm not sure what to do from here.&nbsp; In all other respects, the machine works fine, no lock-ups, no strange errors...&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

<p>I have a Compaq-mini-CQ100 net book which has no CD drive, OS is&nbsp; windows XP home , the disk has bad sectors making it unbootable . I cant boot safe mode I get the Blue-screen-of-death with missing DLL's. Currently I am running UBUNTU from a flash drive
 . How can I repair/reinstall XP either via UBUNTU or from a bootable flash drive. I think this becoming a common problems with Net-books and tablet PC's

            I would not hold your breath waiting for MS to create a download of XP home if you have a valid license or not.&nbsp; In fact, I would not count on them for anything.<br />
<br />
If you can't get to any web site using a system that is working, that is a problem.<br />
<br />
I don't know if copying an old version of XP to the flash drive will work or not - I just make bootable XP Recovery Console flash drives for issues like yours.<br />
<br />
You are going to have to fix your missing file problem the old fashioned way.<br />
<br />
When you boot into the XP Recovery Console from a flash drive you should be able to just replace your missing file since XP has copies of it on your system in other places.<br />
<br />
A copy of the file should be here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
or depending on your installation, you might find it here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
But it could be that your unspecified antivirus/antimalwre application qurantined (Effectively deleted) the file.&nbsp; That is more unknown information, thanks to the MS Answers forum not asking for any system information when a new question is asked (you should
 be done by now).<br />
<br />
It is quite common for the XP Recovery Console or even the XP installation not to recognize SATA drives (at least when booting from CDs).&nbsp; There are dozens of different notebook models like yours so there is no way for us to know&nbsp; that you have a SATA drive.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have SATA drives too and do not have this problem, but I think my system is afraid of me.<br />
<br />
In order to get these SATA drives recognized (usually), you need to enter the BIOS of your system and find the section where the device interface is configured and temporarily change it from SATA to something the Recovery Console will recognize (since I can't
 see your BIOS, I can't tell you what that is), replace your missing file by copying it, reboot and change the BIOS back to what it was before you started.<br />
<br />
Be sure to make a note of any BIOS settings you change so you can change them back when you get done or if your situation deteriorates.<br />
<br />
I also suggest Hiren's Boot CD from time to time and they have instructions to download and boot their stuff from a USB drive
<a href="http://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd-on-usb-disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp; I have never seen Hiren's require any BIOS adjustment on a SATA drive, but I don't have your system.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, you should visit the <a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Compaq Support forums</a> where this subject is a frequent topic of discussion.&nbsp; You are not the first person in the world to need to boot their Compaq mini from a USB device in order to fix something.&nbsp; This is the Windows XP help forum - not the Compaq help
 forum.<br />
<br />
Good luck waiting on MS to help you!<br />

            I think if you can boot UBUNTU from a flash drive that your system supports booting from a flash drive or am I missing something?<br />
<br />
Since it has been established that you are indeed able to boot from a USB device, perhaps the Microsoft Support Engineer will continue to supply what comes next?<br />
<br />
Is there some reason you are withholding the information about what you are seeing about these bad sectors, the BSOD&nbsp; and missing DLLs?<br />
<br />
You can create a bootable XP Recovery Console flash drive (there are many methods on the Internet -
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JUTNIeBVw0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here is a nice video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/4JUTNIeBVw0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/4JUTNIeBVw0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>) and from that, you can boot into the XP Recovery Console where you can run chkdsk /r on your HDD to clean up potential bad sectors, and most of the time, if there are DLLs that are
 suspicious or missing, there are backup copies on your system that you can copy in to replace any suspicious or missing ones.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem is we don't know anything about what is wrong with your system, what you are seeing, how it might have gotten this way so can only give general advice, but let's see what the Microsoft Support Engineer comes up with now that the original
 MSE concern has been addressed.<br />

 what do I have to do to get to my files on my external HD?Will I have to install the software for my WD HD onto my PC first before it will work together?I tried to use the Windows Easy Transfer wizard but it will NOT let me and it kept asking me to formatte
 the drive first and I did NOT want to do that for fear of losing all my backups.DT had 7 Ultimate and PC has 7 Home Premium.

<blockquote>This back-up was&nbsp;from another computer and the wizard won't let me access my Western Digital external hard drive that I had the photos music and documents backed up on</blockquote>
The original post said that the wizard you had tried to use the "Windows Easy Transfer wizard" not "Backup and Restore" so I guess I was a bit confused. And on second thought, my reply assumed that you had originally made the backup to the external drive using
 Windows Backup and your original post doesn't mention what you did the backup with. I've got a WD MyBook external usb drive and I use it with 2 different Windows 7 pcs and I've never had to install any software to use it.&nbsp; After you connect it, if you go to
 "Computer" is it recognized there?<br />

            it is telling me to format the disk and I don't want to do this as I fear that it will reformat and erase all my back-ups when it reformats because it was already formated for use with my desktop and all I really need is the photos,music and documents
 and maybe a couple other programs off of it. My&nbsp;laptop is working fine it's the desktop&nbsp;that got shocked and will NOT even power up when I click on the power button.Also before I started using the WD HD on my desktop I installed the software that came with
 the HD and then I did use windows backup and recovery to backup the desktop.And on the laptop when I go to computer and then hookup the HD a windows pop-up tells me that I need to format the drive before I can use it.And again TY for your time and effort to
 help me with this it is greatly appreciated !

            The fear of the click is to format or NOT to format this is the question.What happens after I do this would be the answer.Success or melt down?

            At least at this point, I would NOT format the drive -- if the data isn't already lost it would be after the format.&nbsp; I can't help you with why it is asking you to format the drive.&nbsp; If you don't get an answer from someone else here, you might try Western
 Digital's support site: &nbsp; <a href="http://support.wdc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.wdc.com/</a>
