<h2>            Payments I did not order refused -repeated emails from Sklype.</h2>
                    <p>I get at least two emails a day from skype saying my monthly payment of £25 has been refused.&nbsp; I have never ordered any such payments but find it impossible to locate Skype help - like a person even!&nbsp; Can anyone help?</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Tor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can locate the Skype account by checking the email from Skype. It should show the
<strong>Skype name</strong> (username) that has refused orders. You can open this
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/wallet/account/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to the order history. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you still have questions. </p>

<p>Thank you very much for taking the trouble to&nbsp;help me sort this one out.&nbsp; I receive&nbsp;a couple of emails a day now from Skype re-this problem. There are emails indeed had my Skype name and a very long transaction number. There is no link to me to click on
 in this email, just one at the end of the email to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ways to pay.&nbsp;</span>This just leads to a general site. I have gone through every bit on my account details and history and there is no reference anywhere to this £35
 charge. I can find no way of stopping this. I would quote this email here but don't know how safe this would be. Skype sense you around in circles when you actually try to find a person who can help!.&nbsp;I have never ordered any automatic recharge of any kind.</p>
<p>If you have any further ideas about this, I would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Tpr</p>

<p>Hi Tor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reason why you are receiving these emails from Skype, is when you are calling a mobile or landline number and you don't know enough credits.&nbsp;This will trigger to top up your credits on the current payment method linked to your Skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable your auto top up, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>On Skype</strong>: Use <a href="http://www.skype.com/go/autorecharge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>Select <strong>Disable</strong> to turn off Auto-recharge, select <strong>Enable</strong> to start using it again.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that works. </p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; Something worked.&nbsp; I had never allowed or asked for any recharge anyway, but there was an option to enable a £2&nbsp; recharge&nbsp; so I did that.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll have no more of those emails.&nbsp; Much obliged!</p>

 i will always end up with status code 03-57-00. now dont you dare say that maybe the disc is messed up its brand freaking new and on top of that i go on my brothers xbox and what do you know it works on his. all my other older games work. but if i buy any
 new ones or even if i try putting in an old game that i just got like crackdown my xbox doesnt read the disc, i guess my xbox isnt for change lmfao. anyways i took it apart cleaned it spotless inside and out and am still having this issue with my disc drive.
 please help i am going insane</p>

            <p>HI there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>you said that you took it (your xbox) apart and cleaned, taking it apart voids all warranty and possibly all official support.</p>
<p>And it's not allowed to discuss self repairs</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>About that error code, sometimes clearing the cache will fix this disc read error:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If that fails I would start to think that the disc drive is having some hardware failures, which may not occur with every game.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since you've taken it upon yourself to open your console any sort of troubleshooting that you've already done is basically all there is going to be. What your console is experiencing is an issue with your disc drive (older disc drives sometimes have issues
 reading newer discs). If you've already gone through the steps detailed <strong>
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Then your only final solution (since you've already opened the console) would be to either purchase a used/refurbished, or new console. There's nothing else we
 can help you with in regards to this.</p>

HE6LLSP6AWN6, this is not an appropriate response. An Ambassador should never suggest for another Xbox user to further break the Terms of Use.<br />
<br />
<strong>Any/All </strong>warranties are void if you open your console / break the seal. This is stated on the console, it's very hard to miss. :)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rubbish,</p>
<p>If the warranty has been voided, then the user can do what they like what with getting a 3rd party to look at it for them.</p>
<p>The user will then continue to buy games for your platform. You clearly want a new sale. Rubbish indeed.....</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue. Just bought NBA 2K13 and have to open/eject 20 times and MAYBE it'll recognize the disc. I haven't opened my 360 either. What recourse do I have? Definitely not looking to purchase yet ANOTHER console. Especially when the new stuff
 is on the horizon. I've only been able to play the game twice and since buying it brand new sealed. Went to exchange it and the same thing is happening. Can't even get this one to launch at all. Sure wish I was able to get one of those newer boxes for being
 one of those 10 year guys on xbox live.</p>

<p>Hiya Total! If your Xbox is having a hard time reading multiple discs, I would suggest setting up a repair for your console. Here is a handy link if you need any help:

<h2>            Ctrl &#43; T makes my taskbar disappears until I press it again.</h2>
                    Whenever I press Ctrl + T, my taskbar disappears. I have searched countless forums for the fix to this issue, but nobody else seems to have this same problem. I used to be able to use Ctrl + T to make a new tab in my browser, or go into 'transform mode'
 in Adobe Photoshop, but now, no matter what application I have selected, it forces my taskbar to turn black (negating my ability to use the above functions), only leaving the round start button at the bottom left corner of my screen.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help, thank you in advance.</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Sorry I could not get back in time. None of these helped me very much, but in the end I DID find a solution, though I was not happy about it. I ended up doing a system restore, of a VERY early date, resulting in me losing much of what I had saved, but
 the problem is fixed now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Won&#39;t close Program Manager on shut down, deletes local account</h2>
                    <p>Two problems just now, and I bet related. (1) On shutdown, Windows 10 reported it was (slowly) closing Program Manager. (I haven't been able to locate that item.) It eventually did shut down, but I suspect "forced" and badly, as you'll see. What went wrong?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) On startup, I then found that Windows had deleted my local account. This has happened before, so I was less scared and this time knowledgeable enough to enter my Microsoft password and create a new local account. But again what went wrong?

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By Program manager, are you referring to Task manager?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you have described, it appears that some applications were not responding in a timely manner to the shut down request and might not have been closed properly. This might have resulted in some user profile related files getting corrupt. To find
 out which program might have caused the issue, you can check the event viewer. The event viewer holds a record of all events in the system. Type 'Event logs' in the search box and click on 'View event logs' in the search results. In the Event viewer click
 on 'Windows logs' in the left pane and check if there is any errors reported.</p>

            <p>Ben, first off, no, I didn't mean Task Manager, and it definitely was not open when I tried to shut the computer. I don't even know what Program Manager is. I'm simply telling you what program the screen said was unable to shut down.&nbsp; I can also tell you
 from a search just now that three others in the last week in these forums reported the same behavior without resolution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, searching for Event Logs doesn't act as you say. It simply opens Event Viewer. There I don't see the option to "view events logs," but I do see two things. One is, at right, Open Saved Log, but that can't be what we want, as it then has me browsing
 my documents. The other, at center, is Overview and Summer. I'm afraid I don't understand it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking down it for events in the last 24 hours classed as errors, and it identifies several dozen, all of them cryptic: an event ID and a source such as, occurring several times, DistributedCOM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do also see Windows Logs in the left column, and there, too, there are many cryptic listings. If I stick to Applications, I see an error here and there, such as App with an event ID.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how this information can be useful? </p>

<p>i do not think there is an expiration as I never looked at one, but there could be. &nbsp;but you cannot stack them you would have to wait till the 14 days are up before redeeming the other one or it will cancel the previous one out.</p>

<p>If you're unsure and want to find out, talk to Xbox support. They can verify the codes expiration date for you. Most codes don't expire till the year 9998, so you're probably fine.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t install Brother Printer &#40;even with the latest windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bayzone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install Brother Printer &#40;even with the latest windows 7 drivers&#41;. I suspect it&#39;s the other network printing drivers. When installing, Brother software reports &#34;The operation cannot be completed &#40;error 0x00000706&#41;. The print processor does not exist.</h2>
                    I upgraded from Vista to Win 7<br />
When I try to add the printer manually, I am unable to select any ports.<br />
<br />
Plugging in the printer cause Windows to try to install a driver, but it fails.<br />
<br />
I suspect it was because of my University's Pharos printing system. (It was working when I upgraded from Vista). After I installed Win7 and started having all these problems, I was unable to uninstall it because of some RPC ports error. So I deleted it manually
 and removed all the registry entries.<br />
<br />
Installing the Brother printer still does not work.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to reset all the printer settings? Clear the slate? Restore all the network ports?<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
===<br />
Edit: I've been reading other entries.. My printer spooler kept crashing previously and I had to restart it via services.msc<br />
Also ran sfc /scannow with no errors<br />
Edit: I've since removed all the other printers listed in Print Management, restarted, but still there are no ports listed.

            Ok I found the solution. It turned out that all my print processors and ports were replaced by Pharos System Dlls (used by my university to charge for printing). After upgrading from Vista to Windows 7 they didn't work.<br />
<br />
They became like this:<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows NT x86\Print Processors\winprint]<br />
"Driver"="PSS08B07.DLL"<br />
"PSDriverLink"="winprint.dll"<br />
"PSDriverPath"="C:\\Windows\\system32\\spool\\PRTPROCS\\W32X86\\PSS08B07.DLL"<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors\USB Monitor]<br />
"Driver"="C:\\Windows\\system32\\PSS08B05.DLL"<br />
"PSDriverLink"="usbmon.dll"<br />
"PSDriverPath"="C:\\Windows\\system32\\PSS08B05.DLL"<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
============<br />
<br />
I manually changed ALL the print processors, drivers and ports in CurrentControlSet, CurrentControlSet1, CurrentControlSet2 to their original values and deleted the irritating Pharos ones.<br />
i.e.<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows NT x86\Print Processors\winprint]<br />
"Driver"="winprint.dll"<br />
<br />
etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
restarted and it worked! <br />
Pity the Microsoft troubleshooter couldn't detect it.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

            Hi Jelle.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There was or is no free version of Windows 10 since the free Upgrade from Windows 7 or 8.1 which expired three years ago.  
<br />
<br />Was this an Enterprise trial?  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation to report back the Status and Edition.  
<br />
<br /> Did you buy a discount Product Key?  The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install.  Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.  
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter:  slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here:    <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days.  If not we will need to try something else:  
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out?  If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate.  We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of Windows 10 Home to activate it.  I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their purchases or Microsoft here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />for home computer the message about expiring says the activation was made illegally. This could do unfair seller, technician or any other person during computer repairing. Please, ask PC manufacturer whether it preinstalled Windows on this device.

            DO NOT EVER POST YOUR PRODUCT KEY!
<br />
<br />One cause of this problem is installing Windows Pro on a Windows Home computer. How:
<br />- Sometimes repair shops give customers a "free upgrade" (NOT!). 
<br />- Sometimes Windows Update itself has "accidentally" installed Pro instead of Home
<br />- Sometimes users have accidentally installed Pro when doing a clean install since MS "improved" their downloads and has now bundled Home and Pro in the same ISO download 
<br />
<br />How long have you been running this version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Tell us exactly what edition and version of Windows you have installed:
<br />
<br />PLEASE PROVIDE FULL Windows and/or Office Edition, Version AND Build Numbers
<br />..........******************************************************
<br />.
<br />Although MS does not tell you, when you are asking for help, we really do need to know specific the Windows (or Office) Edition, Version AND Build numbers you are running. 
<br />.
<br />Contrary to MS's wishful thinking, we are all NOT running the "most recent" version (actually Version AND BUILD!) .  Individual recurring, (obviously unfixed) Windows update errors cause people to be running older versions and builds. We commonly see people running versions of Windows that have fallen out of support because they are 18 months old due to unfixed update errors during that span of time. 
<br />.
<br />The simplest way is to RUN the WinVer command  (option 4 or 5 in the following tip)
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-determine-what-version-windows-7-you-have" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-determine-w...</a> 
<br />.
<br />Or you can run the following script to copy and paste the full information:
<br />.
<br />Report Windows Edition, Version and Build number
<br />This “copy and Paste” process will get the full Window Build and Version number information we need:
<br />.
<br />.  *  In start menu, search for POWERSHELL
<br />.  *  Click on it to open a PowerShell window
<br />.  *  Copy the following lines, between the lines of ***, not including them
<br />.
<br />********************
<br />.
<br />$name=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).caption
<br />$bit=(Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem).OSArchitecture
<br />
<br />$vert = " Version:"
<br />$ver=(Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").ReleaseId
<br />
<br />$buildt = " Build:"
<br />$build= (Get-ItemProperty "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion").BuildLabEx -match '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' |  % { $matches.Values }
<br />
<br />$installd = Get-ComputerInfo -Property WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry
<br />
<br />Write-Host $name, $bit, $vert, $ver, $buildt, $build, $installd
<br />
<br /> ********************
<br />Note: the install Date will take a minute to capture the required info
<br />
<br />.  *  Paste them in the PowerShell Window
<br />.  *  Then hit enter.  
<br />.  *  It will return something like this:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Windows 10 Home 64-bit  Version: 1709  Build: 16299.431 @{WindowsInstallDateFromRegistry=18-01-01 2:29:11 AM}
<br />
<br />.  *  Copy that and paste it into your reply

    <title>Windows 10 has ruined my laptop and I don&#39;t know how to fix - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 has ruined my laptop and I don&#39;t know how to fix it&#33; &#40;Desperately need help&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    Up until a few months ago, I had Windows 7. I had not wanted to upgrade to 10 because I was perfectly happy with my laptop as it was, and everything worked fine. Microsoft tried to FORCE me to upgrade when I made the mistake of leaving my laptop open during
 an update, I only just managed to shut it down and stop the forced upgrade. A few months later however I did attempt to upgrade, because someone foolishly told me that a game I play would run faster if I did.<br />
Since then I have had NOTHING but problems!<br />
<br />
First off, it took the upgrade almost 2 days to fully install, and screwed up my laptop several times because it would freeze for 6 hours in mid-download, and when I tried to emergency restart it actually completely messed up it's general preformance. Videos
 wouldn't work, it would crash for no reason. And when I finally called Microsoft to ask for help they refused to help me unless I payed them ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. They wouldn't even talk to me or suggest anything, they just tried to say I had a virus and that
 if I wanted their help I needed to pay them money that I didn't have!<br />
<br />
Then after it had finally installed, since it was NOT A VIRUS, I realized that several of my programs didn't work anymore!<br />
I am a digital artist, that's how I make some of my money, and since upgrading to Windows 10 my drawing programs don't work! Programs that took me several years to fully master! For months now my income has been effected by Windows 10 while I find a program
 that works with it and I am FURIOUS!<br />
<br />
And as of last month, my tablet and mouse drivers DO NOT WORK! And it has nothing to do with the mouse or tablet, as they work just fine on my mother's laptop (which also has 10). I have tried updating the drivers, I have tried redownloading the software, and
 only yesterday my mouse driver has disappeared entirely from the list! I have run multiple virus scans with Windows Defender and turned up nothing. Google has yielded no results for where I can redownload the mouse driver. It was working fine up until that
 point, then it never worked again.<br />
<br />
And now Windows 10 wants to upgrade since yesterday and has given me NOTHING BUT TROUBLE! For no reason, my laptop restarts without warning when I'm in the middle of doing something or if I walk away for one second. The updates take HOURS to download and install,
 and even then give me error messages about how they didn't download or install properly.<br />
<br />
I want to go back to Windows 7, I never had a single problem with Win7, but get this! I can't just downgrade back to it because Windows 10 DELETED MY OLD BACKUP FILES WITHOUT TELLING ME OR NOTIFYING ME. If that had been made clear to me prior to upgrading I
 would have NEVER upgraded. My only way to get back to Windows 7 is to either pay Microsoft money for a new copy of the operating system that my laptop came with in the first place, or completely reset my laptop back to factory settings. Which requires me to
 back up all of my files and programs on a usb and redownload everything I had.<br />
<br />
I can't even call tech support and ask questions about my mouse and tablet drivers because they refuse to help me unless I pay them money that I don't have. My game does not run better since upgrading to 10, in fact it runs worse! And even before this, I was
 scammed in to paying them $100 to clean my laptop of a 'virus' that popped up on my laptop and turned out to be just a pop-up that was as easily dispelled as using task manager to shut down my internet browser. And I know it wasn't actually a virus because
 months after that I got a very similar one and did just that, and a virus scan with the program that the tech support guy installed on my laptop revealed no threats to my system.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Windows 10 has done nothing for my laptop, in fact it has given me more problems then I've ever had in the years that I've owned it. At this point I just want my tablet and mouse to work again, that way I can find a new art program that works with 10's requirements
 and hopefully get enough commissions done so I can afford to go back to 7. If anybody has had problems similar to this and knows how to fix it, please respond!
<br />
<br />
My tablet is an Intuous 3 and has had no problems prior to last month, the drivers worked fine and the pen pressure had no issue. Again, the tablet and various mice that I've plugged in to it work just fine on other laptops, it's just my laptop that has an
 issue with them. However the various ports will recognize other non-mouse or tablet devices with no issue.<br />

Clean Reinstall Windows 7</a> with the Product Key - which should be affixed somewhere (possibly under battery) on a COA sticker - will be as much or more trouble than doing the Windows 10 Clean Install which is a more modern OS that actually works better when

            Ideally, I would like to return to Windows 7. I understand if you've personally had no troubles with 10, but it's been nothing but that since I updated. However, I did try the method you suggest for re-installing Windows 7 and was met with an error message
 which informed me that because the copy of 7 I had came pre-installed on my laptop, I wasn't allowed to download it.<br />
<br />
Also I want to reiterate that my tablet had no troubles whatsoever until an update in late August of this year. I had actually drawn a picture prior to it, it was only after I restarted my laptop that when I attempted to plug the tablet back in that it would
 blink once to show that it had been plugged in, but then remain off. It has no such issues on my mom's laptop, it plugs in just fine and stays lit. Also, when I check under my device manager section for Mice, it only lists my touchpad. Even when I have a mouse
 or tablet device plugged in.

            I want to add that at this very moment, the laptop wants me to restart so it can install the 'Feature Update' to Windows 10, which it had been attempting to do since yesterday. I'm already very frustrated that the updates it installed yesterday prior to
 this did absolutely nothing to fix my tablet and mouse issue. And if you set aside the nonsense that I've been dealing with from Microsoft and Windows up until this point, that is the main focus here - Getting my mouse and tablet to work again. Something has
 gone wrong with the drivers, I want it fixed so I can at the very least earn some money so I can buy Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly hesitant about rushing to let it install this update if I can't get some kind of assurance that it will fix the issues that Windows 10 has created on my laptop since I installed it.
<br />
<br />
[Edit]<br />
Before I forget, another issue with the tablet and drivers. The driver for the Intuous 3 specifies that it runs on Windows 7, the last update to it was in 2015. However, despite this, my tablet never had any issues. Even after the update it continued to work
 just fine. I have tried several times since it stopped working to re-download the driver, but it effects nothing.

            I followed your advice and allowed the update to install.<br />
Absolutely nothing has changed. The first time I started it up, I recieved a message about 'Reinstall the tablet driver', and I did using the disc that came with it, and restarted it again. Nothing.&nbsp;<br />
I'm quite angry now, the update took hours to complete, only to do nothing and then re-install apps that I removed because they were cluttering up space and useless.
<br />
<br />
[Edit]<br />
I recieved an error message telling me that 'libxml2.dll' is missing and to re-install the program, so I'm going to. At least I'm finally getting somewhere. Funny though how I can plug it in to my mom's laptop, which also has 10 and none of the drivers, and
 it'll turn on and stay on just fine and then when I plug it into mine it'll blink once and then stay off.<br />

            Well, that's all I got. There's definitely a Setting to enabled or disable Autoplay - though you may have to "dig" to find it. Maybe someone else can assist you?

    <title>Photos app for windows 8.1 not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erin1616  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos app for windows 8.1 not working</h2>
                    <p>I had to do a complete computer reset (thanks to Windows 10) and now the Photo App in Windows 8.1 will not 'pick up' any of the photos in my pictures library.&nbsp; The live tile shows the pictures when it is on the start screen, but when I click on the app,
 Photos tells me that there is a problem and come back later.&nbsp; I have rebooted the computer many, many times and it still won't recognize or pick up the files.&nbsp; I'd like to uninstall and reinstall the app, but this seems to be one of the apps that does not
 have an uninstall option (why is this?).&nbsp; If it's not working, I don't want it on the computer - broken apps tend to connect very badly when it comes to future updates and they then crash the entire computer.&nbsp; I want to either fix it or uninstall it.&nbsp; I do
 not want to do another complete reset of my computer for the third time in two months.&nbsp; I am tired of installing a thousand updates and praying that all my files have reloaded correctly.</p>

            <p>Hello Erin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos app is a built-in app that comes preinstalled when you set up Windows 8/8.1. Hence, you cannot delete or uninstall the app like other third party or desktop apps. In&nbsp;order to diagnose the root cause of the issue, I would suggest you to run the Apps
 troubleshooter and check if it helps resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><strong><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Apps Troubleshooter</span></a></strong></em> is an automated tool which
 we have developed to address a number of known issues that can prevent the Apps from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. If issue persists,
 refer to the remaining steps from the help article and check. </p>
<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Troubleshoot problems with an app</span></a></em></span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, I would suggest you to refer to the section: "<em><strong>If you don't see photos and videos you expect to see</strong></em>" in the following article.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/photos-app-faq#troubleshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Photos app for Windows help</span></strong></em></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further information on editing photos and auto fixes, refer to the following article:</p>

    <title>Error 1721 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarahkhammond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1721</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to install Final Draft on a new Lenovo Yoga, but the installation could not complete because of Error 1721. It says "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A program required for this install to complete could not be run. Contact
 your support personnel or package vendor." Since the install was interrupted, I tried to uninstall the program to start over, but the same error box comes up whenever I try to uninstall the program. So now&nbsp;Final Draft won't open, but won't delete either. Can
 you help?<br />
Thank you!</p>

            Hi there, I was having the problem with Final Draft 9. I went ahead and paid for Final Draft 10, upgraded, haven't had the problem since. Annoying! It appears it was a sync issue between the last version of Final Draft and the Operating System.

<p>I ended up getting tech support from final draft through chat. They walked me through some simple steps and resolved the problem.</p>
<p>I didn't save the transcript but they seemed to be very familiar with the problem. Contact them and you'll be okay.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
You may try using the Inbuilt Zip utility in Windows 7<br />
<br />
<strong>Compress and uncompress files (zip files)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Compress-and-uncompress-files-zip-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Compress-and-uncompress-files-zip-files</a></strong></p>
<p>For assistance with 7 zip which is a third party software, I would recommend you to contact the developer of the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In this case, please try resetting the Edge browser and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please know that resetting the Microsoft edge will remove your bookmarks and history. Follow the instruction provided below and check.

<p>
</p><p><span>a. Navigate to the location: </span></p>

<p>

            <p>Hello maybe this will help</p><p><br /></p>Step 1:&nbsp;Welcome to the Xbox One Startup Error Solution
<p>If you’re seeing an “E” error code when your Xbox One console restarts after a system update, select the specific code below to troubleshoot this error.</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcompass-ssl.xboxlive.com%2fassets%2f9f%2faf%2f9faf71ba-0178-4dfd-8518-d3ccf4b441f5.png%3fn%3drs-error-screen-wl.png" />
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;This solution covers “E” startup codes like the one shown above. If you are not seeing a&nbsp;<b>Something went wrong</b>&nbsp;screen that looks like the one above, or if you are getting a startup error that is not included in the list below, try the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One System Update Solution</a>to troubleshoot other types of startup errors.</p>
<p>Which error code are you getting?</p><p><br /></p>Step 2:&nbsp;Can you bring up the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter?
<p>Check to see if you can bring up the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter:</p>
<ol><li>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.</li><li>Wait 30 seconds, then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Press and hold the&nbsp;<b>BIND</b>&nbsp;button (located on the left side of the console) and the&nbsp;<b>EJECT</b>button (located on the front of the console), and then press the&nbsp;<b>Xbox</b>&nbsp;button on the console.</li><li>Continue holding the&nbsp;<b>BIND</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>EJECT</b>&nbsp;buttons for 10-15 seconds.</li><li>Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the&nbsp;<b>BIND</b>and&nbsp;<b>EJECT</b>&nbsp;buttons after the second power-up tone.</li><li>The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>Step 3:&nbsp;Restore your console to factory defaults
<p>If resetting your console does not correct your startup error, you can use the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter to completely restore your console to its factory settings.</p>
<p><b>Warning</b>&nbsp;Resetting your console to its factory defaults erases all accounts, saved games, settings, and home Xbox associations. Anything not synchronized with Xbox Live will be lost. You should only use this option as a last resort.</p>
<p>If you need to bring up the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter again, follow these steps:</p>
<ol><li>Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.</li><li>Wait 30 seconds, then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>Press and hold the&nbsp;<b>BIND</b>&nbsp;button (located on the left side of the console) and the&nbsp;<b>EJECT</b>button (located on the front of the console), and then press the&nbsp;<b>Xbox</b>&nbsp;button on the console.</li><li>Continue holding the&nbsp;<b>BIND</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>EJECT</b>&nbsp;buttons for 10-15 seconds.</li><li>Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the&nbsp;<b>BIND</b>and&nbsp;<b>EJECT</b>&nbsp;buttons after the second power-up tone.</li><li>The console should power up and take you directly to the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>To reset your console from the Xbox Startup Troubleshooter, use the&nbsp;<b>D-pad</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>A</b>button&nbsp;&nbsp;on your controller to select&nbsp;<b>Reset this Xbox</b>. When prompted, select&nbsp;<b>Remove everything.</b></p>Step 4:&nbsp;Your console should function correctly now
<p>If you experience another startup error, you can return to this solution for additional troubleshooting. You can also get help with system updates from the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One System Update Solution</a>.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 isn&#39;t  updating from 10240 to 1703</h2>
                    <p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device : &nbsp;HP AB522TX Pavilion Book with Windows 10 Home Single Language Licence and I have 3 years of ON SITE Warranty</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before :</p>
<p>
</p><p>i purchased the laptop near around Jun - 2017 and the windows updated to the 1603 in the December but i had an hard disk replacement ,because the HP Smart Hardwere check (Which scan all the hardwere and warn you if any of that is going to fail in near future)
 detected that my HDD was facing currupted sector problem so i just went to the shop from where i bought the laptop and told them , they confirmed the issue and i got free hard disk replacement with in no time....</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i purchased the laptop they took backup of the original system in a pendrive and told me to keep that for any OS related issue.... since the hard disk was going to currupt they took the pendrive and restore the Licenced Windows from it on the new hard
 disk... the PC was blank of course but it was same as it was when i bought it from store</p>
<p>
</p><p>now the issue....</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Current version of the OS is 10240 ... since the month of May from where i replaced the hard drive the version is never updated , the update what is shown is "&nbsp;Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703. " and the only update....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>somtime fails to download but sometime downloads the update to 100% the it gives no warning or error code but just begins the download from 0%.... when i check the folder Windows(c) &gt; windows &gt; softwere distribution &gt; Delivery Optimization it shows 4.82
 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>now again if it is downloaded then why without any warning the updator starts re-downloading of OS....and i am on the same microsoft account as i was before the replacement of hard disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>till today it has already tried for downloading for near about 8 time&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>When you take this action, all applications&nbsp;that are not pre-installed in Windows 10 will be automatically deleted. It means all third-party applications that cause issues and incompatibility to your operating system will be included also. However, your
 personal files and some Windows settings will be retained. You can skip the volume licensing prompt message since your computer was already activated.</p>
