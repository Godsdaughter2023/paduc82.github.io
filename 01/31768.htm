    <title>Assign a new version of an application to open a file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Assign a new version of an application to open a file</h2>
                    <p>I have several versions of an application to handle a particular file-type (that is with a particular file-name-extension).</p>
<p>The versions of the application have the same file name, but are located in different folders.</p>
<p>When I use Control Panel in an attempt to&nbsp;associate the newest version of the application with the file-type there are problems.</p>
<p>1) Navigation through the various levels of menu did not change the version of the application called up to handle the file.</p>
<p>2) When I tried to assign a completely different application and then assign the new version of the application, Control Panel hung!</p>
<p>What is the correct procedure to achieve my aim?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Deepak_Krishnan R</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>The first method you suggest got me nowhere.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application that I require is not listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems that only applications in the Program Files folder get to be listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; The application that
 I want is in Program Files (X86) in a sub-folder of a sub-folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lowest level has one sub-folder for each version of the application.</span></p>
<p><span>The second method that you suggest is essentially what I tried in the first place, except that I accessed it via Control Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; As in my original query, it did not achieve the desired result.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div>Thanks for your reply. I followed all the instructions that mentioned. Everything was already up to date. I shut down laptop and then switched on. I started windows 8.1 update from store. It was downloading and at the 50%, It started installing and then
 getting ready your pc , something like that. But after that it went from 50% to 0 % again and started downloading.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there any chance, I can ask this from Microsoft. Any help?</div>

            <p>Just Beware that 8.1 is newer and has several issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One issue is&nbsp;if your using QuickBooks 2011&nbsp;working on windows 8 just fine, windows 8.1 will not print PDF(emails to customers even after going threw all the Windows 8 steps that got it to work on 8) and with QuickBooks and there is no&nbsp;QB Support&nbsp;since its
 an older version&nbsp;of QB so you will have to buy &nbsp;the newest version.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will also loose document mappings have to recreate all&nbsp; mappings&nbsp;&nbsp; So just prepair yourself to be working on all the bugs could take several hours and or buy new software.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            failed update, now controller just blinks and it wont sync</h2>
                    
<p>i tried to update my controller last night and after the update reached 100% i was told there was an error and the controller did not work after that and all it would do was blink. So as any reasonable person would do I restarted my console. As of now ive
 restarted my console many times, i have it plugged into a USB, and ive been on plenty of forums and all problems have been close but a USB worked for other people. If I go to devices and accessories to try to restart the update the controller is not seen by
 the xbox. I plugged it into my laptop aswell and this "update" made my controller completely unrecognizable at this point. and now all it does is blink if you hold the sync button there is no change in blinking speed, and from what i can tell no commands are
 being picked up from the controller either.</p>

<p>Maybe somehow you missed that im not a complete dumb *** and i have tried all the simple stuff and more innovative ways to fix the problem without success. My controller is now a brick that i cant even get my laptop to recognize as anything being connected.
 All the controller does is steadily blink for days on end no matter what buttons i press, the sync button does not change the pace of the blinking. That update destroyed my controller so lets just skip the bull *** and send me a new controller, please.</p>

                    <p><span>I have a cell phone video file (several) that seem to get corrupted randomly. &nbsp;When I download my own file from Verizon online (Instant Upload), then the file is fine. &nbsp;I noticed

 have two laptops, a Surface 4 Pro that has always run Windows 10, and an older laptop I recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;A couple of weeks ago, the start menu on the Surface changed. &nbsp;It has 5 icon buttons on the left (from bottom: power, settings, file explorer,
 user, and a 3 bar icon at the very top), a column of apps and a column of tiles. &nbsp;I'd like to return it to the original 2 column start menu (with the icon buttons at the bottom left, recently used apps above them, and the user at the top all in one column
 and tiles in a second column). &nbsp;I've compared the preference settings for the start menus on the two computers and they are identical. &nbsp;I can't find any differences or any controls that change the start menu in the way the Surface has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The picture above is the start menu on the Surface that I want to fix, with the apps list in the center rather than stacked with the left hand buttons. &nbsp;How do I make this column of apps merge back into the left column?</p>

            This is completely unacceptable.  I'm likely to just adopt APPLE or something.  Win 8.1 had the beneficial feature of allowing my menu layout on the start menu screen to duplicate on any pc I logged in upon.  Why can't this feature resume functionality? I just had the update completely evaporate not only my start screen but all of my programs.  That is **** Microsoft.

<h2>            Windows 10 search bar and start menu not working</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I updated my pc from Windows 7 (64 bit) to Windows 10, my start menu and search bar never work half the time, or take over 5 minutes to actually activate. &nbsp;(The same thing goes for all my apps on the toolbar.) I have run System File Checker and
 the results came back with no errors. I have also tried restarting my PC many times, but the start menu stops working around 10 minutes after logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting explorer.exe a few times, but I was met with only half my toolbar loaded, missing icons, and missing wallpaper each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that my PC has been running a lot slower, and it hangs a lot when I right-click on an icon or file. It never did this when I was using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked for updates as well, but it says I'm completely up to date. Any help would be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Bailey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find and fix issues related to Windows Search and Start menu, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Search and Indexing troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press âWindows Logoâ + âWâ keys from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type â<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>â in the search bar and press â<strong><em>Enter</em></strong></span>â.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) In the â<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>â window, click on â<strong><em>View All</em></strong></span>â on the left pane.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d) Click on â<strong><em><span>Search and Indexing</span></em></strong>â.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Click on â<span><strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>â and then click on â<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong></span>â.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click â<strong><em><span>Next</span></em></strong>â and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from the current Account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
</span>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

            <p>Clearly Method 1 won't work - as it involves <strong>searching </strong>which is the reported problem!</p>
<p>After a reboot today Visual Studio 2013 is reporting it is corrupted, OneDrive For Business constantly crashes and I just noticed I can't type into the search bar and get results. If I type something in - I just get the loading graphic - forever, as far
 as I can tell.&nbsp; Everything was working fine an hour ago and since I upgraded to 10 a while back.</p>

<p>1) The Windows key is now not working for me and</p>
<p>2) It's not letting me create a new user even though I'm the administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas?? I've been searching community boards and so far haven't found a fix!</p>
<p>I also can't click anything on the taskbar, the action center won't open, I can't access my apps and the Microsoft Office suite I loaded has been deleted. I have to ctrl+alt+delete just to turn off or reset the computer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've got the same problem.&nbsp; I've now done 5 fresh installs of Windows 10 Pro Build 10240 (Retail), and each time - at some random point - the Start Menu stops working and the taskbar reverts to, at best, very limited functionality.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to isolate the problem by creating restore points after installing each 3rd party program - and I've varied the order of installations across each restore - but the fault or whatever corruption is causing it appears random, and far reaching -
 well beyond the Menu button.&nbsp; The latest occurrence came midway through installing Adobe Creative Cloud; and uninstalling was no cure.&nbsp; Only a full restore back to the post-installation restore point did.&nbsp; Since then, my latest attempt has seen no problem
 with Adobe Creative cloud or Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; I've yet to try Office 365, though previous attempts did not seem to falter at the Office installation stage.&nbsp; But at some point, I know it will fail........Windows always has so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Start Menu fails, right-clicking on the start button still works for the most part, but not at all on the task bar.&nbsp; Windows Mail becomes unavailable, and even such things as Control panel has failed.&nbsp; What also happens is that permissions for core
 folders such as Documents - for me stored on a separate drive - are suddenly changed.&nbsp; What was accessible before the fault suddenly becomes inaccessible without taking ownership again - and even then access remains unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried - by trawling the various forums for ideas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To disable One Drive via group policy .......no effect.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; sfc /scannow - no faults found .......and no effect.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Create different user............impossible, as once the fault occurs, windows won't let me create a new user account.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Running Powershell(admin) script - Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}.........no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You name it, I've tried it....from every forum that a suggestion has been found......but nothing has worked.&nbsp; Once the fault occurs, it stays locked in.&nbsp; And for what it's worth, I've paid for Windows 10 Pro - it isn't even a freebie upgrade from Microsoft,
 so right now I really could do with Microsoft taking what has obviously been a widespread problem ever since the Beta builds more seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs fixing now.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and tried steps I searched on the internet - no success.</p>
<p>After some (not long) time from computer startup, start menu opens with quite long lag. Search icon do not respond at all. Also, pressing windows-key does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summing up: this is really annoying as I used to use search/menu start quite frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix it ASAP -- this really painful.</p>

</p><p>I've tried to isolate the problem by creating restore points after installing each 3rd party program - and I've varied the order of installations across each restore - but the fault or whatever corruption is causing it appears random, and far reaching -
 well beyond the Menu button.&nbsp; The latest occurrence came midway through installing Adobe Creative Cloud; and uninstalling was no cure.&nbsp; Only a full restore back to the post-installation restore point did.&nbsp; Since then, my latest attempt has seen no problem
 with Adobe Creative cloud or Norton Internet Security.&nbsp; I've yet to try Office 365, though previous attempts did not seem to falter at the Office installation stage.&nbsp; But at some point, I know it will fail........Windows always has so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the Start Menu fails, right-clicking on the start button still works for the most part, but not at all on the task bar.&nbsp; Windows Mail becomes unavailable, and even such things as Control panel has failed.&nbsp; What also happens is that permissions for core
 folders such as Documents - for me stored on a separate drive - are suddenly changed.&nbsp; What was accessible before the fault suddenly becomes inaccessible without taking ownership again - and even then access remains unreliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried - by trawling the various forums for ideas:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To disable One Drive via group policy .......no effect.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; sfc /scannow - no faults found .......and no effect.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Create different user............impossible, as once the fault occurs, windows won't let me create a new user account.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Running Powershell(admin) script - Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}.........no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You name it, I've tried it....from every forum that a suggestion has been found......but nothing has worked.&nbsp; Once the fault occurs, it stays locked in.&nbsp; And for what it's worth, I've paid for Windows 10 Pro - it isn't even a freebie upgrade from Microsoft,
 so right now I really could do with Microsoft taking what has obviously been a widespread problem ever since the Beta builds more seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs fixing now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I am having the same exact problem, it is driving me crazy. &nbsp;I have restored Windows 10 twice and I just went back to Window 8.1 from my recovery partition. &nbsp;I really want Windows 10 to work, but I can not use it with the problems as noted above. &nbsp;Does anyone
 know how long the Windows 10 will be available to use for a free upgrade? &nbsp;I am thinking Microsoft still has a lot of bugs to work out that are not being addressed. &nbsp;HELP ME.</p>

            <p>The issue is fixed on my computer...for now...</p>
<p>Here's what I did:</p>
<p>Online chatted with a support person who forwarded me to a Level 1 tech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>24h later, finally got in touch with a level 1 tech (this was after I put my phone number in the call-back line and waited almost 5 hours for that call-back).
</p>
<p>Spent a little over an hour on the phone while they tried to solve the problem to no avail (as predicted). The case was escalated to a level 2 tech.&nbsp;</p>
<p>48h later the level 2 tech called me.</p>
<p>After 2.5 hours of two Level 2 techs working on my tablet remotely, it seems to be working fine for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, what they did was create a new user, but the process was NOT as straight-forward or easy as the rep above made it sound. It took two Level 2 techs 2.5 hours to fix it! Plus all those phone calls and wait time! They said if the problem occurs again
 then to contact them again with the same case number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>...but is it actually worth the trouble and time?</p>

            Hi Daryl.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  Do the same for the TV device; you may need to choose View tab to Show Hidden Devices to find it.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hello and thank you for taking the time to reply,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for not describing my query better. </p>
<p>Your answer explains how&nbsp;DisplaySwitch.exe works but it does fully answers my question, specifically:&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I control <em>which </em>screen/s will be activated what i select each of the options?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>A scenario:</em></p>
<p>On a PC with 1 integrated and 1 discrete graphic cards, 4 ports are used:</p>
<p>Discrete&nbsp;DVI I - main display.</p>
<p>Discrete&nbsp;DVI II - TV.</p>
<p>Integrated&nbsp;VGA I - Left display.</p>
<p>Integrated&nbsp;DVI I - Right&nbsp;display.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Example</em>:</p>
<p>When&nbsp;<em>%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /<strong>external</strong> </em>is used, windows will activate:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI I - main &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI II - TV <strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;VGA I - Left &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;DVI I - Right &nbsp;display <strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The <strong>desired </strong>state is:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI I - main &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI II - TV&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;VGA I - Left &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;DVI I - Right &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Similarly, windows will activate/de-activate monitors to an undesired stated with the other modifiers:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<em>%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /<strong>internal&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI I - main &nbsp;display.&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI II - TV&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;VGA I - Left &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;DVI I - Right &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>&nbsp;<em>%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /<strong>duplicate</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI I - main &nbsp;display. <strong>ON&nbsp;Duplicating&nbsp;TV</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI II - TV&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;VGA I - Left &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;DVI I - Right &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<em>%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /extend&nbsp;</em><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI I - main &nbsp;display.&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Discrete&nbsp;DVI II - TV&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;VGA I - Left &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Integrated&nbsp;DVI I - Right &nbsp;display&nbsp;<strong>ON</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i control which displays turn on and off for each of the modifiers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            File in &#34;Recent Lists&#34; with Chinese Text.</h2>
                    I'm getting a file in "Recent Items" list that's named with what I think is Chinese text. It says the location of the file is my desktop but there is nothing on there and it claims under "properties" that the specified target box is not vaid. There is
 no indication of a specific file type or anything like that. Should I be concerned? By the way, this is not the first time I have seen this. What could it be?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            Hello - I apologize for the really late response. I saw this in my inbox so I thought I'd write back. Off and on this
<u>still</u> occurs where I end up seeing this "dummy file" I will call it with Chinese text. In fact, I'm seeing it tonight as I write this. It does go away when I clear the "Recent Items" list and once other documents get stored in there, it doesn't always
 appear just certain times. I have done numerous scans using both the Microsoft Security Scanner and others, none of which have detected any malware, spyware, etc..
<br />
<br />
The only recent change in hardware that I made I think in mid to late May? Was a new graphics card. No other new software/or hardware has been added to my computer.<br />
<br />
I thank you for your continuing support in resolving this issue. <br />

Ok, it is now a few months later. I finally got around to making a new user profile and all was well for a while. Now, it has come back. For the sake of curiosity, I turned to the Google Translate website and copied the "file name" of this file. By the way,
 it claims the location of this file is on my desktop. Nope, it is not. <br />
<br />
So I guess the next step is maybe to fix a corrupted user profile? But is it really a user profile issue now since this has come up even on a fairly new user profile I made?<br />

<p>Yes, am using the Desktop when seeing this (Power Icon "off") so is this a problem or a normal situation as your response would seem to imply ?</p>
<p>The reason for my initial question was that I can't restore my WIFI icon at the bottom right of screen hence not being able to see the Systray. Is this linked with Power icon being "Off" please ?</p>

    <title>Blu-ray stutter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tacticaltimbo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blu-ray stutter</h2>
                    
<p>Watching my Blu-ray copy of The Fellowship of the Ring, I witnessed stutter at multiple points during the film. It was by no means constant, occurring a random points only for a split-second, before ceasing; still it was incredibly jarring, and ruined the
 moment.</p>
<p>The disc is spotless, totally without imperfections and plays fine on the PS3 upstairs. I've uninstalled/reinstalled the Blu-ray app and taken the disc out, before putting it back in; what else is there?</p>
<p>I hope it isn't a duff console, I've already had one of those!?</p>

<p>Have you checked your video/Blu-Ray settings on the console and/or on your TV or tried another disc to see if the same thing occurs? It might just be the higher framerate of the film too - have you considered that?</p>

<p>It's a definite skip/stutter, the picture pauses, then resumes normal playing.</p>
<p>I have tried a few other disks and haven't noticed issues, that doesn't explain why this particular disk is okay on other players though...</p>

<p>Right, well I got Star Wars: The Complete Saga blu ray set, and had skipping right off the bat with 'A New Hope'. It would skip at completely random points, but if I rewound and played the section a second time, it would play without a hiccup!?</p>
<p>I assumed it must be the Xbox One, as again the disc was brand new, and completely flawless. I therefore went ahead with an Advanced Exchange, but to my disbelief, there's skipping with the replacement as well!!</p>
<p>I really don't know what to do, this is billed as the ultimate entertainment media device, but it seemingly can't playback certain blu rays!?!</p>

<p>I have noticed the exact same thing. &nbsp; The blu ray player in the X1 isn't quiet as good as the PS3 blu ray player. At least not right now. Hopefully with some updates and patches it will get better.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Want to know a really bad problem? Try watching 3d with your Kinect on.&nbsp; It actually turns 3d glasses off and on every 2 minutes.&nbsp; THAT is a nightmare.&nbsp; Luckily I figured out to just shut the Kinect off.&nbsp; In fact I would recommend turning the Kinect off
 for every blu ray movie.&nbsp; That might be the cause of the other stutter too.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 folder mapping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgreg7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 folder mapping</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a clear explanation of the Windows 7 folder mapping methodology?&nbsp; I have been looking through the postings, but most of the questions are too specific.&nbsp; I am looking for an overview that explains the folder mapping and why there seem to ba so may
 shotcuts disguised as folders.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>It sounds like you are describing the Junctions that are present in Windows 7. Many of the default folders that were present in Windows XP have had name changes starting with Windows Vista.</p>
<p><span><span>The folders with the shortcut icon are either&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Symbolic Links</span></strong> or
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Junctions</span></strong> (AKA: <span>Soft Links or Reparse Points</span>). They are there for &nbsp;<strong>compatibility</strong>&nbsp; with older programs that are hard coded to look for those old folder names&nbsp;when the older
 program is installed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These folders have special properties that will redirect the old installer program to the new location in Windows 7. This allows the
 older program to install and work in Windows 7, seamlessly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A good&nbsp;example is the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Documents and Settings
</span></strong>&nbsp;folder. This folder was used in previous versions (XP) to hold all of the users files. When an older program that was written for XP is installed, the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Symbolic Link</span></strong> called
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Documents and Settings</span></strong> will
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">redirect</span></strong> that installer to the new location in Windows 7, which is the&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users folder</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Because they are very important, they all have the properties,&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Everyone</span></strong> =
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Access Denied</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are many of these&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Soft Links</span></strong>&nbsp;in Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows has supported the use of Soft Links for a long time, but they were not used extensively until Windows Vista.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It is recommended that the user does not change any of the properties of these folders, since doing so can cause some installed programs
 to stop working or other behavior that can cause more serious problems.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft Will Not Sync With Cloud - Saved Games Gone &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;recently left the Xbox Preview Program because it was forcing a system update too frequently (average every 2.5 days). &nbsp;I&nbsp;run a Minecraft world for about 6 friends so you can see this is less than optimal.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>After leaving the Preview Program all of my Minecraft saved games (our world and backups) are no longer available.&nbsp;Not only that, but when I first start Minecraft and select "play game" it will not sync with the cloud to retrieve my saves. &nbsp;I constantly get "We couldn't&nbsp;get your latest saved data" and no matter how many times I click "try again" it won't sync.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I've tried my luck with official xbox support (and windows support) and unfortunately they have not been able to resolve this issue. &nbsp;We have poored hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of hours into this world I would hate for it to disappear just because of leaving the Preview Program.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Here's a list of some things I've tried:</p>
<p>1) Factory Reset</p>
<p>2) Remove account / Add account</p>
<p>3) Wired / wireless connection</p>
<p>4) Power cycle console</p>
<p>5) Uninstall / Install Minecraft</p>
<p>6) Many tricks from the community when this happened&nbsp;to them. (ex: going to offline mode, sign out, go online,&nbsp;start Minecraft, then sign in profile from Minecraft menu ...this by the way, freezes my game for some reason, switching profiels from within Minecraft, etc...).</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I've read cases where Microsoft support can actually alter the saved game in the cloud and allow it to sync, I'm hoping I can find some sort of answer here.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all very sad :(&nbsp;&nbsp;Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Hot Dog Tony</p>

<p>OK since you do not remember the password and Have no access to the security proofs (where they want to send the verification)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what you are going to have to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to account.microsoft.com/acsr and try to recover your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at the point where it wants to verify the account by sending an email there should be another choice that you do not have access to any of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on that it will ask for and email address that you do have access to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it will start asking you questions about the account. This will be sent to MSs account recovery team who will look over your answers and determine if you answered enough of them correctly. This normally takes approximately 24 hours for them to get back
 with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did provide them with enough information they will then send you a link to reset your password. at which time you would then be able to go in and change the security proofs on your account to something that you do have access to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do NOT provide them with enough information they will still send you an email letting you know that this email will have a reference number at the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then contact xbox support AS LONG as you have a console that the profile has been on previously they would then be able to fill out an escalations form with some different questions about your account, that reference number from the email, and some
 information on the console that your account was on previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be sent up to the escalations team who will then look over it and decide if there was enough correct information provided and if so they would then send you an email that will allow you to change your password. This normally takes about 72 hours
 for this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to fill out the account recovery form first to get that email with the reference number on it AND have access to a console that your profile was on previously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a console that your account was on previously then all you can do is continue to fill out the account recovery form till you get enough questions correct.</p>

Thanks. That's kind of what I was looking for -- but not quite. I am talking about basics. For example: What is a 'project'? Do I need one to make a video? If not, what purpose does it serve?
<div><br />
<div>Also, i have tried numerous times to import a video, then edit it down to the movie I want (ie., throw away part of it) but either the start and stop commands are not working as one would expect start and stop functions to work, or I have misunderstood,
 and there is no explanation of what I should be doing. To recap: I have roughly nine minutes of video. I want to make a 'movie' of about five minutes in length. But MM doesn't seem to let me. (earlier versions were much easier to understand, in my experience.)</div>

            <p>Here's a user-contributed guide to <a href="https://www.box.com/shared/bedsnr2001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Movie Maker 2011</a>.&nbsp; The concepts should be relevant to Movie Maker 2012 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to think of making a movie, is to think of building a house.&nbsp; For a house you start with your construction materials.&nbsp; You have a blueprint that tells you how to cut and combine those materials.&nbsp; The final result is&nbsp;a house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Movie Maker, your construction materials would be all your source files (photos, videos and music).&nbsp; The project is your blueprint.&nbsp; The final result is a completed movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you are adding items into Movie Maker, you are revising your blueprint/project.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is easy to move things around at this point because you are just changing your plan, not the final movie.&nbsp; If you need to walk away from your project, just save it and
 return to the latest point.&nbsp; The project file (.wlmp) will still contain a list of all the source materials, their order, their lengths, etc.&nbsp; You can continue revising as you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when you are all done, you tell Movie Maker to take the final step of building your house (movie).&nbsp;While it might seem you&nbsp;have been working on a movie, you are only previewing what the final result will look like.&nbsp; When you tell Movie Maker to save
 your movie,&nbsp;it does the real work of pulling everything together, following your blueprint (project) and making a single video/audio file that can be played, shared, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, using the analogy of&nbsp;building a house, let's say you decide you want to change something about&nbsp; the house.&nbsp; With the blueprint, you easily know what&nbsp;can be changed, where things are, etc.&nbsp; You could even make major changes to your blueprint and just
 build another house to your new specifications.&nbsp; For example, let's say you wanted a basement, a larger entryway and to remove several walls.&nbsp; Doing that after the house is built is pretty hard.&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you are allowed to revise the blueprint and then build
 another house, it is very easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes, you want to keep your project around, especially if you plan to make any revisions at a point in the future.&nbsp; While you could go straight to building your movie, just imagine how you'll feel if&nbsp; you find a typo in a caption or that you&nbsp;wanted a different
 transition or better music?&nbsp; You can't change a caption&nbsp;once it is embedded in the final movie, but you can, if you still have the project file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On to your other question about editing.&nbsp; The most important features to learn are trimming (setting an in point and out point to a clip) and splitting.&nbsp; You've probably figured out how to trim from the beginning or end of a clip, but many people overlook
 the ability to Split a clip.&nbsp; This is key to working with clips.&nbsp; For example, let's say you had a clip that was good at the beginning and end, but not the middle (GGGGBBBBGGGG).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Play the clip to where the undesirable portion starts and make a split (Video Tools &gt; Edit &gt; Split, or simply 'M' on the keyboard) --&gt; GGGG | BBBBGGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make another split at the end of the undesirable portion --&gt; GGGG | BBBB | GGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should see 3 parts.&nbsp; Right-click on the middle part and choose 'Remove' --&gt; GGGG | GGGG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't worry about splits that remain.&nbsp; You can put a transition here or let the clips just cut from one to the other.&nbsp; The final movie will have everything put together so don't worry about them being in parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that help?&nbsp;Is there anything else that I can help with?&nbsp; Is there anything about the "classic" versions of Movie Maker that you are finding harder to do in the newer version?</p>

<h2>            Pubstomping can get boring, suprisingly.</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know the point of this thread. I guess it's me just wanting to post some useless spam. Anyway, I was playing some BO2 with a party(as I always do) and we flat out dominate all our enemies. I don't know why but there were so many noobs today. It was
 just domination after domination playing Domination lol. After a while I got bored cause no one was a challenge. I don't know about you guys, but I sure enjoy a team who can keep up with me and my level. I don't mind getting my @@@ kicked either cause of the
 lag or whatever. You can't even tell who's good at this game cause of the lag. Everyone is good with this lag to be honest. So yeah, the point of this thread? Pubstomping too much can get boring. I miss barely going positive or going negative.<br />
<br />
Also just so this thread isn't completely pointless, I was wondering.. how many levels have you guys gone up by during this double xp? I started out 5th prestige level 54 Friday afternoon and I'm now prestige 7 level 30 something. I don't remember and I can't
 be **** to check Elite haha. I think I can get to 8th tomorrow. :)<br />

<p>Nah, COD is fun. I can play it for hours and hours on without getting bored. I just felt like dominating the enemy team over and over was getting boring or a little stale might be the better words here? I guess this is why they introduced league play for
 the peeps who like a challenge. I might have to play that and rage at all the tryhards who own me haha.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Well I've got to say I had fun playing with you all today &nbsp;..... but I had a lot more fun when I was playing against you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Its twofold for me though. I felt like dead weight when I was on on your team ( or much worse like on carrier... lol ). But even when I was doing ok, it just wasnt as satisfying as mixing in with a bunch of randoms and trying to bring the giant down.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Maybe that would alleviate your boredom. Instead of partying up with them Let them get the match started, then pop in when the enemies start backing out and see if you can lead a bunch of randoms to turn things around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Its just a game .... its ok to kill your friends.</p>

<p>Haha, I'm surprised you stuck around on the enemy team those couple matches. I would have rage quit a long time ago. I give you props though. You are a trooper old man!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, I might just do that. I had a game where my party got split up and Lady was on the enemy team. It was pretty fun killing her for a bit. Now I wanna do it again. Maybe I'll even get a ridiculous class set up and troll some friends? Haha.

<p>&nbsp; I popped in and out several times with you guys throughout the day before eh invited me. The problem I was having was staying on the enemy team when you didnt have a full party. Since she's on my friends list I knew if there was room it would put me on
 your team so I'd back out and do somehing else for a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It wasnt bad joining in progress since you kept making people run away, I just didnt get to play too many from the start.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My son joined at one point on nuketown .... I think he stuck it out for all of a minute. He's competing with a friend for k/d's so he's a bit squeemish about dying.</p>

<p>Not to be a hater but when you play with your obline friends on a regular basis, pub stomping is a no brainer. You know that feeling you had after pub stomping is how I feel a day after every cod game releases. I played for an hour today, prestiged, set
 up my mp7 w/ target finder/recoil and owned in ffa. After a match or two later I was BORED! Joined mosh oit and went 30-8 in 5 straight matches with 2 wins and 3 losses due to no team play, was bored as a mother f her.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yeah your lucky you have a crew def. If I was as patient as many other gamers are to party up and play online, oh my I would prestige much,much faster and be so done with shooter games. I seriously have no real consistent gaming time abyways :-(</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I tried gamibg Saturday around 1pm and the wife hops out the shower and lost it. "HAVEN'T YOU GAMED ENOUGH DURING YOUR VACATION!!!! MY GOD.""</p>

<p>Why do you think so many people were ecstatic about League Play? After 5 years of either</p>
<p>a) dominating</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) going through the hassle of doing customs, scrims, clan battles, etc..</p>

<p>I find Mercenary Moshpit both A) Challenging because most of the time you have to carry your team, and B) has good variety. I got tired of pubstomping in Black Ops I and having the enemy team all quit out. It's not fun or challenging whatsoever. Still haven't
 really looked into league play though.</p>

            <p><b><span>Hi CherylBean,</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>1) Is this a
<b>refilled cartridge or a brand new cartridge</b>?<br />
2) Which is the <b>Operating System</b> installed on your computer?<br />
3) Have you made <b>any changes</b> on your computer recently?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This generally occurs due to three reasons-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) If the <b>Cartridge head is faulty</b>.<br />
b) The <b>ink and toner levels</b> are not appropriate.<br />
c) If the <b>fuser</b> on the <b>printer</b> is faulty.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to remove the cartridge and seat it back in again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1-</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
You need to check the <b>Ink and the toner levels</b> on the <b>
cartridge</b>.<br />
To do so, you need to refer to the article mentioned below-</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-change-my-ink-or-toner-levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-change-my-ink-or-toner-levels</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Note</b>: You may use the link mentioned above just for reference if it does not apply to your
<b>Operating System</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2-</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>You need to post your question in the
<b>HP support forums</b> and contact <b>HP support</b> for further assistance.<br />
