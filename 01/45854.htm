<h2>            Downloading photos from disc to computer</h2>
                    I followed instructions regarding downloading to Microsoft Photos but when I click on Import, the computer is not recognising the disc drive and the options I'm offered are only retry or cancel. Any suggestion on how to solve this problem?

<h2>            Sims 3 launcher not working</h2>
                    I haven't played sims for at least a year, and now when I try to run the game, it tells me the launcher has run into a problem and It won't open. I've tried repairing the game, and uninstalling/reinstalling twice to no avail. Nothing on my computer has
 changed since the last time I ran the game. I am hearing however that a recent update may have caused this problem, so I've tried running it through the bin file .exe and still nothing. Please tell me you can help me with this, because restoring my computer
 to a previous point to fix this is absolutely not an option.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is best getting in touch with the developer of the game application on how you can play the game without the launcher. If playing the game without the launcher fails, right clicking your shortcut and clicking on
<strong>Run as admin</strong> might solve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to this thread for additional information:&nbsp; <em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-gaming/sims-3-launcher-wont-load-using-windows-8/90f24739-515d-4192-a80e-e265eb78a7c7">Sims

<p>I uninstalled the software and that took care of the problem. The MSN issue has been resolved as well. I call them to fix the problem.

            <p>Update.... After MSN helped me get back into my account another problem started. No pages will display on the laptop! None. It says I am not connected to the internet but my wireless network indicates that I am connected. I spent a day and a half trying
 to get help from Microsoft. Just to be scheduled for a call back for help. When they finally called back I was not at home to take the call. So the issue has not been resolved, I can not use that laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get help resolving this?</p>

<h2>            Wireless Capability turned off - Lenovo ideapad 110S, windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was using my&nbsp;laptop,&nbsp;a Lenovo IdeaPad 110S, when the Wi-Fi turned off, so I tried to restart the laptop but it continued the same. I already tried to press Fn+F2, u<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">ncheck
 "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power", enable the change adapter</span>&nbsp;settings, and my computer doesn't have a switch on the side to turn the wireless ON/OFF.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When I try to troubleshoot, the only error it has is that it says 'Wireless Capability Turned Off', and I can't find where to turn it back on.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I had the same issue after installing the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 10&nbsp;November update 1511</span> on HP Probook 4540s, but i noticed it was a fingerprint device driver issue &amp; did the following to activate fingerprint login in Windows Hello</p>
<ul>
<li>Open device manager </li><li>Under Biometric devices, select Validity Sensor &amp; click "Uninstall". A dialog box appears prompting to confirm device uninstall, Check "Delete the driver software for this device" &amp; click "OK"</li><li>On the device manager window, click "Action" &amp; click "Scan for hardware changes", an unknown device will appear, Right click it &amp; select "Update Driver Software" to download the updated driver from Microsoft</li><li>After the system has installed the driver, restart your computer</li><li>Open "settings", click "Accounts" then click "Sign-in Options" and check under Windows Hello you'll see an option for fingerprint.
</li></ul>
<p>The above steps successfully worked for me &amp; can now use my fingerprint for login. Hope it helps you too.</p>

<p>Have you checked the steps in a Clean boot?</p>

<p>If yes, I would suggest you to uninstall the app and check the issue.</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, choose <strong>Programs and Features.</strong></p>
<p>b. Find the program and choose <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

If you have not installed any such program, run a virus scan on the PC.<br />

<h2>            Writing in Microsoft Word 2016 on Surface 3 with Surface Pen</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first time posting here, since I couldn't find any solution for my problem.</p>
<p>I have bought a Surface 3 to fill out protocols for work in self-created forms with my Surface Pen in Microsoft Word (Office 2016). While the writing itself works, the written text itself is strange. When I try to scroll the screen with my finger just after
 writing, often times the written text would partially or completely move along. Occasionally the scrolling doesn't work at all or the text would get displaced upon scrolling. Everything is fine if I wait for maybe 5-10 seconds before scrolling, but that's
 not satisfying. I have updated Office and Windows 10 to the latest version. Below I added a .bmp to illustrate the problem.</p>
<p>I would be very thankful if anybody could help me.</p>
<p>Oh, and if anybody wonders why I use word: I need to include some macros in the protocol, otherwise I would use PDF-files.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are many possible reasons why you are encountering this issue. One of the possible reasons is the firmware on your Surface 3 is not&nbsp; updated. But, since you already updated your Windows 10, you can manually download the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">drivers and firmware</a></strong> and install them. You can also download and install the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/apps-and-windows-store/surface-app?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface app</a></strong> to easily utilize the Surface Pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Problem installing KB2789645 and KB2789642 updates.</h2>
                    I'm really not familiar with Windows updates that much but if there is an update, I usually just update. But when I try to update KB2789645 and KB2789642 on my Windows 7 Home Premium laptop, it takes a long time and after restart, my laptop hangs a LOT!
 I have to system restore to recover from it. My laptop literally freezes and I'm unable to click on any but my mouse moves.

            I really don't get any error messages. The updates will successfully install and I don't turn off my laptop when Windows is trying to install updates. My laptop becomes unstable after my laptop restart from the updates. When I click and open something,
 my laptop starts freezing but I'm able to move my mouse, it's just the whole system is frozen. It's will recover after maybe 5 to 8 minutes but then when I start clicking again, it will do the same thing. To recover from it, what I do is turn off the laptop,
 turn on, then when the desktop loads, I quickly go to system restore and restore to the date my laptop was stable before it starts freezing again. This happened several times and at first, I didn't know what caused it. So I updated the updates one-by-one and
 found out that one of the two updates or both are causing it (I guess).&nbsp;

<h2>            WMV9 to WMV7 file conversion</h2>
                    Hello all:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have some WMV V9 (I think) files that I'd like to convert to WMV V7 so that I can play them from a USB thumbdrive on my Samsung DVD Home Theater player. &nbsp;The Samsung documentation says that I should be able to play WMV V1/V2/V3/V7 files.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how I can tell what version my WMV files are first and then how do I convert them back to WMV V7?</div>

            Hi Paul<br />
You can convert to WMV V7 format using Any Video Converter from Anvsoft. The software limits the WMV outputs to V8 and V9, so as a workaround you should choose the AVI format and select wmv1 as the video codec. You can then change the file extension of the
 output file from .avi to .wmv<br />

<p>Hi Sujyosna,</p>
<p>&nbsp;The compatibility information of Oracle 10g on Windows 7 is not yet available. It should be in the testing mode and you can always check the compatibility of the same in the Windows 7 compatibility center once it is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Access the link below to check for the compatibility of your products with Windows 7.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; </strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</strong></a></p>
<p>However you may try installing the program in Windows XP compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click the program icon on the desktop.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Properties and click on Compatibility Tab.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put a check mark for “Run this program in compatibility mode for”.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click the dropdown and select the necessary operating system.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Apply and click OK.</p>
<p>Check the link: <strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows: </strong>

<h3> sailorathome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Print Spooler Service could not be started - not sufficient resources for the operation</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new laptop with pre-installed Windows 10 Home two weeks ago and I am now unable to start the "print spooler service". This is apparently a precondition to use Adobe Acrobat (Version XI) and any printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message prompts: "The print spooler could not be started. A system error has occurred. System error 1721 has occurred. Not enough resources are available to complete this operation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home Version: 1703 (OS built 15063.540)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is quite unbelievable, that a new laptop, with a pre-installed state-of-the-art operating system, is unable o provide "enough resources" to start a mere printing service!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know, how to fix this problem. Preferably without any changes to my registry or any other wizardry, I would have to embark upon myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>M.</p>

<h2>            Where does Windows 10 install games downloaded from the store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought Minecraft for Windows 10 through the Xbox store app.&nbsp; I'd like to connect the .exe file to a mouse profile switcher so it will automatically save my macros and stuff... but I can't find the .exe anywhere.&nbsp; I was just playing the game, and hit
 the install button in the store, so I'd assume that the game installed on my system somewhere.&nbsp; But I can't find the executable... anywhere.&nbsp; I used the search function on "This PC" and got nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either A) It's a cloud based game (in which case I'd like a refund) or B) I'm too dumb for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Apps from the App store are different than desktop apps.</p>
<p>You may not be able to use your mouse profile program like you would want to.</p>
<p>You would be better off getting Minecraft desktop version and using it.</p>
<p>The Win 10 Minecraft is a new version based on the Pocket Edition.</p>
<p>So with Win 10 you basically have 2 different Minecraft games for the PC.</p>
<p>The original one from Minecraft.net and then the new Win 10 version.<br />
The one from Minecraft.net will be able to work with your exe mouse profile\macro saver program.</p>

<p>All i want to do is to add a game from the Microsoft store to startup, I cannot find the files for the game anywhere on my system. I have navigated to the specified file path and it simply doesn't exist. If you could help out that would be great, as it seems
 some on the people in this thread have unsolved issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem in that I cannot find my game files anywhere. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My story in short:&nbsp; I got a gift certificate for Christmas for Xbox but have a 360 I no longer use.&nbsp; Found out I could use that to buy PC games and bought Middle-earth: Shadow of War.&nbsp; First game purchase ever from Microsoft Store.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
After playing a couple times the game will not run after displaying the start up screen.&nbsp; After trying a few things I just reinstalled the game after a 6 hour re-download time and the game worked fine.&nbsp; After a few more plays it fails to run again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I see fixes on Steam forums on playing with the game settings, but I need to find the&nbsp; setup files first.&nbsp; They are either cleverly hidden in generically named folders or in hidden folders or possibly on a cloud somewhere because searching for keywords involving
 that game is coming up with nothing my desktop icons..&nbsp; It's like I don't really own the game I paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't find a fix my $60 is wasted and I will never purchase through the Windows Store again.</p>

<h2>            &#34;The operating system couldn&#39;t be loaded because the digital signature of a file could not be verified&#34; and error code 0x0000225 on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:Computer will not start after update. Error 0x0000225</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I first got my computer (came with windows 10) I started it, set it up, and went ahead to update it. When I restarted it displayed that the pc could not start and the error 0x0000428.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up needing to reset it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So afterwards everything was fine, transferred all my data, and tonight updated again, and lo and behold, similar issue again.</p>
<p>This time it displays error 0x0000225. If I try to enable safe mode, it displays that "The operating system couldn't be loaded because the digital signature of a file could not be verified"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also trying to reset again, but my computer is now not recognizing the recovery drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also sometimes it displays that aswVmm.sys could not be verified, and winload.efi</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, any ideas? thoughts? suggestions</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should I just not update or what's going on?</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and appreciate the time and effort spent in resolving the issue on your own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>File verification</span></strong><span> is a process of using algorithm for verifying the integrity/authenticity of a computer
 file which can be done by comparing two files bit-by-bit which intern requires two copies of file with similar name.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might have faced the above issue due to presence of corrupted
<strong>File verification</strong> files on the computer. The <strong>File verification</strong> file may go corrupted for many reasons some due to faulty storage media, errors in transmission, software bugs, etc.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next time when you encounter the above issue,
</span><span>scan your PC for virus/malware attacks by running the anti-virus software. Run the anti-virus software twice to detect and confirm any malware/virus on your PC and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Forget password brings back to the login pages as it is unable to access internet due to faulty drivers. Futhermore since the release of windows 10 my Nvidia Graphics has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide with the solution, as mentioned earlier i can only see battery status, network symbol "only airplane mode icon " and password box which is not accepting the current password.</p>

    <title>Automatic Updates - A Tale of Lost Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artkingjw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic Updates - A Tale of Lost Work</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>It probably seems very common now to see people complaining about the inability to control automatic updates in Windows 10. I've read through the various solutions out there now and have concluded that there seems to be no way to turn off this "feature",
 without messing with some risky/dangerous settings on the non-Pro version of Windows 10. So this is not a question on how to control it, but rather a discussion to raise some issues, which I think the smart cookies at Microsoft should be aware of, and are
 hopefully trying to address. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 now has the Notify to Schedule Restart feature, which is much better than not having it, as we are now afforded at least, some control over how updates work. However I do not think that this is enough, here is an example of my scenario:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I go to bed at 11pm -&gt; Updates install some time in the night (say 12am) -&gt; Automatic restart scheduled for 3.45am -&gt; I wake up at 8am to find that my computer has restarted -&gt; rage quit smash keyboard punch hole in the wall&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? here are a couple of possible reasons, all of which have occurred: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I am running some form of software that needs time to process. Examples include programs such as a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) solver, or meshing program. These things do not magically finish in a few minutes, and depending on your hardware and
 setup, can take hours, days to run. So if the computer shuts down at 3.45am, and I get up at 8am, the amount of work loss is not 4 hours, but
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">a lot more, </span>possibly as long as<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> the whole project duration</span>. This program can be somewhat mitigated with the clever use of auto-saves in the CFD solver, but this is
 not the case for every single application, and certainly not friendly to storage space.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I am downloading a large file, of some importance/urgency. I have a slow internet connection, which cannot be helped (believe me I have tried). Therefore, it takes a long time to download, I often let it run through the night. When I get up at 8am, I
 find that the entire download has been compromised, because Windows 10 decided it wanted to take a nap. Naturally, the time lost, is the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">duration of the whole download,</span> not to mention any issues with<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> data caps
</span>(which thankfully I don't have, because I paid for it). </p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I have several tabs open on my internet browser, all of which are lost in the reboot. I value privacy so I do not want my browser to remember history. Not the biggest issue, but definitely annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Not all programs have an auto-save feature (where it auto-saves your work every 15 minutes or something). I have to consciously remember to save all my work before going to sleep, in fear that my computer will eat it as a midnight snack. Again, not the
 biggest issue, but definitely more hassle than it should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can see the intention behind the current Windows 10 method of handling updates, Microsoft doesn't want anyone to lag behind on updates to put it simply, which has many advantages (as well as disadvantages, but I won't delve into that here). But the way
 in which this is handled is less than desirable, at least for me, or for users like me (surely I am not alone in this?).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are definitely work-a-rounds to solve this issue, but not everyone has enough resource to pay for Pro or Server or whatever version it is that allows for better management of updates, especially not when the only real 'use' of upgraded is to control
 update behavior. Not everyone has the privilege of living in areas of good network connectivity, not everyone can afford unlimited data caps, not everyone can afford to upgrade to a business grade data connection, especially when they don't need it all of
 the time - it is probably hard for people who have good internet connections to imagine what people with slow connections have to deal with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem seems to be in how Microsoft thinks of its customers/users and how they use their machines. A good example of this is back in the Xbox One "Always Online" days - remember that? Yea... look how that turned out. For all their desire of progress,
 and all things shiny in the future, never forget that 95% of your users are still stuck in the grimy past Microsoft. I think there needs to be a reevaluation of what a typical Microsoft client is. Design goals are aimed at the top 5%, but if you really want
 to drive adoption, and adoration, you need to appeal to the 95%; solutions need to be engineered to accommodate the lowest common denominator. If I wanted to use my computer, only in the way my OS creators wanted me to, I would buy a Mac, not a Windows machine.
<br />
<br />
If a machine is to be useful to me, it needs to serve me. Work-a-rounds are good, but the more complicated they become, the more it becomes an issue of me serving the machine, and why should that be the case? I buy a machine to make my life easier, not give
 me extra stress. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my issue, I've decided to wait for the next batch of updates to come (even if it means I have to stay up), when it asks to schedule a restart, I will schedule it to a time when I will almost definitely be using the computer everyday, for example,
 11am. That way, if it does need to reboot, I will know in advance and can save my work, and do what I need to do to avoid loosing work. I am not keen on a downgrade to Windows 8.1, as I found that OS experience very buggy on my system, so there goes that work-a-round.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to discuss this, post suggestions etc. I hope someone from Microsoft sees this as feedback.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, the solution to this problem could be as simple as adding a hidden feature, where once activated, the scheduled restart will not occur unless user permission is explicitly granted, you could ask it to give you 15-30 minutes to save your work, after
 which it will reboot regardless. At least you have that last barrier, or safety net to prevent lost work. You make it hidden so that it is not available by default, so if someone were to use it, they will have to know what they are doing before doing it. This
 is similar to how Android's "Developer Options" is hidden, you tap on the "build number" 7 times - neat trick.
</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>There are so many issues with mandatory automatic updates, and the list gets bigger as time passes. No schedule when to check and or download, (meter bandwidth). Large driver update&nbsp;and the new version does not play well the GPU. Now OS version update, very
 large.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I remember Windows security updates come out once a month. Why have this background processes constantly running. They can send any little program down through updates. Like a new candy crush game, or a twitter app. Where is the choice. But like all things
 conservative there has to be away to stop the cost of bandwidth. Disconnect the Wi-Fi until such time I'm ready do update. Even with that while I'm working or browsing I get the notification a restart has been scheduled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all that was sent through updates was security and Important all would work well except for the restart. If it was just a manual restart, there would be time to save work. Unless that was done automatically.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Sleep Mode-Won&#39;t Wake Up Require power cycle restart</h2>
                    This started after the last W10 update on my desktop. This seem to be a big widespread problem. Already tried manually updating every driver in Device Manager. This is a frustrating problem. Lets hope MS will offer a solution very soon.

            Thanks for the response. I tried the above ad retried again since your reply. My desktop goes to sleep no problem. It just cannot wake up. I have to do a hard power cycle to get it back. Right now I have disabled sleep and keep the pc on all the time.
 I hop there will be a solution soon.

    <title>Why The Unfair Billing Practices&#33; NOT COOL XBOX. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why The Unfair Billing Practices&#33; NOT COOL XBOX.</h2>
                    
<p>Today I looked at my bank account info to see that after MONTHS of not having anything to do with Xboxlive, they charged my account for A GOLD MEMBERSHIP. (I was thinking SH*t sH*T, but whatever I'd call and cancel it because THAT WAS THE LAST 65 DOLLARS
 IN MY ACCOUNT. Now, I know you guys at xbox cannot see how broke I am, but since I lost my job, ran out of unemployment, and can't find another I'm one of those Americans whose left STRUGGLING to get by. Well, I digressed...let me get back to it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The money LEFT MY ACCOUNT TODAY, 6/23/11. I called your customer support. Unbeknownst to me, (as I do not use my old email for xboxlive), apparently my account auto-renewed back in April (YOU WOULD THINK THAT AFTER MY CARD WAS DECLINED THE SERVICE WOULD
 JUST BE DISCONNETED, LIKE IF YOU STOPPED PAYING FOR NETFLIX). I WAS NOT AWARE THIS WASN'T THE CASE. I thought I had cancelled it, or at the very least I didn't think you'd continue to run the service once my card was declined for payment. It declined those
 payments for MONTHS, and yet you STILL ran the service???? Today I find what little money I put in my account to use on gas and food has now been taken away from me. What did the person I spoke to on your call support say? He said there was nothing I could
 do since it technically renewed months ago.....well xbox...not fair. I CALLED YOU THE DAY that you took that money out of my account. I don't want to be a rude&nbsp; customer or anything like that, because I do like your company, I do like the services you provide,
 but I have to say I think this is bull-crap. I know 65 dollars is NOTHING to you guys....but to me thats seriously a weeks worth of food and gas and I have NO idea what I'm going to do now....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the point of this is please Xbox, I know you have a soul somewhere....please let me have my 65 dollars back, since I caught the transaction THE DAY it was taken. I called you AS SOON as I realized what was going on. It's not that I don't pay attention,
 that I'm irresponsible, it's that I genuinely did NOT know how xbox live worked apparently. Now, this is a fault I will take resoponsibility for but COME ON....PLEASE. The fact that I caught it the day of the monetary transaction SHOULD count for SOMETHING....</p>

<p>You do know all this was listed in the terms &amp; conditions you agreed too before signing up including auto renewal, keeping your payment details up to date and how to go about cancelling the service right? The system wasn't to know you wanted to stop using
 the service as you hadn't told it that you wanted to stop hence it trying to charge you.
</p>

<p>Sorry to here that&nbsp;has happended to you, and VernierSlake is right once you create your account with a credit card auto renewal is automatically turned on and you need to contact Xbox Support to have it turned off. &nbsp;The matter about your 65 dollars that
 you are claiming to want back will need to be dealt with by calling Xbox Support and talking to the billing department that is the only way no further help about refunds can be found on the forums.</p>
