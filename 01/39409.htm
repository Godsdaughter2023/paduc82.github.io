<h2>            Can&#39;t Join Minecraft with people</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been like over week since I've downloaded 'Xbox Insider Hub' while I was playing Minecraft. However, I had no idea what's that about so I remove the hub and my game started to have issues, therefore I uninstalled and re-installed the game back. So,
 far, I'm able to play by myself and on servers but can't join others at their games. The game is coming as 'Outdated Server' and its version 1.9.0.0. Please help me out and thanks alot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the trick to locate old Toshiba in support for Drivers is to <strong>click "Archive"</strong>. Any other boxes will lead you to Timbuktu. Practice makes perfect- Under Archive the relevant boxes will appear. The rest is history. All pre-2015 drivers are
 located here. You cant miss it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any one can now get the respective Drivers.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 DPI Scaling with Remote Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> halo_four  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 DPI Scaling with Remote Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I frequently remote from a Microsoft Surface 2 Pro running Windows 8.1 Pro to a desktop computer also running Windows 8.1 Pro.&nbsp; The Surface Pro DPI is set to the default 144 dpi whereas the desktop, connected to an older LCD monitor, is set to 96 dpi.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In my experience DPI scaling behaves differently depending on the scenario in which I log into the session.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I have already logged onto a session on the desktop computer and then later connect to that session via Remote Desktop then the scaling seems correct, applications render scaled so that they appear appropriate for the DPI of the Surface Pro.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I have, say, rebooted the desktop computer and then log onto a new session on the desktop computer via Remote Desktop then the scaling seems to not apply to that session.&nbsp; Worse, if I then connect to that same session from the console of the desktop computer
 scaling appears to render scaled applications to half of what would be their normal size.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'll gather some example screenshots and post them here to demonstrate the effect.</p>

            <p>The effect in this example is subtle but visible.&nbsp; The two portions that seem to be most affected are the task bar and the console.&nbsp; Other apps seem to scale as abruptly as the console, such as mIRC and Trillian.&nbsp; Something else I've noticed is that in those
 cases when using Aero Peek there is a disparity between the size of the peek of that window vs. the size of the actual window, and the outline of the window in Aero Peek reflects that of the actual size whereas the contents remain unscaled.</p>

Same with me, everything worked fine, now it keeps saying something went wrong. I tried all of the things above and none worked.

            <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Please do the following (one after one <u>before</u> trying to check if the problem is fixed):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Run your computer in Clean Boot Mode.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Click your start button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- On the search field type: msconfig</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Hit the Enter Key to open it right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- On the General Tab, select "Diagnostic Startup" and be sure ONLY "Load System Services" is checked. (Uncheck any other, the third one can't be unchecked this is normal)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Go to the Service Tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Look for a checkbox called "Hide all Microsoft services" and check it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Hit the button "Disable all" </p>
<p>&nbsp;- Hit the button "OK" it will ask for a restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Reboot your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>2. Delete temporal files.</strong></p>
<p>Copy and paste this in your Windows Explorer address field (Change YOUR USER with the name of your user account):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Users\<strong>YOUR USER</strong>\AppData\Local\Temp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Use this keyboard combination to select all the items of the folder: Ctrl + A</p>
<p>b) Use this keyboard combination to delete all the items of the folder: Ctrl + Alt + Delete</p>
<p>(It can say you need admin rights to delete a file there, check "do the same for all conflicts" and select yes, if it says a file can't be deleted because it's being used, check "do the same for all conflicts" and select "skip")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy and paste this in your Windows Explorer address field and <strong>repeat the same steps</strong> we just did for the other folder:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Temp</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Stop Windows Update Services and rename the SoftwareDistribution Folder then start the services again.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Press your Windows key in your keyboard to open the Start Screen (it looks like a flag between Ctrl and Alt)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Type the following using your keyboard: <strong>cmd</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Right click the result and select at the bottom "Run As Administrator"</p>
<p>&nbsp;- On the black screen type: <strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- DO NOT close the black Window, just minimize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Now go to C:/Windows and look for a folder called "SoftwareDistribution" (if you can't find it try to look for a guide&nbsp;on how to show hidden files and folders).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Right Click SoftwareDistribution folder and select "Rename", add a ".old" at the end of the name. (It should&nbsp;look like this:&nbsp;SoftwareDistribution.old ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Bring back your cmd black window again, and type: <strong>net start wuauserv</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Run "CheckSUR" commands in your computer.</strong></p>
<p>- Press your Windows key in your keyboard to open the Start Screen (it looks like a flag between Ctrl and Alt)</p>
<p>- Type the following using your keyboard: <strong>cmd</strong></p>
<p>- Right click the result and select at the bottom "Run As Administrator"</p>
<p>- This command has two parts, each can take up to 20 minutes and will seem to be stuck at 20% but they are actually working,&nbsp;in the black window type the following:</p>
<p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong></p>
<p>And when that's done, this one:</p>
<p><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If after doing all of this the problem persists please refer yourself to this article, you might want to Refresh or Reset Windows 8 to an out-of-box state.&nbsp;I warn you this means you will lose all your applications.
</p>

<p>Hope I've been helpful. Let us know if you managed to fix your issue.</p>

            <p>I have had the same problem since purchasing an HP laptop with Windows 8.&nbsp; I don't mind the layout of Windows 8, but I really loathe that the apps don't work.&nbsp; I use free apps on my phone and Kindle Fire and was looking forward to using them on my laptop,
 but after googling and binging, and reading what other people have said, it looks like that probably won't happen any time soon, especially since I'm not particularly computer savvy.&nbsp; BUMMER OF THE YEAR = not being able to download the Norad Santa Tracker

<h2>            Windows Updates without Warning</h2>
                    Why does Windows updates and reboots without warning, and twice within 24 hours? It happens while I am in the middle of important tasks and I keep losing content! This is extremely annoying and inconvenient. How can I stop it?

    <title>Cannot activate windows firewall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lk_967  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate windows firewall</h2>
                    <p>In November I clicked on an email that I thought was a phone message. It was called "What's App?"</p>
<p>The malware installed itself all over my computer. I found instructions for removing it on the internet.</p>
<p>I noticed that my firewall was not activated and I tried to activate it manually but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>I was told by Norton that I was protected by their firewall. Recently I ran services.msc in the&nbsp;cmd window.</p>
<p>When I clicked on Microsoft Firewall I noticed that the path to the program that activates the firewall, svchost.exe</p>
<p>has been corrupted and the reason the firewall cannot be activated is that it cannot find the path to this program.</p>
<p>The field that contains the path: C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe has a character that looks like a K with a horizontal line through the middle of it and then a space and then netsvc. I cannot correct the field and remove the character and what comes after
 it. I also noticed that my DVD drive doesn't work and I believe that this is a shared service dependent on the same program as the firewall.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone knows how to correct the path field in the properties window of the firewall service please advise me. Thank you..</p>

            What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What Norton product(s) do you have installed?<br />
<br />
If the malware installed itself on your system that should tell you that Norton is not doing a good job of protecting your system.&nbsp; I would ask them if their product is so great how it failed to protect your system.<br />
<br />
Most experienced volunteers here will/might agree/concur that Norton is not going to be the best choice for an AV software to install on your system, but I understand that some people love their Norton, it may be recommended or offered for free from your Internet
 Service Provider or you may be forced to use it in a corporate environment but there are other things like Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) that you (and your system) might like better.&nbsp; Not every product is perfect, but it sounds obvious that Norton has
 failed to protect your system.<br />
<br />
Not all Norton product offerings come with a firewall and you did not tell us what Norton product you have installed but if you are using a Norton product that does have a firewall and it is enabled, it is usually not a good idea to run two firewalls at the
 same time since they can conflict with each other - so pick one or the other, but never both.<br />
<br />
It sounds like your XP firewall Service looks fine, but you did not tell us what happens when you try to start it except it '<i>was unsuccessful</i>'.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; If you are getting some error message you need to tell us what it says and if you are
 using the Norton firewall, you don't want the XP firewall running anyway.<br />
<br />
If your XP firewall Service looks like this, it sounds like it is fine:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fce24ad1-0027-4c7e-9457-159a3a570179" /><br />
<br />
<br />
Interpret the -k netsvcs to mean that this Service called <b>SharedAccess</b> will not be listed as a separate running process you might see in Task Manager but as one of the XP Services that runs
<b><i><u>under</u> </i></b>the several svchost.exe Processes you will see in Task Manager (this is normal).&nbsp; There are lots of XP Services like this and that is fine.<br />
<br />
It is easy to reinstall the XP firewall Service, but I don't think that is the problem or necessary.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 at least, installing a third party firewall disables the Windows firewall and I don't remember how thing work in XP but I thought a Norton firewall installation would disable the XP firewall and am not installing any Norton stuff to find out -
 even to test.<br />
<br />
Your DVD drive doesn't work?&nbsp; Exactly what does '<i>doesn't work</i>' mean to you and why do you&nbsp; believe that this is a shared service dependent on the same program as the firewall?<br />
<br />
And just because Norton (or any other AV) says your system is clean, doesn't necessarily mean your system is clean.&nbsp; Interpret that to mean that the scanner just didn't find anything that it knows about and there doesn't seem to be any single AV that knows
 about everything so it is prudent to use more than one.<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malware protection, please follow up with this:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
Be sure to select and choose to delete any threats, reboot, then scan again to be sure the threats have really been removed.<br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
SAS may install a startup item and launch every time your system reboots so if it is your desire to disable that, from the SAS splash screen, choose Preferences and uncheck the box "Start SUPERAntiSpyware when Windows starts" and the startup item will be removed
 from your configuration.<br />
<br />
SAS may also create a Scheduled Task to run every day which can also be disabled or deleted if that is your desire.&nbsp; To do that, choose Preferences, Scanning Control tab, Configure Scheduled Scanning and it may remind you to upgrade after 14 days. You don't
 have to do anything to keep SAS installed to continue using it with updates and run on demand actions.<br />
<br />
Do a full scan once in a while when you have more time (perhaps hours).<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />

<p>Hi ElderL,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I am running an old Dell XP computer with service pack 3. This is not the first malware attack I have had. My Norton antivirus is Norton Security Suite and is provided free by Comcast. I know that it fails to protect this computer.
 This computer is all filled up after ten years of use and runs very slowly thanks to little space and comcast "high speed". I have purchased several new products from microsoft lately, the surface, the Dell venue, the windows phone and the HP Envy. All run
 windows 8.1 and I am trying to get used to the new invironment. This computer is the only one where I can store email because comcast has a pop server and windows 8.1 will not take email from a popserver. If it weren't for that I would just retire this computer
 but there is a great deal of information on it that I need. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to activate the firewall it tells me that it can't find the file svchost.exe. That is why I thought the path in the properties page was corrupted. I have tried every possible fix known to me but I have been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believed the DVD drive was run by svchost.exe but I could be mistaken. What happens when I try to run a disk is the machine ejects normally, starts to read and then stops a few seconds later. In the past it worked.
<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the information on scanning and deleting viruses and malware. I will run all items now and report back about the results. To be continued.</p>

            PUPs are Potentially Unwanted Programs and softomate is some adware your system picked up from somewhere...&nbsp; Uh-oh Norton.&nbsp; How many strikes is that for Norton?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you are going to keep using Norton (or even if you switch to something else), then you can and should still supplement it with at least the quick scans from MBAM and SAS once in a while.<br />
<br />
Windows 8.1 doesn't do pop emails?&nbsp; What are you using for email?&nbsp; I know somebody that is not going to be very happy about that but they are using Outlook so maybe that will be okay.&nbsp; Looks like it is only the Windows 8.1 built in email can't do POP, but they
 list some ideas.<br />
<br />
I know how to fix firewall messages like this:<br />
<br />
Could not start the Windows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing Service (ICS) on Local Computer<br />
Error 2:&nbsp; The system cannot find the file specified.<br />
<br />
I don't have that message you report but would like to see it.&nbsp; It seems unlikely that your svchost.exe file is really missing so something else is wrong.<br />
<br />
I would still like to see what you have so I can actually see what you are seeing and learn how to fix it for the next time (it is a lot of trouble, but it will help somebody else someday - and they will appreciate it) so I wish you would do this:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Clic OK to open a Command Prompt Window and then enter these commands one at a time striking the Enter key after each:<br />
<br />
<b>cd&nbsp; \windows\system32<br />
<br />
sc&nbsp; qc&nbsp; sharedaccess&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; ics.txt<br />
<br />
notepad&nbsp; ics.txt</b><br />
<br />
When Notepad opens the ics.txt file, select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy all the highlighted text to the Windows clipboard (Ctrl-C) and in your next reply, paste the Windows clipboard back here (Ctrl-V).<br />
<br />
It should look something like this:<br />
<br />
[SC] GetServiceConfig SUCCESS<br />
<br />
SERVICE_NAME: sharedaccess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TYPE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 20&nbsp; WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; START_TYPE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 2&nbsp;&nbsp; AUTO_START<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ERROR_CONTROL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 1&nbsp;&nbsp; NORMAL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BINARY_PATH_NAME&nbsp;&nbsp; : C:\WINDOWS\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOAD_ORDER_GROUP&nbsp;&nbsp; :&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : 0&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISPLAY_NAME&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Windows Firewall/Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEPENDENCIES&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Netman&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : Winmgmt&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SERVICE_START_NAME : LocalSystem&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
Then you can close Notepad and delete the ics.txt file and enter 'exit' in the command prompt window to close it.<br />
<br />
The we can take a look at your Registry setup for the ICS Service but before doing that consider creating a manual restore point and also backing up your registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
That is since there is no undo or quit without saving in the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Then click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
regedit<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the Registry Editor and by clicking the plus signs, navigate to the location of the SharedAccess Service which is here:<br />
<br />
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</b><br />
<br />
Find and select the SharedAccess Service, right click it, choose Export, name the file something you can remember (lke
<b>sharedaccess.reg</b>) and save it to someplace you can find it (like your Desktop), then right click the sharedaccess.reg file and choose to Open With Notepad.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
In Notepad, select all the text (Ctrl-A), copy (Ctrl-C) and also paste that back in your next reply (Ctrl-V).<br />
<br />
Close the Registry Editor.&nbsp; You can delete the sharedaccess.reg file from your desktop or wherever you saved it.<br />
<br />
There could be quite a bit of text to paste back depending on what exceptions may have been made to your firewall settings, but that's okay - do the best you can.<br />
<br />
If you want, you can also email it to me as an attachment by clicking the link for

<p>Thank you so much for all your trouble. Although I have done programming and systems analysis I have never used regedit and I am reluctant to do that. Please tell me what is going on with this because it looks exactly like it is supposed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone mentioned to me that the Microsoft firewall is not active because I have Norton installed.
</p>
<p>Is it possible that it would be active if I uninstall Norton Security Suite? </p>

 antivirus software, Spybot and Malwarebytes programs. I ahve checkd for malware and I am OK there. I have tried optimizing the search for pictures or videos and that didn't work. Any suggestions? I have a Toshiba Sateliite L355D laptop.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to run the fixit from the following link:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us</a><br />
<b><br />
Method 2<br />
Step 1: </b>I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
<b>Step 2:</b> If the issue is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.<br />

<b>Note:</b> Follow step 7 from the clean boot article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 3</b></span><span><br />
I would suggest you to run online virus scan using Microsoft safety scanner to make sure that your computer is not affected with virus.<br />
<br />

    <title>Cumulative Update KB3200970 keeps failing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshua v. lewis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cumulative Update KB3200970 keeps failing</h2>
                    My system's auto update feature keeps attempting to apply Cumulative Update KB3200970 and continues to fail. I've tried manually applying it as well, but that also keeps failing. It's been doing this since the update was released and has failed each time.
 I'm starting to get rather annoyed now because I keep having to let my system restart when I'm already busy trying to get things done [I prefer to let the updates get done with so I can get them out of the way as soon as possible]. Even the Security update
 [same number for some reason] has also failed.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows of a working fix for this I would be very grateful, because this is starting to become extremely annoying.<br />

<p>That method also didn't fix it. The update still failed again. And I couldn't get the log from troubleshooter either since it couldn't be saved and since I don't have a printer.</p>

This failed, and there was no way to save the log to show the results. I also don't have a printer so I couldn't print the results either. Resetting Windows Updates also didn't fix the issue. The Cumulative update still keeps failing. It doesn't even get past
 7% for me during the restart stage.&nbsp;

            <p>After six logged fails (seemed like 10), the update took on my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet. I'm not sure why or exactly when it succeeded because I had to restart manually a couple of times because the screen went black after logging in. At one point, File Manager
 showed no links below the two top level links and showed a never completed progress bar when Quick Access was clicked. It went black after that. I think there may have been an auto restart after a very long time black, also.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another user setup and logged in to that account successfully and discovered in it that the update had succeeded. Now that login took a long time to get to the desktop and had a Windows setting up user..... for a long time so I wonder if it was the
 switch in users that completed the update or if that happens with each first login after the update. Returning to my normal account, there was a long drawn out process until I got the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had prior to an earlier fail run the sfc /scannow and the Windows Update Troubleshooter a couple of times with no apparent success. I also had paused OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive. I believe there was a fail after those actions because I had a fail
 today which would have been 36 hours later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So switching to another user may have done the trick or been merely coincidental.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that is (was) different between the two accounts is that I am admin, the other is not and on my account I have a virtual drive on the microSD card, the other does not. Currently, the virtual drive has fallen off my account giving Dropbox et al
 grief because that is where they point(ed). More to check into...</p>

            <p>I was wrong earlier that my other non-admin user account did not have the virtual drive. The reason that File Manager was hung up building an index was that the microSD card was somehow disconnected. Even though it was shown as drive D:, clicking on it said
 that it needed to be inserted. So I removed and reinserted it and File Manager sprang to life. Restarted and the virtual drive V: (using a portion of that card) not only appeared in the non-admin user but also I no longer had the black screen in my normal
 admin account. The majority of my programs are installed on the removable drive card in order to conserve space on the 32GB system drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is possible that part of my problem with the update might be due to some glitch with microSD support throughout the update procedure. I'm not sure there is anything I can do about that. I think Microsoft has exhibited prior failure to adequately support
 tablets or other computers with small system drives and necessarily very dependent on the SD slot.</p>

<h2>            opening a file  .mov</h2>
                    Bought new Canon digital SD1400 camera, installed software and later took a movie. I can playback movie on the camera but it will not play on computer once downloaded. Screen appears saying "Windows cannot open this file MVI_0122.MOV&nbsp; Windows needs to
 know what program created it." I have manually tried to select from a list of programs Windows suggested that were on my computer and I have also gone online to find a solution. So far both ideas have not worked. Anybody know what program creates this file
 .MOV and how I can download solution to my computer?

            I hope you created a physical recovery disc set first.<br />
<br />
Most laptops and many OEM (HP, Sony, etc.) desktop computers come with a factory restore image on a special partition on the hard drive. The factory restore process is normally invoked by pressing a Function key (like F11) at computer startup. There will be
 a message as to which Function key to press on the screen when you first start your computer. You can also refer to your computer manual, or the computer mftr.'s website, or contact its tech support to see how to restore your computer to factory condition
 since each computer mftr. does it differently - sometimes even between models.<br />
<br />
These machines also usually have a utility with which to create physical recovery discs in case the hard drive needs to be replaced or the factory restore image is somehow damaged. If you did not create the physical recovery discs and/or damaged the recovery
 image, contact the computer mftr.'s tech support to order a recovery disc set. This is normally very inexpensive, around $20-25.<br />

            Here are some suggestions to regain space so you don't need to so something like deleting your recovery partition (which I wish there was some way to undo because you may one day have need for it despite the recovery disks which you either have or may
 purchase from the computer manufacturer (I've seen them go for a bit more than $20-$25 but not a whole lot much more).&nbsp; You should get the disks if you don't have them ASAP in case you run into trouble and need to restore the system to factory-original conditions.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp;
 There are ways to handle this in Vista (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer
 vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop).<br />
<br />
To improve your speed, do Disk Cleanup using: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster (though perhaps not
 so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<br />
<br />
You can accomplish some of these tasks (and more that aren't entirely related) by using
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(which
 also searches for malware).&nbsp; I do this on a monthly basis just as a part of normal maintenance and I suggest you do the same.&nbsp; Make sure you select a full scan - it will take a few hours (mine can take around 5-6) but can work in the background so start it
 when it has enough time to complete.<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;is
 an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really need Defender (but you would with any other AV program).&nbsp; I
 would also suggest downloading </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 running it monthly to catch anything that MSE/Defender might miss.<br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps.</span>

<h2>            How do you get 1920x1200 resolution on DELL 2405FPW monitor for Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10. Have DELL 2405FPW monitor. It has 1920x1200 resolution. However on my Dell Dimension 9100, I can not get more than 1280x1024 resolution. My Display Adapter is " Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" and Monitor comes up as Generic non-Pnp
 under Device Manager. Video Controller comes up as unknown manufacturer and driver for it is not installed. Tried updating drivers for monitor and display adapter but came up with the message saying that drivers are up to date. Dell website does not have Windows
 10 driver for 2404FPW. Any solution? I had Windows 8.1 before and my monitor worked in higher resolution.

<h3> selfyjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop scaling too high on Android phone</h2>
                    <p>I frequently remote into my Windows 10 PC using my mobile phone and have recently upgraded to a OnePlus 3. Compared to my previous device, &nbsp;which had a 4k display, &nbsp;the 1080p display on the OP3 results in Windows scaling the UI to such a large degree as
 to be completely unusable (see screenshots). </p>
<p>
</p><p>As the display options are disabled when in a remote session, &nbsp;does anyone know how to tone down the UI scaling, &nbsp;either through Windows or the RD Client Android app?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            APN for SIM CARD in new Surface Pro 5thGen - ATT SIM card</h2>
                    <p>APN settings SIM CARD ATT SURFACE PRO (5th Gen). Cellular won't connect</p>
<p>
</p><p>New Surface Pro (5th Gen),Windows 10, bought/shipped from Microsoft (May 2019). Wifi is fine. Cellular is problem.</p>
<p>Went to ATT store and they gave me nanoSIM. SIM shows up in Network Settings as ATT LTE. But clicking Connect results in spinning dots, and no connection. &nbsp;ATT store and ATT ProTech phone wizards could not solve it. And they barely knew what APN is, and
 could not provide APN settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Apple, and know Windows not at all really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems that either the APN needs to be set/defined - based on Microsoft Windows 10 requirements? (Is that right?)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>The SIM Card is not compatible</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Are there different varieties of SIM CARDS?</p>
<p>

<p>Franco - thank you. &nbsp;However, three staff, including manager of ATT store, didn't know how to solve APN issue. And they had ATT's "ProTech" department call me (alleged gurus) and both the initial ProTech person and her higher-up couldn't solve it. When they
 started trying to google along with me, they soon gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Franco -- where in ATT or Microsoft shall I go for help? Do you think that Microsoft wouldn't know? In other words, is this ATT-specific or Microsoft-specific information? THAT MAY HELP ME GET TO ANSWER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why is this not easily available information?</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS AGAIN FRANCO -- any ideas for more? You are very kind.</p>

<span>Hi David Ferleger,</span><br />
<span>The APN address to be set on your device can only be supplied by your Manager (ATT), Microsoft cannot know this because it depends on the type of subscription you have subscribed and the State or Region
 in which you reside.</span><span>
</span><span>I am very surprised that ATT is not able to provide you with this elementary information ...</span><br />

    <title>No CallerID when receiving calls via my Skype Landline number - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No CallerID when receiving calls via my Skype Landline number</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Skype landline number (in Australia). Is there any way to enable Caller ID for people calling into this number? Currently, the Skype app on my mobile phone (iOS) just shows an "Unknown Person" calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear... this is Caller ID for the person I'm receiving the call from - not CallerID for me when I make a call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

    <title>Add features to windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whatsisname  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add features to windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I update my Windows 8.1 OS from; Settings&gt;Control panel&gt;Win update, I have a message in the bottom left hand corner "Add features to Windows 8.1".</p>
<p>I&nbsp; click on&nbsp;the link&nbsp;to get more&nbsp;information as to what the features are but I am faced with the choice of&nbsp;a download with no idea as to what&nbsp;is therein&nbsp;contained.</p>
<p>I then search online to see if these features are useful to me and find nothing other than it was perhaps known as Windows Anytime Upgrade and perhaps had something to do with Propack, I deduce&nbsp;this was also offered with Win 7 and 8. If it is an update I
 can understand it being on the Win Update screen, if it is an attempt to shift a software bundle I would be impressed to be informed of its contents by another means.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a definitive&nbsp;list or explanation of what is&nbsp;shipped with these features?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, one other beef, I keep getting&nbsp;an optional update for Bing Desktop V 1.3.1, which I tried out&nbsp;but then&nbsp;got rid of, with seemingly no way of being able to switch the update off&nbsp;so it is no longer&nbsp;on the&nbsp;update screen. One&nbsp;had the option with XP at the&nbsp;Microsoft.com
 update site,&nbsp;Is there any way of bringing this back within Win 8.1?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            The Pro version has the link to add features, but there are no features to add except Media Center, which you might already have. If you had Media Center before the upgrade, you should still have it.&nbsp;
