 limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>OEM versions of Windows
 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM versions do not offer
 any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM licenses are tied
 to the very first computer you install and activate it on</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM versions allow all
 hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>- OEM versions cannot be

            <p>You do not have downgrade rights as a part of your Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do the downgrade you would have to purchase a Windows 7 license which because the product has been withdrawn by Microsoft is not that easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be very careful about where you get a license from if you go down that route. Microsoft never supplied Windows 7 as a key only offering and any on line sale of such should be treated with extreme caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a peer led forum supported by volunteer contributors, we cannot "provide Windows 7" for you.</p>

            This isn't the forum for doing what you are asking, checking with Dell that your model came with Windows 10 so to go to Windows 7 you will have to buy a Win7 installation which are hard to find a legal disc, if your issue is that you are trying to run
 some software that doesn't run on Windows 10 have you tried the compatible mode?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Pontin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever pics are sent in a mail that is formatted in Rich text, the picture is embedded on the email where as in a HTML formatted email the pic is present on the server of the email service provider and needs to be downloaded.

<p>If you are not able to see the complete pic in a email sent in Richtext then reason could be that the size of the image is large and hence occupies more of the screen face, unfartunately you can only use the scroll bar to move right/left to view the pic.</p>

    <title>Where do exported OE messages go&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where do exported OE messages go&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to export my Outlook Express messages and message folders so I can import them into Live Mail in Win 7. When I export them OE does not tell me where they are exported too or what kind of file to search for. The .DBX files that I find in MY
 MAIL will not import into Live Mail.&nbsp; Where are the exports and what file extension do I look for?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Capt. Brigg

<p>Exporting from OE only sends messages to Outlook or Exchange.<br />
<br />
Transferring data from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail:</p>
<p>For messages:</p>
<p>Copy the *ENTIRE* OE message store folder to a flash drive. (Folders.dbx must be included). Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail. Open WLMail and: File | Import | Messages | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and point to where
 you saved it.</p>
<p>OE Message Store Location:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Addresses:</p>
<p>Open the Address Book in OE and File | Export | Address Book (wab) and save it to the Desktop. Copy to a flash drive. Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail.</p>
<p>Open the Contacts list in WLMail, (Go | Contacts on the Menu Bar), and File | Import | Windows Address Book (wab) and point to where you saved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you use a CD or DVD instead of a flash drive, after placing on the new machine you must remove the Read Only attribute in Properties before you import.</p>

            Thanks, the process worked well. <br />
I'm still curious where the files go when you export your messages.&nbsp; <br />
Seems strange the export windows don't let you select a destination or at least tell you where to find them.&nbsp;
<br />
It's also strange that you don't actually use the exported files. Oh Well, just one more of life's mysteries.<br />

            You're welcome. When you File | Export | Messages, you select WLMail or Exchange and then Browse to where you want them. But again, it's not made for transferring messages.<br />
<br />
Glad you got it worked out OK.

    <title>Technical Summary of Skype versions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Technical Summary of Skype versions</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype-team!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is a GREAT Application and Platform.</p>
<p>There are tens of millions of users who use it every day. This is also true for me.</p>
<p>Many of us have been using it since over a decade (me from 2004!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of us appreciate and value your work and effort to make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since Skype introduces changes many times, there is a LACK of DETAILED INFORMATION about changes.</p>
<p>https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34685/what-s-new-in-skype-for-windows-10 is not enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What probably many of us wish, is to see a "Technical Summary of different Skype Versions".</p>
<p>Including an overview of Feature-differences</p>
<p>and (very important for old users) what version 8 and version 12 do with your (decade-long) chat-history when you upgrade from version 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my question is quite common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone made some research and published it as a PDF:</p>
<p>http://aztcs.org/meeting_notes/winhardsig/Skype/Skype11versus7.pdf</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like this, but with official information from the Skype-team would be really GREAT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alexej</p>

<h2>            How to repair Windows 10 installation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well...after 4 attempts I finally got Windows 10 installed (upgrade from Windows 7).&nbsp; However, obviously the installation is "whacked".&nbsp; When I right click on the DESKTOP to access properties (change icons, screen save, resolution etc ) I get the following
 error:</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>ms-settings:personalization-background</strong></div>
<div>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action.&nbsp; Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel.</div>
<p>
</p><p>And... that's not all</p>
<p>Whenever I click on SETTINGS a window pops up for a second and then disappears.&nbsp; It never allows me into SETTINGS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the RUN command?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is SO WHACKED!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does&nbsp; one repair a Windows 10 installation?</p>

</p><p>I have the same problem however my Personalization in the control panel still works. If you go to the Start menu/All apps/Windows System/Control Panel/ Backup and Restore (Windows 7). I am leaving mine just in case they patch it. It looks like a few of us
 got this glitch...Perhaps a video driver file. Hope this helps. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dayvcrocket</p>

            Backup and Restore is indeed found in Control Panel however, there is NO backup to restore. &nbsp;it appears that the botched installation of Windows 10 wiped all of that out. &nbsp;Way to go Microsoft!!!

            I found a fix on "The Windows Club" &nbsp; &nbsp;Windows 10 Settings app does not open. Microsoft has classified this as Emerging Issue 67758 &nbsp;The tool from Microsoft will scan your system. If you choose advanced and select fix it works in a few seconds...very fast
 and it worked. Troubleshooter "Fix or work around an emerging issue" &nbsp;Hope this helps someone.

            <p>Thank You Dayvcrocket, as you could see by my post it was frustrating trying to get the Operating System to preform properly, I knew there must have been a fix out there somewhere but not knowing how to find it has now been solved.

            <p>I was not able to use w10. I upgraded from w7 three times and the 3 times run into error. Very hard to revert to w7, because there was no way to stop the cycle when was booting and not enough time to start settings or control panel before the crash.</p>
<p>BIOS... Loading... Log in... drawing of desktop icons... black screen... blue screen with sad face informing of error SYSTEN_THREADING EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED collection of data... automatic rebooting .... BIOS again... In endless cycle. I struggled with it
 for 3 days and finally was able to interrupt the cycle by pressing few times the F7 key after the 4 small blue squares appeared on the black background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to upgrade any more, but the notification program keeps prompting me to start the upgrade. How do I disable it? Would someone know the way?</p>

            <p>I also am NO LONGER interested in upgrading to Win10 as it has crashed 3 of my machines even after multiple attempts.&nbsp; Not to mention... the best way to upgrade to any new OS is a clean install... not an upgrade!&nbsp; Shame on you Microsoft for pushing an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, how the heck does one get rid of the annoying icon in the SysTray that says 'Get Windows 10'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with that said... how the heck does one get rid of the annoying pop up each and everytime I visit answers.microsoft.com that says:&nbsp; Where's my upgrade?&nbsp; It's coming!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft...if you are going to shove something down the users throat it should at least work and not be annoying....</p>

<h2>            Internet Windows games NOT working.</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Can anyone please tell me why ever since 10 was released I am having so much trouble playing internet checkers or backgammon?</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Ever since Windows 10 became available I have had nothing but trouble connecting to these games. &nbsp;Not sure if it is the fault of 10 but due to the timing of all of my troubles with them it sure does not foster any desire
 for me to move up from Windows 7 PRO to 10, that's for sure.</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader1"><strong>The codes I'm repeatedly getting when trying to load them either end in the number 4 or number 6. &nbsp;Would gladly supply all the numbers in those darn codes IF I could copy and paste them&nbsp;which&nbsp;of&nbsp;course MS doesn't allow. Nor
 is there any place to look up any codes, guessing they want them kept secret?</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader1">
</p><p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Another annoying thing about MS is the fact when I go to UPDATE seems MS thinks I mean UPGRADE, now isn't that silly?</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader1"><strong>I am an old woman who wants to play her games IF MS would keep them working. &nbsp;IMHO games not working means I can't trust that 10 you all want to shove down my throat. &nbsp;heard of the major troubles many are having with that
 one, so I'll stay away.</strong></p>
<p class="contentHeader1"><strong>Must say back when 3.1 came out my dear hubby called it the most
<em>widely circulated legal virus on earth.</em> &nbsp;With all the subsequent new Windows he NEVER changed his mind. &nbsp;Always said Dos never gave him the fits any Windows product did.</strong><br />
<strong>Silly MS now how do I choose where to post this from your silly list here?</strong></p>

<strong>Well to be sure was not due to MY internet called my cable company and had a check done on my system. &nbsp;For sure is all due to Microsoft not maintaining their systems these days. &nbsp;Am now day 3 and still unable to connect to my FREE with 7 PRO games that
 are better than any pills to relax. &nbsp;Seriously doubting I'll be getting 10 any time soon.</strong><br />

            <p><strong>Apparently Microsoft is not maintaining the system that Internet Checkers and Internet Backgammon are played on. &nbsp;Have not been able to connect to either one for days and days now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>These are the 2 games I play to relieve stress and neither one has been working all that well prior to the no connection. &nbsp;Many a time right in the very middle of a game with an unknown player game will stall then crash. &nbsp;Was happening at least 1
 or 2 times a day. &nbsp;NOW? &nbsp;Can not connect at all. &nbsp;Would gladly have copied and pasted the entire code given as reason but MS seems not to allow us to do that so all I can give are the 004 at end,</strong></p>
<p><strong>To tell you the truth I've been wondering whether to upgrade to 10 from 7 PRO even though many of my online friends have said don't that 10 is worse than 8. &nbsp;After this long stretch of MS not maintaining the system that runs my 2 Internet games have
 decided NOT to court more headaches.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have enough RAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>Have checked and rechecked my Internet connection including having my company run a test. &nbsp;All is AOK on my end.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I NEVER use IE due to the serious security issues it's had. &nbsp;Again many friends have warned me about IE including some very&nbsp;savvy&nbsp;techs. &nbsp; I'll stick with Google TYVM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So can anyone tell me why Internet Checkers and Internet Backgammon will not connect?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Oh and clicking more free games from Microsoft and playing my 2 from there you may ask? &nbsp;HA! &nbsp;Even there MS is having troubles. &nbsp;Right in middle of playing game will "time out".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Sad how MS gets themselves so involved with their new Windows as well as their&nbsp;driver less&nbsp;cars and forgets to maintain products they sold to us for big bucks already.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can anyone please help?</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Well here we are again, Microsoft is totally ignoring the Windows 7 PRO user questions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Posted twice now about the&nbsp;Internet&nbsp;Checkers and Backgammon NOT connecting with absolutely no response from Microsoft. &nbsp;If MS thinks this will get me to go to Windows 10 think again Microsoft. &nbsp;IF you can't keep my 7 PRO working how in the world
 can I expect you all to have 10 working properly?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MS, you've been asked by myself and others about our Internet games included with our Windows program and you've not yet responded. &nbsp;Should we just assume you're no longer supporting any Windows below 10? &nbsp;I ask this because when I do a manual check
 for updates for MY Windows program there are none when in past was nearly daily notification of updates ready for install for Windows 7. &nbsp;Oh and when I click "check for UPDATES" I do not mean check for upgrades! &nbsp;Don't know about anyone else but clicking check
 for updates brings me to screen showing UPGRADE to 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You may ask why am I manually checking, well now due to the fact I haven't received any message about UPDATES being available to download in weeks now needed to be sure I had the latest update running on my machine. &nbsp;Oh and yes I had to change from
 auto install updates due to there being so many with reboot needed which often&nbsp;interfered&nbsp;with work I was doing, hence the ask me first. &nbsp;Guessing I can now go back to the auto setting since there doesn't seem to be any updates available other than an UPGRADE
 to 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When will MS inform us IF our games will work again or IF they are working on the problem?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks,</strong></p>

            <p>This forum is for posting feedback about the Microsoft Answers web site, not for asking technical questions.</p>
<p>Your question should have been asked in an Android forum.&nbsp; No software for WIndows can ever run on any cell phone.&nbsp; Software must be written for the operating system that is its target.&nbsp; Moreover if the software you mean is from
<a href="http://cell-control.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cell-control.com/</a>, the web site explicitly says it works with Android phones.&nbsp; If you are having trouble, they'll need to address it.</p>
<p>Frankly, though, any company whose main page makes you enter an e-mail address before telling you about their products isn't worth a second look.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure and check with the game's maker's support and their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Often BEX errors are caused by Toolbars such as Google, TrendMicro and others. Are you using<br />
any 3rd party toolbars in IE? Cause and fix is same for Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have<br />
EVER had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which<br />
causes issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore&nbsp;Advanced Settings&nbsp;and then click RESET - APPLY /&nbsp;OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;- click Reset all zones - APPLY / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java<br />
still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look<br />
for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program<br />
ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - SpyBHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download, UnZip<br />
and run. Also not all BHO's are bad, some run toolbars and features you have added.<br />

<br />
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware&nbsp;UPDATE it and then<br />
run it as a scanner. <br />

<h2>            Sign in issues on Generic skype account</h2>
                    <p>Hey</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have generic skype account that was created few years ago.</p>
<p>When it was created the details were quite basic just get going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when trying to log to this account it wont allow login as it believes this is child account (the dob was left 1/1/2010 so the account would be 7 years).</p>
<p>Microsoft policy prevents it accessing services like skype now without approval from parent.</p>
<p>Tried to change the date but it will ask for credit card, no problem otherwise but the address part is locked to US, which is not correct (UK is)</p>
<p>Also when trying give "parental consent" from another account it asks again for the credit card details which are country locked to US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have working username and password, just not being let in to change the incorrect details or use skype services.</p>
<p>As the support page just points to these forums, I'll ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to correct the details so I would be allowed to us the skype account again?</p>

<h2>            Skype seems tp be  blocking my wife&#58;s access to her account. Will they also keep her money&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today, after years of use, Skype no longer took my wife;s pasword. We treoed MANY times to reset it, etc. We were sent to a form that asked when we bought the last MS produxt TO THE DAY, the last 4 of the credit card we usedm rgw phone number we signed up
 years ago with, the numbers of the most recent people we called, and their full names, etc, etc. &nbsp;Besides the gross invasion of privacy... it all seemed insane. NEVER jumped through ddo many hoops for a simple password reset. Derious;y? It is not a bank account.

            Thank Vijay, I appreciate any rsponse. We have given up for the day. I wikk try one more tim tomorrow, but then my wife has said she's had it with Skype's draconiansignon recovery and the constant glitches that make us renew or replace paswords for no
 reason. Wish us luck tomorrow. With no REAL support from Skype (no human manned phone from a company that sells phone time... ironically sad)

    <title>How to change the default port for Microsoft Terminal Services Client - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change the default port for Microsoft Terminal Services Client for the Mac</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just recently purchased an iMac and I have a question regarding the Microsoft Terminal Services Client. Hopefully this is the correct forum. On my Windows Machine, I have a batch file that looks similar to the following:</p>
<p>mstsc /v:0.0.0.0:1234 /f</p>
<p>0.0.0.0 refers to the IP address of my Terminal Server and 1234 refers to the port.</p>
<p>I want to create the equivalent&nbsp;batch/command file on my iMac only I don't know how to do that. I can connect to a Terminal Services server from my iMac so long as the Terminal Server is listening on port 3389. The issue that I'm having is that we don't
 use the default 3389 port and the only way that I know to change that from the client side is to connect via batch file using the syntax above.</p>
<p>I've been a Windows user ever since there was a Windows so the Mac is a steep learning curve. Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch.</p>

Thank you for your question. </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could come from issues with your profile or corrupted system files. I would suggest you to try changgin and adding language from control panel:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + X</strong>&nbsp;keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>Add a language</strong>.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows logo key Windows logo key&nbsp;&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span>I</span>&nbsp;on your keyboard to open Settings. If that doesn't work, select the&nbsp;<span>Start</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;button in the lower-left corner of your screen, then select&nbsp;<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<span>Update &amp; security</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Recovery&nbsp;</span>.</span></li><li><span>Under&nbsp;<span>Advanced startup</span>, select&nbsp;<span>Restart now</span>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts to the&nbsp;<span>Choose an option</span>&nbsp;screen, select&nbsp;<span>Troubleshoot&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Advanced options</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Startup Settings</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Restart</span>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in&nbsp;<span>Safe Mode</span>. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select 5 or F5 for&nbsp;<span>Safe Mode with Networking</span>.<br />
<br />

<p>Thanks Mikael for your reply. &nbsp;I have done everything you suggested and nothing has fixed it. &nbsp;I may have to do a full reset to solve this. &nbsp;What I'd like to know is what would have caused it. &nbsp;Was it an error update, an interrupted update, another source
 such as virus or malware? &nbsp;I've looked at the event logs but could not fine anything that looks related. &nbsp;I've also tried a system restore and still no help ...</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One factor which might have caused why the <strong>Languages</strong> option under
<strong>Region &amp; Language</strong> is empty is due to missing or corrupted system files. What we recommend is that you run the System File Checker (SFC) tool. System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system
 files and restore corrupted files. You may check the article below for the steps in running the System File Checker.

    <title>unable to view certain images in Windows 10 image viewer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to view certain images in Windows 10 image viewer</h2>
                    <p>Hi Friends,</p>
<p>I am unable to view images which consist of black lines on a transparent background, using the Windows 10 image viewer (apparently called "Photo").&nbsp; I found this topic:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/change-the-background-colour-of-windows-10-photo/3a2e0364-cf5e-4909-83ce-a2501bb8b512
 which offers a few different alternatives.&nbsp; I posted in that topic, but no one answered.&nbsp; I thought maybe it was because I should have made my own topic instead of posting in someone else's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to try one of the first fixes, which refers to this article http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-windows-photo-viewer-windows-10/ which provides an edit to the registry to make the old Windows Photo Viewer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't know how to back up the registry, before I try to apply that fix.&nbsp; Could someone please tell me how to back up the registry?&nbsp; Then I can download that file, to edit the reg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if anyone has any other ideas, to be able to view images which are black lines on a transparent background, in Windows 10, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide an example of the type of image which I'm unable to see, if it would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much&nbsp; :-)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can view any kind of image except images which are black lines on transparent background.&nbsp; It's because the background of the viewer is black.&nbsp; If it could be changed to white, there would be no problem.&nbsp; But doesn't seem changable.&nbsp; That's why I
 wanted to enable the old Photo Viewer, because it has a white background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, yes, I've made a lot of changes, while configuring this new Win 10 system.&nbsp; I couldn't possibly remember them all.&nbsp; But I don't think I've done anything that would affect the image viewer.&nbsp; I'm not using any kind of theme that I've downloaded.&nbsp; I just
 changed the color of the titlebars, using Personalization &gt; Colors.</p>
<br />
<p>Yes, the images showed perfectly in the old Windows Photo Viewer of Win7 and whatever it was called in WinXP (PIcture Viewer, I think).&nbsp; On XP, I used to have....I can't remember the name but it was part of Office back then, and they showed fine there too.&nbsp;
 I'm not sure if I have any other image viewers in Win10 (since I didn't buy Office) but maybe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The format of the specific images I was testing, is PNG.&nbsp; But the problem would also happen with any format which provides transparency, such as GIF.&nbsp; (I haven't tested GIFs because the old Photo viewer wasn't able to display GIFs and I don't know if this
 new one does.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Crashing after Update , Resolved by Stopping Update Service - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Crashing after Update , Resolved by Stopping Update Service</h2>
                    <p>Right ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days ago I turned my computer off and it updated, then in the morning it was stuck in a loop crashing on startup.</p>
<p>I created a disk to repair the installation , tried "fix startup" which &nbsp;failed &nbsp;then "restore" which worked, but then I restarted my computer and it did it again , this time no options worked it would not even do a fresh install as it said there wasn't
 enough disk space , but I couldn't delete files as I couldn't open windows, so I installed windows 10 on my second hard disk deleted files from my 1st hard disk then reinstalled windows 10 on it, this time I made dam sure the Ethernet cable was pulled out
 when to Admin-Tools -&gt; Services -&gt; Windows Update and stopped it and disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is defiantly the last update that is causing it to go into the crash loop as now my computer is fine again .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is not a good Idea to disable Windows Update but I have no choice if I want to use my computer more than once before spending an entire day reinstalling windows goodness knows how many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I updated my MB Ram CPU, and it said I needed to reactivate my windows 10 which took ages to do and in the end the Microsoft Support guy had to take over my computer for half and hour to get it to activate, and he said it was some kind of "workaround"
 which sounds like a bodge to me &nbsp;! So could it be something to do with this ? </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I sort it so that this update dosesn't get installed when I turn Windows Update back on ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p>
</p><p>The last update I have installed is "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 (KB3140743)" which was a couple of days ago. March 2016&nbsp;Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I would manually check for updates and download it and install it. Then use restart now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Cumulative Update is just going to auto update. You should be able to get this update installed without what your calling a loop. Better to restart computer because the update process configures during shutdown and then finishes before boot.</p>

    <title>system process leaking handles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eep squared  say:</h3>
<h2>            system process leaking handles</h2>
                    <p>The WinXP system process (ntkrnlpa.exe) handle count increases until the system becomes unstable. I noticed this after using Process Explorer (PE) and noticed the system process had tens of thousands of handles open (one time I even had over a million) and
 saw many were to "non-existent process"es. Closing these 1-by-1 in PE was tedious so I found Process Hacker 2 which can close multiple handles at once but that doesn't address why the handles to non-existent processes and the many other duplicate handles in
 the system process (and other processes) are occurring in the first place.</p>
<p>Also see <a href="http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://processhacker.sourceforge.net/forums/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=559</a> for more info on another forum I posted this to (with no help).</p>
<p>Any ideas? Thanks.</p>

    <title>Desktop sticky notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larbac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop sticky notes</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am looking for a way to get my notes in my desktop at all times. I currently use MS Sticky Notes because that seems to be the only application that will allow me to stick notes into my laptop background but I would rather use another tool that allows more
 collaboration and availability in other means like a mobile device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use MS to-do, which does a great job sync into my MS Outlook. But I can't seem to get the to-do lists in the desktop background.</p>
<p>I also use MS OneNote for the project and more extensive notes. I could use this, but again I fail to see how I can "stick" it into the background.</p>
<p>More recently I thought about use MS Planner alone or via MS Teams boards to create buckets of things... Again don't mind using it but I don't know how I would get these into my background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with a similar challenge and has the answer?</p>

<p>Sticky notes were designed to be temporary reminders. They're the wrong tool for what you want to do. You're on the right track with OneNote or a 'to-do' app or
<a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Trello</a> and it's competitiors, and you can collaborate with all of them. (You can also collaborate with Google Docs - collaboration is built in!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, the desktop isn't supposed to be a place for storing information, which is why the contents of the desktop can possibly be erased by a backup. You don't want to lose your notes!</p>

<p>Hi thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the key thing here is to display in the desktop not store in the desktop repository.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sticky notes store and run content somewhere, yet they pop-up at startup and stay in the background. This is the key functionality i am trying to achieve.</p>

<p>Hi there, I'm from the Sticky Notes team. If you sign in to sync your notes, you can get your sticky notes on your mobile device through one of our integrations: Microsoft OneNote (for Android Phone &amp; iPhone), Microsoft Launcher (Android), and our web portal
 (<a href="https://www.onenote.com/stickynotes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.onenote.com/stickynotes</a>). If you have an Android phone, Launcher allows you to pin the note list to your homescreen which it sounds like you are looking for. Happy noting!</p>

<p>hello,</p>
<p>thank for your comments. interesting to see that it seems like stickynotes is under Onenote product. I know about the sync functionality. Do you know if it is possible to flag as tasks topics within stickynotes like we flag an item in Onenote?</p>
<p>This would be ideal, because it would, in turn, create a task in Outlook tasks, which in turn will show up in MS To-Do.</p>

<h2>            Not sure if I need to re-activate or not - something is messed up</h2>
                    I'm so confused.... my Windows 7-64 ultimate is acting up.&nbsp; A half hour or so after an involuntary restart, I saw a pop-up in the system tray that I will have to activate Windows within 3 days because windows detected some hardware change. &nbsp; The only "hardware"
 change is a USB bluetooth "dongle" that came with my fitbit fitness tracker that I installed 3 days ago.&nbsp; What does that have to do with Windows activation ????<br />
<br />
Some recent history and details....I noticed the fitbit software had two pieces -- a desktop client and a service.&nbsp; I dislike excess processes so I was closing the desktop client piece and only opening it when I wanted to sync the fitbit.&nbsp; All seemed fine.&nbsp;
 But yesterday, I did not close the desktop client.&nbsp; I hibernated (as always - big fan of hibernation).&nbsp;&nbsp; But shortly after it came up from hibernation it crashed and restarted. &nbsp; This morning it came back from hibernation okay, but when I came home from work
 it did not.&nbsp; It started but then crashed and restarted and then I saw the Windows Activation popup.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hibernated again this evening and when I came home, it said "sorry, can't come back from hibernation... you will lose what you didn't save.&nbsp; press enter
 to continue".&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My Control Panel System page says Windows is activated.&nbsp;&nbsp; (BTW, is the Product ID that shows right beneath that the product key for reactivation if necessary?)<br />
<br />
Event viewer had nothing recent interesting in it.&nbsp; I did see some errors that look like they need addressing, but they've been there for several months.<br />
<br />
I've contacted fitbit support but that seems like a black hole.&nbsp; I am afraid there is not much support there<br />
<br />
HELP!!!<br />

            To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please also state the Version and Edition of Windows quoted on your COA sticker (if you have one) on the case of your machine (or inside the battery compartment), but do NOT quote the Key on the sticker!<br />

            <p>Re-activation due to hardware changes can be cumulative i.e. a series of changes can not require re-activation then on more even minor one can tip it over into needing it. This is quite logical or you could gradually migrate a system over to a completely
 new system by making one change at a time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that I didn't think that a USB device was included in the hardware profile so shouldn't be that final straw to force a re-activation. This rather indicates that something else is going on besides the fitbit issue. The fact remains that you are
 in a grace period at the moment and without knowing why it has kicked in it is difficult to say what will happen when it expires.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The licensing system analyses numerous files for tampering as these are known to be altered with various "hacks" to bypass registration. I am not suggesting this is what you have tried to do, there are several examples of other causes the best known being
 corruptions in the Intel Rapid Storage driver although these most don't give a grace period but go straight into "illegal" mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noel is the "star" on this subject so do as he suggests and let him look at the results and give some guidance on where your problem lies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the Product ID question, no this not what you need. What they want is your encrypted 5x5 character key. This is the value on the Yellow COA label somewhere on the PC if provided with the computer or in the box if a retail pack. If the Windows is OEM
 the MGADiag report will probably show the last 3 5 character block different to what is on the label due to the way in which system manufacturers pre license Windows. If you have upgraded to Windows Ultimate then it will be the key you were provided for the
 upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this at least partly answers your actual question and shows that somebody has read it.</p>

            Thank you both.&nbsp; THis is great.&nbsp; this is what I was looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I see the "why" hardware changes&nbsp; may affect activation.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Some other info/questions now that I am becoming informed:<br />
<br />
The PC was OEM Windows Home Premium (2009) but I upgraded to Retail Ultimate.&nbsp; Hopefully, I saved the Ultimate key somewhere.<br />
<br />
fwiw, 2 months ago I replaced the video card.<br />
<br />
When I first saw the fitbit installation screen, I didn't like the warning "please close all applications as some system files may be replaced" (or something like that).&nbsp; That was a red flag and seemed really old school (dualing msvc dll's like in the 80s/90's).&nbsp;
 I inquired about that before installation but got nothing back and installed anyhow the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have since looked at date-time stamps in windows\system32 but nothing stuck out.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also, can I believe the "Windows is Activated" message on the System info page?&nbsp; Or is that not relevant to the current pending requirement of re-activation?<br />
<br />
I will get that download tool and run it and report back tonight..<br />
<br />
I was also thinking a forced Windows Update may be a good idea -- or not?<br />
<br />
Also, I haven't seen the activation pop-up again since I disabled the (persistently running) FitBit desktop client piece.&nbsp; I have restarted and hibernated and awoke several times and no more warnings or errors.&nbsp; THe FitBit background service seems to be totally
 sufficient for the bluetooth syncing it is doing.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />

            That tool was pretty quick... here are the results.&nbsp; What is rearm count?&nbsp; I once had an issue when Dell had to replace the motherboard right after purchase (they even came to my house to do it -- that was so great!!).&nbsp; I recall that screwed up some stuff
 but details are sketchy now.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the authentication system is not behaving as it should it is difficult to say&nbsp;what&nbsp;would happen, in normal cases if it needs activation it should say ""X" number of days to Activate" or something like that&nbsp;when in the grace period. No software can produce
 these symptoms when active yet revert to normal when not active, once a key file is corrupt it is corrupt.</p>

            <p>MJB and the MGADiag report *will* have the same Key - as that is stored in the registry in encrypted form, and both programs use the same extraction algorithm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is whether that Key is the same as the one you have on a Proof of License label, or an email from MS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Key showing in the report&nbsp; appears to be properly activated, but hasn't been validated fully - to do that, go to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate</a> using Internet Explorer, and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>If/when it passes, you'll be offered IE 9/10 and MSE (I haven't tested since IE10 was released&lt;g&gt;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your hibernation problems are unlikely to be connected to the non-genuine notification problem - which is almost certainly the result of a race condition where two or more programs compete for resources. If one of those programs is the Software Protection
 Service, and it doesn't gain access within a certain time, it will flag he system as non-genuine. A reboot will often correct the notification.</p>

<p><span>Hi Esteban,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>My name is Benjamin, one of the Senior Technicians here in Microsoft. First of all, I would like to apologize if you're still having issues with the Windows
 updates, please accept my sincerest apologies. I really do appreciate your feedback about the support provided to you by Jenefer on your last contact. That's correct Esteban, we are encountering alot of Windows Updates Issues on a daily basis and here on our
 end we can only do so much since we don't have any means of access the Windows Update Servers but don't worry I will pass this to the developers, administrators and programmers so that they could be able to devised a permanent fix for it. Since the Windows
 update build 1511 is a major update Microsoft did the wait list or a queuing process for our customers can be able to download the said update, I will still ask for your patience and once your computer is ready to get the update it will automatically download
 it for you.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for choosing Answer Desk. We're here when you need us.
<span><span>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year as well!</span></span></span></p>

</p><p><span>My last contact, today:</span></p>
<p>Benjamin, Jenefer &nbsp;or Microsoft&nbsp;Support:</p>
<p>Your ask me to be patient on December 2015. Two months later I'm still receiving the message "There were problems downloading some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this, try searching the web or contacting support for help. This error
 code might help: (0x8024a105)"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How long more I need to wait for Microsoft to solve this issue?</p>
<p>Please advise me,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is relatively straight forward since you are using and will be using WLM.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>
<p><span>You will need to copy a folder from where it is (the old installation) to another spot where you know it will be (for example to your desktop)</span><br />
<br />
<span>The folder is in c:\users\your user name\app data (if it is not there see the note below)\local\microsoft\</span><br />
<br />
<span>At that point you will see a folder called oddly enough "windows live mail"&nbsp; Copy it to your desktop</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you cant see app data it is because it is invisible atm.&nbsp; To make it visible you will need to go into your control panel&gt;folder options&gt;view&gt;Change to show hidden folders (see snip)</span><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b96f2f8a-bacb-45c5-80e2-e816b665594c" /><br />
</p>
<p>Once you have the mail safeguarded on your desktop (or where ever) drag the folder from the desktop to the location for the new WLM (again it should be C;\.... just like above).&nbsp; Just make sure WLM is not running at the time.&nbsp; What wont be imported is the
 passwords and rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The accounts and data should now be in the new WLM when you open it.</p>
