            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model # of your USB Modem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All USB modems require a software driver to be installed, as opposed to most other USB devices which don't. Go to the manufacturers support/download drivers site and type in the make and model# and download the driver for your model do not install it.
</p>
<p>Then go to Start/Run and type devmgmt.msc and press enter. In the Device Manager, Right click the device with the yellow flag and Uninstall. Run the driver software and it should find the device.</p>

            <p>Hello Habib,</p>
<p>
It helps you to identify if the Bluetooth driver has issues on Windows 10 and quick solve the driver issues:
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Scan the hardware and devices to find out the driver problems.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Fix the corrupted, damaged, or incompatible Bluetooth driver.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Update to the latest Bluetooth driver for Windows 10.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Download and install the best-matched driver in Windows 10.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>As Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in developmental stage, you may expect some compatibility issues as of now and some features or settings might not work as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Plug in the hardware device and run the hardware troubleshooter. Once this is done, restart the computer to check if this helps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press “Windows key + X” to click on “Control Panel”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on “Troubleshooting” and click on “View all”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on “Hardware and Devices” to run the troubleshooter. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if this helps.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Install all pending Windows Updates and restart the computer to check if this helps. As this new version of Windows is still in developmental stage, ensure to keep the computer up to date with all Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

            <p>This is an old trick that I haven't had to use since XP days (that I can remember): uninstall device drivers. &nbsp;In my case I had this error when installing a Bluetooth USB dongle on an Intel PC. &nbsp;I had tried to use a Bluetooth mouse without installing the
 CSR 4.0 driver, figuring that something this popular would be covered in MS standard drivers. &nbsp;WIN 7 installed drivers but the mouse and BT speakers failed to pair. Installing the CSR 4.0 driver afterward failed. &nbsp;Your post led me back to the solution of uninstalling
 conflicting drivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In WIN XP I often used regedit&nbsp;or other registry editor to search and delete (after backing up/exporting), drivers manually. &nbsp;That usually forced a reinstall of drivers upon reboot or re-attachment. &nbsp;The logic of doing that is that WIN is designed to arbitrate
 driver installation better on fresh install than on overlay install of new devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems go back to how WINTEL is designed IMO - layer up from embedded drivers within many/most component devices vs. BORG Empire compilation into the monster OS.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows.old Folder not removing itself again</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading with the Windows 10 Creators update, I waited 10 days for the Windows.old file to remove itself. Of course it did not so I went into the Store (Settings) and removed it from there. No problem and a whopping 9 Gigs saved on the SSD. I actually
 thought it would be more but that's ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I notice in File Explorer, that once again the Windows.old directory is still there, showing 0 contents. My question ... is is safe to manually delete that thing. Back a year or two ago, I did that and my system wouldn't reboot. If I remember correctly,
 back in the Spring Update, I removed it manually. Someone let me know if it is still safe to remove it manually or will I be doing something that is going to send this computer flying.&nbsp;</p>

            the Disk Clean utility is supposed to do that. Start it using Run As Admin
<br />
<br />If you want to do a general cleanup you can use the built in diskclean tool. Here are a couple of articles on using the tool
<br /><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-clean-up-system-files-with-the-windows-10-disk-cleanup-tool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-clea...</a>

<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can try the manual method again:
<br />
<br />DELETE WINDOWS.OLD AND $WINDOWS.~BT FOLDERS AFTER WINDOWS UPGRADE
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2066-delete-windows-old-folder-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2066-delete...</a>  
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/delete-windows-old-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/dele...</a> 
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />When you upgrade your current version of Windows to a newer version, the upgrade process will create backups of important directories from your previous version of Windows. These directories include your user profiles, Windows folder, Program Files directory, and other important locations. These backups are then stored in two folders called Windows.old and $Windows.~BT, which can be used after the upgrade to recover any data that may not have been properly migrated over to the new version of Windows.
<br />
<br />Before deleting the backups of your old Windows folders, please make sure that you have all of your data migrated to the new version of Windows. Unless you have created a backup, these folders will be permanently deleted from your computer.
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />
<br />If nothing works, leave it alone. You say it is empty. Next time the system needs it use it either it will be used as is, or the system (will try, maybe fail) rename it and create a new one.

<h3> ingameinstincts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hitman Absolution Contract Mode</h2>
                    
<p>[quote]The developers at IO Interactive are including a brand new challenge mode in Agent 47's newest adventure.</p>
<p>In Contract mode, players will be able to create custom challenges for other Hitman players to try and complete. Unlike similar features in other games, this mode will not require the player to learn to use an editor or any extra creation tools. Simply select
 the level, the targets, and the weapons players are allowed to use, then fine tune the circumstances of the contract in areas such as witnesses to the hit and time limit.</p>
<p>Players who create contracts will be able to upload them for their friends to try and complete at any time. After players successfully complete a contract, they will be rewarded a special currency which can be spent on weapons and upgrades to make even more
 elaborate contracts. Contract dollars can also be earned by playing through the Hitman: Absolution single-player campaign.</p>
<p>The new contract mode will be available with several preloaded contracts when the game releases on November 20, 2012, for the XBox 360, PS3, and PC.[/quote]<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds good looking forward to complete some contracts.<br />

<h3> spladlesrus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 Pro not allowing access to Pro features.</h2>
                    <p>I ordered an HP Omen which came pre-installed with Windows 10 Home. I was sold a copy of Windows 10 Pro to install on the machine. However every time I try to install the new OS, it just re-installs Windows 10 Home. I've called Microsoft Support and they
 have already confirmed the functionality of the key I have. </p>
<p>In order to get to Pro, I activated the Default Key, and then once I had finished the Upgrade I activated the Key I have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I put in the disk to re-install the Pro OS, it just Installs Windows 10 Home. Then I perform the above steps and nothing changes.</p>
<p>Any plug in I try to activate that comes with Pro, says that it is not the correct version of the OS for the plugin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run out of ideas at this point, and need an assist here. MS wants to charge me $500 to fix the OS whenever it didn't work to begin with. Any thoughts?</p>

            <p>I've done this already, and like I said above I have 'upgraded to pro'. However the plugins still are not working properly. However this isn't the main issue. If I can get the built in 'administrator' account to work properly I will be ok. It isn't being
 given the proper permissions. &nbsp;I'm trying to install Malwarebytes Managed package under this account but it is still saying that it isn't the admin account.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/824dc363-94ad-4828-8f99-324dfd73dd94" title="chadydaher">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the migration of Skype to Microsoft, we need to follow Microsoft's account recovery process. That means, we will be going to the Microsoft password reset page when you're trying to reset your password. If you tried going to the password reset page
 while you're signed into your Microsoft account, it will not give you the password reset page, but it will sign you into your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you will be seeing the password reset page and reset your Skype account's password, please open a private browser or another browser when performing the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">Click here</span></strong></a>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;the Skype name of the account you are trying to recover, and hit
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Look for
<strong>Reset password</strong> button and click it. </span></li><li><span>You will be routed to Microsoft's website for password reset.
</span></li><li><span>Click any radio button, and hit
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the "<strong>Recover your account</strong>" page, please make sure that the Skype name of the account you are trying to recover is listed on the first box.</span></li><li><span>Type the characters (CAPTCHA) shown into the second textbox and click Next.</span></li><li><span>Verify&nbsp;the account.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Regarding your concern about account cancellation,&nbsp;we need to link the Skype account to a Microsoft account before we can proceed deleting it. And if you linked the Skype&nbsp;account to your e-mail address, we cannot unlink them, which makes
 it not possible to delete the Skype account without deleting the Microsoft e-mail address attached to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hi i bought it in Washington Square, and just returned it yesterday in a store in Portland. I got a new one, exactly the same model and it still cant stand more than 3hours of battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have updated everything there is to update, on both computers, and only been browsing and watching youtube.</p>
<p>You guys are claming up to 9hours on the website on the i7 model. It's clearly impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, 2hours for a laptop is not normal....on 2 different computers. What should I do?</p>

            <p>Battery life depends on how you are using your Surface Pro 4. This includes the software and applications you are using. Also, connecting to the internet using WiFi can affect the battery life. You know how to make the battery life lasts longer, you can

            <p>I have been testing for 2 intensive days my second computer, i didnt install any software except Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maximum i had is 4hours of battery. Usually closer to 3 only using Chrome browser and watching youtube videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Claiming up to 9 hours seems quite a joke.</p>
<p>I cant believe it's because of wifi or my screen brightness, its a 2000USD computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The claim of 9hours might be with i5 and 4GB ram... Impossible with I7....no way.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing the same thing for the past year. I have literally been back and forth with the Customer Service Center and I have sent it back 6 times already. They promised extra care when picking the replacement unit, still got a faulty one.
 The longest battery life I could ever get was 3hrs. But it means over tweaking the system and basically deactivating most of the features I bought the Surface Pro in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forget about the updates, firmwares, Anniversary and Creator updates, nothing works. That's just bad hardware. There is a reason why a new Surface Pro is being released...</p>
<p>The battery life is even poorer than the Surface Pro 3. Didn't get much help from anyone or anything Microsoft, I literally threw 2000USD out the window, since I can't even get a decent price on eBay.</p>
<p>Big mistake, but lessons learned</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Edition 1607 Will Not Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex134  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Edition 1607 Will Not Install</h2>
                    <p>I've been fighting with this computer to install this update for a long while now. I'm getting seriously fed up, but I am much further along than I was.</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 11 laptop running Windows 10 (from the factory) and I am having trouble updating it to version 1607. It is currently running the original Windows 10 that it was shipped with. I have NOT gotten the 1511 update, and I cannot do that
 since the Windows Update Catalog link to manually install the update doesn't work.</p>
<p>Windows Update shows that it is installing 1607, and it will go through the process as it should. I am using a USB flash drive to add space for the upgrade since the computer only has 32gb flash memory and no space at all to install this without the flash
 drive. Before anyone wastes their time suggesting I make more space, don't bother. It's absolutely impossible for me to make any more space on this computer. I have maybe 2gb of free space, and I have nothing installed other than Google Chrome and Ccleaner
 along with the factory software and drivers. I don't have any documents, pictures, or anything on the laptop. There is no other partition. Making more space on the SSD is not an option.</p>
<p>That being said, the computer goes through the update process like it should in the beginning. Once the computer restarts, it shows the update screen and restarts itself. When it gets to the screen that says something along the lines of "Windows is upgrading...
 this will take a while..." it just sticks on 0%. I have tried 3 times so far, and it will stay on 0% for literally hours.</p>
<p>What I found interesting is that if I remove the flash drive, it will get up to 4%, but then it will restart and tell me to replace the flash drive. It then proceeds to restore the previous version of Windows 10 and bring me back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read to use the Windows tool, but that doesn't work because I need 8gb on the computer. I was thinking about downloading the ISO for 1607 and installing it with the flash drive, but I don't want to have to recover all of the drivers and factory software.
 I don't have a million high capacity flash drives laying around to spread a recovery drive and extra installation space over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is how can I install this update completely without removing my data? It's driving me nuts, and I would like to just get this done so I don't have to worry about it anymore.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Error 1935&#34; when trying to install older Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; Redistributable Packages</h2>
                    <p>I have recently done a fresh install of Windows 10. Since then, I have not been able to install older C++ Redistributable Packages when installing 3rd party apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error word by word says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error 1935.An error occurred during the installation of assembly 'Microsoft.VC90.CRT,version="9.0.30729.6161",publicKeyToken="1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b",processorArchitecture="amd64",type="win32"'. Please refer to Help and Support for more information. HRESULT: 0x80073712</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed the "0x80073712" error pop up when trying to install a windows update after it errors out. I have a good feeling that the error "0x80073712" is somehow linked together. I think if I figure out how to fix that error, I will be able to
 fix install older C++ Redistributable Packages and do windows update installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured for answers on many forums on this topic and didn't find any solution. I have already tried the "sfc /scannow" command and came back with no errors. I have also ran the DISM.exe scanhealth and restorehealth commands in the command prompt with
 no luck. I have even tried to do a PC reset. &nbsp;Any other feedback would be great. I would hate to revert back to Windows 7 again.</p>

            I appreciate the feedback that you gave me, but I have found a solution to my issues. I've downloaded Windows 10 Media Creation Tool and put it inside a USB. Then I opened it from the USB, had it run through the process, and now I'm able to do Windows
 Updates and install older C++ packages from 3rd party apps. Thanks anyways!

<h2>            Touchpad stopped working after clean boot</h2>
                    <p>I clean booted my laptop today, following the steps given on http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135. After the first restart in clean boot, the touchpad scroll-bar of my laptop stopped working. I can now scroll using only the arrow keys, or discrete mouse
 clicks on the arrows at the end of a scroll-bar on the screen. Also, I cannot select any text using my touchpad now. All of this happened after the clean-boot process. What has gone wrong? How to fix it?<br />

    <title>Windows Installer will not stop&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles linquist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer will not stop&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Windows installer pops up and keeps trying to load Adobe Acrobat from a location that no longer exists.&nbsp; I'm running WIN10/32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into SERVICES and set Windows Installer to MANUAL, but I still get the pop-up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to re-register Windows Installer, I am told to use an elevated CMD prompt, but when I type CMD in the window and right-click "run as Administrator", the Windows Installer starts and the computer freezes.&nbsp; The installer says it is looking for ACRO32.msi,
 and asks me to pick the file location.&nbsp; But I don't have ACRO32.msi on my computer.&nbsp; If I pick another *.msi file (one that DOES exist on my computer),&nbsp; I'm told that "that file does not contain Adobe Acrobat install files" and hangs.&nbsp; If I go into TASK MANAGER
 and try to stop the installer, it does NOT kill it.&nbsp; I actually do not want to install Acrobat on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that point, I have to re-boot and hope that the installer doesn't start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Hi Charles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A software conflict might be causing this problem with your Windows Installer. Please execute the following commands to
<span>unregister and&nbsp;</span><span>re-register</span><span> Windows Installer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span></strong>, type&nbsp;<strong><span>cmd</span></strong>, right-click and select
<strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type the following commands and hit Enter after each command:</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; msiexec /unreg</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><strong><span>msiexec /regserver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; 3. Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once your computer is up, please observe if you still encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Got it, Charles. Since you're unable to do anything when you're trying to open the command prompt and run it as administrator, then I would suggest that you perform a clean boot to start Windows using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs to help
 eliminate software conflicts. On this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, please look for
<strong>Use the following steps to perform a clean boot</strong> on <em>How to perform a clean boot</em> and follow the steps intended for Windows 10. Make sure that to
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hide all Microsoft services</span></em> first before disabling all other services.<br />
</p>
<p>By the way, have made any changes on your computer or maybe installed some updates or programs prior to the issue? If you do, what were those changes and updates or programs installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update us on how it goes so we can further assist you.</p>

    <title>Password issue with Easy Transfer from Windows 7 to Windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gameface6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password issue with Easy Transfer from Windows 7 to Windows 7.</h2>
                    I transferred data from 1 admin&nbsp;account and 2 user accounts with Easy Transfer.&nbsp; The admin account opened with no problem.&nbsp; The user accounts will not allow me to access the transferred data until I use the original passord.&nbsp; Even using the original passwords
 for both accounts, I get the "incorrect password" message.&nbsp; I have deleted the accounts and re-transferred them with new passwords that I changed on the old computer, but nothing has allowed me to open them.&nbsp; Any suggestions? Thanks

<p><span>Hi gameface6,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The password which Windows Easy Transfer (WET) asks for is not the Windows login password. It’s a special key called the Windows Easy Transfer
 key which acts like a password to help protect files and settings when you transfer them over the network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A WET key is presented to you during the transfer (see screenshot below). The same key has to be used when you’re transferring files and settings
 using WET on the other computer. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Games freezing and or lagging</h2>
                    <p>Skyrim and Fallout 4 keep lagging while playing.&nbsp; Skyrim will play fine for about 20 minutes and then will consistently lag about every few second and the start working after a minute.&nbsp; I have an Xbox one x that I bought last month. Fallout 4 will freeze completely and I have to shut the system down, pull the power cord and push the power button several times to&nbsp;get it to work. Fallout will work fine for about an hour and then freeze again. I have not tried the other games yet. These problems started last week when both games updated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Typically this would be due to a sticking "2" key, but you appear to have already tried the obvious swapping of the keyboard itself to attempt to confirm whether it was causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try completely disconnecting the physical keyboard and use the On-Screen Keyboard instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10762/windows-use-on-screen-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type - Windows Help</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That document tells you how to access the OSK from the Windows 10&nbsp;sign-in screen if you need to type a password as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open the OSK from the sign-in screen, select the<strong> Ease of Access </strong>
button in the lower-right corner of the sign-in screen, and then select <strong>On-Screen Keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access the OSK once logged into Windows 10&nbsp;with only your mouse:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Start</strong> , then select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Ease of Access </strong>&gt; <strong>Keyboard</strong>, and then move the slider under On-Screen Keyboard. A keyboard appears on the screen that can be used to move around the screen and enter text. The keyboard will remain on the screen until you close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the On-Screen Keyboard works OK, then your problem is with either the keyboard, the motherboard&nbsp;computer hardware that accepts input from it or possibly the keyboard driver software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the OSK doesn't work either, then the problem may be something damaged in either the drivers or more likely Windows itself, at which point the original cause doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way you'd likely recover from such damage is a complete reinstallation of Windows 10, which should wipe out whatever software damage has occurred along with everything else contained in the existing copy of Windows, including any malware or other
 corruption.</p>

<p>The on screen KB worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used all the USB ports available and just borrowed the third KB and it was ok for a bit but started running 22222222222's again and some occasional 3333's as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the drives have been formatted and Windows 10 reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a friend that has a PS2 KB I might try as well.</p>
<p>All my KB's are plug and play, so drivers are not the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to take it into service b/c it only happens occasionally and Murphy's Law dictates it won't happen while it's sitting there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posed this same question on the MSI forum (the MB installed) and they doubted it would be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm certainly no teck whiz and asking if a virus may exist in the bios somewhere?</p>

            Hi Michael,<br />
<br />
Reinstalling Windows 10 completely should have eliminated any software issues as you have started from scratch. We would like to verify though, did this issue reoccur right after reinstalling Windows or have you installed any programs before the issue resurfaced?
 Also have you tried using a PS2 keyboard?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>I'm working on a theory that my additional gaming KB for left hand use only may be the issue as it has dedicated KB assignments available. If I disconnect it, and there are no 22222's that's the culprit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time will tell b/c as I mentioned before it's only happening 20% of the time. A week or so, without the smaller dedicated gaming KB may give me answers. I've also access to a PS2 KB if this test fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for keeping in touch and I'll get back to you as soon as I've got more data to share.</p>

<h2>            What are the pros and cons of upgrading to Windows 10&#63;&#63; ...apart from tracking, that is.</h2>
                    I'm on the fence about upgrading, and that fence just became bigger. I found out it's actually possible to disable telemetry!! Telemetry was my biggest concern because privacy, but that faded away. However, now the choice about upgrading or not is too
 complex now. What are the pros and cons, and which outweighs the other?? P.S. I'm running Windows 8.1 in the time I type this.

            <p>No one can make that decision for you. Everyone uses a computer in their own unique way, so you have to do what's right for
<em>you</em> no matter what anyone else tells you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read about Windows 10, get all the information you need and make your choice. Just because something is new doesn't mean you must have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two over-arching aspects to operating systems: the design and the execution. There's no question that Windows 10 works properly - it's being successfully used by more than 400 million people - but many people have problems with the way it's designed.
 On the other hand, iOS is beautifully designed but many people have problems with the way it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I may be so audacious as to make a suggestion: As you're forming an opinion, you should pay most attention to people who really know the technology well and can speak more-or-less objectively about it. That means avoiding both the fanboys and the haters.
 And apply a grain of salt to folks who are still low on the learning curve. I was low on the learning curve for years, but now I'm ... a little higher.</p>
