<h2>            Unofficial info on party chat problems with Diablo 3</h2>
                    
<p>Sri guys, I had no idea where to post this, as this game is not officially released yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But a friend of mine I play with on a regulary base already has access to the game Diablo 3.</p>
<p>And it looks like there is the same problem with party chat as we experienced during the destiny beta. We just had that problem. He was playing the game and as soon as he undocks the party he had no more voice connection to the party. So we investigated
 a bit more and came to this:</p>
<p>If you first start the game, then join a party and then undock it, there is no talking to put listening to the party chat anymore. If you first join the party and then start the game everything is fine. Just like the problem with destiny.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just want to let you know bout that problem we may face when Diablo 3 will be released next week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forgive me for not being all that educated on the subject, Is this an active beta? Is it open or closed? I would imagine if this is a beta build of the game your concerns would be better posed to the developer.
<a href="https://us.battle.net/support/en/?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">us.battle.net/.../en</a> That should be a good area to start. That is after all the info the devs are looking for when a beta build is released.</p>

<p>Closed beta nvm answered my own question lol. Have your friend offer that feedback to the developers often times they set up a forum or give you a direct link in your email or even on screen of the game itself. Report the issue you and your friend are having
 and they likely will have it sorted for release.</p>

<p>This is the retail version which will be released officially next week. </p>
<p>And that's why I posted it here, because I think there will be questions on this issue with the party chat in the support forums here. And I am also not sure that it is a game related problem but maybe also a party issue.

<p>Im kind of confused as to how your friend gained access to an advanced copy of the game? If it was acquired through illegitimate means then, yes I would suspect there to be a multitude of &nbsp;issues with it. There was a closed beta of the game and if this bug
 was present then I'm sure the developer did their best to rectify the issue. If the party chat was at fault, then blizzard most likely got with microsoft and they worked through a resolution together. Thanks for the post I will keep it in mind in case the
 issue isn't resolved and people ask.</p>

<p>My friend and I ran into this problem today. Both purchased new copies of the game. We weren't able to use the party chat not even chat in game.</p>
<p>Major error on their part. Need a fix soon.</p>

<p>Aye ok. So no fix with the day one patch. Was not able to check that yesterday by myself.
</p>
<p>Have you tried the workaround? First start the party, let your friend join, have the party undocked and the start the game? That's the same like with the destiny beta.
</p>
<p>This worked for us. </p>

<p>That indeed is a heck of an oversight, surely the issue was reported during the beta it is surprising no fix was issued. But alas we have a temp solution to offer folks. Thanks again for the heads up Bob.</p>

<h2>            Xbox &#40;Beta&#41; app doesn&#39;t open</h2>
                    Hi, I'm experiencing an issue with the Xbox app. I subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and then installed the app to start playing, but when I try to open it a window appears that says "parameter is incorrect" and there's also a file location in the
 window which brings to Xbox.exe in the folder "WindowsApps". I tried to uninstall and then install again but it didn't work. So, is there anyone who can figure this out?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry not to have answered before but I've sincerely forgotten this question. Anyway, I tried the clean boot, but nothing changed, so the only thing I could do was writing on the Xbox Insider Subreddit. So, I'm here if anyone's got or would get something
 new.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Store Completely Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lans61  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store Completely Missing</h2>
                    <p>So recently (Not sure how long ago) I got&nbsp;Age of Empires: Definitive Edition on the Microsoft store and was enjoying it a lot but after sometime the game would no longer sign me into my xbox live from there I thought there was a problem with my game and
 decided to uninstall it only to open the store and find out it wouldn't connect anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there I tried several windows app fixes to no success until one day my laptop blue screen and proceeded to tell me that the files for the store no longer existed, from there I tried to repair, reinstall and lastly remove and install it and sadly it
 just is completely gone and not even the pre-installed apps powershell file fixed it so now I no longer have a store and am at a lose of what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record there are no files, folders, or anything relating to on my computer anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am grateful for any help.</p>

            You can use the Windows media creation tool to create a USB and install Windows 10. You can download the tool with the link below: Just make sure you have logged into a Microsoft account and link your digital license to the laptop first otherwise the license will not transfer.

<h2>            Why I am losing faith in MS and have none for the Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Okay everyone this is going to be a rant about how are we supposed to trust MS with the Xbox One when they cant even get a simple app like youtube to run properly on their current console?&nbsp; The quality of my youtube app experience has been real crap lately
 constant buffering, console freezings, video speed ups without sound etc.&nbsp; Now if MS cant tackle something as easy as THEIR youtube app what hope is there for the future of the xbox one in all honesty</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Every day</span> for some years now, when I open MS Edge, I have to resize and relocate it on my screen to suit my needs - I have probably done this over one thousand five hundred times now!!!&nbsp; Edge NEVER EVER saves
 its last size and position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I needed to view two spreadsheets in MS Excel at the same time, so I selected View, Arrange All and Horizontal. This resulted in two small letterbox windows, one above the other - as intended.&nbsp; Before closing these documents, I maximised each
 of them and saved them.&nbsp; Since then, every time I open a spreadsheet it opens in that same small letter box shape, so I have to maximise them each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when opening multiple spreadsheets, they are presented in cascade layout.&nbsp; This results in me always having to drag the cascaded documents back up so that I can utilise that document's bottom bar functionality - eg. tabs, size etc, as well as the left
 side of the spreadsheet.&nbsp; I want multiple spreadsheets to not be cascaded, but simply overlaid like pages in a book.&nbsp; This way, each spreadsheet's left hand side and bottom bar is fully available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr Microsoft, providing users with sensible layouts for multiple spreadsheets and remembering last window sizes and positions is basic functionality that existed in earlier versions of your products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr Microsoft, these problems have existed for some years now, and you have been made aware of them from many users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Mr Microsoft, can you tell me when you will fix these deficiencies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I wish I could go back to Windows 7!!!</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might be caused by system conflict. For us to know more, please answer the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Can you provide us the current version of Windows that you are using? Follow the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to get the exact Windows version.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we suggest following the methods below to help us identify the main cause of the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Starting your PC in safe mode. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe mode</a></strong> starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers.</span> It will help us

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check the system health by running the following commands in the command prompt:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</li><li>dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth</li><li>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s go ahead and try to repair any damage in the system files by running the command:
<em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em>. Restart your PC and use the<strong> <em>sfc /scannow</em>
</strong>again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once done, we suggest checking if there will be any changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get back to us and keep us updated.</p>

<p>Hi My Dell Inspiron 1545 (opened) suffered a blow to the plastic case obove where the internal hard drive sits. It crashed and after rebbooting "no hard drive is detected". I removed and opened the hard drive to see one of the two tracking arm heads was
 incorrectly parked. I assume the shock to the case disloged and caused the disk sensor/feeler thing to park over the top of the stall instead of in the correct position=bent arm...bad hard drive.</p>
<p>So I buy a new hard drive install it and it says "no hard drive detected"...I do all kinds of trick and stuff but find no remedy.</p>
<p>So I return the new hard drive to Best Buy and exchange for another. Install it and it says "no hard drive detected".</p>
<p>The operating system will partially load but eventually cant find a driver and requests that I "Use OEM Utility and Driver Install Disk" but it cant find what ever it is looking for their either...but that doesnt really matter because it simply does not
 see the hard drive...</p>
<p>Looking for answers to your/my error code "4400:011A" and&nbsp;"Msg:&nbsp;SCSI_0-000_DISK_GENERIC-_MULTI-CARD - Target not ready" and/or on boot "no hard drive detected"</p>

            I have my sisters inspiron 1545 as her kids got a virus on it so i formatted the system to kill the virus which worked but now when i try to install Vista it goes through the install right to the finalizing installation window then stays on it for about
 an hour then restarts and goes to a black screen with a mouse pointer and stays there. This is seriously annoying me. If any1 has any idea then your help would be greatly appreciated thanks peeps

    <title>Just upgraded to Windows 10 - now the cursor starts jumping around - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> auweia123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Just upgraded to Windows 10 - now the cursor starts jumping around randomly on occasion</h2>
                    <p>I've seen this issue discussed for Win 7, 8, and Vista, but nothing yet for Win 10 - &nbsp;apologies if this has been asked before. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I updated to Win 10 my Lenovo Yoga 3 last night, seemingly without a hitch. &nbsp;I then proceeded to do the usual web browsing, etc., and all was fine for about 30 minutes until the cursor started randomly moving on its own, jumping from the box I was typing
 in to some other location. &nbsp;I restarted, and everything was working fine for another hour, and then it happened again! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same story again today - laptop will behave totally fine for a while and then the jumping begins. &nbsp;It's like this &nbsp;game where you have to race the cursor to hit restart before it randomly clicks on say, Cortana, 10 times. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to fix? &nbsp;Playing the restart game several times a day is not really an option for me. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;now that I look again, the cursor seems to mostly jump to the Cortana box. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: &nbsp;Disabled the Cortana/search box and that has completely fixed the issue! &nbsp;Perhaps Microsoft can push out a working version of the search bar next go-around. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi guys.I am having a problem with my CPU going to 100%.I reinstalled my whole computer yesterday because it was so slow and i also had this problem so i tought reinstalling might fix it...However when i finally reinstalled it yesterday everything was fine.Cpu
 was very fine.I only installed Google Chrome and League of Legends.League of legends ran smoothly without any lag spikes.Today when i was playing it cpu got to 100%...FPS in game drops to about 0-6 for maybe 10-15 seconds and then goes back to normal and again
 drops....So i guess reinstalling computer did not help.I really do not know how to fix this i cannot play any game without FPS going to a very low amount which is unplayable.I checked processes in task manager to see who is using much cpu.</p>
<p>50-60%-League of Legends</p>
<p>32%-System Idle Process</p>
<p>Please help me i dont know what to do with this anymore...Im having this trouble for a very long time.Should i install Avira and check for any viruses???Also i tried windows update but it is checking for updates for about 3 hours...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Third is your video card or its driver.</p>
<p>

<p>17.5 hours?!Daaaamn.That is quite alot to wait.Also about the CPU percentage svchost.exe is using 50% and other is system idle process.About the second suspicion i dont think so.It doesnt happen just to LoL,i also tried to play other games as well,and same
 result-CPU percentage is 100%.Video card,well my computer specs are bad so it might be i dont know.But my question is:</p>
<p>I played LoL yesterday.Everything ran smootly.No lags or anything.And then suddenly,next day,everything is slow.</p>
<p>Anyways,i hope its WU.Thank you :)</p>

            <p>That is exactly the way WU works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you also set your WU setting to NEVER.&nbsp; That does not mean you should never update.&nbsp; It just means you take control of the WU process and do it when you are ready for it.&nbsp; All of my client computers are set that way to prevent Win10 take over.&nbsp;
 I advise them to manually start WU once per month and then reject all non-security Windows updates.</p>

            Windows update is not complete yet.&nbsp; A lot of the work takes place after the restart.&nbsp; Wait it out.&nbsp; Then check to see if there are more updates.&nbsp; There may well be another cycle or two to go through.

            <p>I agree with Canadian Tech you are not done with updates and you have a lot more to come.&nbsp; I also agree with waiting it out until you have all the updates needed for install. after everything is up to date and you are still getting the 100% cpu usage I would&nbsp;then
 go and delete Windows 10 updates that I am 100 % positive you have them and they will make your comp cpu usage to be 100% all the time.&nbsp; When you are done with updating I suggest you look for these installed Win 10 updates and remove them to bring your cpu
 usage back to normal.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also another fact to look for is on some machines Microsoft Security Essentials will without a doubt make your comp run hot and will use 100% cpu always and it happened to me thats why I use a different antivirus and I shut down MSE. Hope this works for
 ya and as soon as you are all updated let us know how you make out</p>

            Okay its good now meaning you are up to date with WU?&nbsp; How many updates do you have also meaning you should be about the 211 to 214 mark on updates? If you got rid of the Win 10 updates make sure when you get updates check what updates they are because
 it will try to sneak win 10 updates in there again and on that case you must hide the updates to prevent install.&nbsp; Also when you start your game your cpu will spike to 100% but will return normal after initial start of the program and that's normal.&nbsp; Is that
 whats happening maybe?

                    I'm trying to pin frequently visited websites like LinkedIn to my start screen in Windows 10 (it was easy in Windows 8). All Microsoft "help" pages refer to is pinning "apps".&nbsp; Web pages are not "apps".&nbsp; Can someone provide any advice? thanks.

            <p>Hi Sayan, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine when I first loaded Windows10. However now when I choose Pin to Start (from the ... at top right of Edge screen by the way) it saves a tile on start, but when you click on the tile it goes to this page in Edge</p>
<span>
<p>https://www.bing.com/search?q=htt&amp;FORM=EDGENA </p>
<p>regardless of which Web page I save. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise a fix for this. Thanks </p>

            it appears to be working now, however, the tile can't be made wide or large. And, while it updates the tile like windows 8 if you add the right code on the web page, it only updates the text, no pictures. For example, I created a live tile on this site
 www.TallasseeTV.com that displayed the current post entry photo and title. It worked on 8 but no photo on 10, just text.

                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fully activated, new install of Windows 10 but I am unable to remove store apps and games from the start menu like "Bubble Witch 3 Saga" that came with my device. Whenever I uninstall them, they reappear when I open the start menu again. I also cannot
 change my start menu settings. Is there some way I can fix this?&nbsp;</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The issue is; when I pair a device with my computer using Bluetooth I am no longer able to unpair, or even uninstall the device, and if i try to, somehow windows will just automatically reinstall it
 even if it's not connected. This means that if i connect the device to something other than my computer, I can no longer re-pair it with my computer as it thinks that the device is still paired.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">When I pair the device from the Bluetooth section of control panel, the device will disappear from the control panel Bluetooth menu, and the only way to see that the device is connected is by looking in
 device manager.</span><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Constantly Freezing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was (unfortunately) forced to upgrade to Windows 10 a couple of months ago. Since then, I have been plagued by issues and have had no luck resolving them, even after upgrading 2/3 of the parts in my computer. I clean installed Windows 10 three times now,
 and as soon as I install a driver for my graphics card (NVIDIA GTX 1070), my computer starts acting up. It will freeze completely, causing me to hold down the power button until I restart it. This does not happen in safe mode, and seems to only happen when
 I install certain drivers on my computer.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at my wits end here. I can't get any work done (I require graphics-intensive programs to do so) without the computer freezing within ten seconds of me using these program. I've changed PCI-E power link settings, sleep settings, hibernate settings, replaced
 half of my computer parts (as mentioned), and still having no luck. When I open a game such as Overwatch, it's almost a guaranteed freeze. I've tried rolling back to previous driver versions of my graphics card, but none of them work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any suggestions, please offer them. If you need any more info from me, please let me know. This has been an incredibly frustrating and costly two weeks, and I'm not sure what else I can do to fix the problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have a similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer would be fine until the 1070 came under load, after which it would CTD with a loud fan noise. Monitoring the fans and temps showed that it's not an overheat issue. Absolutely nothing useful in the Event Viewer that I could find (unexpected restart,
 thanks).<br />
<br />
I tried reinstalling the drivers, I tried resinstalling windows, and then the latest drivers. Still CTD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the 1070 and was able to use the default graphics without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ordered a replacement 1070 today, I'll followup on the 7th after it is in place to see of that fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: New card arrived. It did not solve the issue.<br />
<br />
I'm exploring that it could be that the card is fine, but that something else installed is causing a compatibility issue. Maybe a driver for a wifi or sound, or maybe bad ram. I have no solution at this point.<br />
<br />
Disabling the card I can use the onboard graphics, although of a less resolution and graphics quality.<br />
<br />
----<br />
</p>
<p>Another update: Success.<br />
<br />
Using the EVGA Precision OC tool and the MSI Afterburner I was able to underclock the performance of my 1070 and limit it to 90FPS.<br />
<br />
I no longer experience CTD or any other errors. I still don't know if this is a hardware fault or a driver issue, but i am currently unblocked and able to use VR as well as 3D gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last update: Success (again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Underclocking only worked briefly. What eventually turned out to be the issue was lack of power because of the cable used. The 8 pin plug in the card was being fed by a forked adapter cable (supplied with the card) that had 2 6pin adapters, that were in
 turn being fed from the power supply from a single 6-pin plug. Changing to my own 8pin plug that was fed from the power supply via an 8pin plug solved my power issues, and I was able to crank the card up without issues (other than expected fan noise).</p>

<h2>            Windows update error 0x80070057.</h2>
                    <p>OT: TrustedInstaller.exe, wermgr.exe, CBS and it's friends bugging out of my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, people</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo Thinkpad X201 Tablet with a recent Win7 Pro setup straight from my DreamSpark. Okay, I've installed an old Office 2003, 'cause I like it more thant 2007, installed the drivers, Avira, Firefox, et cetera. Well, then it complained about over
 one hundread updates, they were already donwloaded, then I put them on run and went browsing interwebs, meanwhile.
<br />
Later, it complained about needing restart to apply the changes. Okay, so I did. Because of the enormous number of updates, the process took a good amount of time. Nearly a half hour and three reboots later (done by configuration process), it stated "The process
 failed, reverting changes" (not exactly using this words) and took one half of hour more to revert it and get back to Windows.
<br />
<br />
Well, I didn't know, but it somehow corrupted some Windows Update components. Yet, I went on, deleting SoftwareDistribution folder. Finnally, when re-running WU, everything went right, execpt for one infamous update: Internet Explorer 11 (KB ????? -- I coudn't
 retrieve the number). And it fails continuously, even after a complete SoftwareDistribution wipe-out.
<br />
So, I simply marked it out and Windows said me there were no updates (i.e. up-to-date system). Then I get back to my normal day-to-day tasks.
<br />
<br />
However, some hours later, my disk activity went very high, bloating the devil out of my machine. What happened? I've asket myself. Opened ProcessExplorer, turns out that TrustedInstaller were calling "wermgr.exe" in a extremely fast motion. Opened, closed,
 quickly. Checking out PerfMon, I saw it was laying down several dumps like <em>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportQueue\Critical_6.1.7601_9ef5448e375a42bbd442d09b1f208e326839ccaf_cab_01cde361</em>. In fact, ReportQueue folder would make some GB's in
 only few seconds. <br />
<br />
Inside these number identified directories, there are some zipped files and the CBS.log, which appears to be some part of C:\Windows\Log\CBS one, suposed to be relevant to the WER's report. I've took down the process and went reading some of these, turns out
 that they're all the same: <br />

</p><p class="contentStandard">This folder in my D: doesn't exist, for instance, but all extracted CBS.log does report exactly the same failure in the same package "amd64_04b4b0f378105ca6c545fa2a9d6455f1_31bf3856ad364e35". I've nearly memorized this last portion,
 because it's really really recurring (in fact, it's the sole error). <br />
<br />
Well, the only possible way to get out that loop is to kill TrustedInstaller. But it does reopen sometime later and the Dantesque adventure begins again. The Windows Update service is so messed up that it doesn't event come up with new updates.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Things I've already tried: </strong></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Running Windows Updated Diagnostics, obtaining mixed results, but always something like that:
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5f8f98d4-bfaa-4f57-a5e4-92af9e12ed6e" /></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Tried to run System Update Readness Tool (the famous checksur), that installs, after some half hour of waiting and, altought it says it, I bet it won't install correctly, because it's needed to kill TrustedInstaller meanwhile, because
 it would do exactly the same loop as described before. <br />
<br />
However, it generated a Checksur.log as follows: </p>
<p class="contentStandard"><a href="http://pastebin.com/jiV5qgwh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Checksur.log resulting from Readness Tool.">http://pastebin.com/jiV5qgwh</a></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I've already googled up so much trying to figure out what this "Missing Winning Component Key" does mean, but no luck. May be the people outta here could help me better than my Google skills, now. For now, the TrustedInstaller process
 is suspened, while I'm in wait for possible solutions. <br />
<br />
Cheers, <br />
Thanks, <br />

Thanks for the fast reply. I forgot to mention that I've already tried to run SFC. Yet, I've ran chkdsk and, then, SFC, again. Both completing without any problems, i.e. clear system.

<em>Note: </em>There are, indeed, some HDD errors and TrustedInstaller crashes, but ther first refer to an external IDE drive that I was backup'ing, so Ignore then. Some of the last sort were caused by manual killing TrustedInstaller.

            <p>Well, I haven't ran it, yet. <br />
<br />
I've downloaded a trial Windows Server version to test out if it ran nicely in my tablet (I'm a C# developer). However, the way it wasted some tablet's gold resource, I've installed Debian Linux, ran dd to write a snapshot of main system unit to the former
 Win7 (I'm using it, now).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I booted into the system, it had two updates pending (IE 11 and some kind of Windows 7's WGA). My first reaction were put them to install (as I reverted the entire filesystem to an old version). Well, the problem came back, so I've simply restored the
 system to an early point. Turns out that the problematic updated were the Windows Activation Technologies.
<br />
<br />
My Windows is correctly activated, it's a clean MSDN copy from my DreamSpark account, so I doesn't think that it's a problem with my copy. However, I suspended that update and IE 11, hiding out them. Until now, everything seems fine, but I'll come back later,
 if it goes up again. </p>

<p>My xbox is unable to connect to xbox live even though when i test my connection it tells me it is all good. It even tells me my nat type is open and i am exceeding the recommended mbits speed. I have tried to remove my profile and redownload it but whenever
 i try this i cannot even attempt to redownload my profile because it tells me that that there is a problem and to try again later. I have also tried clearing my mac address and restarting but that has done nothing yet either. Also tried just about every kind
 of reset an xbox one can go through. This is a problem i have experienced the last 3 days and i have not found a solution.</p>

<p>Okay. &nbsp;With the profile removed please perform a hard reset exactly like this. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power
 cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational reload the profile and test. &nbsp;Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!!</p>

    <title>Unable to reset skype password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vesnaj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to reset skype password</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>recently I was forced to upgrade my Skype and then I failed to re-login (my password was apparently incorrect). I don't know any more if my password is incorrect or my account got locked because of numerous attempts to relogin so I tried to reset my password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Password reset process starts within Skype itself and after few steps I am asked to continue the process on&nbsp;account.live.com/acsr.</p>
<p>Over there, after <span>
verifying&nbsp;</span>my email I am asked to fill out <span>
questionnaire</span>, however:</p>
<p>- At one point I am asked to enter my name, date of birth and country where I registered my account. Since I registered my account very long time ago (I never had name and date of birth filled in - I just had username). However, wizard is not letting me
 continue unless I fill in all those details???</p>
<p>- If I fill in my name and date of birth (even though those were not present on my account), and then later on answer few more questions (like what are names of three contacts on my contact list) I get an automated email telling me that my password could
 not be reset and that I should try again. I tried several times already but there is nothing else I could do as I am certain that I am correctly answering all questions in
<span>
<span>
questionnaire&nbsp;</span>except name and date of birth which cannot be answered correctly since that info is not present on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bear in mind that I never had Microsoft account (I created it just now in order to post this question).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried reading through several posts on this forum but haven't found solution to my problem - the most often suggestions were to visit password reset link (https://account.live.com/password/reset?cobrandid=90010) or try with this link&nbsp;https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics
 or to go through password recovery few more times. I've tried both links and there is no point going through that whole process again, so please try to provide me with more specific advice how to solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing which might help you with troubleshooting. Link https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics initially&nbsp;showed me two accounts linked with my email address (I was unaware I had two). One has my profile photo so there is no doubt which one is correct.
 I tried logging in in both of them but failed with the same password incorrect error message. After registering for Microsoft account (in order to post this question) I've noticed that I have three accounts now. I can successfully login into latest one but
 that is just a new account, there are no contacts in my contact list - it is a brand new account, not mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Vesna</p>

            You should chat with a live Skype support agent to get it straightened out. Here's how to:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com</a>
<br />Click on Skype
<br />Click on Contact Us
<br />Click Contact Skype Customer Support
<br />Choose Account &amp; Sign-in
<br />Choose Your Account is Blocked
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Text Chat Support
<br />
<br />Note: Not all choices lead to a chat session, but the choices above will, even if you don’t have a blocked account.

    <title>Skype for Mac is not honouring &#39;hide&#39; setting when set to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> remcokalf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Mac is not honouring &#39;hide&#39; setting when set to automatically open at login</h2>
                    <p>I want Skype to start when logging into my Mac, so I have set up Skype to automatically start at login in System Preferences.</p>
<p>This works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I also want it to hide so I set the 'hide' checkmark at login items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Skype does not honour this setting and it is the only program doing so.</p>
<p>Tried everything, but Skype keeps opening with a full window after login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on a new install of High Sierra, with a fresh download of Skype.</p>
<p>So this must be a bug.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was working in older versions of Skype.<br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to let Skype behave, and hide after starting at login?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9352ebb9-b929-4b29-b23d-062890df95c3" title="RemcoKalf">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>This was working in older versions of Skype. Does anyone know how to let Skype behave, and hide after starting at login?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The latest version of Skype <em>(New Skype)</em>&nbsp;has different User Interface (UI) and design compare to the older version of Skype
<em>(Classic) </em>wherein some features and functionalities in the Classic version has been modified. Also, New Skype is not yet fully developed especially the one installed in the MacOS High Sierra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In connection to that, we would advise to use the older version of Skype for MacOS in order to use the "hide" system preference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get Classic Skype, follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Log on to <a href="http://www.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">www.skype.com</span></a>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Downloads.</strong></li><li>Click on the dropdown from the blue button.</li><li>Click on <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></li></ul>

</p><p>I have the same problem with Medal of Honor Allied Assault for Windows 10. I tried all the above troubleshooting options but they didn't&nbsp; work.</p>
<p>Is there any more options I could try?</p>

            <p>I was playing MOHAA and Quake 4 with no problems on windows 8.1 until the Sept. 9, 2015 patches were installed. After that neither game played in any mode just like is happening now with Windows 10. Since this is all to coincidental I would say the issue
 in windows 10 is mirrored by the same code in the patches from Sept. 9. Thought that might help MS look into what happened. Since I was out of luck playing the games I moved to windows 10 after have removed it for this very reason. Good luck to everyone. Of
 note I installed and have no problem playing Return to Castle Wolfenstein.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've as well tried everything above to help run Medal of Honor Allied Assault on my Windows 10, but nothing seems to work. What is strange that the compatibility mode doesn't even work, when I've used it before on Windows 8 and it worked.</p>
<p>Please let us know if there is anything else we can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is probably better for gamers that love playing old PC Games to keep to the old Windows operating systems (XP/Vista/7/8), compatibility issues are much less concerning old PC Games.</p>

            <p><em>"It is probably better for gamers that love playing old PC Games to keep to the old Windows operating systems (XP/Vista/7/8), compatibility issues are much less concerning old PC Games."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>On one level that would be best, if only playing older games, but this is not really a compatibility issue.</p>
<p>It has to do with a malware built into Win10. Win7/8/8.1 are also being infected by the DRM Blocking malware
</p>
<p>that MS developed for Win10, and is now subversively installing to Win7/8/8.1 via Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Medal of Honor Allied Assault is just one of hundreds of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disk based versions</span> of games that are </p>
<p>being blocked by this malware. </p>
<p>I have more details in my rant&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---here---</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- However, problems with MOH-AA&nbsp; are not exclusive to Win10. Some people did have issues on Win7
</p>
<p>as well (before DRM Blocking). More commonly when using the 'War Chest' version (with Spearhead and</p>
<p>Breakthrough expansions), if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>There may be other settings that affect MOH-AA and it's expansions, but one which applies when using an</p>
<p>Nvidia&nbsp; graphics processor is to use the 'auto' option for PhysX rather than 'gpu' in the
</p>
<p><em>Nvidia Control Panel&nbsp; &gt; PhysX</em> options.</p>

            Does not work. I have tried every suggestion on most tech sites so far. The game crashes just after selecting "New Game."

            Nope. No go on this suggestion as well. I had no problems running MOH War Chest in Windows 7. Just when Microsoft updated me to Windows 10.

            Jim if you haven't tried buying it from gog.com may want to make sure you don't have windows update # KB3086255. It causes MOH not to work as well
