<h2>            Macromedia projector says it isn&#39;t working for Big Fish Games and games won&#39;t go to full size</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Macromedia projector says it isn't working!&nbsp; Help!</p>
<p>I need the macromedia projector to see strategy guides for Big Fish Games. It says it isn't working! Also my games won't go to full size but stay in the smaller size. I am not sure when in the last 2 weeks this happened. I was in the hosptial and came home,
 computer updated and I've had problems ever since.&nbsp; Downloaded DirectX as recommended in reading others problems but it hasn't helped. Would appreciate ANY help.&nbsp;This grandma is not super computer literate but have got along just fine for years even with new
 programs. Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. Is the issue specific to Bigfish game? Do the other games play fine?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Macromedia Projector is a utility which bundles up a Flash visual presentation into a stand-alone EXE file, so you can display the images on a PC without the Flash Player installed.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to run the game in Windows XP compatibility mode and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To install the program in Windows XP compatibility mode, refer the link below:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Verify the application you are attempting to run is trustworthy, and you have downloaded and/or installed it from a valid source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click the start button, right click on "computer", and then select properties from the list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click "system protection", click the "advanced" tab, click the settings button in the performance section, and then click the Data Execution Prevention tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. There should be two selections, and "Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those I select" should be selected. Click the Add button and navigate to the folder that your game/application is installed to (usually found in the program
 files folder). Click on the .exe file in the folder that launches the application.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Run the game and check if it runs fine.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can also post your query inin BigFish forums for better assistance.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://forums.bigfishgames.com/forums/list.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://forums.bigfishgames.com/forums/list.page</span></span></a><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span>You can also change the resolution the games are running in and check if you get full screen. This is usually found in
 video options.<span>&nbsp; </span>However not all games will have these options.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also refer to the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-screen-resolution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change screen resolution</a></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Photo Viewer Won&#39;t Print - opens a .JPG but won&#39;t print it - 2nd request</h2>
                    <p>LOTS OF PEOPLE are having this same problem that I describe below.</p>

<p>There is a long thread about this topic over on the Microsoft TechNet Forum. with no answer except some crazy wacky suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is an older thread about this topic here on the Windows Answers Forum, and the moderator asked us to submit a newer current question on the same topic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the problem: we open a .JPG file in Windows7 Photo Viewer, and the picture opens fine and is displayed on the screen. Choose Print at the top of screen, choose print again on the drop down menu. New window opens with all the default choices for printing.
 Choose the button "Print" and NOTHING HAPPENS. The software just sits there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same picture opens and prints perfectly if we use QuickTime or Internet Explorer to print it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go look at the Microsoft TechNet thread about this same topic for more information (but no solution).</p>

<p>Please give an answer WITH INSTRUCTIONS even for the most basic steps.&nbsp; Which menu to use, where to point-and-click, etc. &nbsp;Most of us are new to Windows7.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I've been using Windows 7 for about 3 years at home and support 21 Windows 7 computers.&nbsp; The only time I've seen this is when you print to a network printer that's either not there or not powered on.&nbsp; When I replaced my printer once on my server, I forgot
 to update the default printer on my other 3 computers at home and ran into this.&nbsp; That's the only thing I know of that can cause this kind of thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your reply does not match my circumstances, and therefore is not a solution to my question.&nbsp; In&nbsp;my case. the user prints to a network printer that is right outside her door, clearly&nbsp;powered on and working&nbsp;on, clearly set as her default printer, and is the
 exact same printer that DOES print the .JPG via QuickTime or Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate that you've only experienced the problem under a certain set of circumstances, but I assure you that several people on the Windows Answers Forum and over on the Micrsoft TechNet Forum have the same problem as me that is not caused by using an
 obsolete or mis-spelled network printer, nor a network printer that's not powered on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thank you so much for yur answer because the situation you describe might work for somebody else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1) Have you made any changes prior to this issue?<br />
2) Do you receive any error message while trying to print?<br />
3) Is the issue confined only with Windows Photo Viewer printing?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps mentioned in the articles mentioned below and check if the issue still persists.</div>

            Rebecca,
<div><br />
<div>I was having almost exactly the same problem. There was no problem printing with any other applications on the computer, but using Windows Photo Viewer resulted in the experience you were having. Print, nothing happens, Print Properties, nothing happens.
 I am using a wireless printer. The way I solved this problem was by choosing "Install new printer" from the "Printer:" pulldown menu within the print dialog. It then detected 2 of the same printer, the one that was not working with photoviewer(yet was with
 all other apps) and one that does work with photo viewer. I did noticed the address Windows Photo Viewer had for the non-working printer did not include the port in the address as the other one does.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Long story short - Run the "Install new printer" option from the "Printer:" pull down menu and &nbsp;choose the printer it detects that is not the one currently working.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example, my photo viewer detected:</div>
<div><br />
<div>HP Photosmart D110a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The one that would not print. Address 192.168.2.5</div>
<div>HP75DFFD (HP Photosmart D110 Series) &nbsp;- This one prints just fine. Address http://192.168.2.5:&lt;port&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>It should install fairly quickly See what happens. Worked for me! (Although now I have a printer driver labeled specifically for windows photo viewer. Doh. ) And if it doesn't work you can always delete it.</div>

            Well, some MS programs has some funny ways of working. Changing the default printer worked for me. Yes I had a Canon Printer as default printer and then I switched to the new Xerox Printer.
<div><br />
<div>Seems to me that Photo viewer has to detect if the default printer is online or not. If not, it feels like the program checks the default printer status and gives to it the high priority on the list of printers and after checking the status then it allows
 or stop the printing process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the heads up.</div>

            Thanks for this solution.&nbsp; I had a little trouble understanding this completely at first but I finally was able to do the same.&nbsp; When I clicked "Install a printer", I then selected the option to install a network printer (vs. a printer connected to a workstation)
 and but this only displayed my existing printer once.&nbsp; I selected it and gave it a distinct name (as you had done) and it worked fine, with the same issue of having two instances of the same printer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having to do this is rather klugie and I wonder why MS
 hasn't come up with a more straightforward fix.&nbsp; In any case, it works and I'm happy.

            <p>If you lock it and display the log-on screen (as you have shown) and your user HAS a password assigned to it (like it would using a Microsoft Live account) - then you will have to enter the password.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uncheck the "display log-on screen" checkbox for the screensaver. &nbsp;How's that?<br />
<br />
Even if you locked manually - Windows Logo Key + L - if your account has a password, you locked it for SECURITY (there's really no other reason to LOCK a computer) and thus, a password is required.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As Shenan said there is no reason to use the Lock Screen unless you want to have security<br />
in place.<br />
<br />
If you just want to cover anything on the screen and do not want it to wait for the default<br />
timer use :<br />

            If you LOCK it - it will ask you for a password as you are using an account with a password assigned to it. &nbsp;
<br />
Doesn't matter if you lock it via the screensaver (the screensaver can still activate if you uncheck the suggested box, it just won't LOCK) or via Windows Logo Key + L or CTRL+ALT+DEL and select LOCK, etc.

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you get any error message/code?</div>
<div>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>3. Which antivirus program is installed on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue can occur if some third party program or application is preventing the computer to shut down.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to refer to the link and follow steps given in the article:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You cannot log off, restart, or shut down your Windows XP-based computer</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831431#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831431#top</a></div>
<div>-Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>
<div>-Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, refer to the link and follow steps for advanced troubleshooting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your computer stops responding when you try to shut down in Windows XP<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313290#top" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/313290#top</a></div>
<div>-Note: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</div>
<div>-Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor(CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</div>
<div>- Note: Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this resolves the issue. If issue persists, you can write to us and we will be glad to assist you further.</div>

<p>Hi Ernie Swanson,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>The D3DRM.DLL file is the Dynamic Link Library for Direct3D Retained Mode, an older DirectX display technology that was not included with Windows Vista. Direct3D is used to render three dimensional images in applications where performance is important; the
 most common examples of which are games, CAD drawing programs and graphics editing software.</p>
<p>This error is usually a sign that the d3drm.dll file has been deleted, corrupted or altered in such a way that makes it unusable to your program.</p>
<p>I’d suggest you to do a System File Checker (SFC) scan on your computer. SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</p>
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
2. Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>Check the below link for details:</p>
<p><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</strong></a></p>
<p>In addition to SFC scan, refer the MSDN link below where a similar issue has been addressed and lots of users have fixed the ‘D3DRM.dll missing’ error:</p>

            <p>My issue was resolved when I found a 3rd Party Driver ToolKitInstaller that was downloaded and installed. &nbsp;This application caused Devices and Printers to hang and the user wasn't able to print. &nbsp;I uninstalled the application the issues were resolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Author of the 3rd party application is Megaify Software Co., LTD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check in the Downloads folder and root back to around the date the issue started. &nbsp;In my experience, something driver related may have been installed that is causing the conflict.</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>Failed to manage to print a Word document so then went into control panel, devices and printers and when selecting this it hangs. This has worked since I upgraded the pc to Windows 10 but now I can't print anything. Nothing

<p>I had the same problem and found the solution on a you-tube video by MrJayBusch at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHoSBT9gDHg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHoSBT9gDHg</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/qHoSBT9gDHg?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/qHoSBT9gDHg?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> .</p>

</p><p>1. From the search window at start button search for Services</p>
<p>2. Click on services or services(local) from the search results.</p>
<p>3. Look for any bluetooth services which are not started. For me it was bluetooth headphone support. &nbsp;I don't use bluetooth headphones but it seems that this needs to be started for my printers to work!</p>
<p>4. For any bluetooth service which is not started, right click on it and select properties.</p>
<p>5. From the properties window set start up type to automatic and under service status click start. &nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Click apply and exit services.</p>
<p>7. All should now be well. &nbsp;I restarted my laptop and devices and printers was up an running again</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably easier to go to the YouTube video rather than following my notes. &nbsp;I hope this works as well for you as it did for me.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Activating Windows 10 with Windows 8 pro key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajnafx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating Windows 10 with Windows 8 pro key</h2>
                    <p>So I'm building a new PC soon, and I can't use this Windows 10 because it's an OEM. (Upgrade from Windows 7 pro OA)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC I had before this one I'm currently using had a retail Windows 8/8.1, which I may have upgraded to Windows 10 (Can't remember)</p>
<p>
</p><p>That PC died because of a power outage, I still have the HDD that PC used with Windows 8 installed. I also have the retail box with the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't POST so I can't check to see if it's still Windows 8 or if it's an upgraded 10. I haven't tested the HDD in this PC to see if it still works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would I go about installing and reactivating that windows on the new one I'm building?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if it is a Windows 8, can I use that product key to activate a Windows 10?</p>

            Hi AjnaFX, you can clean install Windows 10 onto your new PC and use your Retail Windows 8 Product key to activate Windows 10, there will be no problem, whether you had already upgraded to Windows 10 or not . . .
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />During the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC'
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) as the Product Key is for.
<br />
<br />Then when the installation completes, go to the Settings App - Update and Security - Activation and enter your Product Key

            Hi AjnaFX, yes you should install Windows 10 Pro.
<br />
<br />You will not be able to deactivate the old installation, if you have any problems activating Windows 10, you can get Microsoft Support to help you with that:
<br />
<br />Choose a Local Phone No:

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What changes were made on the computer prior to this issue?</span>
</li><li><span>Does the same happen when you open systeminfo from start search?</span>
</li><li><span>Also does this happen when you open certain category in systeminfo?</span>
</li><li><span>Are you able to go online?</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Looks like the system files are corrupt. Try and use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to check and fix system corrupted files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To do this, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span>Steps to perform SFC scan</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start button</span></p>
<p><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></p>
<p><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator
 or insert the administrator password etc.</span></p>
<p><span>6. In the Command prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></p>
<p><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></p>
<p><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>9. If any files need any replacement SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></p>
<p><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more information.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Also run a scan on your computer and check If there are any infections.</span></p>
<p><span>Run a Virus scan using online live one care utility.</span></p>

<h2>            Locked out of services.msc for many of the updaters need a patch to unlock my Laptop&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Services in Question which the options are all grayed out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update 'Running' Manual Trigger</p>
<p>Update Orchestrator Service for Windows Update 'UsoSvc' 'Running' Manual Trigger</p>
<p>Delivery Optimization 'Running' Manual Trigger</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender Service 'Running' Automatic</p>
<p>This one is extremely annoying as my pc has a virus that forces my Antimalware Service Executable into this bizarre overload causing a good chuck of high 75-100 Disk usaged for about 10-30mins putting alot of strain on my pc till it finally says restart
 your pc &amp; the service stops altogather I can't even download &amp; run antimalware removal software due to one of my viruses I'll got &amp; defender won't remove them &amp; turns off so I just want to avoid this whole 10-30min process of hell everytime I reboot as the
 program doesn't work anyways just performance drains/kills my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3 windows Updates are a different story when active my pc is also being drained via the network connection everythings like snails super slowed down &amp; sometimes refuses to even let me do anything online using wifi, beyond that I normally don't have wifi
 or a hard connection instead I use a tethered bluetooth phone dialup *991 or or something as my primary internet &amp; these programs running literally refuses my 200kbte 1/5mb per sec network for surfing/gaming &amp; the stuff I would like to do as it hogs up what
 little bandwidth I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put I need a patch to turn off all 4 of these features &amp; the fact that the windows operating system is blocking access to these to begin is down right disturbing/board-line criminal so I would like to request a very detailed step by step guide for
 unlocked these grey outs so I can disable them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still using an out dated version of windows 10 as the updates it tried to place just destroyed my ability to do anything so I've used a firm rule to get these disable as best a could &amp; normally they aren't greyout out excluding Defender as its always
 active but for some ungodly pure hell/evil reason I&nbsp; can no longer change these settings &amp; its driving me mad thus why I'm here posting all thes bs due to the lack of easy access to this beyond simple click disable program Services, if this is intentionally
 shut down from some recent update I suggest you change this policy for all users of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again if theres some way to turn these off using something like run 'regedit' please post how to do some because I pulling my hair out here trying to solve this internet connection issues which should not have been a issues to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my 400$ laptop was all I could afford &amp; not everyone is going to shell out extra cash due to your assumption that internet works well enough while this programs drain massive amount of bandwidth for nothing more than a fancy illusion of security that simply
 never worked in the first place, I use the pc for purely web surfing &amp; gaming I keep no personal info in my gmail accounts/or anywhere else stored within my pc that I don't mind losing/have stolen by a dead hardrive or hacker so the need for any of theses
 updates/virus protections is a mute point that has never bothered me or cuased any sort of issue performance wise hell I have many viruses that literally cause no issues on my pc its your poorly design update &amp; bad a virus defender that has been the bain of
 my existance.</p>

 I had got moved to windows.old which caused them to cease fuction which is wonderful new I keep all my old files too &amp; haven't noticed any issues beside&nbsp;<br />
VBA Gameboy Emulator+Skyrim/Other Steam Games needing a new direct x 10 june install which fixed those issues, resetting my settings weren't to bad so I think factory reset keep files is a great method to avoid any future hassle, no need &amp; for any more windows
 updates have it all disabled &amp; if I get any more viruses I can Reset once more &amp; place them into windows.old too, that&nbsp;<br />
Fix Me Stick will erase them if they cause any real problems later on.

<h2>            Xbox one s controller overheating problem</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello. I got my xbox one for 1 week.&nbsp;When I installed the batteries in the controller and started to set up the console I found that the battery door was getting warm to the touch. I immediately opened the door and took put the batteries which were so hot by this time I couldn’t hold them, after the light on the controller would blink twice and then shut off.&nbsp; I's a brand new xbox one s controller. What can I do? I'm from romania&nbsp;</p>

<p>I noticed when I select<strong> Mountain Time(US &amp; Canada)</strong> and remove the option for daylight savings time, the system, time is correct but the time in the apps is an hour ahead as you mentioned. Once I changed the&nbsp;<em><strong>Time Zone</strong></em>
 to <strong>Arizona</strong>, both the system time and the time in the apps were the same and set to the correct time.</p>
<p>Let us know if this helps.</p>

<h2>            Computer Freezes for a few minutes at a time after last major windows update</h2>
                    I have a problem with my computer freezing for 2-5 minutes a couple of times a day. &nbsp;The first time this happened was after the upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;After some research, I couldn't find a good solution so I did a clean re-install...problem fixed. &nbsp;After
 the last major windows update in Dec. the problem has returned. &nbsp;Am I going to have to do a clean install after every major update? &nbsp;No solution I have found online works. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;I don't know what kind of info one may need,
 but I can provide it on request. &nbsp;Thanks in advance.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry to know that your Computer constantly freezes after updating Windows 10. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you and I will be happy to assist you with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before proceeding:</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Does this issue occur on a local account or a Microsoft account?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would like to suggest that you perform the methods below and check if the issue persist:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;a) Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;b) Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on view all and select System Maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;c) Click next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><strong><span>Follow the steps below to check the issue occurs in safe mode if not perform a clean boot please follow the steps below:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Please refer the article below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to do a clean boot and check if any third party apps are causing the issue.
</span><span>Placing the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please refer to the article below for steps to perform a clean boot.

<p><span style="color: rgba(46, 116, 181, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span> </span><strong><em><span><span>Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot "to reset computer
 as usual. </span></span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Scan System</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Perform a full system scan of your computer, to check if the issue is caused by a malware or virus.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to perform an SFC scan and see if it helps:</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse 2000 not working</h2>
                    When first installed my new microsoft wireless keyboard and mouse 2000 both worked fine for a few weeks.&nbsp; After I installed a new Canon printer, suddenly neither were working.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling and then reinstalling the software, putting new batteries
 into both, but my computer does not recognize the devices at all.&nbsp; I even installed the software on another computer, and that computer was only able to recognize the mouse, not the keyboard.&nbsp; Could the USB piece for the keyboard/mouse be broken?&nbsp; If so, where
 can I order a new part?

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping someone can help me with an ongoing issue I have had with my laptop now for a couple of years.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 that came with Windows 7 but I upgraded it to the free Windows 10 Home offer.&nbsp; The spec of the laptop is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: Celeron Dual-Core CPU T3100 1.90GHz</p>
<p>Ram: 4.00GB</p>
<p>System type: 64-bit OS, x64-based processor</p>
<p>Sound: Microsoft High Definition Audio Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is whenever I play an audio or video file there are skips/stutters/jumps intermittently throughout playback which becomes very irritating. No matter what software I use to play the files the same thing happens. I have even tried plugging in an
 external speaker and also a Bluetooth speaker hooked up but experience the same issue. I have looked online in the Microsoft Support Community and also in Dells own Support which both offer various assistance such as uninstalling Dell Support Assist and Agent
 apps, uninstalling the audio driver and reinstalling, I have even done a reinstallation of Windows 10 but the problem is still there. I have googled the issue and seem to find many other users suffering the same fate and trying the options I have explained
 but to no avail.&nbsp; I am extremely frustrated with this and would really appreciate some help or a final fix on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this and hopefully someone will have a proper solution to the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Al.</p>

            Hi The, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I believe the issue is that the laptop is quite old, and the audio hardware drivers aren't supported on Windows 10. I had a look at the driver details page here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/inspiron-1545/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/prod...</a>
<br />
<br />It says that the latest drivers are supported only up to Windows Vista, so I'd imagine that would be the cause of the issue. Windows 10 would be doing its best to use the audio hardware, but the drivers haven't been updated by Dell to support Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You could try getting in contact with Dell to see if any later drivers are available for Windows 10, but otherwise it's just a case of old hardware not working with new software. Here's a link to Dell Support:

<p>Hi Graeme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my question and your very informative response has been most enlightening. I have followed your instructions and looked at the links provided and can see that Dell does not seem to support Windows 10 with any drivers
 which is a shame plus it sounds like this laptop is kind of redundant when it comes to audio/video capabilities but I would be reluctant to get another one just for the privilege of being able to run sound based files as I already own two Dell desktops which
 work fine for this.&nbsp; It is a shame though as I would also like to be using the laptop for that purpose.&nbsp; If that is the end solution then I guess I am stuck with the issue. I doubt that Dell would oblige with new drivers for Windows 10 based laptops?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks again for your kind assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Al.</p>

            Furthermore to the above I contacted Dell support and a representative informed me that Dell have not tested the Inspiron 1545 with Windows 10 and do not intend to release the relevant driver and apparently the hardware on the system is not compatible
 with Windows 10 so they cannot support it! So I assume my laptop is now redundant even though it is functioning perfectly fine except for the sound issue and will be another notch on environmental waste to be replaced with another new machine! Surely there
 must be some other alternative? Would it be possible to revert to Windows 7 on this laptop thus curing any sound issues?&nbsp; I do hope someone can assist.

    <title>Windows 7 boot stalls at classpnp.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pgoelz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 boot stalls at classpnp.sys</h2>
                    
<p>I know this is a very old issue but I haven't seen any solutions.&nbsp; Is there one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has happened on my Thinkpad X61s sporadically after upgrading from Vista x64 Ultimate to Windows 7 x64 Professional.&nbsp; There seemed to be a connection between motherboard temperature (hot after installing Win7 and updates) and the boot failure, but I
 am not 100% certain. It happened several times under various conditions including immediately after a successful full install and also after an install and&nbsp; OEM driver installation.&nbsp; Sometimes simply waiting and then restarting got it to boot.&nbsp; Other times
 not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boot would stall immediately after the first two dots of the logo appeared and then froze.&nbsp; Booting to safe mode showed that the boot stalled at classpnp.sys.</p>
<p>I tried all the usual stuff like system repair.&nbsp; No improvement. After letting the system settle(ie., cool) and also flashing the BIOS (it was very old), it hasn't happened again but I am worried. I see lots of references to this exact issue but so far no
 solutions.&nbsp; Someone always suggests a system repair, but after the OP reports that didn't solve it (it also didn't in my case) the thread continues with others saying they have the same issue and then just dies.</p>
<p>So.... has there been any progress determining why systems fail to boot, stalling at class.pnp.sys?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Paul,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What steps you have tried other than system repair?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any unnecessary external device connected to the machine, you may unplug them &amp; check if you are able to boot to the desktop.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to boot to the installation disk and verify if you are receiving the error.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to run chkdsk from Windows Recovery Environment &amp; then try to boot to the desktop normally.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.Follow the steps from this link to boot into Windows Recovery Environment and open the command prompt. For more information, follow the section&nbsp;
 ‘</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>To open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer</span></a><span>’&nbsp;
 from this link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In the command prompt window, type ‘chkdsk /r’ and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> During the restart process, Windows checks the disk for errors, and then Windows starts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have done all of what you suggest.&nbsp; This is a laptop, and it has failed to boot immediately after an install with nothing external connected as well as later in the install / configure process.&nbsp; It does not always refuse to boot.&nbsp; When it
 will not boot, System Repair (run from the DVD) has announced that there is a problem and it cannot fix it, although it does not state what the problem is.&nbsp; Memory test shows memory is OK.&nbsp; Checkdisk (which runs successfully during system repair) shows the
 hard drive is OK when run from within Windows (when it boots). At one point I totally wiped the hard drive, reformatted, and installed.&nbsp; During that process, it refused to boot at least once.</p>
<p>The last time it refused to boot was when I realized it was hotter than usual (but not dangerously hot), so I let it cool a couple minutes.&nbsp; The next attempt booted OK and it has booted OK ever since.&nbsp; So far.</p>
<p>Note that Vista x64 ran 100% perfectly for a couple years on this same machine.&nbsp; Additionally, my copy of Win7 is an upgrade copy so although it does a clean install over Vista (Vista is Ultimate, Win7 is Pro so it will not actually "upgrade") it does not
 actually reformat the hard drive.&nbsp; Is that a clue?&nbsp; Is there something remaining from the Vista install that is confusing things? The next boot after a failed boot offers the repair option.&nbsp; If I take that, it announces something like "a required device is
 unavailable".&nbsp; That sounds like something like the hard drive has gone missing.&nbsp; But it is reading the hard drive (the boot actually begins, it just stalls).</p>
<p>Like I said in my original post, it is currently booting OK.&nbsp; I have flashed the BIOS and finished all driver installation.&nbsp; I am merely worried that I have not in fact fixed it since this is a very common problem, reported by many people over the last year
 or so.&nbsp; Some of them were using brand new machines with the factory Windows 7 load.&nbsp; I am merely wondering if anyone has found the real issue and if there is a permanent fix.</p>
<p>I know everyone is trying to help, but if you look at the many threads reporting this problem (stalling on classpnp.sys) running repair and checkdisk etc. NEVER fixes it.&nbsp; The threads just die out without a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, MS needs to look at the code for this web site..... using Firefox, there is no cursor when typing, making it very hard to make corrections. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Interesting.&nbsp; Did some more digging.&nbsp; Turns out that while everyone seems to think the boot is stalling at classpnp.sys, it is in fact stalling at the NEXT file in the boot sequence, which is cdrom.sys (in my case, anyway).&nbsp; That makes a bit of sense.&nbsp; In
 my case, there was a DVD drive while I installed and configured.&nbsp; It was in a docking base.&nbsp; In normal use, there is no dvd drive (it is a Thinkpad, which has no internal drive), and if I configure a boot log, the system reports that cdrom.sys did NOT load.</p>
<p>Given the fact that when it failed to boot the repair option claimed that the boot failed because a resource was not available, perhaps the BIOS was reporting a cdrom was available but the system could not find it? &nbsp;</p>
<p>But I'm just guessing.&nbsp; I wish that Microsoft would weigh in on this one.&nbsp; It has been going on for a long time if you Google for it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>OK _ I ran into this problem today. Apparently classpnp.sys is a Microsofts SCSI driver but the problem was to actually get&nbsp;to the root cause of this problem I had to turn off automatic reboot on system hang in the F8 startup options. Nothing else I tried
 geve me a reasonable lead to an answer. I could not get into safe mode, but I could try startup repair but this didn't help as the problem is a hardware driver, not software.</p>
<p>Eventually after turning off automatic reboot I got a BSD which at least pointed to the driver for my Atto Celerity Fibre card being the culprit. Removing this card allowed the system to boot normally. Either the card or driver is corrupt but ... at least
 I have a place to start.</p>
<p>In my opinion this insane urge to "hide" problems from the user has led to this being one of the most difficult problems to track down, even for a savvy computer user like myself. Microsoft need to develop a reporting system tha tinforms hte user exactly
 where hardware problems lie - in htis case a log of the failing driver that popped up on the next boot would have been sufficient to identify the problem hardware. So simple and yet so obtuse - Microsoft hit yourself over the head with a 2x4 at least 10 times
 until the message gets through - abstraction layers are no good when problems are involved.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure what is happening is that classpnp.sys actually loads any third party SCSI drivers like raid cards, fibre cards, legacy CD drives etc - that is what makes this a difficult problem to track down. Could be a failing hard drive, a dead CD ROM
 controller or a problem raid card etc</p>

<p>Not sure your issue is quite the same.&nbsp; In the scenario I am describing, the boot simply stops at the step AFTER reporting that it has loaded classpnp.sys.&nbsp; In my case, that would be loading CDROM.SYS.&nbsp; No automatic restart and no BSOD.&nbsp; It just stops dead
 in its tracks until you hit the reset button.&nbsp; But I fully agree with you that in this day and age of smart OSs, it is inexcusable for any OS to be as obtuse as this.&nbsp; It should be simple to add a subsystem to keep track of what the system wanted to do, whether
 it in fact did it, and if not, what prevented it.&nbsp; Like it is supposed to do with standby issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW, it is now several months later and after I updated my BIOS, the issue has not returned.&nbsp; I do think your issue and mine are probably related, though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK _ I ran into this problem today. Apparently classpnp.sys is a Microsofts SCSI driver but the problem was to actually get&nbsp;to the root cause of this problem I had to turn off automatic reboot on system hang in the F8 startup options. Nothing else I tried
 geve me a reasonable lead to an answer. I could not get into safe mode, but I could try startup repair but this didn't help as the problem is a hardware driver, not software.</p>
<p>Eventually after turning off automatic reboot I got a BSD which at least pointed to the driver for my Atto Celerity Fibre card being the culprit. Removing this card allowed the system to boot normally. Either the card or driver is corrupt but ... at least
 I have a place to start.</p>
<p>In my opinion this insane urge to "hide" problems from the user has led to this being one of the most difficult problems to track down, even for a savvy computer user like myself. Microsoft need to develop a reporting system tha tinforms hte user exactly
 where hardware problems lie - in htis case a log of the failing driver that popped up on the next boot would have been sufficient to identify the problem hardware. So simple and yet so obtuse - Microsoft hit yourself over the head with a 2x4 at least 10 times
 until the message gets through - abstraction layers are no good when problems are involved.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure what is happening is that classpnp.sys actually loads any third party SCSI drivers like raid cards, fibre cards, legacy CD drives etc - that is what makes this a difficult problem to track down. Could be a failing hard drive, a dead CD ROM
 controller or a problem raid card etc</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Turning off automatic reboot worked for me.&nbsp; I had connected an external USB CDROM drive prior to the problems.&nbsp; During a logged reboot, my HP Netbook hung after that classpnp.sys.&nbsp; It would appear that the automatic-reboot-on-hang was constantly rebooting
 the thing.&nbsp; Once off, I was able to get past the hung driver and boot up.&nbsp; Now to blow away the hung driver...

<h2>            Registry errors causing computer to run slow.</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows XP and I am constantly getting registry error messages with Regeanie and Regicure (both of which I uninstalled because they didn't work or fix the problem).&nbsp; I get these pop up programs that say I have 359 or more registry errors or empty
 registry keys which are causing my computer to run slow, download slow and even kick me off the internet.&nbsp; I have high speed internet but you wouldn't know it by the dial up speed I have!!&nbsp; What can I download to repair the registry errors and empty registry
 keys once and for all so my computer will run fast again?</p>

<p>My first impression of your problem is that you are infected with malware. I would recommend you download, update and choose a quick scan with Malwarebytes. Even if you have an anti-virus software and/or anti-malware use Malwarebytes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes.org</a></p>
<p>Most registry cleaners do more harm than good. The numbers of invalid entries the programs you refer to state you have is not uncommon if you have never or it's been a long time, since you cleaned the registry. There are only 3 programs I truly trust to
 edit my registry. First, is Ccleaner. When cleaning the registry using Ccleaner you will be prompted to save a back-up of the invalid entries. Choose yes to this option. After a few days, if all seems to be well you can delete the back-up. Secondy, Glary Utility.
 it too creates a back-up. However, the back-up is automatic and does not require confirmation. Both Glary and Ccleaner have additional tools that come in handy from time to time. This is especially true with Glary. The third program I use is Windows OneCare
 Live clean-up. This is a web based application but requires the download of a few small files. When invalid entries are found a restore point is created unless you choose to un-tick the option to do so. I will tell you that cleaning the registry is a very
 risky process if you choose the wrong program to use. Some are very intrusive and as previously stated do more harm than good. Additionally, cleanig the registry does little to speed up your computer. There is a big misconception as to that. This does not
 mean you will not see any benefit, but it will be minimal.</p>
