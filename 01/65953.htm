            <p>Then I suspect that you are not following the intent of&nbsp;instructions but being guided by Microsoft instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you click to download you will be presented with a choice to use Windows Updates or proceed with the download. I have already stated that Windows Updates<em> will not work</em>. Select the proceed with download option. Do not take any other downloads
 suggested by Microsoft until you have installed SP3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or use this link instead...</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/3/0/d30e32d8-418a-469d-b600-f32ce3edf42d/WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/d/3/0/d30e32d8-418a-469d-b600-f32ce3edf42d/WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe</a></p>

            I have a Compaq SR2023WM that had a catastrophic hard drive failure.
<div><br />
<div>The computer is totally OEM (AMD Athlon 64 3500+) with an additional 512mb RAM,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did a fresh install of Windows XP Professional on a 90 gb partition with quick formatting using a Genuine CD I purchased directly from Microsoft long ago. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Windows XP Professional (OEM 1/1/2001)</li><li>Quick Format&nbsp;<span>
</span></li><li><br />
</li><li>install video and motherboard drivers from OEM HP recovery DVD:</li><li>nvidia 6150 driver.exe</li><li>sr2023wm chipset driver.exe</li><li><br />
</li><li>install WindowsXP-KB835935-SP2-ENU.exe</li><li><br />
</li><li>install audio drivers</li><li>sp31994 (Microsoft UAA Bus Driver for HD Audio).exe</li><li>sp26792 (Original Realtek High Definition Audio Drivers).exe</li><li>.</li><li>At this point I attempted to install the crash fix from the HP web site, but got the message that my system did not meet the minimum requirements.&nbsp;Installation&nbsp;was cancelled (9998)</li><li>.</li><li>Install WindowsXP-KB936929-SP3-x86-ENU.exe</li><li>IE8-WindowsXP-KB2618444-x86-ENU.exe</li><li>.</li><li>At this point I started to get blue-screens every 10 or 15 minutes. I followed the HP instructions and deleted the Intelppm.sys file.</li><li>I still get 'Your computer has been shut down...' though the error changes. &nbsp;Sometimes it is atapi 0x000000007a or 77, other times it will say it is in win32k.sys other times it will just be a number, no file name. &nbsp;</li></ol>
<div>Sometimes the computer will run for hours, no problem, other times I will get a blue screen 5 minutes after starting up over and over.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have been getting automatic updates on my system, but if I try to go to the Windows update site, IE says:</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Internet Explorer has closed this webpage to help protect your computer
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp; </td>
<td>
A malfunctioning or malicious add-on has caused Internet Explorer to close this webpage.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div><br />
<div>I have flushed the cache, reset all the settings, but cannot get IE to work on the update site. &nbsp;Chrome (my browser of&nbsp;preference) does not use activeX controls, so i cannot view my update history, but there are 124 installations &nbsp;listed in my winnt folder.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So how do I cure the&nbsp;blue&nbsp;screen?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>The HP patch probably doesn't apply (and it told you so)&nbsp;if you rebuilt from a genuine Windows installation CD. The problem came about because HP imaged an Intel based system and used that image to build AMD based systems, including their hard disk based
 recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your blue screen crashes should really be the subject of another question of your own as they almost certainly are not associated with the Windows Update/SP3 issues&nbsp;that this thread is about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry, this is not my problem. &nbsp;I can get into my generic online Microsoft account, this site for example. &nbsp;The answer you gave is what to do if I forgot this password. &nbsp;I need to know how to recover or reset the password associated with my personal laptop,
 I.e. The one I created when I first set-up my Windows account on the new device.

========================================<br />
You did not need Movie Maker for the purpose of Playing <br />
DVDs. However...VLC Media Player will play them.<br />
<br />
Maybe the following article will help:<br />

Good detective work.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials works well for me as a virus scanner.<br />
If you were running Avira and MSE...that would cause issues. It is<br />
not a good idea to run two virus programs simultaneously.<br />

MS Security Essential is not for windows 8, only windows 7 and earlier. Windows Defender is used in Windows 8 and 8.1.

<span>which has a slight problem of swelling the battery, to the point that the screen has detached from the rest of the device, after 2 years of use...)<br />
<br />
With SB2 (like with SP4) I develop DirectX program. SB2 has 2 GPUs. Problem : there is no way to use NVIDIA GTX 1060 with them. Debbuging, i found that GetDDEnum detects only 1 GPU (the Intel 620) and not the NVIDIA GTX 1060. I tried to force the GTX 1060 utilisation
 setting NVIDIA configuration Panel / 3D parameters / Global parameters / Prefered GPU, result is same.</span><span><br />
<br />
I need GetDDENum to collect GUID of GTX 1060, to use that GUID on DirectDrawEnum() function.<br />
<br />
I'm blocked. Someone could help me plz ? Thanks a lot.</span></p>

<p>Hi Xavier, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that the NVIDIA GTX 1060 is not detected in the Device Manager. Please check if the driver is detected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's not detected, we recommend that you keep your Surface up to date as we are working to resolve the issue as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have any other concerns.</p>

<p>Hi.<br />
<br />
Thx for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GTX 1060 is detected in the Device Manager, but in Dxdiag the Device Identifier of GTX 1060 returns "unknown" (the Device identifier of Intel 620 returns&nbsp; a GUID ( {D7B78E66-1A57-11CF-4C65-3820BCC2DB35} ). I suspect Windows cannot affect a correct GUID to
 1060GTX because of that. NVIDIA Panel detects the 2 GPUs and when i use NVIDIA Panel to affect GTX 1060 to a DX11+ 3D game it works fine with 1060 GTX (GPU1 on Task manager). The problem i discribe seems affect all 3D programs that working on DX7 and DX8 :
 Enum function only detect Intel 620 and not 1060GTX. I suspect it's same thing for DX9. DX10 Enum function seems to detect the 2 GPUs.
<br />
<br />
I tried to deactivate only Intel 620, 1060 GTX staying active. Result is that Dx7 and Dx8 Enum function cannot detect any GPU (sure they cannot detect the Intel620, but they also cannot detect the GTX1060 GPU that was staying activated).<br />
<br />
Thanks for you help.</p>

<h2>            Laptop Won&#39;t Wake Up From Sleep</h2>
                    I have a Samsung Series 3 laptop with Windows 10 and I've been trying to figure out why it'll freeze when I turn it back on after closing the lid. When that happens, the hard drive light becomes solid so I'll have to push down the power button to turn
 it off and on again. The event viewer usually gives me a Kernel Power Event 41 (63). And since it's in a clean boot state now, if it leave it alone for too long and the screen goes black, I can't get the screen to come back on and still have to hard reboot.
 Everything works fine in safe mode though.

Useless boiler plate answers. All 3 series Samsung laptops have power issues that Windows 10 created. Restart shuts down, Shut Down freezes, and no coming out of Sleep. Nobody at Microsoft has come up with any workable answer. Although there is no reason not
 to pray. Come on folks, step up to the plate and find a fix!

<h2>            Did Mass Effect 2 seem shallow to anyone else&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I wasn't a bad game...far from it.&nbsp; It just seems like there should have been more.&nbsp; Most of the game was compiled of crew member story missions.&nbsp; After the initial start there were less than a handful of story driven missions then BOOM the end 2 end missions.&nbsp;
 It wasn't as deep as the first either.</p>
<p>I ask b/c these were things I thought most gamers would have thought were very poor decisions, yet it seems ME2 gets high praise anyway.</p>

<p>Nope, just you. Mass Effect has always been a character focused franchise with an over-arching story that revolves around you.</p>
<p>While you might not have liked it, the vast majority of those who have played it really enjoy it. Including myself, top 5 of my favorite games over the last 30 years.</p>

<p>I agree. It was a good game. But there were lots of little touches normally present Bioware games that simply weren't there in this game. Bioware used to spend 3 or 4 years working on a single title. But since being acquired by EA, they are being forced
 to pump out in a much shorter time frame. They simply don't have the time for all the polish that they were once known for.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one exception to this is their upcoming MMO The Old Republic. It has been in development for a long time and hasn't been rushed at all. I'm generally not in to MMO's, but I might have to give this a shot so I can once again see Bioware in their former
 glory.</p>

<p>It wasn't so much shallow as it was more tightly focused. In the first game you were an Alliance Marine and then a Spectre, so you had the freedom to do whatever you wanted, basically. This meant you could explore the entire galaxy at will, what there was
 of it to explore anyway. In the contrast, in the second game not only have you died and gotten better, your benefactors would like you to save the galaxy in return. Since a) this was your primary mission in the first place, b) the threat just showed it's fangs
 with how easily you got punked and c) the attack means there's less time to faff about doing mineral surveys, it's logical that Shepard would want to get back in the fight as soon as possible and break some noses (insipid reporters notwithstanding :p)</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;</p>
<p>The only thing I didn't like about ME2 was how readily the Illusive Man became all buddy buddy with Shepard. In the first game I completed every single side mission and disrupted a LOT of Cerberus programmes, destroyed all facilities I encountered and killed
 EVERY Cerberus Operative I came across. And the Illusive Man didn't even mention it in passing or anything, and didn't even hold a grudge. He was falling over himself to give me new technology for cryin' out loud, technology that would absolutely POSITIVELY
 be used on him and his posse the first chance I got.</p>

<p>Shallow, no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disjointed, yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The individual elements were good. Tali's loyalty mission for me has been the best part of either of the two Mass Effect titles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However none of the elements really bind together very well. The entire game to me feels as if it is a series of DLC missions, loosely connected to the over-arching plot but really having very little to do with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course it doesn't help that the Collectors, who are meant to be the big bad, are such a pushover when you encounter them. Plus as an antagonist, Harbinger is a pale shadow of Saren.</p>

    <title>Permission error when trying to delete folder under shared network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timellerbee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permission error when trying to delete folder under shared network</h2>
                    <p>I recently networked my new laptop to my desktop and shared my music folder from the desktop to the laptop. But I had all my music in another folder on another drive so I unshared the music folder on my desktop. Thing is, it is still showing up on my laptop
 as a network folder but when I try to read the contents it says I don't have permission to view the contents even though I am the laptop AND desktop administrator. When I go into FOLDER PROPERTIES it indicates that the folder is not shared. Why then is it
 still showing up on my laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get this useless folder off of my laptop, and why can't I get permission to do this in the first place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How do I delete a ghost network folder from my laptop that used to be on my desktop.- Original Title&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Can you provide the exact error message that you have received when you try to access the file?</p>
<p>2. Have you turned File Sharing settings&nbsp;ON?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, I suggest that you check under Control Panel if Public Sharing&nbsp;is set to ON. To do so follow the steps below</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing&nbsp;Center</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Here click on the&nbsp;<strong>Change Advance Sharing Settings </strong>link located on the left menu pane.</p>
<p>3. Here under <strong>All Networks</strong>, turn <strong>Public Sharing to ON</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Once done try to remove/delete the said file and check,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; When I double click on the file in question the message I get reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows does not have access to [folder name]</em></p>
<p><em>You do not have permission to access [folder name]. contact your network administrator to request access.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click the file and go to the security tab, the message reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You must have Read permissions to view the properties of this object.</em></p>
<p><em>Click Advanced to continue</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>After clicking on Advanced: You do not have permission to view or edit this objects permission settings.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the administrator on both of these machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;2. On the desktop where the shared file resides, I have changed the File Sharing settings to ON as you described and am still getting the same messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the laptop, no Homegroup exists, yet on the desktop, it indicates that there exists a Homegroup that was created by from the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting the desktop, where the shared folder resides, said to troubleshoot the Homegroup on the computer that created the Homegroup. Troubleshooting the&nbsp; laptop, which allegedly created the homegroup, couldn't identify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot even find the network any more.</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused and for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the added information, it is not clear if you have rebooted the PC to check if the folder disappeared. Having stated so, I suggest that you shutdown and then restart the PC and check if the folder still exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above didn't help, I suggest that you try the below mentioned workaround and check. This has to be performed on the PC that the folder has been shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. As you have specified that you "unshared the music folder",&nbsp;I suggest that you right click on the said folder and select Share with &gt; Specific People....</p>
<p>2. Here add the name of the user and click on Share.</p>
<p>3. Once done, again navigate to the said folder and select Share with &gt; Specific People.... and remove the user by right click on the name of the user and clicking on Remove.</p>
<p>4. Once done, reboot the system click on the said folder again and click on Stop Sharing.</p>
<p>5. Reboot and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>ASUS Computer keeps Shutting Down - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> krconv  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS Computer keeps Shutting Down - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer that is "refurbished" from Amazon, which I bought a month ago. Here are what was in it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS M52BC Desktop Computer</p>
<p>AMD FX-4200 3.8 GHz Quad Core</p>
<p>Nvidia GeForce GT 640</p>
<p>Actel AcBel HBA005 350W Power Supply</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And here is in short what is happening:</p>
<ol>
<li>Computer is <strong>randomly shutting down</strong>, which started a week ago. At first it could take up to a few hours to shutdown. Since this morning&nbsp;I can only get it to stay on for 15 minutes at a time.</li><li>When it shuts down, it <strong>doesn't automatically restart</strong>. Sometimes after a few minutes it will try to restart, but it will just kick the fans on for a second and then cut power again.</li><li>Sometimes when it shuts down, if I push the power button it will just <strong>
kick the fans on for a second </strong>as well, then will cut power. When this happens, I have to push the button again and it works</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have stripped it down all I can think to do. I have unplugged the HDD (running on a SSD that I installed), took out the RAM that I added, unplugged the CD Drive, limited the processor to 25% in Windows Power options (which helped it stay on a couple minutes
 longer than usual), unplugged my second monitor, started in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Tempuratures </strong>seem to be ok. I monitored the temperatures using Speccy (I think that was what its called) and the CPU and MoBo stay under 40 C, while the GPU stays under 55 C (both of these are the max I have seen after it was running for
 a while).</p>
<p>I also used Speccy to check <strong>voltages</strong>, and they all seem to be ok (last frame before the system shut down listed (+12V) 12.261 V, (+5V) 5.017 V, (CPU Core) 1.392 V, (+3.3V) 3.162 V</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you need any more information I can provide it! I have spent hours scrolling forums which usually suggest PSU or overheating issues, but I have ruled those out (I think?).Thank you for your suggestions!</p>

            <p>Hi Abdul, </p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer shuts down I receive no warning or error code. One weird thing about shutdowns though is that the "Shutting Down" screen pops up for just half a second. I don't think it shuts down correctly (fast startup fails every time it crashes) but
 it does "try" to shut down (opposed to what it would look like if I just pulled the plug).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only information I can get on the shutdowns are these three Warning/Critical events (these three are recorded every time it shuts down after a crash).</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Critical&nbsp;11/16/2015 2:26:37 PM&nbsp;Kernel-Power&nbsp;41&nbsp;(63)</td>
<td>The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Error&nbsp;11/16/2015 2:26:43 PM&nbsp;EventLog&nbsp;6008&nbsp;None</td>
<td>The previous system shutdown at 2:23:46 PM on ‎11/‎16/‎2015 was unexpected.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Error&nbsp;11/16/2015 2:26:36 PM&nbsp;Kernel-Boot&nbsp;29&nbsp;None</td>
<td>Windows failed fast startup with error status 0xC00000D4.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Power troubleshooter and it told me that there is no actions to be taken. I also ran the Safety scanner and it had nothing to report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two more things to add to what I have tried:</p>
<p><strong>Resetting the computer </strong>while keeping my files (using Windows Reset feature in the recovery options).</p>
<p>I have taken the side of the case off and currently have a <strong>desk fan pointing into the computer</strong>. I don't think anything could actually be overheating (maybe a sensor though?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One more thing to note, the computer was able to idle for <strong>seven hours today
</strong>(after I reset it this morning) flawlessly. But after I started using it for a few minutes it shutdown, and after trying to turn it on a few times&nbsp;it continuously crashed within&nbsp;<strong>five minutes</strong>. So when it crashes and I try to turn it
 right back on, it seems worst. But if I wait a while it will turn back on for longer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some more things that I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried <strong>completely reinstalling Windows 10 </strong>on the original harddrive that came with the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried <strong>flashing BIOs with an update </strong>that claimed to increase system stability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Neither of these solutions have worked either! Could all of this be pointing to a specific component?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, follow the below steps to disable the Fast start up in Windows and check with the results.</p>
<p><span>1. Open the Control Panel (icons view), and click on the Power Options icon.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click/tap on the <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong> link.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click/tap on the<strong> Change settings that are currently unavailable
</strong>link.</span></p>
<p><span>4. If prompted by UAC, click on Yes. </span></p>
<p><span>5. Under <strong>Shutdown settings</strong>, uncheck the <strong>Turn on fast startup box</strong>, click on the Save changes button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, if you have recently installed a hardware device, such as a sound card or video card, an incorrect or improperly installed device driver might be causing the problem. Make sure you have the latest driver for the device installed. You can find
 drivers on the device manufacturer's website. I suggest you to deploy the following two tools and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><strong><span>Use Driver Verifier</span></strong><span>: </span></span><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff545448(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Driver Verifier</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;monitors
 Windows kernel-mode drivers and graphics drivers to detect illegal function calls or actions that might corrupt the system. Driver Verifier can subject the Windows drivers to a variety of stresses and tests to find improper behavior.</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>You can run Driver Verifier on multiple drivers simultaneously, or on one driver at a time. You can configure which tests to run, which allows you to put a driver through heavy stress loads or through more streamlined testing.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn305113(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn305113(v=vs.85).aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Memory Test</strong>: Also deploy the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/memory-problems/21c3f63f-f570-4522-b2ef-ecc7b7ff6461">

            <p>I don't really know what I have found, but I have found something! I tried to run the MemTest86+ on my computer that you linked, but that didn't work for some reason. So instead I tried MemTest86, and I have
<strong>noticed something strange</strong>. </p>
<p>When I run the test using one core on the first core, the <strong>tests run fine</strong>. However, if I run the test in parallel on all of the cores at once, it freezes. Also, on that status bar that shows which cores are running, a spinning symbol is shown
 on cores 0, 1 and 3, but <strong>2 appears like its not working</strong>. So I tried to run the single core test using only the 2 core, and no progress is made at all (stuck on test 0 at 0%).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this suggest? <strong>Does </strong><strong>core 2 not work at all</strong>? Because if so, how can I run the computer at 100% CPU power when in Windows (using some prime number generating stress test that I found for testing)? Thanks for your
 help so far, I think we are tracking down the issue!</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted and your patience is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This brings to our notice that the CPU stability might be the blockade we are looking at. There might be another issue, if you run heavy workload on your CPU for a long time, a&nbsp;CPU core might get damaged. But again these are possibilities as it is impossible
 for us to reproduce the issue at our end which you are currently facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that&nbsp;this is now beyond&nbsp;the knowledge and the service boundary of our support. I would suggest you to consult a hardware expert who can help you better from here on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But however, as a personal suggestion, last few ideas I can share with you are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Set the high performance mode from the power option settings in Windows.</li><li>Run the Check Disk utility to check the HDD health (chances are less though !)</li><li>Uninstall any performance monitoring/overclocking tools.</li><li>Flash CMOS to bring down everything to stock settings.</li></ul>
<p>We hope the issue gets fixed without any fatalities/replacements&nbsp;once you identify on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Thank you for all of your help! After trying your suggestions and troubleshooting some more, I eventually found something new! As I said in the first post, Event Logs didn't report anything out of wack, just that the computer was unexpectedly shutting down.
 After trying to limit the PC to just one core (because the Memtest made me think that something was wrong with the CPU), the computer started to log the cause of the shutdown (I have no clue why). This is what it said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The shutdown process was initiated. Source: Power button or lid"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking for people with this error, and after all of this troubleshooting, I have confirmed that all of the above
<strong>issues are due to a simple, faulty, power button</strong>. I confirmed this by running the computer and changing the behavior of the button to only turn of the screen, and sure enough the screen started shutting off on my all the time! But problem has
 been fixed (for the most part).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a working computer after a week without it, and so I am pretty happy. I am still a bit skeptical though about why memtest makes core #2 appear like it's not working. While monitoring the CPU logical graphs in task manager, it shows all four cores
 working, and so I will have to look into this issue further before I decide the computer is 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time</p>

<p>If you are unable to connect to Skype.com or utilize any of its services, you may want to contact your ISP to see if there are issues reported on their end. Nothing would be removed on Skype's end. There would either be an outage on Skype's end or an issue
 on the ISP's end. There is <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
no outage reported on Skype's end</a>. However, this does not totally exclude that possibility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is related to your ISPs DNS, you could try alternate DNS servers to see if that changes anything (like Googles' 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4).</p>

    <title>Very Slow WiFi on Surface 3 After Most Recent Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Very Slow WiFi on Surface 3 After Most Recent Update</h2>
                    I am using a Surface 3 with Windows 10. &nbsp;I recently installed the Cumulative Update for Windows 10 version 1607 for x64 based systems. &nbsp;Now my WiFi connection is so slow that it will not even load the start page in Edge. &nbsp;My email would not download in
 Outlook, and I cannot watch anything online. &nbsp;My wife's iPad 2 was running perfectly at numbers that put my machine to shame based upon the speed test. &nbsp;Please help me figure out how to get my machine to run reasonable speeds for WiFi. &nbsp;I note this was an
 ongoing issue as of last year. &nbsp;I would really like to think there is something I can do to resolve it. &nbsp;Thank you.

<p>I'd be interested in your results from speedtest.net and how that compares with<br />
prior tests, if you did them and also what is your Internet speed tier supposed<br />
to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is it only one browser that is impacted? </p>

<p>Barb:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I note you are a real trooper about these things and routinely hand out helpful advice on this forum. &nbsp;On behalf of everyone who has read your posts, I just want to say thank you. &nbsp;Second, sorry for the delay. &nbsp;I made a point of being computer free
 for the weekend.</p>
<p>But, on to the question at hand. &nbsp;The speed based upon the Network Speed Test App is now 3839 ms delay, .04 Mbps download and .02 Mbps upload. &nbsp;Before I rebooted, it was 4426 ms delay, but the other two numbers were the same. &nbsp;The best result I ever got
 out of my Surface was 53 ms delay, .88 Mbps download and .27 Mbps upload. &nbsp;That was October 2016. &nbsp;The second best was 237 ms delay, .39 Mbps download and .07 Mbps upload. &nbsp;That was December 2016.</p>
<p>When I recently ran a speed test on my wife's tablet, the numbers were far, far better. &nbsp;Like factors of 30 better. &nbsp;I am only on a DSL connection, and that is a slow one. &nbsp;However, when my ISP came out and tested, they explained I am only yard away from
 the vault, and get better speeds than I am supposed to coming into the house. &nbsp;They even recently gave me a new Router (Actiontec brand, it says).</p>
<p>Whichever browser I use, Edge, IE, or Firefox, they do not connect. &nbsp;Really, doing anything other than checking my email is ridiculously slow. &nbsp;Even checking the News app is slow.</p>
<p>I don't know what I am supposed to do. &nbsp;I am exceedingly frustrated by this, and would like to know how to boost this. &nbsp;Thank you for all of your help, not only here but also in the past.</p>

            <p>thanks for the kind words..</p><p>I'm thinking to try a different way of attacking this. You originally mentioned<br />"I am using a Surface 3 with Windows 10. &nbsp;I recently installed the Cumulative<br />Update for Windows 10 version 1607 for x64 based systems" - and I'm wondering<br />what might change if you installed the Creators Update - Version 1703. You can<br />manually update from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a><br />(and you have 10 days to roll back to where you are as of today). I think this<br />is a better option than having you go backwards.. the update isn't being offered<br />to Surface 3 users because of this issue <strong>I</strong> found (really). Just pull out the<br />MicroSD card (if you have one inserted) before you start the update and it<br />should install just fine.</p><p>the round trip delays are pretty awful - I'd also be

            <p>Mike I'll be glad to help you with this. I am a volunteer installation specialist for six years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What &nbsp;exactly happens when you power up your computer now? &nbsp;Does it respond to CNTRL ALT DEL keys all pressed at once? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any disks which came with PC or that you made for repairs or recovery? &nbsp;Did this PC come with Windows 8?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens if you reboot and immediately tap vigorously the F8 key? &nbsp;If given recovery options what are they?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have access to another PC to download and make recovery media with my help? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply to each question and always feel free to ask back more. I will stick with you until this is resolved like I have for thousands of others before.</p>

            <p>Thank you Greg. &nbsp;The situation is that I upgraded from 8.1 when I was told to do so by msft. &nbsp;So I have no disks for 10 or 8.1. &nbsp;The system runs apparently as a 32 bit system when my 8.1 was 64 bit. &nbsp;All the associated software like Java, Chrome, Quicktime,
 etc have been switched to 32 bit. &nbsp;I have no idea why this happened. &nbsp;The biggest problems are that Wifi connections drop after about 10 min and can only be restored by a reboot. &nbsp;When I try to access "Settings" a window opens and closes so quickly that I
 can barely notice it. &nbsp;So there is no way to access the roll back features. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>CNTRL-ALT-Del works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried the F8 reboot option, but will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have access to another computer with DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>Many programs will still be 32 bit in a 64-bit system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds very much like a heavily bloated factory install that corrupts Upgrade. Right click the task bar to choose Task manager, show details, disable everything in Startup tab except Defender, reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Right click the network connection icon in system tray to troubleshoot problems. Specify wireless adapter. &nbsp;If you can't get a stable enough connection to run windows updates try plugging in by ethernet cable. Try updating the wireless and ethernet drivers
 from the &nbsp;PC's support downloads webpage, choosing windows 8.1 drivers if 10 is not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Since it will boot to the desktop, let's try other ways to access settings. Type update in start search box. Select Check for Updates. &nbsp;Now expedite the install of all updates including recommended. &nbsp;These can sometimes drag out for several days before
 restart is requested to install them, during which time performance problems exist due to needed drivers and patches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to try is to right click the start button, select Admin command prompt, type sfc /scannow . Report back results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type Device Manager &nbsp;in start search box, look for devices without drivers or in error with an exclamation mark &nbsp;import these drivers from the PC or devices support downloads webpage - we can help you find them.</p>

            <p>Let me tell you about MY Win-10 experience.<br />
1- I saved an image of my primary, boot drive to a 80GB external drive.<br />
2- I did a windows-7 backup of my user folder to another external drive.<br />
3- I did a windows-7 backup of my user folder to an internal drive.<br />
4- I did a direct copy-paste of the user folder to that same internal drive.</p>
<p>5- I also have on hand a full install version [retail] of Win-7 on DVD disk.</p>
<p>6- I used the Make Media Tool to make an ISO file on a USB drive and on a DVD.</p>
<p><strong>By that time I think I am ready for most any failure Microsoft would cause.</strong></p>
<p>7- I tested the install [that would be a clean one - opposed to an upgrade] onto another internal drive. It went flawlessly.</p>
<p>8- Win-10 is now on that drive with only my Norton 360, Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird installed.
</p>
<p><em>The reason for Firefox is that Edge is just a useless kiddie browser. Plus - I installed Thunderbird because Windows Mail seems to not be able to send messages. It will receive but not send.</em></p>
<p>9- I turned off ALL the myriad privacy violation off\on switched that come with Win-10.</p>
<p>10- I downloaded and installed all the available at the time updates.<br />
<em><strong>That</strong> was when I realized that I have <strong>NO</strong> control of updates other than delaying restarts
<strong>AFTER</strong> Microsoft has downloaded <strong>and installed</strong> them. It was then I decided that I could not use Win-10.</em></p>
<p><em>It had been well over a year since my last 'clean' install of Win-7 so I decided to do just that.</em></p>
<p>11- I did a clean install of Win-7. Installed all my apps, adjusted settings and preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a dual-boot system. Win-7 for real-life serious work and Win-10 for playing with.</p>
<p>Windows-10 is just a<strong> Fun &amp; Entertainment OS</strong> -offering nothing in the way of improvements for productivity - for which I have no serious use.</p>
<p>Win-10 <strong>does</strong> have a better looking dual-boot screen than Win-7<br />

<p>The purpose of this post is to point out that regardless the mess Microsoft may have made to my system I was READY to undo said mess and get on with computing.</p>
<p>I have read 100s of these forum posts and the #1 impression I get is that MOST just trust Microsoft and take NO steps to protect themselves should Microsoft fail them.</p>
<p><strong>Good Luck with your news media quest.</strong></p>

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;Here's the status. &nbsp;I was still on hold with MSFT after 3.5 hours! &nbsp;This was a scheduled call where they called me and I never spoke to anyone but the person who created the case. &nbsp;I called the Microsoft store to request an appointment there. &nbsp;I
 spent 30 min on a call queue just waiting to do this! &nbsp;I went to the store and the tech said that the operating system was obviously corrupted. He said that some of the computer manufacturers haven't released new Win10 drivers for their older machines (my
 Thinkpad was just 3 yrs old) and that was probably the source of the problem. &nbsp;I left the system with them to figure out how to roll back to 8.1 or re-install it. &nbsp;The people at the store were helpful and concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am retired but was part of the original IBM PC team in 1981. &nbsp;Later I used to run a major part of the PC business at IBM. &nbsp;I've been CEO of three software companies. This roll-out and support situation is the worst I have ever seen by any company in my
 40 years in the tech business.</p>

</p><p>Are you wanting help to fix things or just to vent?&nbsp; No one from MS Corp. is reading this thread so all you are doing is driving off those who would otherwise be willing to help you get everything resolved.
</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Please start at the top of the steps I gave you and report back on each, or ask back how to do them.&nbsp; That you asked nothing about the steps but just continue venting makes me wonder if you're really interested in&nbsp; fixing anything&nbsp; or just venting steam
 about it.&nbsp; So maybe you need to set it aside for a few days.&nbsp; We'll be here to help when you're ready.</p>

            <p>The W10 program is inherently defective. For example, when I want to "search" for a case name or subject, I go to the left bottom of computer and put in that name. The search goes "on and on for an indefinite period of time." This is totally unacceptable.&nbsp;
 But, even worse the "search does not include any outlook emails." <br />
<br />
Then, to check the past emails, I have to "start entirely over another search" and enter the name on the "right" top of an Outlook page. I have to then go to the "left side of the monitor" and click ALL EMAIL FILES. Then, I have to go back to the right side
 and click "enter" on the name. After all of these steps I get to see the outlook emails.
<br />
<br />
This is a terrible experience, not user friendly, particularly when I purchased state of the art INTEL PROCESSOR, THE BEST SOLID STATE HARD DRIVE AND FASTEST "c" DRIVE, EXTRA RAM, etc.<br />
<br />
In sharp contrast, in using "my XP" computer, a search is "instant." All I do is go to the bottom right of the home page and enter the name and click enter. In a" second," every possible document, every possible email and every location on the computer where
 that name exists is "instantly available" for me to perform the work I need to do.<br />
<br />
I am so disappointed in W10, I wish I never purchased the new computer.<br />
<br />
I have invested so much money and it has taken three+ weeks to try and operate the computer, to send emails, to transfer the information to the W10 from my XP, even with help from the Microsoft team (except Francis who has been a Godsend). When I download applications,
 it has also been problematic (a Quick Books program was not even possible to use on W10 that worked perfectly on XP).
<br />
<br />
Many of the "email addresses" that were moved to the W10 from XP still are not functioning; this leaves to be desired XP ease of operation because I cannot benefit from the "auto fill" that was working on the XP and, therefore, I cannot send emails without
 first going back to my XP computer and doing the search again and finding the email address so I can write each one I need down and then go back to the W10 computer to type it in.<br />
<br />
The W10 program or system has caused me to spend countless hours&nbsp; and hours wasted, losing business and money in my law practice.
<br />
<br />
Besides, getting to the right department when seeking assistance results in calls to the wrong department, having calls transferred and being disconnected and then getting once again a wrong department, it is so challenging.
<br />
<br />
There should be direct numbers available to get to the correct support person that comes with the W10 operating system. The search engine for the W10 search bar at the bottom should be identical to XP and it should provide access to EVERYTHING on the computer,
 particularly Outlook that is manufactured by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what appears <strong>also to be problems:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>The&nbsp; WINDOWS 10 scan also does not work.</li><li>The Outlook 2016 is incompatible with W10.</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>Right click Start button to open Control Panel, choose Icon View, then Indexing Options, then Advanced Button, Show all Folders, go through the whole list choosing any you want or deselecting those you don't.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should work but if not use the Rebuild Index button to re-index Windows which can resolve many problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if this is an Upgrade or Factory Install, be aware that these are inferior installs which most tech enthusiasts would never run in the first place.&nbsp; As an example, the volunteers here see a new Upgrade problem posted every few minutes round the clock,
 but no complaints at all from the tens of thousands who've followed <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

            <p>Greg, why should I have <strong>confidence</strong> in the proposed solutions you recommend, when I have spent several dozens of hours with Level 1, 2 and 3 in Microsoft's outsourcing technical division as well as Level 3 in their USA Global technical deoartment
 and no issue was resolved? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more irresponsible and, therefore, incomprehensible is the fact the "names" from the email addresses were deleted<br />
(leaving only the remaining code and symbol portion of the email address that I cannot identify without the respective names) from approximately 5,000 contacts. Also, their Senior technician in the USA deleted my saved .pst Outlook folders from 2007 to 2012,
 and did nothing to recapture them&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the purported experts including the Executive Offices of the Microsoft CEO and President (after contacting Microsoft in writing) resolved the above as well as multiple other problems, causing a totally horrific experience with Microsoft, albeit a
 previously loyal customer for 30 years.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>In addition, staff in Microsoft stores claim they "know of no known issues and/problems with Windows 10 and Outlook 2016."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If actual Microsoft employees tried and tested countless procedures and only made my computer more problematic, the only thing that I keep praying for is to be assigned and &nbsp;have a MICROSOFT SENIOR ENGINEER personally email and help me.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Wyatt,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that the Windows 8.1 Video App crashes and closes back to the Desktop Interface when you try to play some of your .MOV video files on the computer. This issue has started after updating
 to Windows 8.1 and it occurs with only certain .MOV files whereas the other .MOV files are working fine without any issues.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To assist you better, I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Do you get any error message/code when the Video App crashes and closes on the computer? If yes, what is the exact error message/code that you get?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Are you able to play the videos files of other files types on this computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Where are these .MOV video files (with which you face this issue) saved on the computer? Is it on the local hard disk or a removable media?</span></p>
<p><span>4) Are you able to play these files using other video player software (like Windows Media Player or VLC) on the same computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please get back to us with the answers to these questions. If this issue occurs only with the Video App and if you are able to play these videos using other video player software like Windows Media
 Player or VLC, then there could be some issue with the Video App on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For the time being, I would suggest you to check if any updates are available for the Video App from the Windows Store. If yes, please install the updates and check if that resolves
 the issue. <span>Please refer to the Microsoft Help article given below and follow the instructions to install the app updates:</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi thankyou so much for your help, I don't get any error code no it just closes and goes back to desktop, sometimes a blank green screen quickly apears but no error code. &nbsp;Other file types work even other videos of the same file type work but a lot of them
 don't (.mov)&nbsp;</p>
<p>the videos that face the issue where originally on an external hard drive which when connected won't work. They where also saved onto the laptops internal hard drive saved in a folder on the desktop, and on the desktop not in a folder and didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded vlc to try and it works on that if I click the icon fast enough (as even placing the curser over the video icon causes the issue)&nbsp;</p>
<p>thankyou so much sorry for late reply look forward to hearing back from you&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for the update and information which you have provided.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might be due to the drivers. </span>So, I would request you to install the latest drivers for the device and you may check in the optional updates. If all of your Windows Update are not installed or you see some optional updates related to
 your device then please try to install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the Microsoft article provided below to perform these tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have Windows install important updates as they become available, turn on automatic updating. Important updates provide significant benefits, such as improved security and reliability. You can also set Windows to automatically install recommended updates,
 which can address non-critical problems and help enhance your computing experience. Optional updates are not downloaded or installed automatically.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe
 driver you shouldn't install.</p>

            I downloaded a windows 8.1 video codec (whatever that is I don't know) and it came with an old player called MPC-HC and it plays fine on this but still dosent work on windows media player or the video app etc. And even though it plays on this type of player
 the codec downloaded when the curser is placed over the video icon for more than a second it still comes up with a green screen quickly then refreshes the desktop. Hopefully you'll be able to help thankyou wyatt.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>The outlook.com server level spam blocking breaks down occasionally, but I don't see enough posts to think that this is happing right now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting "Send to Junk" should help the outlook spam filter learn to block these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If enough of these messages have the same "From" or the same word in the subject you can create a rule to send them to Junk. This will be too much work if a rule won't catch&nbsp;a number of messages. You won't want to setup numerous rules. It's easier to just
 report and/or block each individual message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If some messages are coming from reputable companies use the Unsubscribe link but using this link of mail that's pure spam will only tell the spammer that your address is legitimate.</p>

    <title>Accessing NAS in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larzzerx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing NAS in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Have a Synology NAS ds211j. From My desktop computer running on Win 8.1 I&nbsp;can add My NAS as a net server. After upgrading my Surface Pro 2 to win 10, I see the NAS in my network and I can access it from my browser but it is not possible to connect to
 as a network resource.</p>
<p>Tried to connect as member or homegroup or as disconnected from homegroup. All other settings are the same&nbsp;as in&nbsp;windows 8 and I have also set up network sharing without password. Since I also want to use it as a printserver, which is no problem in win 8
 I hope there is an answer.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to access the NAS on win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Larzzer</p>

</p><p>Actually, after todays upgrade, it work!</p>

            I've done it! Solution: Reduce paging file size to 500 MB and turn off file protection which reduce space requirements for restore points. Turn it back on after installation has finished.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hello Ariel, thank you so much for reviewing my inquiry. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; I first noticed the blue screen when I tried to run a diagnostic to determine any errors with my pc's memory, hard drive, etc. The Dell diagnostic didn't complete and the blue screen happened (multiple tries).</p>
<p>&gt; I am able to restart the computer and get it to do routine tasks, but it often 'hangs' and after it freezes I have to reboot.</p>
<p>&gt; I had previously noticed that Windows has not completed any updates since November 2016. Which I only discovered after reaching out to Norton, thinking that maybe there was some virus/malware affecting the performance of the laptop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; Just today, I was able to download and update some drivers from the Dell support webpage.
</p>
<p>&gt; I tried to update Windows 10, again, and it would not update; I received error&nbsp;0x800705b4. &nbsp;</p>

 which means it is not installed correctly. I tried to use the update feature, but that didn't fix the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a driver file for this that I can download that works on Windows 10?</p>

            I uninstalled the driver and then reinstalled and that fixed the problem.&nbsp;
