<h2>            Windows Vista Home Premium compatible with Office Excel 2013&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows Vista Home Premium.</p>
<p>I purchased Office Excel 2013. While trying to install Excel, "Unsupported operating system" appears.&nbsp; States I need a 32bit Windows 7 to successfully run Office.</p>
<p>My Windows Vista is a 32bit.</p>
<p>When I purchased the Product key the employee said Windows Vista works with it just fine. Is this true?</p>
<p>What do I need to do in order to use this Excel?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            No Office 2013 is only compatible with Win&nbsp; 7/8. <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee624351.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
As it says here<br />
</a><br />
I would take it back and get a refund. Otherwise you'll have to buy Windows 7 or 8 if you want to&nbsp; use it<br />

<span>Hi Bgoulette612,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The fonts are probably hidden. Windows can hide fonts that are not designed for your input language settings. You can let Windows show
 and hide fonts automatically, or you can choose to see all of the fonts installed on your computer in your programs</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type
<strong>fonts</strong> and hit Enter to open Fonts. </span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click Font settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><em><span>Un-check</span></em></strong><span>
 the <strong>Hide fonts based on language settings</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the fonts were previously hidden, they will be visible now.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are the fonts visible now?
</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Hi&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<div>i've had my laptop for approximately 2 years now which i bought from a retailer&nbsp;with no problems whatsoever (windows was already built in to it). Recently I've had a popup on my screen saying&nbsp;‘update to windows 8.1’. On Friday I thought&nbsp;i may aswell update
 my windows as its asking me to.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upon updating it, i got a message saying if this is my email address i will have a product activation key sent to me. I have not received any such email and having spoken to your online assistance i have now been advised i need to pay £99.99 to keep my
 windows active! There was no such warning that this was the case when i updated windows on my system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I only use my laptop for general web browsing and now find myself in a position where i either pay £99.99 or am unable to do this anymore!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was quite happy with the windows i had previously and I wish i had never even attempted this update. The online support advised me if i wished to revert back to my previous version of windows then i would need to use an installation CD but i bought my
 laptop with windows pre-installed!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you can understand i am extremely angry that i am being held to ransom for paying £99.99 or losing my ability to use my laptop (which was working fine before i got this pop up).</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I now get a pop up every time i turn my computer on saying i need to enter a product key and the only way of doing this is paying £99.99. I flatly refuse to pay this out of principal</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There was also no mention of paying £99.99 until windows was installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I look forward to your reply</div>

</div>
<div>Kind Regards</div>

            <p>The upgrade from Windows 8 to 8.1 is free so there would be no charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Windows were you running before the upgrade? Windows XP has been off support since April and would be exposed to malicious software. As such it has been presenting warnings that an upgrade is needed to maintain security. Check the bottom
 of the laptop or in the battery recess for a COA label which will detail which version of Windows it was supplied with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you 1st ran the laptop there would have been advisory messages to create recovery disks when a computer is not supplied with disks by the manufacturer. Most systems also included a recovery partition to reinstate the hard disk back to factory default
 but how this is accessed depends on the manufacturer. Unfortunately the Windows 8 installation does break this function in some cases.</p>

            <p>If you did the free upgrade to Windows 8.1, you should not be prompted to activate it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform <strong>SFC Scan</strong> </p>
<p>Please follow the steps to perform SFC Scan:</p>
<p>a. Press "<strong>Windows Key + Q" </strong>to open Charms Bar.<br />

            <p>Hi thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>Im not sure what version of windows i had prior to this update, i just know it was windows 8 as it says so on the bottom of my laptop but cant see any COA label</p>
<p>The message that came up took me to the online store and updated windows 8.1 for me. Now whenever i turn my laptop on i get something come up asking me to update windows with the following message:&nbsp;Error code: 0xC004C003, the activation server determined
 that the specified product key has been blocked.</p>
<p>I spoke with 1 of the microsoft agents online and they advised the only way around this was to pay the £99.99</p>
<p>Please can you help as i really dont know what to do as im not very good with computers</p>
<p>thanks</p>

            <p>Hi, SteveBell.</p>
<p>I was in the exact same predicament as you recently. This is because my system had become unstable and my Windows 8 Pro w/Media Center had been upgraded to 8.1 (since I really disliked v8) and I had added Office 365 (from Office 2010 Home &amp; Student). It
 worked well enough for over a year (although I needed to reinstall it various times for irksome reasons - too lengthy to mention). However, most recently, a program that I very much enjoy was no longer working on 8.1 and so I wanted to reinstall the out-of-the-box
 (factory/OEM) settings which I accomplished without a glitch. Before doing so I made copies of everything (using System resources). Sadly, these did not work after reinstalling my Windows 8 system NOR did the app of interest. Therefore, because I kept getting
 information about the upgrade to 8.1 I again followed suite. When I ran into trouble, I called Technical Support but they wanted me to pay for it (as you indicated). I have a OEM Technical Support license but this is for hardware only now. Moreover, I reverted
 to the OEM version again because of my irritation with 8.1 but again, I got the same notices. This second time everything went just as smoothly as the original download when I first bought my system. I was not required to pay for the upgrade and it is the
 system that I originally encountered upon upgrading. However, my original key seems hidden and Microsoft Terms have changed. Also, I wonder if&nbsp;one system&nbsp;copy can be made (which they allow) that will work since, as mentioned, none of my backups worked when
 I reverted from 8.1 to 8. This included a System Image, recovery media files, and backup. The latter did have copies of my personal backup files, however.</p>
<p>I hope I haven't confused you. I merely wanted to confirm your troubles as similar to mine and to jon your frustration with the new 8.1 system('s shortcomings).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>BearlyAlive</p>
        </p>

<p>I also followed your instructions which did nothing but scan the drive for errors. It did not yield the anticipated result of a product key. I don't believe this is an ancillary function. I have pasted a screen shot of the result but this will inform you
 of nothing further.</p>

            Anshul has given a comprehensive response and you should follow his advice however I have struck problems with the latest version of Google Earth on several XP based machines and the easy answer is to uninstall it and install the previous version, it sucks
 I know but even if you do get it installed you may well have trouble with street view.

<h3> smife  say:</h3>
<h2>            Search Box And Cortana not working</h2>
                    <p>I did a clean install of Windows 10 pro 64 bit&nbsp;after I did the upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit. I have been trying for a week now to try and get Cortana and the Search Box to work. It worked for about 3 days then it stopped. I tried to do a system restore
 from a restore point that I created right after the upgrade and before I installed my programs and it still does not work.&nbsp;Cortana does not show up in&nbsp;Task manager either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried everything that has been posted here and on the web. You name it I have tried it. I do not want to reinstall the OS because everything else works fine. It seems that all of the problems that everyone has been having with Cortana Microsoft would have
 a Stand Alone installer to reinstall Cortana and the Search Box. I have tried to extract&nbsp;files from the DVD that I created, using different programs,&nbsp;but the DVD would not let me access the Source Folder. Microsoft
<strong>please come out with a Installer File&nbsp;to reinstall Cortana and Search Box.
</strong>That would be the logical thing to do seeing all the problems people are having.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this it worked for me :)</p>

</p><p>This info comes from:<br />

<br />
Download the following 3 CAB files from my Dropbox:<br />

<br />
and store them in C:\Cortana.<br />
<br />
Open a command prompt (cmd.exe) as admin and run this command:<br />
<br />
Dism /online /Add-Package /PackagePath:C:\Cortana<br />
<br />
This adds the cortana packages back to the Windows.</p>

            <p>I recently had the same problem and accidentally discovered a simple solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought installing some software that would enhance or replace Start or the taskbar etc might fix the problem. I tried Start10 from Stardock and although it seems a nice program it didn't solve the problem, I still couldn't type into the search box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I uninstalled the program, and discovered the search box on the taskbar was back to normal and I could use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not an orthodox solution, but it worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Please note I have no association with Stardock and am not endorsing their products. In this case I installed the trial version of the Start10 program, so the exercise was cost free.)</p>

<div>What if I don’t have a DV camera?</div>
<p>If you don’t have a DV camera (or your DV camera does not support analog-to-digital conversion), you can still import video from a VCR to your computer in Windows&nbsp;Vista. You’ll need an
analog capture device such as a video adapter or a USB device. You can find analog capture devices in stores or online where computer accessories are sold.</p>
<p>You’ll also need software that can import video from an analog video source, such as a VCR. One free program that you can use is Microsoft Windows Media Encoder 9&nbsp;Series, which you can download and install from the
Series"" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=77623"&gt;
Microsoft website</p></div></span>.
Welcome to the digital age
<p>My first step was to transfer the video from the VHS tape to my computer. Because the video was on an old VHS tape instead of a newer digital video (DV) tape, I had to use a workaround to get the video onto my computer. My solution was to connect my DV camera
 to both my VCR and my computer. This way, I could import the video from the VCR through the DV camera to my computer using the Import Video feature in Windows&nbsp;Vista. (This process is sometimes called analog-to-digital conversion.) To learn more, see
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/3ae62d5e-29e2-41eb-b326-9e42ac46b7021033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Import analog video to your computer by using a DV camera</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I only wanted to use parts of the video for this DVD, I imported the whole two-hour tape. (I figured I should do it now while I had everything set up, and I wanted to edit some of the other video footage later on.) The time it takes to connect
 the different devices and import the video depends on how your computer and video equipment are set up at home, as well as the amount of video you want to import to your computer. For me, the process took about three hours.</p>
<p>As the video was being imported, I was able to see my parents when they were younger—in classic '60s and '70s style. Along with the fun of getting to see a time when plaid was really in style, watching the video was practical too. I wrote down the times
 (displayed next to <strong>Video imported</strong> in Import Video) when my parents appeared, so that I could find these parts quickly when editing the video in Windows Movie Maker. Noting key times is an easy way to help you find the video clips later on
 and speed up the video editing process.</p>
<div>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Write down the Video imported time for the video clips you want to edit</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
From two hours to twenty minutes
<p>After I imported the unedited footage to my computer, it was time to find the parts of video that showed my parents. In all, I wanted to have four scenes on the DVD—Dad fishing in Canada when he was “a few” years younger, Dad coming home from the service,
 Mom and Dad’s wedding shower, and their wedding. I used Windows Movie Maker to create four "projects"—each project is one scene.</p>
<p>First, I needed to import the video file into Windows Movie Maker (you will not need to do this if you start Import Video from within Windows Movie Maker). Next, looking at the times I wrote down earlier, I quickly found the first video scene that I wanted
 to include on the DVD. I 
split the video two times in the collections area—once at the beginning of the scene and again at the end of the scene—to isolate the video clip that showed my Dad fishing in Canada.</p>
<p>Though I split the video clips myself, Windows Movie Maker can automatically create clips for you. To learn more about how to split clips, see
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/4467e2ab-0ac6-48a6-88c0-a5a30a73687e1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Work with clips in Windows Movie Maker</a>.</p>
<div>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The highlighted video clip is the first video scene I included on my DVD</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>I now had one video clip, which I copied into a new 
collection folder called Dad Fishing. I did this because you can use collections folders to help organize and find your clips in Windows Movie Maker. For example, I was able to quickly find the clip that I wanted to use in Dad Fishing, and then drag it
 to the 
storyboard. Then I added a title, transition, and two basic effects before saving the project. To learn more about the different features I used in Windows Movie Maker, refer to the
<strong>See also</strong> list at the end of the column.</p>
<div>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The storyboard for my first project shows the title and first video scene</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>I knew I needed to repeat the same basic steps for the remaining three scenes of video that I wanted to include on the DVD. So, I saved myself some time by using my first Windows Movie Maker project. After isolating the video clip for my second scene (Dad
 Coming Home), I opened the first project, replaced the existing video clip with the new one, edited the title text, added a transition, and then added a Fade Out effect to the video before saving the project with a new name.</p>
<div>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I used the first project to create the second project</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>I did this two more times, so that I had a total of four project files. Before closing Windows Movie Maker, I took a few pictures of different video frames (by clicking
<strong>Take picture from preview</strong> on the <strong>Tools</strong> menu). I wanted to use some of these pictures on the DVD menu, as well as on the DVD label and jewel case cover. To learn about taking pictures from video, see
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/2908ea52-7c4e-4355-9b9f-b251d343f3801033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Take and use a picture from a video frame in Windows Movie Maker</a>.</p>
A burning issue
<p>My edited video was complete, but I still needed to get it onto a DVD. So, I turned to Windows DVD Maker (a feature available in Windows&nbsp;Vista Home Premium and Windows&nbsp;Vista Ultimate), and then added the four Windows Movie Maker project files that would
 appear as four scenes on my DVD.</p>
<p>Then I customized the DVD menu (by using the pictures that I took in Windows Movie Maker) and the menu text. I also added a quick note to my parents on the DVD that read “Happy Anniversary Mom and Dad!” If you want to learn more about using these options
 in Windows DVD Maker, see <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/27a0225d-260e-4313-8a82-7c5253e93e6f1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Burn a DVD-Video disc</a>.</p>
<p>I was eager to start burning the DVD, but I knew from doing this before that I should take the time to preview my DVD first. I was glad I did because I found a typo in the note text. I fixed it and saved myself the aggravation of wasting my time and a blank
 DVD.</p>
<div>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A preview of my customized DVD menu in Windows DVD Maker</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Thinking ahead, I saved all the work I’d done in Windows DVD Maker as a project file in case I wanted to burn another copy of the DVD later on (for example, if my sister wants a copy). That way, I can open the project file anytime in Windows DVD Maker, make
 changes (if necessary), and then burn another copy of the DVD. To learn more, see
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/74b65f20-93ab-495d-b0f0-368d80821c4d1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Work with projects in Windows DVD Maker</a>.</p>
<p>It was now time for one of my least favorite parts (because of the time it takes)—burning the actual DVD. Burning the DVD can take awhile, depending on different factors, such as how much video is on the DVD, the available system resources on the computer,
 and the speed of the DVD burner. For me, this was a good time to take a break, make some lunch, and get some things done around the house.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
The final touch
<p>My typical DVD labels are a mess. I usually quickly write some barely legible text on the disc, and then put the DVD in an old scratched jewel case (assuming that I can find one lying around). However, I wanted this DVD to look a little bit nicer.</p>
<p>I decided to use Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 to make a DVD label and jewel case cover. I picked a DVD label and cover template, added my own text and pictures (that I took earlier on from the video), and then printed an adhesive label and jewel case
 cover on regular paper using my photo printer.</p>
<div>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The final DVD with the label and cover that I made</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Note that Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 has been discontinued, but you still might be able to find it in stores or online. The good news is that there are lots of other graphics editing and DVD/CD label making software programs available. To find some
 of these programs, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=81593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows&nbsp;Vista Compatibility Center website</a>. This website contains a comprehensive list of programs that work with Windows&nbsp;Vista, as well as compatible hardware. You can search the Compatibility Center website by product name or browse many different categories
 of software and hardware.</p>
<p>I can now say it’s done, and I’m really happy with how it turned out. Now it’s time to put the DVD in the mail. I am not sure which will surprise my parents more—the DVD or the fact that I actually remembered their anniversary this year.<br />

    <title>Intel wifi link 1000 bgn on Hp laptop only connecting at 65 mbps or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goznu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel wifi link 1000 bgn on Hp laptop only connecting at 65 mbps or even 58 mbps and then 130 for 1 second then back to slow speed.</h2>
                    I recently bought an hp laptop and currently have wireless n in my house.&nbsp; I have another hp laptop that is connecting at 130 mbps and never changes.&nbsp; This laptop however changes constantly and never stays at 130.&nbsp; It generally is around 58 or 65 and then
 will change for 1 second to 117 or 130 then back to slow speed.&nbsp; I noticed that on the correctly configured laptop it states:<br />
ipv4 connectivity&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet<br />
ipv6 connectivity&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Local<br />
media state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabled<br />
Speed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;130 Mbps<br />
<br />
On the slow computer it states:<br />
<br />
ipv4 connectivity&nbsp;&nbsp; Internet<br />
ipv6 connectivity&nbsp;&nbsp; No internet access<br />
media state&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabled<br />
Speed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 65 Mbps<br />
<br />
I dont know if that means anything, but I would guess it does.&nbsp; Is there something incorrectly configured on laptop #2 or what?&nbsp; I cant seem to figure this out.&nbsp; I would be certain that this adapter in this laptop was also capable of maintaining 130 Mbps but
 it doesn't stay at that speed.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><span><span>Most of you are complaining and bad mouthing HP, Intel, and others in regard to the performance of the Intel Wi-Fi 1000 bgn network card.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There seems to be lots of misinformation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the card is set up correctly in your laptop it will function at up to<strong>150mbps</strong> (card limitation).<span>&nbsp;
</span>You must understand how the card works before making unfound accusations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first mistake all of you are making is to use the "Speed" reported by Windows in the Wireless Network Connection Status window as the measure of how fast the
 wireless link is running.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In reality, this number is only distantly related to the throughput of your wireless connection. What it shows is whatever the wireless adapter's driver tells it
 to show, which is the highest link rate that the card can link to. <span>
&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So do not assume that because your other laptop is reporting 150mbps (or other) that that is the actual connection rate.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The link rate is also referred to as the PHY (or physical layer) rate, which is the maximum rate that bits will move across the network link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows might report a 150 Mbps speed, but your actual throughput could be anywhere between 25 and 100 Mbps (for example), depending on the
 11n router and client card being used. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The reasons for the big difference between the "link" and actual rates include the high overhead involved in wireless connections (lots of bits used for communicating
 information other than the actual data you are trying to send or receive) and data retransmission (due to the inherent unreliability of a wireless connection).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unlike other cards, the Intel 1000 bgn reports the actual link rate that the card is at. This is a dynamic function of the card, and if you understand it, you will
 grow to like it. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you verify the link speed<strong>“while data is being transferred”</strong> you will see the link rate goes up and down as needed and up to 150mbps.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This
 function is dynamic.</span> <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Other cards do not report or function this way.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You "must" check the link speed in the Wireless Network Connection Status window “while” data is being transferred.<span>&nbsp;</span>If no data is being transferred
 the card will revert to a slow link rate, however, it will pick up the speed as needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To get an accurate measure of the speed of your wireless connection you need to use a method that actually measures the speed that your connection is delivering.<span>&nbsp;</span>However,
 verifying the connection speed that Windows reports will help you verify that your card is linking at high rates of speed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>In addition, The Intel 1000 bgn, like most 802.11n products will knock your throughput down by up to 80% if you use WEP or WPA/TKIP security. The reason is that the
 802.11n spec states that the high throughput rates (link rates above 54 Mbps) can't be enabled if either of those outdated security methods is used. The bottom line is that you can only use WPA2/AES wireless security (or no security at all) if you don't want
 to throw away lots of speed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Intel card will only link at rates of up to 150mbps if it is set this way.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Go ahead and test your card speed while data is being transferred, you will see the link speed go up to 150mbps (if your router will support it) as needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have performed tests on a brand new HP dv6 SE verifying the transfer rate. It is as fast as any other 150mbps 802.11n laptop NIC that supports the IEEE standard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once your card is set up correctly, and you verify the link speed while data is being transferred, you will see that there is no need to return your laptop or to
 purchase add-on NIC’s.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this will help.</span></span></p>

<p>I had the same problem with the same Intel Adapter WiFi 1000 BGN. &nbsp;Couple of things fixed it. &nbsp;My router defaults the 2.4 Ghz band to a max of 130 Mbps for backwards compatibility. &nbsp;Change this to 300 Mbps. &nbsp;Second if your router allows you to set QoS settings
 make sure WMM is enabled. &nbsp;Third the network card properties default to the following on older NIC's:</p>
<p>802.11n Channel Width for Band 2.4 = 20 Mhz only</p>
<p>802.11n mode = Disabled</p>
<p>Ad Hoc QoS = WMM Disabled</p>
<p>The defaults have the "N" capabilities disabled, as when the card first shipped wireless N routers were few and far between, and it improved the "G" throughput. &nbsp;Change them to "Auto", "Enabled", &nbsp;and "WMM Enabled". &nbsp;The last one allows priority to be given
 to local network peer-to-peer multi-media data transfers (i.e-streaming video, music between two computers in the same house). &nbsp;Hope that helps.</p>

<h2>            Native USB 2.0 ports stopped working</h2>
                    <p>After a recent windows update all of my USB 2.0 ports have stopped working, on the motherboard and on the case. &nbsp;The USB 3.0 ports work. &nbsp;Power is getting to the USB 2.0 ports and during repairs, I was able to get them to function but once Windows 10 got
 loaded, they stop working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my drivers for my motherboard, chipset and BIOS. &nbsp;I've installed older verions and new versions of the chipset and drivers. &nbsp;I've run windows repair and windows troubleshooter. &nbsp;I've uninstalled everything USB and then restarted to try and get
 the real ones to pick up. &nbsp;I've uninstalled the windows update. &nbsp;I've suspended USB hibernation. &nbsp;I've checked the registry&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">{36fc9e60-c465-11cf-8056-444553540000} for any filter entries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The motherboard is ASRock P67 Pro3 SE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screen shot of what I see from device manager. &nbsp;Also under my Devices I see a device that is an Unknown USB Device, while the only USB Devices I have plugged in the USB 3.0 ports and are recognized.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Mute speakers using the volume key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imroadkill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mute speakers using the volume key</h2>
                    <p>When using the Surface Pro 3 without the keyboard, its not easy to mute the speakers. From what I can see, the only way to "mute" the volume is to press the Volume (down) button until it goes to 0.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would therefore suggest a small change which would allow me to mute the speakers by double-press the volume-down button. To un-mute the speakers and return to the previous volume-setting a single-press on the volume-up button would do the trick.</p>

<p>That's a terrible idea. most people change the volume by doing multiple presses in the button. your concept would result in the volume constantly muting and unmuting when a user just wanted to change the volume in consecutive button presses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>another way to mute the volume is to open the settings charm and:</p>
<p>option a: Tap the volume button and then tap the volume icon on the top of the volume slider.</p>
<p>option b: Tap and drag the volume button downwards</p>

<p>I have a problem in that the speaker icon has a cross next to it and the volume has a constant cross on the screen. It seems it is stuck, what can i do to clear the problem and get sound back on. Switcheing on or off does not solve the problem</p>

            This is the first post I've seen on the rubber strips coming loose. You should be able to reattach them with contact adhesive. Look for one for rubber, not paper etc.

<p>I did buy double sided tape and that is working for my newer Surface Book 2 so far. (Applied it earlier this week).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the rubber strip/foot has developed several kinks in the original Surface Book that no longer allow it to sit flat in the recessed channel with the tape for more than a few minutes. the rubber foot eventually peels away from the tape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These rubber strips/feet are just not suited for their function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            The rubber strips came off my Surface book also.&nbsp; Rubber cement didn't do the trick, the strip came loose and is lost. &nbsp; Microsoft Store could not provide me replacements. &nbsp; I have 3 Dells, one Latitude, one XPS 13 and one Precision 5230, and Dell's service
 is impeccable. &nbsp; I had hoped the Surface could be a great 2-in-1 replacement, but will not buy another without better support. &nbsp;

<p>I have had the same issue.&nbsp; Both strips are now gone.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I wouldn't be too concerned, but there are now holes to the back side of the keyboard.&nbsp; I'll need to be careful at Starbucks setting it down on a water ring.&nbsp; I'll probably just put some blue tape on them for now.</p>

            I had the same issue.&nbsp; Tech support person was very pleasant, but Microsoft does not sell the rubber feet and has no interest in offering a solution.&nbsp; I was advised to use adhesive, ultimately this is not a great long term solution.&nbsp; Its unfortunate that
 a company that can make a good product has little to no answer the little things.&nbsp;

            Same issue here, both of the rubber feet came off, one was lost and the other so damaged it can't be reapplied.<br />
<br />
I can't believe I paid $2600 for a computer and it has bad rubber feet and they can't be replaced!<br />
<br />
Microsoft, you have to do something about this!<br />
<br />
Ha!&nbsp; Maybe someone will see the opportunity and manufacture them and sell them on eBay and/or Amazon.

<h2>            Windows Does Not Recognize Kindle Device Anymore</h2>
                    <p>I have a DELL LATITUDE 3570 computer powered by Windows 10 Pro which has all the latest windows updates installed. The problem is that my computer has stopped recognizing my Kindle Devices (Paperwhite and Fire HDX) and also my Garmin devices (Garmin 520).
 I do not get any error message when these devices are connected to the laptop (I have tried all 3 USB ports) but these devices are just not visible. I have tried uninstalling the USB drivers and then restarting the computer but that has still not helped.</p>
<p>

            Hi UMERJAVED1,<br /><br />You mentioned your kindle devices, but then also said a garmin. I wonder if it’s not recognizing USB devices at all. Is there another item we can try? Printer? Android or iPhone? Try to plug one of those in and see if they pop up. <br /><br />Let me know and we’ll move forward with troubleshooting. <br />- Charlie

<p>Dear Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. The USB is working fine, it can detect my USB devices, external hard drive, mouse, iPhone etc. so all of these devices are working as they should on the same machine. Just my Kindle devices and Garmin device are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            I would suggest creating a 500 GB partition for Windows 7.&nbsp; Set the partition size as 500 x 1024 =<strong>512000</strong>
