    <title>Windows 10 wont offer PIN login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leventesid&#243;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 wont offer PIN login</h2>
                    <p>I've set my PIN in the option menu, even tried resetting it, but at login the system only offers password option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\PINLogonEnrollment &nbsp;is empty, tried adding dword "Enabled"/"Enable" did not work out either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution for how to correctly enable the registry value or other workarounds would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually it worked before, but stopped offering PIN login after a recent update - could be the source of the issue. Also wont accept password from time to time - restart resolves this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Xbox live parent account invalid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> freedombro13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox live parent account invalid</h2>
                    
<p>Hey I've had an xbox live account for close to 5 years now as a minor. My parent account has never been invalid that entire time up until the past two or so weeks. When i go through the steps to create a new parent account or whatever its trying to get me
 to do i fill everything out and it always says "Xbox Live signup is currently unavailable. Please try again later." Now I'm sure a huge company like microsoft wouldn't leave their sign up service down for multiple weeks and I've actually made another account
 so and used a 7 day trial that came with cod Ghosts so i could actually play with my friends. So considering all this the whole "Xbox Live signup is currently unavailable." message sounds like complete crap. please fix this soon.</p>

<p>I've been having the exact same problem. For roughly two weeks now, when I try to log in to my xbox like normal, it says that my parent account email is no longer valid. I go through the steps to set it up with the correct/new one, and after entering the
 email/password and clicking "I Accept" I get the message "Xbox Live signup is currently unavalible, please try again later". This has also been happening when I try to change the email on the parent account to the new one.</p>
<p>I have tried clearing the cache, I've deleted/formatted/redownloaded my profiles, I've checked the xbox server status, my internet connection(Which, by proof of posting this, it's fine) &nbsp;I've even been trying to do something about it on my profile via the
 computer. When I click on "Account" under my gamer tag, it goes to a page (Where it says 'sign in' instead of my info) that says</p>
<p>"Uh oh... that shouldn't have happened.</p>
<p>It appears you've found a glitch in the system.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t create anymore New Folders in Windows 7</h2>
                    Well this problem only began today after installing and uninstalling some free Antivirus software that I was trying out for the first time. Before that, I was about to install a new burning program and I decided to create a manual restore point first,
 in case anything went wrong. After installing Microsoft Security Essentials, I'm not too sure if that caused the problem but that's when I noticed that I couldn't create anymore new folders when I click the New Folder button in Explorer or when I right-click
 and select New, there would be no New Folder option. I have a hunch that this could most likely be some sort of registry problem but I've got practically no idea how to manually re-enable this in the registry. There was a few solutions lying around that showed
 some tips&nbsp;on editing the Context Menu but everytime&nbsp;I tried to edit the registry, I get an error saying that the changes could not&nbsp;be saved. I even download the ShellEX utility but&nbsp;it reported the New Folder o

<p><span>Hi Sop_the_Otaku,</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Where exactly are you trying
 to create a new folder? Is it somewhere in the C drive or on the desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may follow the steps below and let us know the result.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Try to use command prompt and try to create a new folder and check if you can create one.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the start search box type
 CMD and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type cd.. and press enter, repeat
 cd.. and press enter until you get c:</span></p>
<p>
<span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, type the following in the command prompt:<strong>mkdir folderName</strong><br />
Here, <strong>folderName</strong> will be the desired folder name</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check if the folder is created
 in C drive</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps suggested by Linda Yan</span><span>on<span><em>Monday,
 May 24, 2010 8:38 AM </em></span><span><span>and check if it helps you fix the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/97de8a2a-12f2-4381-a409-a78f4ae551cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/97de8a2a-12f2-4381-a409-a78f4ae551cf</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 3</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps fail perform a system restore on your computer and check if it helps you create a new folder</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click on Next.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
 on Next. </span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Finish.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore
 point was created. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

contact the manufactures for drivers. </span></span></p>

    <title>Mouse buttons switched by default - Switch primary and secondary - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t0pc4t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse buttons switched by default - Switch primary and secondary buttons enabled to temporarily fix however now causing issues in programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As described in the title, since fresh installation of Windows 7 64 bit OS &amp; Gigabyte drivers my mouse buttons have been switched from default right handed user, to left handed user, as standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only temporary 'fix' I have found for this is using the aforementioned setting in control options to switch the primary and secondary buttons; however when using some programs, this setting is not detected and therefore the mouse is set up for a left
 handed user (which is extremely frustrating).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only guess this issue is caused by Windows operating systems as the mouse doesn't have this issue with other PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 7 64 Bit (Fully updated)</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H</p>
<p>Mouse: Razer Lachesis</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has been apparent since before the release of Windows 8 so I would like to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be highly appreciated - please let me know if you require any further information as I understand the description may not be the best and therefore a tad confusing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for some context this is how the settings are set for me to use the mouse as a RIGHT HANDED user (button on the left is to select, button on the right is to drop down menus etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/062fbf10-bea0-4a87-a0cd-2eff60d909a7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/062fbf10-bea0-4a87-a0cd-2eff60d909a7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I switch this setting OFF then I will be using the mouse as a LEFT HANDED user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(This is causing issues as when I use specific programs the setting is not picked up and therefore difficult to use as a right handed user).</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that. I can imagine that must be frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, what exactly are the programs that is not recognizing the primary mouse input?</p>
<p>-Does the program have settings to change the mouse input?</p>
<p>-Did you try using a different mouse?</p>

            <p>Hello Wungraileng,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your queries:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The program in mention is a game called Payday 2 - it seems it is ignoring the 'switch primary and secondary button key' and reverting to the root problem. As my previous post suggests (2nd post on this thread), it is Windows which seems to be causing
 the root problem (which I would like to get resolved).</p>
<p>2) Yes, the problem persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<h2>            My device manager is not working.</h2>
                    Hello people, okay so I recently purchased a new headset and to try and resolve some issues with that I decided to try updating my sound card, however when I brought up the device manager it wouldn't work and just displayed an error message/page.<br />
<br />
It was the following:<br />
________________________<br />
<br />
MMC could not create the snap-in. The snap-in might not have been installed correctly.<br />
<br />
Name: Device Manager<br />
<br />
CLSID: [74246BFC-4C96-11D0-ABEF-0020AF6B0B7A]<br />
________________________<br />
<br />
I've looked up advice from Google searches but most seem to solve the issues 2+ years ago and none of these suggestions have solved my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.

            <p><span>Hi Kiltieh,<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Method 1<br />
</span></b><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>In the start search box, enter 'devmgmt.msc' and check if it opens since you are unable to open via control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Have a look and see if you have this file :<br />
<strong><span>C:\WINDOWS\system32\devmgmt.msc</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Click start<br />
b. In the search box, type 'run'<br />
c. enter 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\devmgmt.msc' and check if the file is present.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;Method 2<br />
</span></b><span>The file could be corrupt, I would recommend doing an system file check to attempt to repair this file. Here are instructions on how to do this:<br />
<br />
System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow the steps from the article:

<p><span><span>As many folks have discovered, to their dismay, message recall in Outlook quite often not only doesn’t work, but can actually exacerbate the problem. That’s because
 there are a wide variety of conditions under which the message will not only not be recalled but a second message, titled “Mike Sloan would like to recall his message ‘Could you be any more stupid?!?!’” will be added to their Inbox, instantly alerting them
 to the fact that you’ve said something that you regret. Some of those conditions are:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 offending message has already been read.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 offending message has been moved to a subfolder, including by a rule.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 recipient isn’t using Outlook as their e-mail client</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 recipient does use Outlook but isn’t currently logged in and has their mail being forwarded to their BlackBerry or Treo. Or they’re checking their e-mail via a web mail client like Outlook Web Access.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>The
 recipient’s mail server forces all incoming e-mail to plain text.</span></span></p>

 a day ending in a “Y”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>O.K. so maybe I need to double-check that last one but the other ones I’m quite sure about, and there are more. The reason for that lies in the way that Recall is
 implemented. Essentially what happens is that when you select to “Recall” the message, Outlook generates a special message in Rich Text Format. That’s the message the recipient often sees which announces that you would like to recall the previous message and
 that’s where things get dicey – those special recall messages are only processed by Outlook and they’re only processed if the message they are supposed to recall is still in the Inbox and is still unread. Of course Outlook has to be running at the time in
 order to process the recall message.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bottom line: The old advice still holds true -- don’t say anything in an e-mail message you wouldn’t want your grandmother to read. Never click “Send” when you’re
 angry!<span>&nbsp; </span>If you type something at all heated, save it to “Drafts”, walk away, come back in a few minutes after you’ve had a chance to cool down and re-read it before you send it. The “Recall This Message” function in Outlook often does
 more harm than good.</span></span></p>

            Hi <span>JukuGirl,</span><br />
<br />
I have&nbsp;investigated your account and found out that you have reached the allowable number of blocked senders. Please be informed that you can only have 500 blocked senders, this may be the reason why you are still receiving spam emails. As a work around you
 may try 2 options:<br />
<ul>
<li>Set your Junk Mail filter to Exclusive - <span>
Setting your Junk Mail filter to will send emails to the junk email folder except messages from your contacts and safe senders, Hotmail service announcements, and alerts that you signed up for.</span>
</li><li>Create a message rule that will automatically delete messages that represents spam email.</li></ul>
<p>To the following options, please visit these links.<br />

            <p>This is happening to me as well...I didn't realize there was a limit to the amount of blocked senders we can have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My email filter has been set to exclusive for a very long time and this is still a huge issue for me.&nbsp; I don't want to switch to a new provider but I am coming to the point where I will be forced to do so because after blocking senders and even domains,
 the junk mail is still multiplying like crazy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything else that can be done? Or is this an issue that cannot be fixed..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried sending in a "feedback" message to hotmail for help - no response.</p>

<h2>            I have a dream.... &#40;Black Ops&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Of leading a team.<br />
<br />
"Quiet professionals"<br />
<br />
Zero trash talking, not an ounce or irritation in their voices during a game. Win or lose. Regardless of map or game type, everyone knows their job and accomplishes it to the best of their ability. No excuses. Slight variations are called out during battle
 by the person chosen to lead that particular fight. No arguing mid-game. Everyone is treated with respect, friend or foe. In the event of a total pr*ck on the other team, no words are said to them. They are not worth the effort of our two cents. Pro Perks
 all around because the team has purposely put in the effort to give their soldier as many advantages as possible. Enemy tactics are identified, countered, and defeated. In the end everyone can turn off their Xbox and go back to the real world well knowing
 that the next time their team is online, the winning will continue.<br />
<br />
I have dreamed of this since playing Call of Duty 4 alone. Games improve, but the people do not. Developers work tirelessly to please their publisher and customers. And we thank them with ridicule and disrespect.<br />
<br />
This world is ugly enough as it is. When the turtle beaches hug my ears I delve into a world I will never be a part of purely for entertainment. Only to hear people incessant bickering and malcontent. Children, and adults with child minds.<br />
<br />
People say they are mature and happy. But everyone is when winning games are spoon fed to them. "The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy"<br />
<br />
People WILL beat you at this game, you are not perfect. I want to see how you are when you actually have to work for a victory.<br />
<br />
Seeking one person like this is difficult enough. But I hope to find 5 others. My own friends in real life have let me down. So now I seek a team here.<br />
<br />
Message me.</span></p>

<p>Hopefully somebody on here is wiser than XBOX &nbsp;support are as i have had no help what so ever. Heres whs going on:-</p>

<p>1) I use my outlook email with the xbox and have a windows 8 phone</p>
<p>2) i have just bought my son a windows 8 phone and i would like the xbox info on his phone and not mine (he has a outlook email)</p>
<p>3) On the xbox i go to settings to change the email but it always fails and tells me to go to www.xbox.com/swap</p>
<p>4) at xbox.com/swap it basically tells me that i have changed something on the account and i have to wait for thirty days, thing is i havent changed anything for years and years</p>
<p>5) Online support was slow and i mean slow plus they never read my message to them as they kept going over the same thing and in the end they got to the thirty day thing as above (probably just to palm me off!!)</p>
<p>6) Telephone support was better but no where near right ( basically they were talking about making an alias (which does bring the xbox info onto the phone but also my messages, contacts, pictures etc so thats no good.</p>

<p>I just cant understand why they cant do it , they always says its to do with security (RUBBISH) i dont have this much hassle changing the email with my bank!!</p>

<p>Please help or its pointless him having this phone.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Are you sure your son hasn't accidentally generated a Xbox Live account when he opened the games app or anything? If so, you have to make a temp account and switch things around. I can't tell you if that works because I'm stuck myself during that process,
 I made my own thread hours ago. It just keeps telling me "Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft Account right now." even though I'm also sure I haven't made any changes to the account.</p>

<p>Hi and thanks for the reply, no his phone hasnt had that email entered until i tried the alias ive tried several email address too all brand new (max two days old) and thats the error i get. I just cant believe how hard it is to change.</p>
<p>So are you saying the best way to do this is to:-</p>
<p>1) make new email address at outlook.com</p>
<p>2) try to change on xbox</p>
<p>3) and then enter onto phone</p>

 I had the issue both e-mails already had gamertags associated with them. I had to do the ridiculous switching thing with account A, B and C. I managed to get the unwanted account from my main mail to the temporary but I can't switch the actively used Xbox
 account to that now empty e-mail. So we're experiencing the same problem I guess. The system Microsoft uses for this is absolutely ridiculous and the most user unfriendly system I have ever faced.</p>

            <p>Hi xxR3d D3vilxx,</p>
<p>to get the best support it is best to create a new thread for your issue.</p>
<p>When you create a new thread please provide as much information as possible (do <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> post any personal information like email addresses etc)</p>
<p>For example is your profile currently attached to your mothers email address? And your mothers address can't be downloaded.</p>
<p>What happens when you try to login at xbox.com, is each account (yours and your mothers) able to login there and show the correct accounts?</p>

<h2>            Reset PC after upgrade to Windows 10&#63; Will I lose drivers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read that some have reset their PCs after upgrade to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop Specs: 2012 Gateway/Acer&nbsp;NE56R laptop, 1.70 gigahertz Intel Celeron B820 dual core, 3 GB memory, Intel(R) HD Graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This laptop came pre-installed with Windows 7 (along with Gateway and Acer bloatware). If I "Reset PC" can anyone tell me if I'll have issues with drivers and such? Will the bloatware be removed leaving me with a pure Windows 10 laptop? I mean I'm not sure
 how much, if any, of the Gateway/Acer branded things are truly needed or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no drivers for this laptop at the Gateway website. Not for Windows 10, anyway,</p>
<p>Only drivers for Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1089 Freezes, Mouse Still Moves - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m&#225;ximo marques  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1089 Freezes, Mouse Still Moves</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this issue where my PC will slowly freeze and the UI becomes completely unresponsive. It happens randomly and the computer will not aknowledge any form of keyboard input, including Ctrl+Alt+Del or even Ctrl+Win+Shift+B (for restarting the graphics
 driver). The only exception being the mouse, which still moves with no lag or hiccup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I cannot link the problem to any specific program or action (as it will also happen when PC is left unattended, or will get stuck even before login), this problem is very annoying, The only thing I noticed is that after it gets stuck and I restart, it
 doesen't happen again in the next session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first installed Windows 10 1809 in October 2018 just as it was first launched. I noticed that both my third-party browsers became very slow, (Chrome and Firefox. Firefox being outright unusable.), I cannot precisely recall if the freezing problem was already
 present or not, but I would guess it was. As I depend on this PC for work, I promptly rolled back the update (even before it was pulled out by Microsoft itself!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, returning to 1803 I had the nasty surprise of finding out that my PC would freeze randomly, as described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the following in a attempt to solve the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn off PCIe Active State Power Management in Power Options</li><li>Turn off Fast Startup in Power Options</li><li>Repair Windows by means of a USB boot drive (It didn't accuse any problem)</li><li>Reinstall both browsers and not use any extensions.</li><li>Update driver for Graphics Card</li><li>Update driver for SSD</li><li>Update driver for Keyboard and Mouse</li><li>Update driver for Chipset</li><li>Tried to update Motherboard firmware (there wasn't a new one)</li><li>Run CHKDSK</li><li>(By then Windows 1809 was available again) Update to Windows 1809!!!</li><li>Uninstall Chrome completely</li></ol>
<p>After I uninstalled Chrome it doesn't happen as often anymore, but still does. Honestly, I have no idea what this could be or why would it persist after both rolling back to 1803 and updating again to 1809. I researched quite a lot and found some people
 linking this issue to the Chipset driver or a reset loop bug with Windows and SSDs. I sincerely don't know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I post this here in an effort to both inform people who happen to have this problem and to help in the diagnostic by anyone in Microsoft who happens to be responsible for solving this.</p>

<p>Did you find a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the very exact problem both on my laptop and PC.&nbsp; They are both 11 years old (except the SSD's). My PC received the 1809 update two months ago, that is when this problem started to occur. A few weeks later my laptop received the 1809, and it's been
 freezing randomly since then. I can only move the mouse, I tried to connect over Teamviewer to see if programs still run in the background, but nothing works. There is nothing in Windows logs, I also tried Bluescreen Viewer software etc to see if anything
 is recorded, but no! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Both computers have only one thing in common: Samsung 850 EVO and Samsung 850 Pro EVO disks (they both have the latest firmwares).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I upgraded my PC's motherboard, CPU and RAMs, the problem is gone. But my laptop still suffers. You said the next session after the freezing is fine, I believe this is also true for me, I didn't put my laptop to sleep for the last 27 hours and
 it is fine. This means that if I turn it off, it will freeze again in the next session.

<h2>            Windows File explorer Drag &#38; Drop Hangs</h2>
                    <p>As stated in the Windows 7 question below File Explore hangs when doing a drag and drop passing over storage on the left side of the window:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is still doing the same annoying thing. As far as I can tell this BUG still exists. Anyone know how to make it stop?</p>

            <span>Hello,</span><span>&nbsp;
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with File Explorer</span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please answer the below questions to assist you better.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. To which location are you copying the files? Is it Network drive or internal hard disk?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Is this issue specific to one particular folder or all the folders?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. What happens when you use Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V to copy and paste?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Does this issue occur in a local account or the Microsoft Account?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Have you installed all pending updates on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can perform System File Checker (sfc) scan and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform SFC Scan, refer to the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let’s boot the computer in safe mode and check, you may refer to the below article to boot your computer into safe mode and check.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest you to place the Desktop system in Clean Boot and check if the problem exists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</span></span></p>
