    <title>Windows 10 TV Resolution resetting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 TV Resolution resetting</h2>
                    On a windows 10 PC, I have two displays hooked up. An LG TV with a resolution of 1920x1080, connected via hdmi and a monitor with a resolution of 1680x1050, connected via vga. I don't use duplicate or extended screens, it's either the one or the other.
 The problem is, when I switch from my TV to my monitor and then back, the TV resolution switches to 1360x768 (which for some reason is flagged as "recommended"). It only happens when I switch monitors, rebooting, re-logging in etc. doesn't seem to cause the
 problems. Both displays on AMD graphics card, latest drivers from AMD installed.&nbsp;

                    I have been wondering what this File was, some said it was a malware, a virus, and I read there are People out there CRASHING and NUKING their computers over it ! This is getting me nervious....for I believe it happened to me.&nbsp; So far my system seems pretty
 quiet except for the occational over starts. What is happening here Microsoft, someone is out there making up your files and applications to be scooped up upon upgrades or downloads?

Hey, wait a minute, the first two files are the same! Well, they are not. The first starts with the letter capital i (I) and second starts with the letter lowercase l (L). The one starting with i (isass.exe) is a virus/Trojan but Windows users may easily mistake
 it for the very important security process, lsass.exe (starts with a lowercase L, as in lucky). And yes Win32.exe is a browser hijack program that will keep taking charge of your browser home page.<br />

I Hope that help explain whats going on a little better<br />

Good Luck!</span> </span>

<h3> svs95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail &#38; Calendar--Can&#39;t add account &#34;Account Already Exists&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Using Win 10 Build 10532, latest Mail and Calendar update, I'm asked to add an account (although I was previously signed in with my Bellsouth account). I have tried to do that, but it gives me an error message "Account already exists."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, my Microsoft.com account uses my Bellsouth email address. Could that be the problem? I have Outlook 2016 installed, and it can access the account just fine. However, I was considering removing the account from Outlook, and using Mail instead. I don't
 really need the full features of Outlook, and don't want to store tens of thousands of emails locally. With Mail and Calendar, I can store only most recent three months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, should be able to use Mail if I prefer it to Outlook, right? So why can't it access my Bellsouth IMAP4 account?</p>

<h2>            Gold is a racket indeed</h2>
                    
<p>I almost decided to get the Live Gold membership. Then I found that IT IS REQUIRED to run otherwise readily accessible services such as netflix and hulu. I already subscribe to netflix. Why is microsoft charging me additional to access it from the xbox?
 I currently access it from the WII. It seems to me that they are bordering on false advertising, as it is only once you buy the console that you realize you have to pay an additional $9 a month or more to get the same service for which you are already paying
 $9. Let's dissect: the xbox doesn't come with an internet service, so that's not it, the xbox doesn't improve the netflix service in any way, so that's not it, the xbox can hear your commands, but then that's onw reason why I paid $400, so that couldn't be
 it. What is really microsoft addint to the experience, that I need to pay additional money? It's just a scam to take money off teenagers.</p>

<p>It's also enviromentally unresponsible to buy a 360 just for Netflix. The 360 uses an order of magnitude more power than a Roku, even when idle.</p>

<p>No one forced you to buy the Xbox. So it's not a scam at all, you bought it because you wanted it. I don't like Netflix, so I won't go down that road. However, the Xbox does have 'internet access'. Have you tried the Internet Explorer app? For Internet Explorer,
 it's pretty darn good.</p>

<p>Whoah. Down boys (or girls)! No. I didn't buy the xbox only for netflix (not even for myself). Yes I paid $400 tax included for the xbox 360 with kynect and 320 gb hard drive plus two games. Did you guys do better? About my bone: I'm willing to pay for what
 is fair, but not for applications which I can run for free on other devices. If I have the gadget, I would like to use it to its maximum, but not under unfair constraints. Ecosystem? You must spend an awful lot of time playing games to call it that.

250GB Bundles were $350</a>, though many of us eschew Kinect. Even so, you said you have a 320GB drive. That sounds like either a Star Wars console bundle, or a third party bundle.[quote]About my bone: I'm willing to pay for what is fair, but not for applications

<p>There should be 3 different Xbox Live subscriptions.</p>
<p>1) Only online multiplayer gaming $30-$40/yr</p>
<p>2) Only media apps $20-$30/yr</p>
<p>3) Both online gaming &amp; media apps $60/yr (Current price)</p>
<p>As it stands we are ALL paying the $60 price tag because Microsoft is "forcing" us to pay for features that are available but not necessarily ones that we use.</p>

<p>I agree with you 100%...Dont mind Xboxs Minnions calling you out.Its like that here.If you dont have anything postive to say on here about Microsoft your not gonna have a good time..LMAO...</p>
<p>But realy your right.why should one need to buy Gold in orfder to use a app that you already pay for??When u can just watch it on your blueray,tv,wii,pc,topbox,etc etc...Thats just Microsoft trying to make more $$$$$$$ ....</p>
<p>Iam sry i love my xbox and services,but come on when someone is right dont jump on them...This is why i been staying away lately from xbox.com forums...some people on the forums dont have a pair of pants without holes in the knees from sticking up for Microsoft

<p>You hit the nail on the head! They will say anything and defend it to the bitter end. And you have a few on here that just need to get out. Mumbo Jumbo speaking to sound educated. I have my console to play games, NOT to do everything that my other devices
 do, so that is why I stay away from gold.</p>

<p>Coming to the official forums to complain about something that is an established model by now makes little sense. All it does is reveal how little research one did before buying the product.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update malfunction</h2>
                    While tryin to install windows updates, Installer can't go further than 12%, then it stops and starts over again the installing process over 4 times until an error message appears "changes couldn't be applied, reverting process"
<div>This is becoming so annoying, it's making me waste time. There´s a large list of updates with error message. What can I do in order to solve this issue, it's becoming annoying. I don't even want to shut down my lap top in order to avoid this whole process.</div>

<h2>            Turn off auto joining in party chat</h2>
                    Is there anyway to turn off auto join for party chat? I play a lot of multiplayer and add many people but don't want people just joining into my party. Can't seem to find this in my settings. And if this can be done can I set it so only my favourites can
 auto join? I have a xbox one by the way

<p>Thanks! But it still doesn't work after I tried all actions below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run the Disk Cleanup Wizard, making sure to remove the hibernation file and all restore points.<br />
2. Disable System Restore<br />
3. Disable the pagefile ( Open up System in Control Panel, then Advanced System Settings \ Advanced \ Performance \ Advanced \ Change \ No Paging File.<br />
4. Disable kernel memory dump. In the same Advanced Settings, go to Startup and Recovery \ Settings and then change the Write debugging information drop-down to “None” to disable the kernel memory dump.<br />
5. Disable Hibernation mode in your power options \ advanced power options screen.<br />
Reboot the machine, and then delete your c:\pagefile.sys file,</p>

<h3> richardmann58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changing Main Network ID inputs .. Windows 10 64bit</h2>
                    <p>hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, a friend of mine, wholly novice where considering the idea of the main focus of my post here (main subject heading), and, if with a tad bit of coaching from me, tried to connect her "Brother" (brand) low-end priced InkJet Printer, wirelessly, to
 her HP Laptop, running Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And got the following "error message" "Solution". ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>— Certainly "greek" to her. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And if also certainly, somewhat unclear to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>WLAN report</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connection failed.</p>
<p>*** Solution***</p>
<p>The Security Information (SSID/Network Key) is incorrect.</p>
<p>Reconfirm the SSID and security information (Network Key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- &nbsp;How to confirm wireless security information (SSID/authentication method/</p>
<p>encryption method/Network Key).</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;The Default security settings may be provided on a label attached to the WLAN access point/router. &nbsp;Or the manufacturer's name or model no. of the WLAN access point/router may be used as the default security settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;See the documentation provided with your WLAN access point/router for information on how to find the security settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>* &nbsp;If WLAN access point/router is set to not broadcast the SSID, the SSID will not automatically be detected. &nbsp;You will have to manually enter the SSID name. &nbsp;</p>
<p>* &nbsp;The Network key may also be described as the Password, Security Key or Encryption Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not know the SSID and wireless security settings of your WLAN access point/router or how to change the configuration, see the documentation provided with your WLAN access point/router, as the manufacturer of your access point/router or ask to your
 Internet provider or network administrator. &nbsp;(Message end.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>.. Unclear to myself more, if more only because I'm a "Macintosh User". .... And with this, when it comes to the idea changing of the main "Network" / "Wireless" / "Internet Sharing" inputs ("SSID", I understand, main Network ID, and "Network Key", "password".)
 I'm not familiar quite, enough, with "Windows / PC" to be able to locate and change these "Settings".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... Any help here perhaps, before I perhaps delineate further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>— Appreciate your time.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elainereseter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update problem</h2>
                    <p>I am on a limited bandwidth (10G/mo), so normally have PC (HP Pavilion) on Metered connection.&nbsp; Started an update this am which took 3.5 hours.&nbsp; System required a restart.&nbsp; Which I did.&nbsp; System will not come up into windows, message says "Windows could not
 complete the installation.&nbsp; To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did.&nbsp; Same thing.&nbsp; So I shut the machine off, thinking it may have gotten hot.&nbsp; Let it sit for 6 hours.&nbsp; Came back to the machine, same message.&nbsp; Disabled the second hard drive, and was about to do the same with the 2nd DVD only to find out that now the
 BIOS is showing no CD-rom units.&nbsp; Every upgrade seems to throw them out.&nbsp; Which makes the recovery disks useless.&nbsp; I have to wait til I get Windows up and running and tell it to search for new hardware, and I have my roms back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've previously had problems with Windows 10 updates, so used the Windows Installation Media File and installed on USB.&nbsp; This has always worked in the past.&nbsp; When I boot to the USB, I receive the message "It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from
 installation media.&nbsp; If you want to continue with the upgrade, remove the media from your PC and click Yes.&nbsp; If you want to perform a clean installation instead, click No."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the USB, and click Yes, the system restarts and I am back to the first message.&nbsp; So, I click No, then Repair your computer. Then to Troubleshoot to get to Advanced Options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I go to Command Prompt - where I do a system scan. "Verification 100% complete" Do a quick Directory listing, everything seems as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I try Startup Repair Windows 10 - which gives me "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC", tells me to try other options or to shut down.&nbsp; Gives a log file as a reference (C:/windows/system32/logfiles/srt/srttrail.txt) Check it out, everything says
 OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step is to try system restore.&nbsp; Message I get "No restore points have been created on your computer's system drive."&nbsp; I do restore points every few days.&nbsp; I assume that for the restore points to be missing that a major update was done which wiped out
 my previous restore points or would cause mass confusion in the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I tried to go back to previous build - Message this time "We ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build.&nbsp; Try resetting your current build instead. (Troubleshoot - Reset this PC)"&nbsp; I don't get that option.&nbsp; I understand
 it, it's just not an available option on my screen.</p>

</p><p>I really don't want to wipe and start over with a fresh load, any suggestions on where I go from here?</p>

<p>Hi Elaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you may experience problems with the update due to a corrupted/incomplete installation or compatibility issue. To provide you the accurate resolution, we'd like to gather more information:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and version of Windows 10 is currently installed on your computer?</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we recommend that you follow the steps in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to troubleshoot Windows Update issues. It will
 let you choose which version of Windows you are experiencing the problem and try performing the instructions provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you need additional help.</p>

<p>Difficult to say which version/build of Windows 10 is currently on the computer.&nbsp; Haven't figured out how to get winver to work from C prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article is of little help, though it would be a neat tool, if I could get my computer into windows to be able to run the Windows Update Troubleshooter.</p>

<p>Was unable to get into safe mode via Recovery.&nbsp; By 3am, it was a draw, which would make it out of the cornfield, the computer or the shotgun!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, I learn from past mistakes or rather problems encountered with Win 10 updates.&nbsp; Years ago when I owned a computer shop, I would preach to my customers to "back up".&nbsp; Thankfully all of my data is saved to an external drive.&nbsp; The only thing on C is
 the OS and programs.&nbsp; Still, it's a pain to format and re-install everything.&nbsp; Especially when you're on a limited internet allotment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A fresh install of Win 10 1607 is back on. Of course, she tried to automatically update, got to 70% and crashed.&nbsp; Did that before.&nbsp; Needless to say the system is back on a metered connection and no more updates will be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What causes the problems with the updates?&nbsp; A hiccup in the satellite internet service?&nbsp; Incompatible update files? Nine year old hardware?&nbsp; Possibly a combination of all.&nbsp; As time goes on, operating systems become more and more sophisticated and use more
 and more resources, and those of us with older systems will fall by the wayside.&nbsp; I don't need anything fancier or the latest and greatest just to juggle the farm books and maintain contact with distant relatives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all for keeping an OS updated.&nbsp; I only wish that Microsoft allowed the end-user the option of selecting which updates to install. &nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need the "overhaul" updates, just the security and drivers.&nbsp; (And I definitely don't need all of these other
 things running in the background eating up my internet service.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I appreciate your attempt to rectify the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Prasad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An unknown background program is possibly causing the cursor issue. That being said, I will need more information to properly address your concern. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Did you notice any system setting changes prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you performed so far?</li><li>Is your Surface Book <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update Windows 10">up to date</a></strong>?</li><li>What is the current <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>OS Build</strong></span> of your Windows 10 system? Right-click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong>, and then scroll down to
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>specifications</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let's perform a clean boot to isolate which program is possibly causing the issue. This isolation method will start your device with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. Refer to the section:
<em><strong>How to perform a clean boot</strong></em> from this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support

    <title>I do not have Windows Photo Viewer for Windows 7&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> caliberplex  say:</h3>
<h2>            I do not have Windows Photo Viewer for Windows 7&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently ran into issues with&nbsp;<em>malware</em>&nbsp;in which it ruined my computer so it had to be reformatted. My father, who is in a career based around computers and anything code based or component based around technology, reformatted it and installed a
 default program of Windows 7 as that is what my computer can run. Upon re-installation, everything was running just fine until I noticed my video player wasn't working; nor was my photo viewer. The video player I just didn't have it defaulted so that's that.
 But the Photo Viewer? I know that one: It runs by default on&nbsp;<span>Windows 7's Windows Photo Viewer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And its not there. I looked through other discussions and download links and such but I do not know&nbsp;<span>how to get&nbsp;</span><span>Windows Photo Viewer for Windows 7</span>. I even went to&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft's own product installation page</strong>&nbsp;to
 collect the driver update to fix it and no luck. Can somebody please tell me how I may&nbsp;<span>install Window 7's Windows Photo Viewer</span>&nbsp;<em>simply</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>with no coding</em>&nbsp;or any stuff like that. If this isn't possible either some random
 person on the internet please explain why not or a staff member.</p>

    <title>Why do I get&#58; &#34;Can&#39;t change the size of items on this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superjosh64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I get&#58; &#34;Can&#39;t change the size of items on this display&#34; in Control Panel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the Display item of the the Control Panel, I am unable to Change the Size of All Items for different displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two displays that I use, one is the netbook's built-in screen, and one is a desktop monitor. On the netbook, things look too small, but I like the way they look when things are scaled up using the Control Panel's display options. However, when I plug
 into the desktop monitor, things are too big and they need to be set back to the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I try to set scaling levels for the different displays, the scale slider is greyed out and cannot be selected. At the very bottom, there is a message that says "Can't change the size of items on this display" with no further explanation or help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I set it up so it uses one scale size for the netbook screen, and one scale size for the desktop monitor?<br />

<p>We would like to know the following information from you to assist you <br />
further. </p>

<div>1) What is the make and model of the netbook and the second monitor? <br />
2) Do you face the same problem with the netbook display? <br />
<br />
<div>I would suggest you to follow the section “<strong>Recommended screen resolutions</strong>”&nbsp;&nbsp; of the link given below and set the recommended screen resolution and then check the issue.</div>
<div>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the instructions for setting my monitor to its native resolution, I found that the monitor is already set at the recommended resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to change the size of all items, it will allow me to change it on each monitor individually, both on the desktop and the netbook monitor. But when I try to use a different setting for each monitor, that's when it disallows me from making any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put it most directly, when I uncheck the box that says "Let me choose one scaling level for all of my displays," then that makes all the options and controls become unavailable, and I get the message that I "Can't change the size of items on this display."</p>
<p>

            The answer is very simple: check the box that says "Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays," then click apply. &nbsp;Log out, then back in again, and you should now have the ability to change the size.<br />
<br />
I had to figure this one out on my own today too... No one seemed to know the answer online or otherwise, but I knew it wasn't a driver issue. And you certainly shouldn't need to perform a system restore! :)

<p>* Under <strong>General tab</strong>, select OS (C:) or accordingly where OS installed,</p>
<p>*&nbsp;Ensure that "<span><strong>Don't move files to the Recycle Bin, Remove files immediately when deleted". Remove files immediately when deleted"

            <p>&nbsp;Those aren't MS files, so they must be some form of malware.&nbsp; Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into
<u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            <p>Unless your using x-p there is no longer (windows mail)</p>
<p>Windows 7 does not come with a default email client as x-p did with outlook express,</p>
<p>That's Live mail part of windows live essentials 2011,</p>
<p>So these exe files should be produced twice a day not just once, basically updating the Live mail program which your calling windows mail,</p>
<p>What you can do is go to Uninstall a program or Programs and features,</p>
<p>Scroll to the bottom of the list and look for Windows live essentials 2011 and see if it exists.</p>
<p>You might even look at Appdata Local and see if you have this kind of garbage listings of Empty folders left behind,</p>

                    <p>Hello. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new HP Envy All-in-One 24-N014 with Windows 10 already installed&nbsp;on the computer, and the touch screen is not working. The touch screen is one of the main reasons why I bought it. How do I fix this? This is crazy especially since I have spent
 so much money on the high end computer. </p>

    <title>Unable to install Streets &#38; Trips 2011, error&#58; Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billallen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Streets &#38; Trips 2011, error&#58; Microsoft Streets &#38; Trips 2011 requires the installation of the Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; 2010 Redistributable</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Streets &amp; Trips 2011 with GPS Locator install problem</p>
<p>I am trying to install Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips 2011 with GPS Locator from DVD and it fails very early in the install.&nbsp; My environment is an HP 8560w Elite Workbook running Win 7 Prof and Microsoft Office 2010 Professional (8GB of memory, 500GB disk space).<br />
<br />
Let me stress that&nbsp; I will not be plugging the GPS stick into a USB port until the install process or the the installed software calls for it.&nbsp; The install starts with the display:<br />
<br />
"Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips 2011 requires the installation of the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable. To install the component now, click OK. If you want to stop the installation and exit Setup, click Cancel."<br />
<br />
I clicked OK to proceed with the install. Another message was displayed:<br />
<br />
"Please wait while the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable is installed."<br />
<br />
After a fairly brief delay, a final message was displayed:<br />
<br />
"One of the prerequisite components failed to install. Setup will now exist."<br />
<br />
I check my installed programs list in Programs and Features and Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable is already installed, listed as:<br />
<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64 Redistributable - Version 10.0.40219<br />
Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x86 Redistributable - Version 10.0.40219<br />
<br />
I've tried to run the install several times but it always fails and ends at the same point.<br />
<br />
What must I do to successfully install Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips 2011 with GPS Locator?<br />
<br />
William Allen<br />

            I thank everyone for their input on my captioned problem.<br />
<br />
As I indicated in one of my earlier replies to myself, for me, this problem is closed now.&nbsp; Microsoft Support accepted my MS Streets &amp; Trips w/ GPS for a full refund.&nbsp; At least, the support staff I spoke to acknowledged that ST2011 was known to be incompatible
 with W7P SP1 and they offered the full refund.<br />
<br />
A number of the replies I received offered possible solutions that I had tried and said so in previous updates to this thread (e.g., running the install from the data.msi on the install CD).&nbsp; While I still had possession of the ST2011 software, I was not made
 aware of the Microsoft reset tool mentioned by Mike L. Robbins so I can't say whether that would get me through my installation problems.&nbsp; So be it, everything was send back to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I can only hope that <span style="font-style: italic"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-style: italic">if</span></span></span> Microsoft releases Streets &amp; Trips 2012 that is does not inherit the problems I experienced.&nbsp; I consider this
 thread to be closed now.&nbsp; Thank you all.<br />
<br />
Certainly continue to reply to this topic if others might benefit from your proposed solutions to ST2011 installs.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Sudoku performance issue on Windows 10 computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Repeated loss of solved history problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Microsoft Sudoku in Windows 10 for several months without problems. &nbsp;Last week started having problems of loading Sudoku, and then when it sometimes loads my history of previous months, weeks and days is missing - even after solving all 3 daily games
 and getting the bonus, returning later the games show as not having been played. &nbsp;I sometimes get the message that Sudoku couldn't connect to the internet and to check my internet is working. &nbsp;It is, (Fibre broadband) without problems. &nbsp;Every bit of my computer
 has the latest drivers installed. &nbsp;Internet connection troubleshooted without problems. &nbsp;Deleted and reloaded Sudoku several times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest what I might have missed or what steps I might take next?</p>

<p>Let me put this into a form that you'll understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sudoku locks up when it's waiting for ads to download. Obviously, this program is neither multi-threaded, or even smart enough to poll of ads. Rather, it's all simply linear, and while ads are downloading the rest of the program is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WILL BE NO LONGER PLAYING THIS GAME AND WHOEVER IS EXPECTING TO GET THEIR ADS TO MY EYEBALLS WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO DO SO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, before you ask, I am a techno guru and I do realize that the slow response of my ISP is a contributing factor. Shame on them, and I will be complaining to them. But, this kind of programming problem on the Microsoft end of things occurs when developers
 have the advert server "sitting under their desk" and so never see the consequences of their sloppy programming because they never experience slow response from the advert server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that put things into economic perspective? Good! Then fix this, or give us a game we can buy which completely and totally eliminates the adverts altogether.</p>

    <title>I&#39;ve uninstalled Bluesoleil and Bluetooth doesn&#39;t work anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahmed h. ramzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;ve uninstalled Bluesoleil and Bluetooth doesn&#39;t work anymore</h2>
                    <p>I was attempting to connect a Wiimote to my laptop and discovered a list telling me to install a program called Bluesoleil. After a bit of searching for a free version, I found Bluesoleil 10.0.464.0 on Softonic. I then went through the wizard and restarted
 my laptop as instructed. It restarted normally and I found the bluesoleil icon on my desktop. The list told me to click on the orange circle in the middle and it would detect my wiimote. When I would click it, nothing would happen so I right clicked and discovered
 my bluetooth was 'off' and wanted me to 'Turn on bluetooth.' I'm currently using Windows 10 so when I did click this option, a little widget appeared in the bottom-right corner saying 'Bluetooth: Turning on bluetooth' and then the widget would disappear, doing
 nothing in the process. In the end, I found the program useless and uninstalled it. First the desktop icon, then the program through the control panel. I also deleted any trace of the program on my laptop except for the zip file. Now, when I try to use bluetooth,
 nothing is detected. All my previous devices I connected using bluetooth would not connect. (e.g. pressing the PS button on my ps4 controller would keep it flashing blue and not detect my laptop as it was previously connected.) Attempting to reconnect anything
 lost would not work (it was basically just the ps4 controller). Nor would I be able to connect the wiimote, again, not detected. I've tried other methods such as starting and stopping programs on the 'Services' app ('Bluetooth Handfree Service' and 'Bluetooth
 Support Service') and attempting to reinstall my bluetooth drivers (couldn't do that). FYI: my bluetooth drivers are:</p>
<p>-Mediatek Bluetooth Adaptor</p>
<p>-Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator</p>
<p>-Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to re clarify, I am currently using Windows 10. Please, anyone with a solution contact me ASAP.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Anup,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is made by Hewlett Packard and my model is the&nbsp;HP Pavilion g6 Notebook PC.</p>
<p>The error is that my bluetooth does not detect any devices even though it should (yes, bluetooth does turn on and perform scans, the issue is it should detect something in the scans, whatever it is, but it isn't). Not only have I tried detecting devices
 through the bluetooth option in the settings application, but I've tried through the 'Connected devices' option by clicking on 'Add a device' at the top and, yet again, nothing was detected. I also got a popup from Norton Security saying 'You are connected
 to an unsecured network' each time I attempt this method. The other method was through the 'Add a device' option in the Control Panel under 'Hardware and Sound'. Again, same issue, nothing detected. I've tried checking for newer versions for my bluetooth drivers(mentioned
 in the first post) but they tell me it's up to date. I also can't find anything online on HP's website or otherwise. Just to note: all my previously used bluetooth devices have had their drivers erased, thus not being detected a second time.</p>
<p>Also, something I forgot to say last post was if I wait a bit after the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">'Bluetooth: Turning on bluetooth' popup, another popup appears saying I had to update Bluesoleil to the latest
 version (being 0.10.494.0). If I were to click this popup, they would take me to the main download page for Bluesoleil. Proceeding would lead me to a pace where I have to buy the program. I don't know if this was necessary to know but the more info the better.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When I tried using the troubleshoot method you gave me, it were as if nothing happened. I followed your steps and restarted my computer, only to find things exactly the same.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Your second method was impossible to me since, like I previously mentioned here, I couldn't find the bluetooth drivers on HP's website.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you could reply with any more tips or suggestions, it would be much appreciated.</span></p>

            for me its as soon as i double click my computer or open explorer. I got XP SP3, Pentium 4 2.40ghz 1gb ram. I used the performance monitor on one of my tests when i opened it and let it set and pretty much as soon as i open explorer my CPU meter maxes
 out and it will take up to 2 hours to load and same for any single click i make.i also have taken off any none essiential programs thinking it could be some kinda conflict. and nothing. So if anyone has any ideas how to fix this please help!

<p>My problem is in certain (not all) folders, when I right click the mouse on an icon, explorer freezes and I have to go to the task manager to END the session (reports that session as Not Responding).</p>
<p>Cannot do any function related to the right mouse click in only some windows.</p>
<p>I've run driver checks and all sorts of suggested programs to see if that would fix it.&nbsp; Nothing fixes it.</p>

<p>The job of Windows Explorer is to examine what is in the disk and its directories and present that information to the user.&nbsp; If the disk or directories on the disk are corrupted, it confuses Windows Explorer and can cause it to lock.&nbsp; Anytime that Windows
 Explorer locks up, the first step should be to run a check of the disk (chkdsk) with the /f or /r option.</p>

&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265</a> &gt;</p>
<p>Disk checks can routinely take hours to complete depending on hard disk size and speed.&nbsp; If corruption is present, it can take longer.&nbsp; Plan on running the check overnight or when you won't need your computer for a while.&nbsp; Also, if corruption is present,
 files could be lost.&nbsp; If possible, back up what you can before running the disk check.</p>

            <p>Being in tech support for IBM since 1967, one of the first procedures I took was to do a chkdsk /f on the disk.&nbsp; No problems found. I took other utilities I have that do system and operational verifications, including one that logs what the system does when
 you click on any function.&nbsp; The only result in the log shows that I executed the explorer routine and it stopped responding - instantly. No errors, no system events logged with errors, no errors found with files, no driver missing msgs, no .dll file faults,
 no 'nothing' reported.&nbsp; Sound like MS has just screwed us with one of their updates and won't take the responsibility for doing it (to me, at least, it sounds like that).&nbsp; I guess I have seen too many PTF's and updates that made more problems than repaired
 them over the years.</p>

            When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song...).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.&nbsp; If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and
 then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about
 since some installed software installs new ones without telling you about it.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView, under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move the Microsoft column closer
 to the top so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header for Microsoft to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; The non Microsoft extensions are the suspicious extensions.<br />
<br />
The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; XP explorer crashing&nbsp; (you have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in groups of 3-5 at a time) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired.<br />
<br />
The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required. <br />
<br />
Test your right click failure condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to behave, you will know that some extension in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.<br />
<br />
If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Remember - disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled so you can always enable it again.&nbsp; That way you can toggle back and forth, enabled/disabled to be sure you have the correct extension under scrutiny.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure the changes "stick".&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave.&nbsp; When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can
 enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the error and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list.<br />
<br />

            I am away from my computer for the weekend so I am unable to try until Monday. I aleardy did the DISM repair commands and they went through after the second try, for whatever reason it had an "87" error but the second try worked. I tried startup repair
 and it failed and also tried to revert back to a restore point but the restore point failed. I will update on Monday sometime.&nbsp;
