<h2>            How do i install KB890830&#63;</h2>
                    Looking over my updates I noticed under Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool it was marked important but was canceled. How can I install it manually?

<p>Vedendo post in giro dato che sono un beta tester, questo mese ho fatto degli aggiornamenti intorno ai 230/240 mega byte, mentre alcuni utenti hanno ricevuto aggiornamenti da più di un giga. Qualcuno sa darmi una spiegazione al riguardo?</p>

    <title>Xbox Microphone Sensitivity Adjustment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aric jc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Microphone Sensitivity Adjustment</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to adjust the Microphone sensitivity like on the PS3.&nbsp; People can hear everything going on in the room and I can hear the same from them so it seems to be a common problem that people are ignoring I guess.&nbsp; I would like
 to be able to adjust the way I sound to other people that I am online with and I do not see that option maybe I am missing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As of now there isn't an option with the Xbox to change the mic sensitivity. Higher end headsets have great noise reduction and won't pick up things going on in the room around you. Are you using the Xbox headset that comes with the console?</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. It's really annoying. I have 300 dollar headset and there is no setting on Xbox One for mic sensitivity. The headset works fine on Xbox 360, PS3 and PS4

<p>I hear other people in games with the same issue so what is being done about this? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue here and driving me nuts. &nbsp;I picked up a Karga with a noise canceling mic but it still pics up background way too much.
</p>
<p>Im going to try a bit of foam on the mic but Im surprised I cant turn down the sensitivity at all. I tried it out on my PC and there are no issues at all...</p>

<p>Hi, I can't join or start a party and have done lots of troubleshooting with 2 different volunteers in chat and nothing has seemed to work. The reference code is 1318874654. Please help we did the basics from resetting the console to complicated things like
 terminating my account off my friends PC, which we had to discover was there. Again, please help with any suggestions! &nbsp;</p>

<p>My son's account has this issue. &nbsp;The above didn't work for me. &nbsp;What's interesting is that when I go to invite him into a party from my account, his gamer tag shows up twice, but the 2nd one on the list has an older gamerpic from a few days ago (we changed
 it trying to troubleshoot the issue). &nbsp; If we update the gamerpic on his account, it updates the 1st entry in the list.</p>
<p>When I click on "leave party" nothing happens. &nbsp;Even logged out of his account on one of our Xbox Ones and when logging back in, he's still connected to me as a party member. &nbsp;We've even had a bunch of his friends join the party to see if that would change
 anything. &nbsp;They can all play &amp; chat fine, but my son is still blocked.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions to try?</p>

<p>1. Make sure the Xbox Profile is not signed in on Xbox App at any Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>2. Sign into your account, or the account experiencing the error.</p>
<p>3. Sign in a second account on the console. Ensure the problematic account is added as a friend. Scroll down to the account name and select 'join party'.</p>
<p>4. Scroll up and select the problematic account. Select 'sign out'. This will remove the problematic account as host in the party, replacing them with the second account.</p>
<p>5. Switch back to the second account (this should be the only active account at this point), scroll down to 'Party' and select 'leave party'.</p>

<h2>            Slow internet with wifi since downloading Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a one year old HP all in one desktop. The internet speed was good using a Wi fi connection with Windows 8.1. After installing Windows 10 the Wi fi speed is very slow and some sites won't even load. All my other programs work fine and the internet
 speed is good with a Ethernet connection. There are other lap tops, phones, tablets using the same Wi fi and they are working fine with good internet speed. The trouble shooting function says the network is all good. I have updated drivers and network adapters.
 My router is an older Cisco Linksys. I have rebooted both this and the modem several times. So far nothing has helped. Any ideas what else I can try? I am not real tech savvy so need detailed explanations. Thanks.

            <p>OK, this was really strange to me but I finally found the problem. I did have the latest driver for the Wi-Fi driver adapter and reinstalling it would help for a short time but the Wi-Fi connected internet speed would again slow down. When I downloaded and
 installed Windows 10 my wireless printer did not automatically reinstall. It still worked on the desktop I was having the problems with but didn't show as I wireless device. I don't quite understand this because it wasn't connected with a cable but would still
 print as an e-printer on the menu. It didn't show up on any of the other&nbsp; the&nbsp; devices on our wireless system as an available printer though. It sits on a shelf right under my desktop with the modem and router right next to the desktop. So, I was on the HP
 trouble shooting web site and had a scan done. It said all the drivers were up to date but asked if I wanted to add the printer device. When I reinstalled it and reconfigured the wireless connection for the printer the Wi-Fi internet connection started working
 again perfectly. I guess somehow the printer that was plugged in but only turned on when I occasionally needed it was blocking the signal.</p>
<p>I know a rather length explanation but just wanted to add this info. I do like Windows 10 especially since everything is working again.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to update the network adapter drivers and check if it helps.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above mentioned method does not fix the issue then, uninstall and reinstall drivers from device manager. Follow the steps from the article,<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/948187</a> (Applicable for Windows 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also visit Toshiba website to download the latest update. Choose the correct model to download the drivers.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the issue with performance, I would suggest you to run performance troubleshooter and check the status of the computer.<br />

            &nbsp;Hi Michael,
<div><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>You can skip the option to set up a Microsoft user account when setting up the computer for first time. When you are prompted to connect your PC to a Microsoft account, click on “I’m not this user” or “I’m not username”. This will take you to the local user
 account page. You can also switch to a Local Account in case if you have already set up a Microsoft Account.
<br />
a. Press “Windows key +X”.<br />
b. Go to Settings<br />
c. Choose Accounts and then select Other User Accounts towards the left.<br />
d. You will get an option “Switch to a Local account” right below your user account name.<br />
e. Select “Switch to a local account” option.<br />
f. Enter the required details.<br />
g. Then login to the local account and check how it works.<br />
<br />
You can always change the local account you are using in to a Microsoft user account at any time. To use many new features like&nbsp;OneDrive and other sync features, you will need a Microsoft user account.
<br />
You may refer to the article below to check out the advantages of using a Microsoft user account:<br />
<br />

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/microsoft-account-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Microsoft accounts</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you decide to change your local account into a Microsoft account later, you can refer to these steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press Windows key + X, select ‘Settings’.<br />
b. Now, click on ‘Accounts’ in the left pane.<br />
c. Click on ‘user account’ and then click on ‘Connect to a Microsoft account’ and enter your credentials.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</div>

<p>I am suffering with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the local administrator is a Microsoft account you DON'T have the option to go back as far I know.</p>
<p>In the Accounts, Your Account there is NO option "Sign in with a local account"&nbsp;for&nbsp;the local administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please provide an answer on how you can switch back to a local account if the LOCAL ADMINISTRATOR is a Microsoft Account.</p>

            <p>Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by the original asker, your response does not answer the question at all. I am facing exactly the same problem. The problem is that the default Administrator account has been linked to my Microsoft account. Please note that there is NO way of
 delinking the account after this. Moreover, as mentioned by Michael, I am also unable to link it to any other local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened for me after upgrading from Windows 7 where I was using the default administrator account as my daily login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no help available across the internet, and I have already lost all my data and a whole bunch of programs (including original Microsoft Office Professional Plus) because of a stupid group policy that disallowed MS Accounts on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please resolve this, replicate this, or at the very least take down a&nbsp;High Severity Low Frequency Bug Request.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>VERY SLOW &#40;&#60;200kb&#47;sec&#41; File Copy between Win7 Machines - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmac99  say:</h3>
<h2>            VERY SLOW &#40;&#60;200kb&#47;sec&#41; File Copy between Win7 Machines Over 300Mb Wireless Network</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>This problem has been driving me crazy for over a week now, and I would really appreciate some help.</p>
<p>I have a PC running Win7 Ultimate connected to my 300Mbps Wireless-N network in my office.&nbsp; This machine connects to the network just fine at 104Mbps (card limitation) and can copy/transfer files to/from our file servers over this wireless-n network at 12-15Mbps.&nbsp;
 Works perfectly, and I have really been enjoying Win7!!</p>
<p>I've just added&nbsp;a new ZINO HD (Dell Inspiron 400)&nbsp;with a Dell 1520 802.11 b/g/n wireless NIC running Win7 Pro which connects to the same wireless-n network at 216Mbps (according to the "Network and Sharing Center").&nbsp; However, any files that I copy/transfer
 to/from the ZINO from/to the Win7 Ultimate PC or our file servers&nbsp;move at speeds ranging from 54Kbps to 972Kbps, and the rate sometimes goes up and down during the copy/transfer.</p>
<p>I have no problems with the speed of files downloaded/uploaded from/to the Internet from the ZINO over this same wireless network.&nbsp; The ZINO has 5-bars on the connectivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tested to make sure that all of the ZINO drivers are the latest and operating correctly.&nbsp; I have also played with a number of various settings on the ZINO NIC with no change, and tried various router (Linksys WRT150N) settings without luck.&nbsp; I have
 tested with the firewall(s) on and off and tried a number of other suggestions I've found on various forums, all to no avail.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any help you may be able to give.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>OK, my team has found a solution to our problem.&nbsp; Here are the steps:</p>
<p>1. Running as Administrator in Command Prompt, type: "<strong>netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled</strong>"</p>
<p>2. Next, follow the instructions that Amrita wrote above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First enter: "<span><span><strong><span><span>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled</span></span></strong></span></span>" and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then enter: "<span><span><span><span><strong>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal</strong><span>" to restore it to the
 typical setting.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>3. Finally, go to Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Turn Windows Features on or off &gt; and check "Simple TCPIP services (i.e. echo, daytime,
 etc.) so that it is enabled.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>4. Reboot your system again, and the file transfer rates should be excellent.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            iPhone Won&#39;t import old photos to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I open photo gallery and it offers to import my photos, it only offers the latest 25 photos. But there are photos on my phone from several months ago that it never imported. How do I get it to recognize or access those old photos? Best guess is that
 maybe I told it not to import those that day, and it coded them as already imported? Anyway, I want to download those pictures, but I can't get it to recognize of find them on my phone. It doesn't give me an option to "search" my phone for which photos I want
 to import. Only Continue or Cancel. Any work arounds?</p>

<p>I was recently backing up a iphone for an older person. I couldn't figure out why there were 900 photos but only 100+ available for backup.</p>
<p>It appears she had cloud backup enabled. So rather than full versions of her pictures, she had lesser quality smaller versions available for viewing on her phone, but the real high quality images were all on the cloud storage leaving only the last month
 or two of actual photos left on the device. Check your cloud.</p>

<p>I used to use Might Fax which was bullet proof and very simple to use. Unfortunately that program does not work with W 7.</p>

<p>Original title: <span>Strange Sound Problems...</span></p>
<p>I keep getting really weird sound problems! Whenever I try to do any non-windows application involving sound, my Audio Device just crashes. The icon changes to a speaker with an X. If i wait about a minute, it comes back, but, instead of what I should get
 I just get a buzzing. Its usually repeating part of the sound that was playing when it crashed. I tried to update my drivers, but it says their up-to-date. The only way to fix the sound is to restart, but then it happens again...</p>

<p><span>Hi Dudewithquestions,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the computer before you encountered this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: To disable speaker audio enhancements</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the Playback tab, click Speakers, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Enhancements tab, and then select the Disable all enhancements check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you don't see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Make sure the option “Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device” is checked</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Sound dialog box, click the Playback tab, click the speaker device, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the Advanced tab, check the option ‘Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device’ check box, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Re-install the audio drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since you’ve tried to up-to-date the audio drivers, I would still suggest you to completely uninstall the audio drivers and then install the latest
 audio drivers from the computer/sound card manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, Video and Game controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the audio component and choose uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you completely uninstall the audio drivers, install the latest audio drivers from the computer manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4: Provide the latest event log information for any further troubleshooting</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</a></span></p>

<p>Totaly agree is not mutch diffrens or mutch more work to make Android work for all android devices include Android TV.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Self am have Sony Bravida in every tv room i have a tv one, and one Xbox One, and One Nivida Shield TV.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
my Xbox One can some people play at so is busy, and even if that device is free is pretty unnessery change HDMI port just for Skype.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Skype Preview should support all devices inside of Android serie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would be great!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the "regular" Android skype&nbsp;ver. 7.46.0.596 on my Philips 55POS9901F Android 6.0.1,
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;can send and receive msg. and I can receive videocalls But I can't get the cam to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Android for TV don't support webcams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a few programs that are suppose to make use of a external USB webcam but it seems that you need a USB OTG enabled port and since my tv only have USB type A (OTG only seems to be availably on micro USB since the USB A is missing one wire that is used
 by OTG) so the closest I got was for one program to recognize my &nbsp;C920 but It wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is where my skills end, but someone who is smarter then me might be able to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW Nivida Shield TV is supposed to&nbsp; have support for Logitech C270 and C920. so it might work on it.</p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a function key doesn’t work on your keyboard, it means that there is a configuration that needs to be changed on your device settings and you need to press it with the
<strong>Fn</strong> key simultaneously. This depends on the model of your keyboard or your computer. To isolate your concern with this function key, we’d like to know the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The version of your Windows. To know which version of Windows you are using, press
<strong>Windows + R</strong> to open run window, type <span style="color: rgba(0, 112, 192, 1)">
winver</span> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>If you are using a desktop computer or laptop.</li><li>Make and model of your computer.</li><li>Model and brand of your keyboard.</li><li>If your keyboard has an <strong>Fn</strong> key.</li><li>If there are any error messages you encounter when you press this key.</li><li>If you changed your keyboard function key settings in your BIOS (basic input/output system).</li><li>Troubleshooting steps you’ve done so far.</li><li>Changes you've made prior to your concern.<span>
</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I had all my photos organized in Windows 8 Pictures&nbsp;in named folders that displayed as albums. After upgrading to Win 10, all the album names disappeared (pictures and original folders are fine), and all photos were reorganized under date taken in the
 Pictures app. How do I get it back the way it was. Right now it is a disorganized mess.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you that in windows 10 photo</span><span> app, you can only sort via month.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 has a new Photos app that does more than just display your pictures as a slideshow. This new default app organizes
 your pictures by date taken (and even creates curated albums for you), features a few nice editing tools for image enhancement, and lets you share pictures via social networks and email. While it's not going to replace Photoshop any time soon, the Photos app
 is worth a look.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Collections and albums</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The new photos app has two main sections: Collection and Albums. In the Collection section, you'll see a collection of all
 your photos, grouped by date taken (in reverse chronological order). If you want to quickly find photos from a certain time period without scrolling through all of the photos in your collection, click or tap on a date to zoom out to a list of all past months.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Albums section is a little different. Here, you'll find albums that the Photos app creates for you automatically, based
 on date taken, location, and possibly facial recognition (people in the photos). At the moment, it doesn't look like you can manually create albums, so this section is a little barren.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Add a folder</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At first, the only photos in your Photos app will be those from your Pictures folder and possibly anything saved on your
 OneDrive. To add another folder to the Photos app, open the app, go to <strong>Settings
</strong>and under the <strong>Sources</strong> section, click or tap <strong>Add a folder</strong>. Find the folder you want to add, select it, and click
<strong>Add this folder to Pictures</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you'd rather not have your OneDrive photos show up in the Photos app, go to
<strong>Settings </strong>and turn off <strong>Show my photos and videos from OneDrive</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Edit and enhance</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The new Photos app does have some editing features, including filters and a one-click Enhance button that applies some basic
 fixes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To edit a photo in the Photos app, click on the photo to open it and click the pencil icon to open the editing platform.
 To the left of your photo, you'll see the different categories: Basic fixes, filters, light, color, and effects. Basic fixes include the one-click Enhance button, as well as rotation, cropping, straightening, red-eye, and "retouch," which lets you tap and
 smooth away blem</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>In the Light menu, you can adjust brightness, contrast, highlights, and shadows. Brightness and contrast are pretty self-explanatory,
 but the highlight and shadow adjusters are useful for fixing a photos that has different lighting levels (e.g., very bright spots that need to be dimmed or very dark spots that need to be brightened). In the Color menu, you can tweak temperature, tint, and
 saturation; there's also a feature called Color boost, which lets you pick out one color and make it more or less prominent.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Filters and Effects menu are where you can get your Instagram-style fix: The Filters menu offers six filters, including
 black and white, while the Effects menu lets you add a vignette effect (fade the corners of the image to black or white) or tilt-shift the focus.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While you're editing your image, you can compare it with the original by clicking and holding the compare button at the top
 of the screen. The top menu also has undo/redo buttons, as well as the options to save the original image or save a copy of the image.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Share your pictures</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Sharing your pictures from the Photos app is pretty simple. You can share individual photos or several photos at once --
 to share several photos, go to the collection section and click <strong>Select</strong> at the top of the screen. Select the photos you want to share and a
<strong>Share </strong>button will appear at the top of the screen. </span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>Click this button or use the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Windows key + H</strong> to open the Share toolbar, which will list the apps you can use to share your photos (this will vary depending on what apps you have installed, but Facebook, Twitter, and Mail should all be on there).</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

    <title>Movie Maker in Win10-1903 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Movie Maker in Win10-1903</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>after the latest update to built 1903 Movie maker wlmp files/projects created previously are not opening properly anymore!</p>
<p>Some, but not all, movie clips in the project are corrupt / not showing, even though nothing has been moved or renamed.</p>
<p>Under "Fix It" only one solution is offered - to delete the clip...?!?</p>
<p>The next time I open the same wlmp file/project and different clips are failing.</p>
<p>I tried the same on another computer - same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix? Something must be different in 1903.</p>
<p>Or is Movie Maker finally totally history?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Sunburst.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Windows Live 2012 apps are being actively shut down now so it's not surprising there will be this type of dysfunction after a Version Update since they aren't being support for any further updates and even having functions shut off now.  
<br />
<br />Now may be the time to switch to the Movie Maker in Photos app, or one of the other free alternatives here:

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Sunburst55
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Please keep in mind, Microsoft stopped supporting Windows Live Movie Maker 2012 and Windows Essentials 2012 back in January 2017. So, there is likely a compatibility issue. 
<br />
<br />You could try uninstall it then reinstall it from the Windows Essentials suite to see if it starts working again:

<br />
<br />If that does not work, I would personally recommend you rollback to your previous version if you want to keep using this software. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1903 again. See instructions how to block it:
