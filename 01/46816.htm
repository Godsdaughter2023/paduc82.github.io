<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Failed 2X</h2>
                    <p>Two attempts to upgrade to Win 10 using Windows Update have failed</p>
<p>With difficulty, went back to the previous build (Windows 7).</p>
<p>Windows Update Error 0x80070057.</p>
<p>Many suggestions from forum and Google tried and failed.</p>
<p>Also tried:</p>
<p>Windows Update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>Windows Update Diagnostics.diagcab</p>
<p>Fix Windows Update-setup.exe</p>
<p>Microsoft Fixit 50123.msi</p>
<p>Nothing fixed the problem so far, too much time has been consumed</p>
<p>Perhaps install from Flash Drive Installer might work</p>
<p>All suggestions appreciated.</p>

            <p>Duh, it failed twice and you want to try again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>First determine&nbsp;<em>why</em> your previous upgrades failed, and fix the problem(s.) If you aren't able to determine what went wrong or how to fix it,
<em>don't upgrade</em>. Is that not obvious? There's nothing magical about the number 3. Why take the chance of messing up a perfectly good Windows 7 system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're that desperate to try a new operating system - Microsoft loves you - buy a computer with Windows 10 pre-installed. But not now. Wait until the middle of 2016. By then Windows 10 will have benefited from two major upgrades.</p>

            It's not that I'm eager for by Windows 10 but rather I'm more interested in the cause and correction of the failure.

            <p>I wish it would be easy to determine why an upgrade to Windows 10 failed. Unfortunately, that's not the case. Generally speaking - this won't help you much - upgrades can fail for any of five different reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The existing operating system is not configured in a supported manner in some way.</li><li>The hardware is not compatible with Windows 10 or needs updated drivers.</li><li>Existing software is not compatible with Windows 10, including bloatware installed by the OEM.</li><li>Not following best practices for upgrading.</li><li>Malware infection - but you would know if that's the case.</li></ol>
<p>In general, a clean install often works better because it doesn't have to deal with #1 above. After using a computer for years, who knows what kind of problems are lurking under the hood - things that don't matter that much to your existing OS but can really
 mess up an upgrade. That's why I did a clean install vs. an upgrade. None of my past mistakes can haunt me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install requires a more than usual amount of technical knowledge, including #4 above, which I gained by spending hours of research on the web. Because I wasn't born with a CS degree in my hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My clean install went off without a hitch, and Windows 10 worked perfectly. But I still don't like it. It is, after all, still new and has lots of issues that need work. Not to mention Microsoft's arrogant stance on updates. Of course some people, most of
 whom work at Microsoft, would call it a 'helpful' stance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end I got rid of Windows 10 but stayed in the Insiders program so I can keep up with how Windows 10 develops over time. In the future things could be very different, in a good sort of way.</p>

            <p>All of the points you raised are valid. I have come to the conclusion after many tests and failed suggestions that the operating system is severely corrupted. That means complete reinstall of Windows 7 or clean install of 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is still to be decided.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Btstackserver error causing computer shut down.</p>
<p>This began on the 15th of September after downloading a video game, and began when attempting to run the game, but has since&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;outside playing the game including after I uninstalled it.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>The error message that appears before shutdown reads: "btstackserver.exe error: 0x0054be37 error, 0x000001ef memory could not be read. "</div>
<div>My laptop proceeds to instantly shut down and is unable to start up for a couple of minutes at least. Only once has a blue screen occurred on startup asking to allow troubleshooting to commence, which I allowed. However there was no solution found by the
 computer. I have tried multiple solutions including running a system defrag and cleanup and uninstalling the game. Since a portion of my laptop becomes unusually hot at the time of shutdown, I have also inspected the area and cleaned dust from it in an attempt
 to remove any possible physical blockages.&nbsp;</div>
<div>My laptop is a two year old Asus N61jq and I run Windows 7 x64.</div>
<div>Any assistance is greatly appreciated.</div>

<h2>            Nvidia Dynamic Super Resolution not working since Windows 10 update 1709</h2>
                    Nvidia Dynamic Super Resolution not working since Windows 10 update 1709. When I try to launch Borderlands 2(dx9) Steam gives the error "Failed to create the D3D9 Device! this can happen if the desktop is locked Exiting". And when I launch Dota 2(dx11)
 with 4k DSR I only see quarter of the screen. All drivers and Windows updated. Very sure that this started happening after the Windows update. Any way to fix this?

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message you received means that the color profile for your monitor has been reset or corrupted. It is also possible that there are drivers that needs an update. Since you're able to update all the drivers&nbsp; on your device, we suggest that you follow

            When doing step 3-3 there weren't&nbsp;<span>qmgr*.dat files in my computer and when doing 3-6 I got errors on most of the commands, not found or gave the error code&nbsp;</span>0x80004005. Computer is working didn't break it but
 the issue still persists. I forgot to mention that I only get the&nbsp;<span>"Failed to create the D3D9 Device!" when I try to run the game in higher resolutions than my native monitor. Which wasn't an issue before the 1709 update.
 I also found out that apart from games I can't increase the desktop resolution from the Nvidia control panel either. I press apply and it doesn't go above 1080p.</span>

<p>- Laptop or desktop machine ? Which Nvidia gpu ?</p>
<p>It looks like the update may have corrupted something. If a Windows sysetm file has been corrupted System File Checker may sort it out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC /SCANNOW Command - System File Checker - Windows 7 Forums</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The 1709 update has caused graphics driver issues for many Win10 Users. More so for those who's machines never had a dedicated
</p>
<p>Win10 made available for their aging hardware, but 1709 is also the first 'feature' update that has overridden the Show/hide tool and
</p>
<p>installed an Nvidia driver on my machine, which was older than the one I had in use before the update.</p>
<p>(I always update my gpu drivers after each feature update as a matter of course anyway).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When you say all drivers are updated... Manually uninstalled and reinstalled, or via GeForec Experience auto update</p>
<p>(Windows Updates or Device Manager are not recommended for gaming machines) ?</p>
<p>Are you using the 390.60 Nvidia driver&nbsp; ? This also has some tweaks that are supposed to help prevent MS's Meltdown/Spectre</p>
<p>patch from causing performance loss (I see they have a newer one 390.77 now too).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not having any problem with DSR&nbsp; on 1709, other than those few games that tend to crash when using a DSR res anyway.</p>
<p>Some general observations that may apply to your issue.</p>
<p>- I'm not on my 3D monitor atm, but believe DSR may conflict with Nvidia 3D Vision if 3D Vision is enabled ?</p>
<p>- If you set a DSR resolution in a game and disable DSR in Control Panel some games will crash while loading when the DSR res</p>
<p>is no longer available (rather than resetting to the minimum res, as any clear thinking game would do ;) ).
<br />
My notes show this results in a D3DERR INVALIDCALL&nbsp; but this may be only one option Win10 may display for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 1709 also made some changes to how Win10 implements screen scaling, which has changed with previous updates as well.</p>
<p>While Windows had taken over control of screen scaling with earlier versions, MS has returned screen scaling to the graphics drivers</p>
<p>in 1703 (or was it not until 1709 ? ).</p>
<p>- This brings us back to the 'old' days when the User could choose a screen scaling option in Nvidia Control Panel to suit their needs.</p>
<p>eg - CS-GO players who like to force wide screen, which could not be done with earlier iterations of Win10 because it only
</p>
<p>allowed resolutions that are native to 4:3 aspect ration to run with black bars on the sides, can now force wide screen with</p>
<p>a low resolution again. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 1709 also causes some old games not to fit the screen correctly (off to the right and down) if you don't use the
<em>Compatibility</em> option </p>
<p><em>Override High DPI Scaling Behavior . </em></p>
<p>This option was also required prior to 1511, but was not necessary after 1703 (or was it 1607 ?)</p>
<p>(Note that Win10 1709 will often force this setting on games that don't really need it, but tends to miss some that do ).</p>
<p>

<p>Desktop GTX 970, did the SFC returned with "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.". I was expecting it to find broken stuff tbh.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Don't have a 3d monitor, just a regular 1080p 60hz monitor. DSR is enabled. I found that different things react differently, Borderlands doesn't open at all, Dota only shows quarter of screen and Desktop resolution doesn't change at all either.</p>

<p>I was forgetting that you don't need a 3D monitor to enable 3D Vision in Nvidia Control Panel, but just checked and found</p>
<p>it does not affect DSR anyway ( G-sync is the option that gets disabled when Stereoscopic 3D gets enabled )</p>

</p><p>Have you played with the three scaling options in - <em>Nvidia Control Panel &gt; Adjust Desktop Size and Position</em> (scaling performed on gpu)</p>
<p>to see if that helps get Dota to run full screen ( I assume clicking Alt/Enter to maximise doesn't help) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The driver may not be the problem, but I don't know what else would cause DSR to not work (except in those situations where is
</p>
<p>does not normally work), but to <em>really</em> be sure the driver well installed, do it the old fashion way.</p>
<p>Download the package from Nvidia. Uninstall the drivers via Programs and Features, and with Win10, disable your internet before you</p>
<p>reboot to install the new driver.</p>
<p>As a safety measure don't install the components you don't use, such as&nbsp; Nvidia HD Audio (only if you use HDMI for audio),</p>
<p>or Nvidia 3D Vision drivers. I would also leave out the Experience, at least while troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Using<em> Display Driver Uninstalle</em>r or<em> Driver Fusion</em> (with care) can also help if a driver install has been corrupted.</p>
<p>These software delete files and Registry keys left behind by normal uninstall via P&amp;F.</p>
<p>(the free version may still leave a couple, but they shouldn't matter)</p>

            So I also found out that apart from only seeing the quarter of it Dota is also constantly flashing black (forgot about this detail), I believe it was trying to make it work but it wasn't working. When I perform scaling on GPU it gives me the ability to
 minimize and shut down Dota which I couldn't with the other setting. I am quiet sure that something is blocking my desktop from changing resolution above native. Works if I go below native. Is there a way to get more help from Windows support?

            Alright I fixed it, apparently you have to disable and enable DSR again and restart your computer to make it work. The reason I wasnt getting any answers on Google was because other subjects who had DSR broken after fall creators update didn't have the
 resolution options show for them when it did for me. Thanks a lot for trying to help.

<p><em>"apparently you have to disable and enable DSR again and restart your computer to make it work."</em></p>
<p>Ah ha ! Now why didn't I think of that ?&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/50987ca7-a647-4883-b20b-cf455499d1eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>Once set you should be able to enable/disable at will from here on. Just shows how Windows errors tend to mislead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT: I've since discovered what may have been the issue with Dota. </p>
<p>COD has an option for 1600x1200 (non DSR), which works on my 27" screen because it has a 1440 height, but on my&nbsp; 24" 1920x1080</p>
<p>screen if I use 1600x1200 the game runs on the left side of the monitor (about two thirds of the screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both monitors have the game running on the left side if I use the next DSR res offered in the game - 2048x1536.</p>
<p>With this res I reckon the reason the game runs on the left side of the screen is 2048x1536 is an dual screen 8:3 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess it may be a good thing the game displays this way when the res doesn't suit the monitor rather than crashing
</p>
<p>to desktop or black screening with an 'out of scanning range', or similar error. ]<br />

<p>Based on the screenshots that you've provided us, your graphics card is using some of your computer's memory. We recommend that you contact your laptop's original equipment manufacturer, and ask them for assistance in adjusting your computer's allotted shared

<p>This is a very frequently asked question and there are many websites that provide detailed explanations.&nbsp; As Joshua Her1 says, the problem is that your video card (Nvidia GeForce G105M) has 512 MB RAM built into the graphics chip.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To expand a bit on what Joshua Her1 said ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even if a hardware device has its own built-in memory (e.g., a video card), Windows has to reserve an "address space" equal to the amount of device memory in order to let the system access and interact with that memory.&nbsp;
 That amount is subtracted from the available system memory and is said to be "hardware reserved" and unavailable even though the physical memory is there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 45.35pt">
<em>Devices have to map their memory below 4 GB for compatibility with non-PAE-aware</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 45.35pt">
<em>Windows releases. Therefore, if the system has 4GB of RAM, some of it is either disabled or is remapped above 4GB by the BIOS. If the memory is remapped, X64 Windows can use this memory. X86 client versions of Windows don’t support physical memory above
 the 4GB mark, so they can’t access these remapped regions. Any X64 Windows or X86 Server release can.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 45.35pt">
<em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 45.35pt">
<em>X86 client versions with PAE enabled do have a usable 37-bit (128 GB) physical address space. The limit that these versions impose is the highest permitted physical RAM address, not the size of the IO space. That means PAE-aware drivers can actually use
 physical space above 4 GB if they want. For example, drivers could map the "lost" memory regions located above 4 GB and expose this memory as a RAM disk.</em></p>
<p>--&nbsp; <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#how_graphics_cards_and_other_devices_affect_memory_limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#how_graphics_cards_and_other_devices_affect_memory_limits</a></p>
<p>Your video card's 512 MB RAM plus a few other hardware devices are occupying a little over 1 GB of your memory space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>You can see what's using the memory this way:</span></p>
<p><span>Open Device Manager (click Start Orb, type devmgmt.msc and press Enter)</span></p>
<p><span>Click View and select "Resources by type"</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the Memory node</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p><span>For more detailed discussion of this see the following articles:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/markrussinovich/2008/07/21/pushing-the-limits-of-windows-physical-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Pushing the Limits of Windows: Physical Memory by Mark Russinovich</span></a></li><li><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/hiltonl/2007/04/13/the-3gb-not-4gb-ram-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>The 3GB-not-4GB RAM problem (MSDN Archive)</span></a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/978610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>The usable memory may be less than the installed memory on Windows 7-based computers</span></a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that you have a moderately old laptop.&nbsp; The Intel core 2 duo T6600 was released in Q1 2009.&nbsp; According to the second of the 3 articles under "detailed discussion" above, "Mobile chipsets on sale today [April 2007] cannot [map memory above 4GB]
 (but that may change with time)."&nbsp; I don't know whether your chipset, released about 2 years after that article was written, has that capability.&nbsp; If not, the only way you'll be able to get more usable memory is to add more physical memory -- assuming that
 is possible (see next paragraph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that you have a 64-bit version of Windows, your operating system can handle more than 4GB RAM.&nbsp; Go to
<a href="http://www.crucial.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/</a> and either enter your computer's make and model under "Crucial Advisor tool" or use the "Crucial System Scanner" and see if your motherboard can accept more memory.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also enter your computer's BIOS and see if there's some setting that might "<em>remap [a portion of your system RAM] above 4GB by the BIOS"
</em>rather than disabling that portion of RAM.&nbsp; And you can go to your computer manufacturer's website and see if there's an updated version of the BIOS for your model.</p>

<h2>            Cannot add Windows 7 PC to domain.  Get the following message.  An attempt to resolve the DNS name of a DC in the domain being joined has failed.</h2>
                    When trying to add a new Windows 7 machine to a network I get the following error message..."An attempt to resolve the DNS name of a DC in the domain being joined has failed. Please verify this client is configured to reach a DNS server that can resolve
 DNS names in the target domain."&nbsp; I don't have any problems adding XP machines to the domain and not sure why I can't add a Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; I am able to get on the internet on the Windows 7 PC but can't add it to the domain.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be greatly
 appreciated.

            We finally got the computer to join the domain by doing the following:&nbsp; in the network adapter IP 4 properties, set the DNS ip address to that of the domain controller,&nbsp;NOT the DNS.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;went back to the computer properties to add the computer to the
 domain, it was added succesfully.&nbsp; After rebooting the machine and logging into the domain account, go back to the IP 4 properties and reset the DNS to automatically get the ip address.&nbsp;

<p>
<span>Hi Alifea,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft answers.
</span></p>
<span>
<p>
<span><span>A.)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You may try opening from the registry editor from the location:
<strong>Start&gt;&gt;Run&gt;&gt; type</strong> <strong>%</strong></span><strong><span>Systemroot%\Regedit.exe</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>B.)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If the issue still persists, then you may have to change few settings in the Group Editor Policy:</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Verify that the "Local Group Policy" or "Domain Group Policy" doesn’t block you from using<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Task Manager".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Go to "<strong>Start</strong>" -&gt; "<strong>Run</strong>" -&gt; Write "<strong>Gpedit.msc</strong>" and press on "<strong>Enter</strong>" button.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Navigate to "<strong>User Configuration</strong>" -&gt; "<strong>Administrative Templates</strong>" -&gt; "<strong>System</strong>" -&gt; "<strong>Prevent Access to Registry Editing Tools</strong>" set the state to Disabled.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;</span>c. Close "<strong>Gpedit.msc</strong>" MMC.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. Go to "<strong>Start</strong>" -&gt; "<strong>Run</strong>" -&gt; Write "<strong>gpupdate /force</strong>" and press on "<strong>Enter</strong>" button.</span></p>
<p>
<span>C.)
<span>&nbsp;</span>If the above steps do not help, you may try booting the computer in Safe Mode and check, safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to
 start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p>
<span>i. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>ii. Start tapping F8 key.</span></p>
<p>
<span>iii. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></p>
<p>
<span>iv. Select the option “Safe mode”.<br />
<br />
</span><span><span>D.)<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You may try enabling the in-built/default&nbsp;administrator on the computer and check, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>To enable the default Administrator account, perform the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Click Start and type CMD in the Start search box</span></p>
<p>
<span>2. Right click on CMD in the list and click on "Run as administrator"</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. Type the following command:
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes.</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>Now check if the above steps have helped you to fix the issue or not.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check if the program is compatible with the version of operating system installed on your computer.
 To check the <strong>compatibility</strong> you may refer the below link:
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the program is not compatible with Windows 7, you might run the program in compatible mode. Refer the below link:
</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step does not resolve you may need to contact the manufacturer of the program or software</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the program is compatible with Windows 7 then run the program by selecting the option “<strong>Run as administrator</strong>”.
 Right click on the program and select “Run as administrator” from the list</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            What is the error message when you try to uninstall Whatsapp?
<br />I suggest you the following steps to make it install:
<br />1. Turn off Quick Heal completely.
<br />2. Install Whatsapp.
<br />3. Add the Whatsapp folder to the exclusions list of QH. This is the closest link I found:
<br />www.quickheal.co.in/tab-queries
<br />4. Turn the AV on again.
<br />If that doesn't help, you might have to report this to QH support so that they can look into this.

<p>Thanks for your prompt response. However it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying it a few times, I asked for Quick Heal online help, gave them remote control and let them try. They declared it has nothing to do with Quick Heal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives an error log called SquirrelSetup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you help me further?</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Does the issue persist while installing a particular game?</p>

<p>Why can't I activate Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>If you received a message saying that Windows couldn't be activated, here are a few reasons why it might not have worked, and some things you can try to fix the problem.</p>
<b>
<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>contact support</u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>A different version of Windows or product key might have been used as part of a repair</p>
</b>
<p>If you took your PC to a repair shop or to a friend who builds and fixes PCs, it's possible that a different version of Windows was installed to complete a repair. Or if the repair shop or your friend used a different product key for your PC, that key might
 be blocked if it was used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>If Windows was activated before you took it to the repair shop or your friend, then re-entering the product key that came with your PC or original copy of Windows might solve the problem. You can also try reinstalling your original version of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>One copy of Windows might have been installed on multiple PCs</p>
</b>
<p>If you have one copy of Windows and installed it on more than one PC, activation might not work because the product key has already been used on another PC, or it's being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Normally, the rule
 to follow for most copies of Windows is 1:1, meaning that one copy of Windows can be installed only on one PC.</p>
<p>If your product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow, you'll need to buy a product key for each one of your PCs in order to activate them.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Counterfeit software</p>
</b>
<p>If you have a counterfeit copy of Windows that wasn't published and licensed by Microsoft, activation won't work because Microsoft won't be able to create a match between your PC's hardware profile and your 25-character product key.</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=71144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>How to Tell</u></a> website can help you figure out if your copy of Windows is counterfeit. If it is, you'll probably need to
 buy a new copy of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Used PC</p>
</b>
<p>If you bought a used PC with Windows already installed on it, it's possible that the product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>You might need to ask the seller you bought the used PC from for the original Windows DVD and product key. If the DVD and product key aren't available, or if you tried them and still can't activate, you might need to buy a new key.

<p>thanks for all that, but I bought this PC brand new and it had no operating system at all on it. I installed Windows 8 Pro on it fresh and have no other operating systems to install.</p>
<p>Is there any other way I can solve this?</p>

    <title>Alt codes in different languages&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pentaerythritol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alt codes in different languages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Alright, I screwed up - I accidentally changed the locale on my Windows 7 computer to Japanese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now usually this wouldn't be a problem as I could change it right back, but the problem is that I can't log in to my computer anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My password involves the special Unicode character █ (Full Block), which is usually typed with alt+219 or alt+987.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, with the new character set these alt codes give very different letters. I can't access the character map, and I can't change the locale back, and generally I'm locked out of my computer now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm asking - is there a way to type █ with the Japanese keyboard, or is there a way to change the locale without logging in? I have an Ubuntu live disk sitting nearby, so if the locale settings are in a file I might be able to change them from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi Liz, 
<br />
<br />The wireless network you’re trying to connect to is hidden? Is it your network? You’d go into your wireless router and unhide the network if it already exists, then it should display in your wireless network list. 
<br />
<br />Give me a little more info and we’ll figure this one out!
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you, If your network is hidden then it means that SSID of  that network is not broadcasting, In this case you don't have to un-hide it, you just need the SSID,  the Password and the WPA2 encryption method, to connect to this network
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps and feel free to ask back any question.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards:
<br /> Yasir

<p>Addition to Security key you have to know Network name (SSID).</p>

            <p>I have THE solution to the HP 4000 printer and Windows 10 printing problem.&nbsp; The problem appears to be a port problem, not a driver problem.&nbsp; I racked my brains for 4 days, spending hours each day trying to solve it to no avail.&nbsp;
<strong>If you want to end your suffering, click on the link below to buy this cable from Amazon.</strong>
</p>
<p>http://www.amazon.com/Tripp-Lite-Parallel-Centronics-U206-006-R/dp/B00005138I/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1452307389&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=tripp+lite+USB+to+parallel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the story.&nbsp; I was using a genuine HP C3801-80073 parallel cable from printer to PC running Windows 10.&nbsp; I saw that every time I installed the driver, the computer claimed it was a success.&nbsp; Then, when it came time to print a test page, either nothing
 happened or it displayed error.&nbsp; I was trying to use the HP 4000 Series PCL5 or HP 4000 Series PCL 6 driver that worked just fine with Windows 7 x 64, but refused to work with Windows 10 x 64 upgrade, even though the claim was that both were supported drivers
 for Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspected a communication problem more than a driver problem.&nbsp; I kept trying to use LPT1 as the printer port, as it had worked fine for me in the past.&nbsp; Then I wondered if a parallel to USB cable existed.&nbsp; One that could make the computer recognize the
 printer in a more modern way.&nbsp; The cable is Tripp-Lite Model U206-006-R.&nbsp; This is a USB to IEEE 1284 Parallel Printer Adapter that is 6 feet long.&nbsp; A 10 foot version is available for users who need to reach a longer distance. Search it out on Amazon if you
 need that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer parallel port mode is set to SPP (Standard Parallel Port) in the BIOS.&nbsp; The new adapter cord arrives.&nbsp; After looking at the instructions and mini-CD disc that came with the cable, I decide not to follow their instructions as this disc supports
 Windows 98 and 2000 driver support.&nbsp; PLEASE: DO NOT follow the instructions at all when you get the cable
<strong>nor</strong> use the disc. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Procedure:</strong> Double click your HP 4000 series in Devices and Printers and click on "See What's Printing".&nbsp; If there are any failed documents, cancel them to remove them from the cache. Now delete the failed printer install from Devices and
 Printers in Win 10 by right clicking and selecting "Remove Device". &nbsp;Then go to Control Panel,&nbsp;Administrative Tools,&nbsp;Printer Management.&nbsp; Under Print Servers, you will see drivers and printers.&nbsp; Delete any instances of HP 4000 drivers and printers by right
 clicking and deleting.&nbsp; Remove driver packages also.&nbsp; If you get a message telling you something can't be deleted, reboot the computer to clear this from memory, &nbsp;go back and try again.&nbsp; They should delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure the HP 4000 is turned on. Take your new cable,&nbsp; plug the parallel end into the printer.&nbsp; After I did this, the data light illuminated and the display kept alternating from
<em>Ready </em>to <em>Data Received</em>.&nbsp; Now, plug the other end into a back USB port on the PC.&nbsp; You will NOT get any notification of hardware detected on the Win 10 home screen.&nbsp; Open Control Panel,&nbsp;Devices &amp; Printers.&nbsp; You may see an icon for the
<strong>Wait</strong>.&nbsp; Eventually, the printer will show up.&nbsp; Print a test page.&nbsp; It works. The port will be automatically changed to USB001 Virtual printer Port for USB.&nbsp; It will be checked automatically under Ports in Printer Properties. You will not be
 using LPT1.&nbsp; This is the only difference between my failure and success.&nbsp; The HP universal print drivers that Win 10 installs are fine.&nbsp; The port was wrong and you need to buy the new parallel/USB cable.&nbsp; This is exactly how it worked for me.&nbsp; Easiest fix
 ever and I got my sanity back.&nbsp; This may very well work with other printers besides the 4000 that are older and have parallel connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your HP 4000 printer to make sure the parallel connector is the same as mine.&nbsp; I do not have pins to connect but rather metal contacts.&nbsp; The cable I listed on Amazon above is the ONLY ONE that would fit my printer.&nbsp; Confirm this on yours.&nbsp; Good luck
 and I'll check posts periodically to see how this is working for users and to answer any questions if you have problems.</p>

    <title>Win7 Language Bar - Not Opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> incurablegeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 Language Bar - Not Opening</h2>
                    I have been using the Japanese and Chinese IME since the mid 90's. Nary a problem.<br />
<br />
Present System:<br />
<br />
1) Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit<br />
2) Office 2010 - only add-on is Multi-Tabs Free for Word<br />
3) Das mechanical keyboard - dual USB connects<br />
4) Japanese IME installed<br />
<br />
Now I have written about 100 pages of Japanese in the past couple of years without a single problem, so I do
<b>know how to use the language bar</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>After Reinstall of Windows 7</b><br />
<br />
Bizarre Problem: Neither left-click nor right click open the Language Bar. Only by hitting Alt/Shift can I switch between the EN icon (English) and the JP icon (Japanese). But that is all.
<b>The language bar does not open</b>, so that I can change settings, input method, output, etc.<br />
<br />
What the Language Bar does do is "flicker" when I click on it (after opening with Alt/Shift, will not open by simply clicking on the EN icon). It appears to
<i>want to open</i> but cannot.<br />
<br />
The only possible problem. and it truly a remote one, that I can see, the only "variable" that is, would be the Das mechanical keyboard. In the past I used traditional Logitech wireless keyboards (membrane/dome switch).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are facing issue with keyboard typing Japanese and Chinese languages.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try a different keyboard from the DasKeyboard to find out if it is the keyboard causing the problem with the language bar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It another keyboard works, then you would need to contact DasKeyboard support for assistance.
</p>

            The Das Keyboard is definitely NOT the problem. That was a red herring and I should not have even mentioned it. In short, the problem exists regardless of keyboard used.<br />
<br />
Once again, having tried everything suggested in other forums, I am still suffering from the same inane problem:<br />
<br />
"Neither left-click nor right click open the Language Bar. Only by hitting Alt/Shift can I switch between the EN icon (English) and the JP icon (Japanese). But that is all.
<b>The language bar does not open</b>, so that I can change settings, input method, output, etc.<br />
<br />
What the Language Bar does do is "flicker" when I click on it (after opening with Alt/Shift, will not open by simply clicking on the EN icon). It appears to
<i>want to open</i> but cannot."<br />
<br />
I wish I could attached snippets to better explain my problem. Suffice it to say:<br />
<br />
I have been using Japanese language packs (IME) since their inception and before that TwinBridge software. I write books in Japanese and am quite knowledgeable about how to use the MS Jpn IME -- if and only if --- the language bar icons actually open to reveal
 INPUT choices and OUTPUT choices. At present only the IME Kanji writing pad opens.<br />
<br />
My conclusion: the Japanese IME is corrupted. And I emphatically Do Not wish to invest 100 hours in a reinstall of Win 7 Ultimate 64 bit and all my programs.
<br />
<br />
I would rather be nibbled to death by ducks.<br />

            One interesting thing.<br />
<br />
A few kind people have actually tried to help with this very frustrating problem.<br />
<br />
And everyone has been operating from the premise that I really don't know how to use the language bar.
<br />
<br />
That is emphatically not the case. I fully understand how to use the language bar and have done so since its inception. I am also native speaker in Japanese. So that is also not the problem.<br />
<br />
What I can't do, despite removing the IME, rebooting, reinstalling, and then rebooting, is make any of the language bar menus open so I can actually make INPUT choices and OUTPUT choices.<br />
<br />
That is my problem.<br />

I have published 12 bks mixing English and Japanese written on XPpro which was easy to set up though word doc was and probably still is 25 years behind the ball with intelligence. But I just got a Win7pro Lenovo and even after upgrading to ultimate and doing two separate downloads of Japanese one for win and one for office I can find no way to get going -- I was even forced to download 32 bit jpse for the second despite having a 64 bit pc = but the main problem is I seem to be being forced to work either in Japanese or english if I OK the only offered changes -- what the **** do we do to regain our bilingual functionality? I, like the guy who wrote the letter know damn well how to use the IME bar, but how do I get it again????!!!! No one in their technical dept knows this stuff and Lenevo despite being a Chinese company is no help --- if it were not for the trackpoint I would switch to mac. My old pc is bluescreening but I cannot transfer stuff until I have a bilingual Word again! Microsoft, yo

            <p>Only the retail upgrade and full version packages include both 32 and 64 bit discs. The OEM System Builder license only includes one architecture, but you can use the product key included in the OEM System Builder package to activate both architectures regardless.
 Besides, if you purchase a particular architecture, you can always download the other architecture directly.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
