<h2>            Windows Update has been prompting me to install the same updates over and over again.</h2>
                    <p>Over the last two days, Windows Update has been prompting me to install the same updates over and over again.&nbsp; I have checked via Control Panel/Add or Remove Programs that the updates have been installed - and they are listed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have run the Microsoft
 Safety Scanner which reported no malware, etc on my computer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Comment:</strong> KB2604092 supersedes (replaces) KB2518864, KB2572073 &amp; KB2633880. [Translation: If KB2604092 is listed in Add/Remove Programs, not worry about the other three updates.]</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>1. Was a Root Certificate update offered and if so, did you successfully installed it? (Again, you'll have to rely on your memory here as it won't be listed in Add/Remove Programs).</p>
<p>2. Please reconfirm that <strong>Update for Windows XP (KB971029) </strong>is <em>
not </em>listed in Add/Remove Programs (after making sure the SHOW UPDATES box at the top is still checked).</p>
<p>Tip: If it <em>was installed</em>, it was probably installed circa March 2011 or so.</p>

            <p>Hi Rosa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Find a paperclip and open it up so you have an inch or two of just the rod.&nbsp; Somewhere on the CD Drive you will find a very, very tiny hole (about the size of that paperclip tip).&nbsp; Insert the paperclip tip into the hole and push firmly.&nbsp; This should open
 the drive "manually".&nbsp; Then you can remove the CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try another you know works and see if the problem persists.&nbsp; If so, you may have a defective drive or need to install new device drivers for it from the computer manufacturer's web site (or the CD drive manufacturer's web site).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that still doesn't work and you have a working drive that fits on another computer, swap them and see if the problem persists (or moves).&nbsp; This will help tell if it's the computer or the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that you should post back to the hardware forum for further instructions, replace the drive if appropriate, or have the computer serviced.&nbsp; I'd start by getting help from the Windows-Hardware forum here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps and the the first step is the only one you really need here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good lucck!</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Hi cabfres,<br />
A. What happens when you drag and drop?<br />
B. Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to check if those songs are DRM Protected; if those songs are DRM protected then you will not be able to copy or write the files.<br />
I would suggest you to run audio troubleshooter and see if that help.<br />
Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter by clicking the Start button , and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Troubleshoot audio playback.‌<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

<h3> conallmccaffrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 critical error</h2>
                    I have had the windows crtical error; start menu and cortana are not working problem since the start of january. I have previously fixed it by resetting my pc, but it always comes back after about a week or so of working normally. I have tried all the
 tips and tricks such as putting commands into powershell and booting my pc in safe mode then restarting it, but nothing has worked. I am sick to death of not being able to get full functionality outof my pc and am at my wits end. Please can someone tell me
 how to permanently fix my pc and not have this issue ever again.

            Hi
<br />
<br />See if upgrading to 1903 helps.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />We would like to see the Installation log to check what caused the update to fail/stuck/rollback.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named files from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
This is repairable though you may need technical help.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue : (The fix for corrupt is basically the same<br />
as for the boot manager is missing.)<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

            Hi MC_123, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Speaker Pop Coming out of Sleep After Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>Since installing the Anniversary Update, I've found that the speakers make a pop noise as the machine comes out of sleep. This happens when the device has been in sleep for some hours rather than minutes. The pop happens just before or as the lock screen
 appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP4 is fully up to date as of 14/09/2016.</p>

<p>Hello Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Several factors may have caused the sound discrepancy with your Plantronics Savi 7xx, namely an issue with the Plantronics Savi 7xx itself, a discrepancy with the Skype app, or an outdated driver. To isolate the issue, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Connect the Plantronics Savi 7xx with a different device or PC, then check if the issue persists.</li><li>Update your Skype app. </li><li>Update the driver or install the driver through the manufacturer's website.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly post the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

                    Well, I downloaded Windows 8.1 from the App Store, and all is going well until it reboots with the blank screen. No cursor, no desktop, nothing. I turned it off and rebooted it and it said "Recovering your previous version of Windows" and it then goes
 back to Windows 8. I really would like Windows 8.1 and if you have found any solutions please reply. &nbsp;

            <p>Windows 8.1 will install a Microsoft created version of&nbsp; the Intel WDDM Drivers (10.18.10.3379). This is the Intel Graphics Driver. The new version has a compatibility issue with the envy and will cause the display to stop functioning. The latest compatible
 driver is 10.18.10.3345 and is on Intel's website.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am still working on how to fix this personally, but if I tell you guys the fix, maybe you will have better luck than me getting to it.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Disable automatic updates, so Windows doesn't reinstall the bad driver.</p>
<p>Go to Device Manager and&nbsp;uninstall the Intel HD 4000 graphics driver.</p>
<p>Do the Windows 8.1 Upgrade like usual. Once the ENVY reboots it will continue the upgrade until it reaches the "Setting up devices" stage, where it will shut the display off.</p>
<p>Turn off the Computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>**Now what we need to do is get the computer into SAFE MODE with Networking. However, F8 has not helped me at all. Holding escape, then turning the computer on seems to pull up the HP boot tools menu, but I see no way to get to SAFE MODE. Assuming we can
 get into SAFE MODE, I will continue with instructions:</p>

<p>Once in SAFE MODE with Networking go to Device Manager, Display adapter, the right click the Intel HD Graphics Driver and go to properties, then the Driver tab, and then click Roll Back the Driver. This is bringing our driver back before the 8.1 Upgrade.</p>
<p>Go to Windows Update and change the setting to "Check for updates but let me choose to install them".&nbsp;Set the HP Utility to not automatically install updates.</p>
<p>Now restart the machine and let it continue into Win8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have had limited success due to the fact that I can't get into SAFE MODE. If you guys can get in though and complete this fix, let me know how you did so. If I figure it out, I will also post.</p>

            <p>Thank you, I would love to say that that fixed it, but unfortunately... Hitting Shift + F8 won't pull up Recovery mode on this model, however, hitting escape will bring it up. The issue is that while in recovery mode, the supposed "Startup Options" does
 not exist. Which is the center problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I attempted forcing it into SAFE MODE by using the second method mentioned in that article, through msconfig. However, as long as Windows 8.1 is being installed, the system ignores the override command. It wouldn't even boot into SAFE MODE until after I
 allowed it to restore Win 8. I'll just have to use it as a Win 8 machine until I can figure this out.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you guys have more ideas, please share.</p>

            Same problem here, but something that might help... when I was using the answer desk, they went to System Configuration, and from there you can choose what programs and drivers to start when the computer boots up, and from what I know about Safe Mode,
 I believe you can do basicly the same thing, before you even start the upgrade. I also just found out that if you go to Boot in the System Config, you can click Safe Mode, and check the networking box to go into safe mode with networking when you restart the
 computer. &nbsp;If this happens to work for somebody, please post what to do here, so that I can do the same.&nbsp;

            <p>*********************************************************************************************************</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Alright guys and gals, I managed to fix the problem, but it was very round about, not concrete and probably not do-able by most of you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure what part of my procedure worked, so I am going to say EVERYTHING that I did:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I pulled the hard drive out of the laptop and installed it in my desktop.</p>
<p>I ran the Win8.1 Upgrade and installed it fully until it booted up to the main desktop. (Of course the upgrade will work fine on my desktop, because there is no driver issue.)</p>
<p>Once this was completed, I made sure that Win update was shut off, Intel update was shut off, and HP update was shut off. I then went to Intel's website to download the last know compatible driver for this laptop and Win 8.1:
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=23405&amp;keyword=10.18.10.3345&amp;DownloadType=Drivers&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=23405&amp;keyword=10.18.10.3345&amp;DownloadType=Drivers&amp;lang=eng</a></p>
<p>I downloaded this driver and installed. Because I was running my desktop, after the .exe completed it said that the driver was incompatible, which makes sense since my processor uses HD 3000 and not HD 4000. I hit ok and moved on.</p>
<p>I then Uninstalled my Intel HD Graphics 3000 driver (Just in case)</p>
<p>Turned off the machine.</p>
<p>Pulled the hard drive out and moved it into the laptop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After turning the laptop back on, it took a while to configure devices, restarted several times and even popped up some error messages that I would normally see on the desktop, not during boot.</p>
<p>Finally, the laptop reached the login screen and has worked fine since in Win 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure what part of this process made the upgrade a success, but I would like to think it was installing the compatible Intel Drivers. It could have also been that when 8.1 installed, it couldn't install the Microsoft made drivers for the
 Intel HD 4000 graphics, because my desktop doesn't use HD 4000 graphics. That would mean that when I pulled out the HDD and reinstalled it in the laptop it was still using the same old drivers as before.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I really hope that this helps those of you with different computers to install the HDD in.</p>
<p><br />

<p>I have windows 8.1.&nbsp; I cannot get&nbsp; a cursor on desktop.&nbsp; I do have one on built-in Administrator account&nbsp; and on standard account.&nbsp; bu not on my usually used Admin. acct.&nbsp; Sometimes I do and sometimes not.&nbsp; I also have cursor jumping all over. &nbsp; Also cannot

<p>You can image Windows 7 to a different hard drive if the SSD is large enough. ﻿If the SSD drive is smaller you can transfer your personal files to external storage to reduce the amount of data on the hard drive, and then shrink the Windows partition to a
 size smaller then your SSD drive.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
1. Shrinking The Partition in Windows 7</p>
<p>
﻿Note: if you have a recovery partition do not alter it.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
When you are unable to make changes to partitions using Disk Management below is a partitioning programyou can use.</p>
<p>
<p>
Includes Partition Manager, Disk &amp; Partition Copy Wizard and Partition Recovery Wizard for Windows XP/Vista/Windows 7 (32 bit and 64 bit). It allows users to Resize/Move Partition, Extend System Drive, Copy Disk &amp; Partition, Merge Partition, Split Partition,
 Redistribute Free Space, Convert Dynamic Disk, Partition Recovery and more.</p>

</p>
<p>
2. Image the Windows install to your SSD with imaging software. <br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Moving to an SSD can have issues with alignment - make sure you use an imaging program that has SSD support, both below do.<br />

            <p>Hi Ameen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to set up a display/monitor. I also know how to install drivers in compatibility mode. If you read my post correctly you will see that windows 8.1 is not able to detect my TV as a display but as a device!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many people who are having issues with their 2nd display not being detected by Win 8.1. A quick google search of 'Win 8.1 HDMI output not working/detected' will give you tons of hits. Heck, there are so many questions around this issue on this
 site itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So can you please help us with a real solution.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Also how do i report this problem to microsoft so they take this issue seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem never existed in earlier versions of windows.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 to Window 10 Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just like to know how I must go about activating my windows 10, or getting a product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a valid windows 7 product key, but I had to format my PC before I reserved a key, and thus could not do the upgrade. So i installed a stand alone win 10 and setup everything, downloaded all updates. I really dont want to go through the process of
 first installing Win7 again, doing all updates, downloading windows 10 again to upgrade. just to get the Key so that I can do a stand alone win 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my other laptops I also formatted and did a win 7 but it is taking forever to get all the updates before it allows me to upgrade? (The whole weekend of restarting the machine, and still no upgrade Icon)</p>
<p>

<span><strong>I got banned for 2 week on communications the other day so i did a case review and they wont lift the ban. I just don't think its right i have been with
 Xbox for so long now and now this is making me want to get rid of it now. On top of that the amount of money and time i have spent of Xbox is so much. So i would just like to say this is some BS for banning me for 2 week on one thing my stupid friend did.
 So if anyone is reading this then remember if you send one bad message to someone and even if it wasn't you. YOU WILL GET BANNED FOR 2 WEEKS FOR IT. So i would like some to fix this cause i think its the stupidest thing ever there's hacker and everything and
 you were about thing as little as this. I think y'all should see who the bad guy is on this. Cause i don't even work for Xbox and i take care of the hacker for you cause yall take way to long on that stuff but a message y'all hope on that real quick. So I
 think y'all need to worry about more important things then what someone said in a message.&nbsp;</strong></span>

<p>Actually they have every right to suspend you if you break their ToU/CoC.You agreed to that when you started your account.</p>
<p>Xbox live is for all ages.If you only want to play with mature players then you will have to play in private lobbies with friends or people who are of a similar age.</p>
<p>You won't get a phone number for the enforcement team &amp; you do not get banned for nothing.</p>
<p>How exactly do you know they don't read your complaints?</p>

<p>well its seems like racial slurs do not count as apart of the Microsofts "terms of service" or whatever. two different scumbags droped the n bomb on me. ( yes I reported both of them) only to find out NOTHING happened and that they are still online gaming.
 so apparently that word doesn't count. but if I was to use one cus word the "enforcement team" would be all up and down my spine. the system is BROKEN altogether Using that word should be a automatic ban but of course it seems to be ok with microsoft</p>

<h2>            monitor not showing up in device manager, leading to resolution issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows stopped recognizing my ViewSonic monitor and started saying the native resolution is 1024x768 instead of 1920x1080. I added 1920x1080 as a custom resolution, but this doesn't work for all programs which still use&nbsp;1024x768.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to device manager, and the monitor does not show up. If I check hidden devices, it shows up but says</p>
<p>"Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code 45)</p>
<p>To fix this problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though the monitor is plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disconnecting the monitor and plugging it back in, but it has not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you recently installed the latest version of Windows 10, version 1803, keep the following in mind:
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>I already tried that. I think the issue is related to how the monitor shows up as a generic plug and play in the device manager, and the actual monitor is under hidden devices and says that it is not plugged in.</p>

<h2>            Proud parents of non-perfect children</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my name is Chad...&nbsp;haha &nbsp;My son Noah is 10, going into the 5th grade next year. I'm not exactly sure how. He was failing math in the 3rd quarter, then made A/B honor roll after I got on his butt. He had never been resitrcted before in his life. lol He
 is as skinny as they come, with&nbsp;semi long, blonde hair, he thinks he's a little rockstar because I was a singer for a metal band in college. His favorite band is Kiss. I don't know where he got that, I love Kiss but never played&nbsp;them much. Maybe it's the makeup.
 His mom let him start watch horror films @ age 3. His first was Chucky. Seriously, my child falls asleep on horror films. Not saying I agree with it, blame his mother :P&nbsp;He also loves Football. He weighed in at 63 pounds last year and the coach made him an
 offensive lineman. I'll put a stop to that this year...he's the fastest kid in his school. I don't care if he is good at offensive line, he'll be better as tight end, wide reciever, running back, or even a safety on defense... anything that involves speed.
 He came in 2nd in a 2 mile fun run in the 3rd grade. The race had up to 6th graders in it. Here's the scenario... who's that long haired white boy running with those black boys. No white boys can keep up with him. lol He doesn't know any difference, his best
 friend since birth is mixed. It was a fun day when&nbsp;I ran him down on the football field and showed the other parents where he got his speed :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school calls me weekly. I know the redirection lady likes she's his Aunt. Actually, he gets in trouble so much, I know the whole school staff by name and they know me. Luckily my son is charming and always says he's sorry. I act appropriately so the
 school thinks I'm a good father, hehe. My son has started cursing lately and I am not happy with that @ 10. I have discouraged it, but his buddies at school curse. I've even tried to watch my mouth around him. I know how quickly a cute little kid can go to
 a rotten, foul mouth kid. I don't want that for him. Any advice?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could go on, I like to write, but now it's time for someone else to tell us about their kid or kids. Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Well, when I was growing up I was taught that in the presence of my parents, I am forbidden to cuss or I will get punished in some way, shape, or form. I'm pretty sure that at the age of ten, my parents still had a hold on me. What my parents did when I
 would use foul language, they would get creative with it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, my parents were divorced and I had two other sisters. My mom was a little less strict when it came to using inappropriate language, but if we ever did something bad or talked back to her, we had to write standards (writing "I won't do this and
 that again because it does this and that. At least 1,500 times by a certain time - she got that idea from Bart Simpson) My dad just wouldn't have it. My sisters and I all went through a name calling phase. Our favorite word was "retard". So every time we used
 that word, we had to put our index finger in our nose (he said it was to make us feel like someone who actually had a disability.. and boy, we did not like the laughter our other siblings gave us.. It was humiliating, so we eventually grew out of that word.)
 If we said the S word, he would make us clean the bathroom until he approved. If we said the F word, we were sent to our room for the rest of the day with anything that could entertain us, taken away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, my dad gave us "the talk" when their punishments were no longer effective. Basically, that we needed to act and speak like young ladies and that it's considered disrespect to use foul language in the presence of your parents. So he just kindly
 asked that we didn't do that. I've slipped a few times, but always apologize. I love my parents.. and respect them enough to grant their wishes... Hope this somewhat helped even though your post kind of seemed fake. :)</p>

<p><span>What you could do is punish him when he curses.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-take away his Xbox privileges.
</span></p>
<p><span>-wash his mouth out with soap. (Irish Spring has a lovely taste to it)</span></p>

<p>I second the soap. The embarrassment, plus the taste works wonders. Our 2 oldest know they better not say anything vulgar or close to it around us, or let us hear about them doing it somewhere else. The classics work best. If he's into the football team,
 keep him there. Best place for kids is in athletic programs. Most of them require decent grades to stay on the team, so he'll have his buddies and team-mates on him to keep his grades up too. Ever think of Track &amp; Field as a secondary since he's quick &amp; smallish?
 Don't be afraid to resort to flat out bribery to keep those grades up either. Like Tem said- all we can do is suggest, good luck, it only gets trickier. I got a 13 y.o. son and 11 y.o. daughter...I dread the next few years

<p>LOL&nbsp; Good luck with that one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When my 10 year old slips up he will loose his xbox for a day. Depending on the word that is. He did a whopper the other night. He had no idea I was in the hallway. Well I have worked in a automotive shop for 21 years and I was a firefighter for 12. What
 he said caught even me off guard and I have heard (or said) them all......I thought. Well he got to see his xbox taken down and put back in the box along with his DSI. Took away friends for a week and some other things that as he put it made me "the meanest
 dad in the world". Anyhoot when he got the xbox back he was lucky enough to have it put downstairs this time next to mine.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" />This way I was able to hear every word him and his friends
 said. After a month of that I really had no problems and to this day he is at least not as loud when he does "mess up".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to remember sometimes we were there to. I think my generation did a little better at not getting caught because we had to go out and play all the time. No video games at least nothing to keep us in.</p>

<p>It's been a houseful this summer for me. Myself and my wife plus my son. Then my other son comes to visit a lot in the summer and my stepson just moved back in. That's 5 of us. Add in the neighborhood kids and I can't wait for school to start back, lol.
 I had to watch netflix with a guitar controller the other night. </p>
<p>I finally got the cursing to a minimum, but now it's me yelling "settle down" because the kids think they are professional wrestlers. That's half my fault cause I've wrestled with them since birth. Now I'm mean Daddy too.</p>
<p>I'm really not complaining though, I love my kids and my life. There is definitely a change around 10 somewhere. My son is hell on wheels, yet likes me to hug on him scratch his head/back, lay on my lap watching movies, etc. It's sweet to me.</p>

<p>Update, my son stabbed himself in the toe with a homemade spear. It went all the way through. I taped it up. My mother and ex wife had a fit, took him to the doctor. Doctor did the same thing I did, but said have his dad tighten the bandage... I couldn't
 hold the boy still enough. &nbsp;I never saw the spear.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for me, I'm on my second session with my therapist. He's actually an okay guy. I've never seen a psychologist before so I just talk about everything. Why not? My latest issue is "Why did I have to inherit a trailer park?" Slumlord does not help one's
 self esteem. I hate this town. Don't wanna own property and farmland in it. Yet, my son grew up here. He knows no place else :(</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, if you like racing games like myself. Don't buy MX vs ATV Alive. It's much too difficult for a kid to drive. My son won't play it. I love it. Nascar stinks to me, but all the kids seem to love riding in circles and it's very easy**. Dirt 3 is extremely
 easy, but I haven't seen any kids that liked it. Shift 2 Unleashed may be the most difficult racer to date and therefore adult hardcore race fans only. Need for Speed the Run will be fun for kids going by previous titles, but this goes into **EA's 13 yr old
 age restriction online and whether or not you want your child running from police cars. I personally don't let my son play Grand Theft Auto, but he can race the cops. It's like Dukes of Hazard to me. He knows I'm not against the police. All kids seem to like
 forza though, so Forza 4 would be a great idea for kids and parents alike. I think it comes out around Sept. 11.</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have noticed in Task Manager&nbsp; that when I am running some programs that underneath the processes section and under the windows processes section that there is a process call "System" which uses up to 99-100% of disk activity. It also appears
 in the details section. I have located the executive file responsible; it is called "ntoskrnl" and it can be found under C:\Windows\System32. I am just wondering why it uses so much disk activity and if this&nbsp;may be a sign that&nbsp;something wrong.</p>
