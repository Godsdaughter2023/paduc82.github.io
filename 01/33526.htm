            <p>Hi Bertram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're glad to hear that you were able to install the Windows Creators update. However, you mentioned that you are having issue managing your font settings after installing the update. The workaround that we can recommend for now is to uninstall the Creators
 Update by opening <strong>Settings</strong>, click on <strong>Update</strong> and
<strong>Security</strong>, <strong>Recovery </strong>and selecting <strong>G</strong><strong>et Started</strong> under
<strong>Go Back</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you have further concerns.</p>

            I used software to change the fonts. Everything is working to change fonts as long as I use the software. However, I am wondering if the Creator update wants to choose your font choices for you. If so, I hope it will be addressed. However, in the date
 at the lower right side of the taskbar, the colon in the time has been replaced by a square. &nbsp;Small annoyance.&nbsp;

            You are totally correct. They should fix the issues, not just say that one should go back to an older version. They gave poor advice. You gave good advice.&nbsp;

<p>See if you can type your regular user account name to replace the<em> Administrator</em> account name.</p>

<p>This has happened on a new second lap-top, idle mainly for long times, so can't recall between time changes, thus puzzled as to why not now working.</p>
<p>Not a branded machine - come with a cloned XP, as is the way here in Thailand! My MS trained friend dumped that and installed XP from 'older' lap-top. Feb 2009.&nbsp;Power Optiions worked, but doesn't now. Sorry not much help I guess, this answer. (Such a dummy!).&nbsp;
 Thanks.</p>

            I'm sorry but you will not be able to get support for a pirated Windows operating system in Microsoft forums. *Someone* must have made the laptop - HP, Dell, etc. Contact the laptop mftr. and purchase a recovery disc for it. This will have the correct
 drivers.

    <title>High packet loss. How do I fix this&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dead spirit87  say:</h3>
<h2>            High packet loss. How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I cannot connect to Xbox Live on my Xbox One S 500GB model. All of my other devices connect to the network just fine, apart from my Xbox. Whenever I do a network test, it says that everything is fine, however, when I do a multiplayer connection test, it says that I have a high 'packet loss' of 51% which is interrupting my online connection. It says that I must reset my router, and I have followed all of the steps in doing so, but none of them do the trick. Can anyone help? It is not only my Xbox Live, but in games such as Fortnite:Battle Royale, my multiplayer gaming is extremely laggy. This only began a couple of days ago, as I've had the Xbox for about 2 months and all has been well before now. My brother also has an Xbox One which is working perfectly well, however mine isn't. Please help :/</p>

<p><span><span>As an initial step, I suggest you to disable antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you
 shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your
 antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to start your computer in safe mode with Networking and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode with Networking place the
 computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit program running in the background creating this error.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Safe Mode
</span></strong><span>is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Let us run
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter which helps to find and clean up unused files, shortcuts, and perform maintenance tasks.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press
<strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>X</strong> key together and select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click on
<strong>View all option</strong> on the left side of the Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click on
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> option.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click on
<strong>Next</strong> and follow the onscreen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: I suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware,
 and other malicious software. The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the
 Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></span></p>

    <title>Halo Waypoint award for Halo Reach&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madness9001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo Waypoint award for Halo Reach&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>I just downloaded Halo Waypoint, and before this, I had recently bought Halo Reach Limited Edition. I pressed start when I started playing Waypoint, and it said I was getting an Avatar award for buying Halo Reach. It takes me to the screen to confirm the
 download, but then it said I was awarded an award, I go to it, and it's just the waypoint Monitor. After exiting the awards menu and continuing to Waypoint, the confirm download screen is gone, and I can't figure out how to get it back up. I have 3 questions:</p>
<p>1. How do I get that screen back up,</p>
<p>2. What was the award? I remember it was like 460 KB or something, but never found out.</p>
<p>3. Was the Waypoint Monitor the award? </p>
<p>I'd really appreciate your answers, because it would just kill me if I missed out on whatever I was getting.</p>

<p>The monitor award is for using halo waypoint. The avatar item that you get with the halo reach limited edition is the falcon prop. To get it you should either restart halo waypoint or try to find the item in your download history. &nbsp;Go to
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://live.xbox.com/en-US/Download/History</a> and find the Falcon avatar prop and add it to your Queue. When you sign in it should download it right away.</p>

            Better idea: Can anyone advise where I can buy Windows 8 or a laptop with Windows 8 installed?&nbsp; Since I purchased a new laptop with Windows 10, I have had endless problems.&nbsp; All my bandwidth is used to download for patches to Microsoft software that I
 do not have installed and will never install.&nbsp; My laptop auto restarts at the worst possible moment and I lose hours of work.&nbsp; I have done every setting change possible to prevent MS from controlling my computer but apparently it is impossible with Windows
 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;I spoke to MS Support in India and apparently the only way I can prevent MS from downloading patches and updating my laptop under Windows 10 is if I do not connect to the Internet.&nbsp; I cannot run my business without email and Internet banking and I cannot
 run my business with Windows 10.&nbsp; I guess I will need to buy an Apple laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hi Irene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us more about the issue you are experiencing? We need to know what specific issue you are having on your computer so we can tell you what is causing it and proceed in resolving it. Then after we resolve this, we can give you some steps to disable
 the update since you don't want it as what you have stated on your post.</p>
<p>

<p>I always trusted Microsoft.&nbsp; My life is simple.&nbsp; I use Windows, MS Office and Chrome.&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp; Since Win 10, every patch changes my settings and it takes me days to use my computer again.&nbsp; Patches are downloaded for MS software that I do not have installed,
 I can't get to the Internet, IE becomes my default browser, I need to re-install Adobe, email settings change, my AV is disabled, I lose Excel and Word docs that I was working on, I lose the docs completely even though I have save every 5-10 minutes, there
 no warning, my laptop closes down and says that patches are being installed. While the patches are being installed, Microsoft suggest Edge and other MS software.&nbsp; No way I will install more MS software!&nbsp; I no longer trust Microsoft.&nbsp; I set to a metered line,
 I installed wushowhide to prevent the Fall Creator upgrade. You forced it down anyway.&nbsp; I have done everything possible but have not been able to protect my computer from Microsoft patches. I replaced my cellphone. The Windows phone was a disaster because
 after a patch, I had zero communications.&nbsp; I will never again link a cellphone to an MS application.&nbsp; Windows 10 moved me back into the dark ages.&nbsp; I can't get the patch to the last buggy patch if I can't access the Internet. I want the MS security patches.
 I want essential patches for Windows and MS Office. I want to decide when to restart my computer.&nbsp; I want to be able to select which patches I need.&nbsp; Why should I pay to download gigabytes of patches for software that I will never install?&nbsp; This is MY computer.&nbsp;
 I fully understand the risk of not applying essential patches.&nbsp; Since Windows 10, I rely on telephone and fax to operate my business while I am trying to resolve the problems caused by the last patch.&nbsp; Thank you for your concern.&nbsp; I pray you will be able to
 assist me until I can buy a Win 8 laptop or an Apple. I have not rebooted since before the update to Fall Creator.&nbsp; I hope this will make it easier to remove it. Since Win 10, I have been terrified to reboot because I know that nothing works after an MS patch
 is installed.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Windows automatically restarted my computer last night WITHOUT my permission and once again it caused business problems.&nbsp; I have a guest house and work between 5:00 am and 22:00.&nbsp; I usually shutdown my computer at about 22:00, sometimes later.&nbsp; At 20:30
 I was on the telephone busy compiling a quote in Excel when you restarted my computer.&nbsp; I lost 30 minutes, the Excel spreadsheet I was working on and the business.&nbsp; It took me until midnight to recover Word and Excel files that were open, retype emails, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am spending more time dealing with Microsoft update problems than I am running my business.&nbsp; Warn me that I must restart but you have absolutely no right to force a restart.&nbsp; Since Windows 10, my computer is a liability to my business, it is not an asset.&nbsp;
 Microsoft is the problem, it is not the solution.&nbsp; Twice you have forced a restart while I am doing online banking.&nbsp; After the restart, I need to check all transactions to see what went through.&nbsp; To run my business, I must be able to control my computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Microsoft have created a new business for entrepreneurs.&nbsp; They can name their price for an old laptop with Win 8 or XP.&nbsp; If I could find one, I would pay regardless of the price.&nbsp; A friend received a call from a computer dealer offering to take her old laptop
 with XP and replace it with a brand new laptop at no cost to her. She has been considering a new laptop but thought the deal sounded "too good to be true".&nbsp; I said "I will do that deal but my advice is hang onto your laptop until Microsoft fix Windows 10".&nbsp;
 The fix is easy: <strong>allow users to control their own computers.</strong>&nbsp; There is no way she would be able to run her business with Windows 10.&nbsp; Her business would go under within 3 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had already done everything suggested by Andre Da Costa in 2016 and I thought this would prevent the Fall Creator Edition from being forced onto my computer.&nbsp; I want ONLY essential Microsoft patches to Windows and Office. I do not want any new features
 or any more MS software.&nbsp; Too many bugs and the patches cause too many problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Most important:</strong> Microsoft must NOT restart my computer when I am working on it.&nbsp; When I stop work for the day, I always do a restart.&nbsp; If patches have not been installed, I start work early the morning.&nbsp; If patches have been installed, it
 can take 2 days before I am able to use Outlook, Excel, Word, Google and my printer.&nbsp; That's all I do on my computer so I don't need the features that come with Windows 10.&nbsp;

            my display went away after this latest update and I cannot get answers from MS.&nbsp; The website used to advise when there were issues and how to fix them, but now their virtual assistant just takes keywords like black screen and gives you advice that cannot
 be used, since you cannot see the screen.&nbsp; I have taken my computer to a repair shop and hope they can fix it. &nbsp;

<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Please give me ONE example of how Windows 10 has improved my life. Perhaps there are new features that I obviously do not need?&nbsp; What are the benefits to the end user?&nbsp;
</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Updates for Dell, Intel, HP and Adobe are set to automatic and these updates never cause problems.&nbsp; After every MS, I check again.&nbsp; After the Fall Creator update, I had to download and re-install Adobe, reconfigure my printer and re-install my Anti-Virus
 software.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The worst is trying to recover my Word and Excel files.&nbsp; They were saved but open when you forced the restart.&nbsp; 1 file was missing and 2 Excel Files were totally corrupted and I had to recover them from my backup and reapply recent changes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>4. Please warn me before you restart so I can close MS Office applications safely.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Do not use my bandwidth for software that I do not have installed (MS Access, MS Project, IE, etc).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
6. Please allow me to work an 18 hour day.&nbsp; Initially you allowed an 8 hour working day.&nbsp; You have increased that to 12 hours.&nbsp; Most people need 18 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> I have no problems because I spent 2 days resolving the problems that the last updates caused.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>8. My computer is working <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> and I don't want any updates that will cause the problems I have experienced after every Windows 10 update.&nbsp; I accept security patches but surely I should be allowed to select which features I want?&nbsp; Surely
 I should be allowed to select the updates I need based on the software I have installed on my computer?&nbsp; If I do not have the software installed, why do you waste my bandwidth downloading updates?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Paolo,&nbsp; </p>
<p>Your screen problem sounds like it could be a driver problem.&nbsp; Your computer shop should be able to fix it.&nbsp; Microsoft force an update on to our computers and expect every hardware and software supplier to keep up with their latest changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration.&nbsp; I have had every problem you can imagine since Windows 10.&nbsp; Usually the first symptom is that my mouse stops working.&nbsp; The screen, my printer, AV, even Outlook, Excel and Word give problems.&nbsp; It's impossible to fix the problem
 or Google solutions when your computer does not work.&nbsp; Fortunately I now have access to a computer running XP and a friend has a Apple. I want an Apple but there is a long waiting list for an Apple computer.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually Microsoft will resolve the Windows 10 issues and it will become a stable operating system.&nbsp; As you can see from their responses to me, Microsoft deny that there are any problems.&nbsp; The biggest problem is that they don't warn us about the next update
 and the impact it could have on hardware and existing software. Give us warning before restarting. Give us a chance to update drivers. Don't force the updates and leave us with a computer that we cannot use.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I fully understand why Microsoft need to force download and install security patches but since Windows 10, I dread the Microsoft updates.&nbsp; Every patch chews up my bandwidth with updates for software that I have not purchased and causes 2 days of problems.&nbsp;
 I am yet to see ONE benefit of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just got a new laptop with windows 8 and I used my current email to make a microsoft account. &nbsp;I already had a microsoft account from my xbox under another email though so I closed the one I made and tried to add it as an alias under my xbox one. &nbsp;But
 now I can't even add it as an alias because it says its taken. &nbsp;Now everything's screwed up because whenever the computer asks me to enter my microsoft password itll say "account doesn't exist" or "incorrect password". &nbsp;I even tried to recreate the account
 but it says my email is "not available". &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you have a printer connected and working...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can compose and print a simple letter with Notepad or Wordpad, both included with Windows 10. Cortana will find these Desktop Apps for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can do this with Google Docs <a href="https://www.google.com/docs/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>3. You can do this with Word Online </p>
<p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/</a> Click on New</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. You can purchase Office</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Wordpad and Notepad are the no-cost options if you don't intend to compose very many letters or other documents. If you want to do more advanced composition, you will want to learn how to use one of the other programs, apps, online features.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 getting slower by the day - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonmci  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 getting slower by the day</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be losing functionality with my computer. &nbsp;It gets worse by the day, and yes, I have maintenance set up. &nbsp;It hangs, taking forever to load Word, Excel, Chrome (I admit, I don't like IE), and other apps, when I can even tell I've clicked on them.
 &nbsp;I feel like I'm clicking multiple times and then suddenly I have 10 pages open one minute later when they finally do! &nbsp;I haven't filled it with stuff, in fact, just loaded iTunes last night when I needed to do some research for something. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens upon restart or just opening the lid from sleep. &nbsp;I'm not a gamer or heavy memory user by any stretch, and this is a brand-new computer in May 2016, though the lid has had to be repaired twice. &nbsp;Once it needed the screen replaced (through no
 fault of my own) and once to have that repair repaired as it was not completed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It beeps internally sometimes but randomly so I don't know what that means as the sound is turned off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if something is wrong internally or this is a software problem others have seen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd certainly appreciate any help you can give! &nbsp;Thank you so much! &nbsp;Let me know if you need other computer information...I know a bit, but am not a guru by any stretch. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a touchscreen&nbsp;but prefer to use a wireless mouse that appears in working order. &nbsp;I have the touchpad turned off and have checked that multiple times. &nbsp;I have a Dell Inspiron 15 7000 series with the following information: &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox LIVE Keeps Signing Me Out&#33;&#33; &#42;HELP&#42;</h2>
                    Whenever I play a game, it signs me out. Example I'm playing Call of Duty: Black Ops II, I play the game then it signs me out. I go to multiplayer and press then press Xbox LIVE. I press my account and it signs me in. Then I can play, but whenever I'm
 playing another or the same game. It just keeps signing me out! It's so annoying. But this might be the point. A few days back it asked me if I could enter my details again. I did, but whenever I completed it. It came as an error. It told me to try again later.
 So I exited and the screen never popped up again. Now it came up like I told you. PLEASE HELP!

<p>MGA, NAT is an entirely different issue. It's caused by a blockage of port 3074 by the router, modem or ISP. However, your procedure is a good suggestion.</p>

                    <p>My account; "JtagsAndJitters" (not affiliated with modding whatsoever) was banned about 4-5 years ago for "Modding".

(will happily provide proper identification to back that up), I had no access to any sort of computing equipment, I had no clue how to modify or tamper with the console, and I changed my name for the sole fact to pose as one of the the famous YouTubers at the time that used to mod because it was pretty fun to get into modded lobbies at the time with all my friends and have a blast. I have found myself being in a plethora of modded lobbies while playing Xbox, but was that really a reason to attack me?&nbsp;Or put the blame on me&nbsp;for my name? I was permanently banned for modifying the Xbox, and&nbsp;I have been trying to get my old account unbanned for years, was it really&nbsp;justified to ban a 10 year old with no furthe

<h2>            Windows Live Mail, Corrupt Calendar after Cloning new hard drive</h2>
                    <p>My boot drive was starting to fail. I ourchase a new drive and cloned it with the Seagate software. Everything appears to nbe there. When I start WLMail</p>
<p>I get the message that Mail must close due to a corrupt calendar data 0x8E5E0247. All my emails .eml etc appear to have been copied to the new disk as well as the appropriate WLM directorys. I uninstalled WLM 2011, removed the Calendar directory, rebooted,
 installed WLM 2012. Still fails with the same error message. Each time I remove the 'calendar' directory and then start WLM it re-creates the calendar directory then fails.</p>

And installed skype for windows desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>every time I start up my system, skype starts as well, and I cannot turn it off.</p>
<p>I uncheck the box next to "start with windows"</p>

<p>then get a popup stating invalid port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a message on the main screen stating:</p>

</p><p>Skype Home is unavailable at the moment. Check back later to see your news and alerts.</p>
<p>It's easy to start a conversation on Skype:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a contact and start talking</li><li>Call a phone or mobile from the dial pad, or send an SMS</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue, and are there any fixes, workarounds, patches, modifications?</p>

            Thank-you very much for your reply Archbolder, 
<br />
<br />Since how long you are facing this issue?
<br />
<br />As with earlier versions of Windows, System Restore allows you to ‘rewind’ your Windows installation to an earlier working state, without affecting your documents. This is possible because Windows automatically saves Restore Points when something significant happens, such as installing a Windows Update or a new application — the idea being that if it goes wrong, you can return to the last Restore Point (or an even earlier one) to turn back time and get things performing as they were previously.

<h2>            Issues with Dashlane on new Surface Pro &#40;2017&#41; using Edge</h2>
                    Dashlane is installed on my new surface pro, BUT, unlike my other devices (Surface Pro 2, my phone, etc.),&nbsp; I have to sign into Dashlane every time I use the Edge browser.&nbsp; Why can't I sign in once and have it 'live' every time I use the browser until
 and unless I sign out of Dashlane?&nbsp; Also, the Dashlane that opens does not have the usual functionality tabs (File, Tools, etc.) so I can check the Edge extension or do anything else.&nbsp; Anyone know how to get full functionality back with Edge (I am a Dashlane
 Premium customer)? Thanks.

 printer.</p>

                    <p>I'm using Microsoft Windows 7 64 bit. &nbsp;My keyboard is a Microsoft Ergonomic 4000. &nbsp;I have a standard issue USB mouse from Dell that came with the Dell PC. This morning, mysteriously, the keyboard would not work at all, though the virtual keyboard on the
 screen was working. &nbsp;I donwloaded the latest software update and to my chagrin, discover that my mouse has been changed back to right click and there is no way to change it to left click again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the control panel to Mouse to change its settings, I get the "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center" but it is keyboard only - no mouse tab at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to change my mouse back to left click --how do I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Have the same issue;&nbsp; new Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is installed and the microsoft website only has software for a keyboard and mouse combination.&nbsp; This removes the option of switching the primary mouse key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Mouse attached to laptop is a&nbsp;Kensington Orbit - set for left-handed use.</p>
<p>I have removed the software: Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3 32-bit<span> (exe) for windows 7</span>.&nbsp; The option to switch primary keys on the mouse has returned and the keyboard has no functionality past the basics.</p>
<p>Please supply software for the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 which doesn't affect mouse software.</p>
<p>Many thanks in anticipation.</p>
<p />
