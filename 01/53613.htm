<h2>            All desktop icons disappeared...</h2>
                    Hey guys,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All of my desktop icons (both system icons and applications) disappeared this morning as I turned on my laptop. I shut it down normally last night. Under right click menu--&gt; View --&gt; Show desktop icons &nbsp;is checked, and under personalization --&gt; Change
 desktop icons, most icons are selected, so it doesn't seem like a setting issue. When I open a file explorer, I can see Desktop under Favorites, it will either appear with all my desktop icons, then turn into Not Responding, or it will just return me a blank
 window and go into Not Responding.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have experienced the same issue? All applications are working fine. I just ran a sfc /scannow, but it doesnt help.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            How do I set intervals for lock screen to show up</h2>
                    I just got a new HP desktop with Windows 8.1. The problem I'm having is that the lock screen appears too frequently. I would guess it's genrally coming up on the monitor at an interval around 2 to 3 minutes. Sometimes it comes up when I'm watching Netflix.
 Is there a way to set the interval? Thanks in advance for your help.<br />

                    I can't seem to find the <strong>Home</strong> page where my contacts share their skype mood messages.&nbsp;<span>Any idea where I could see it?</span>

<p>On the new Skype application, mood message shared by your contacts will no longer appear from your Home page. You may need to&nbsp;check it&nbsp;individually on the user's profile to view their mood message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still wish to see the mood message from your Home page, you may download the classic version of Skype. You may download it using this link and select,
<strong>Get classic Skype</strong>: <strong><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype Download</a></strong></p>
<p>

    <title>Laptop screen disabled when connecting a projector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guy_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop screen disabled when connecting a projector</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: &lt;connecting a pojector&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, I am trying to connect an Acer H5360 projector to my Pavilion dv9750 laptop running Vista Home Premium using an HDMI cable.&nbsp;
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever I connect the projector, either noting happens and by typing FN+F4 &nbsp;I can have my desktop projected or, after some time, automatically my desktop is being projected (w/o typing anything). In both cases, the desktop disappears from my laptop's
 screen (!)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only way to have my laptop's screen active again is by disconnecting the HDMI cable AND even this is not absolutely deterministic: It does happen that the laptop's screen stays inactive after the&nbsp;extraction&nbsp;of the HDMI connector and&nbsp;until&nbsp;it's&nbsp;power&nbsp;is
 cycled</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My question &nbsp;is how do i set up the system to always mirror the lap screen to the projector, whenever the projector is attached, while&nbsp;always&nbsp;leaving the lap's screen active? before, while and after attaching the projector.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd like to add just that i never imagined that it's be so complicate to just attach a projector. For instance, when i attach the same projector with the same cable to my xoom &nbsp;tablet i simply see it projected! without doing anything more than the *physical
 connection*</div>
                </div>

            <p>How many times do you have to press the key combination?</p>
<p>Fn + F4 key combination is to switch between monitors. Try pressing the fn + f4 a few times untill you get to show both monitors ON.
</p>
<p>When the laptop monitor is OFF and the projector is ON, press the key combination and the projector should be OFF and the laptop monitor should be ON. Pressing the key combination the second time turns both the laptop monitor and projector ON. There should
 be no instance that both will go OFF.</p>
<p>If that won't work try enabling your Dual Display:<br />
Right click on the Desktop -&gt; Output To -&gt; Intel Dual Display Clone -&gt; Notebook + Monitor. It may vary defending on your setup, I am using a HP notebook and Acer LCD as second monitor.</p>

            <p>&lt;&lt; 3) laptop with the screen background and no icons nor notification etc + acer at 1280*800. Again, this is the best; above this i had the option of something x 960 and it seem unstable and there are some black lines between the desktop background and the
 bottom notification bar <br />
&nbsp;<br />
This indicates you are in extended mode, you don't have the desktop icons and taskbar on the laptop&nbsp; (monitor 1) because the projector (monitor 2)&nbsp; is set as the Primary monitor.
</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; What i still miss is 1) the ability to have the full desktop with icons on both displays
<br />
You can do this in Dispay settings by clicking on the (monitor 1) and clicking on the check box before "This is my main monitor" and&nbsp; See the link below on how to:<br />

<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h3> steve_r_w  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get Civilzation 4 running on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I am running a new Toshiba Satellite L450D laptop which came with Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed.&nbsp; I have been using it for a couple of months now with no problems - except that some features in my Microsoft Office suite have stopped working.&nbsp; But
 I can find workarounds for those problems.&nbsp; Here's my biggie:<br />
<br />
I am trying to run the game Civilization 4<br />
Developer: Firaxis<br />
Distributor: 2K Games<br />
<br />
I installed the game using the Run as Administrator option.<br />
<br />
I then dowloaded and installed the latest patch (ver 1.61) also using the Run as Administrator option.&nbsp; Apart from installing the patch Firaxis and 2K offer no advice.&nbsp; Civilization 4 was first published in 2005, so I guess it's out of warranty.&nbsp; That's great
 for them but I only bought my copy in 2008.<br />
<br />
If I attempt to run the program normally it appears to start okay - with correct flash screen - but then the laptop switches to a blank (black) screen and locks up.&nbsp; There is a lot of HD activity but no sound and nothing on screen.&nbsp; I cannot get Task Manager
 to work and I cannot toggle program screens.<br />
<br />
Next I tried the Troubleshoot Compatabilitty option.&nbsp; This time, with Win XP settings, I got past the flash screen, the credit screens, and the introductory video.&nbsp; Then lock-up as above.<br />
<br />
I have now big-red-switched my laptop off and on about a dozen times and I'm fed up.&nbsp; Hard re-starts have caused havoc with my settings.&nbsp; I had a heart-stopping 10 minutes when, after one re-start, all my Administrator access appeared to have been deleted and
 I could only find one way to access File Explorer.&nbsp; Then System Restore refused to roll back!<br />
<br />
Since then the laptop appears to have gone back to normal - although my (non-Microsoft) firewall appears to have lost its database of safe programs and is slowing everything down by asking me questions every 5 seconds.&nbsp; Also, I won't dare to try System Restore
 again until all my work is fully backed up.<br />
<br />
Please help - while I still have hair to tear out.<br />
<br />
Steve.<br />

<h2>            Compatibility with Google Input tools</h2>
                    I had installed Google input tools for windows for Bangla keyboard. It was working great with Win 8. But after installing Win 8.1, it is no longer working. The Bengali - INSCRIPT keyboard is still available but is not very user friendly as it do not allow
 phonetic inputs for dipthongs used in Bengali language. Any solutions ?

            <p>Hi Saktinath, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the program and check with the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>To uninstall the program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong></p>
<p>b. Type 'appwiz.cpl' and hit ENTER. </p>
<p>c. From the list of programs, you may double click the program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reinstall the program, you may visit. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.co.in/inputtools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.co.in/inputtools/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: <br />
<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists, you may install the program in Windows 8 compatibility mode and check with the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">a. Locate the <b><font>executable</font></b> file (.exe file) for the driver installation program.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">b. Right-click the file, and then click Properties.</font></span></p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the security information listed on your account to pass verification is no longer accessible, then you would need to fill out and submit an Account Recovery Form to pass verification and a password link will be sent to an alternate email of your choice
 granted if you provide sufficient information. Here is the article that will guide you through the entire process:

<p>Hey there Laetitalll, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, if you are unable to recover your account through those previously posted steps and links, then ultimately the only thing you can do is start another account or keep trying until you are successful in the verification and password reset process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know these security measures may seem harsh but they are in place to make your personal information secure from others who may want to access it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Failed Windows 7 Rollup Installs - 0x80004005 Unspecified Error</h2>
                    <p>I work in a large enterprise environment and we have been having trouble getting
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ANY </span>of the Windows Quality Rollups to install on a substantial number of systems, going back to the April rollup - KB4015549. All logs are indicating error "0x80004005" Unspecified error (gee, thanks for specifics
 MS). I think our problem has something to do with whatever transaction occurs when a newer rollup is installed that supersedes a previously installed rollup (overwriting the previous, removing the previous KB, etc) due to the fact that we are getting the same
 errors when we simply try to uninstall the April rollup. These systems do not have the AMD processors referenced in the KB article for known issues, nor do they have any problems installing any other Windows updates including the monthly 'security only' updates.
 The April rollup isn't the exclusive common thread among all our problematic systems, but seems to be present in about 90% of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excerpt from CBS log:</p>
<p>&nbsp;CBS&nbsp; &nbsp; Failed. Attempted to uninstall a version of a non-driver component that is not installed, version: 0X600011db15ca3, component: amd64_microsoft-windows-m..do-backcompat-tlb60_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7601.23715_none_4b8dbf8520ae4ce5, owner: Package_854_for_KB4015549~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.1.1.3.4015549-2880_neutral_LDR
 [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried these common methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. renamed the SoftwareDistribution &amp; catroot2 folders </p>
<p>2. ran SFC&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. ran SURT (System Update Readiness Tool)</p>
<p>4. DISM repair (dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /Scanhealth)</p>
<p>5. ran WindowsUpdateTroubleshooter </p>
<p>6. re-registered some of the servicing component .dll files</p>
<p>7. installed latest Windows update agent</p>
<p>
</p><p>....among a few other fruitless attempts. I've attempted to manually install the updates (mostly the August and September 2017 rollups) using both the .msu file format as well as the extracted .cab file. Ran April rollup install again, and then attempted
 Aug/Sept rollup....still cannot remove April rollup.</p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t get a Teredo IP address&#38;quot&#59; Yet more Xbox One connection issues</h2>
                    
<p>After jumping through 100 hoops and getting a new router, I finally managed to get my NAT type open on the Xbox One. Now It has gone back to strict and I'm getting a error message telling me that the Xbox &nbsp;"Can't get a Teredo IP address".&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems like there's a new connection problem every day on the Xbox One. Back on the 360 I enabled UPNP on my router and everything worked fine. Now there's all of this port forwarding and static IPs and constant error messages... What the hell do I do
 to fix this ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>My Xbox One is connected to a Westell Model 7500 via an ethernet cable. UPNP is enabled and the Xbox has a static IP. Why the hell do I still have a strict NAT ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Westell Model 7500 is a gateway , could be that simple ...you did port forwarding and upnp? &nbsp;Cant do both , if you just got that modem / router &nbsp;, I would return it and get a modem ONLY , router ONLY....if that came from your isp , the upnp and portforwarding
 may not really even be working , or &nbsp;you get it working , and it reverts....( some isp put their own firmware on there and you cant really change anything)</p>

<p>@ZOMBIE BAIT 368 hey hey</p>
<p>Please keep in mind, that You must use UPnP or manual Port Forwarding, not them all together. So, delete all port forwarding rules, check that UPnP is enabled, then set Xbox One to use Automatic IP address. And check Your gateway for IPv6 settings, You need
 to find something like this: IPv6 Enable, IPv6 filtering, IPv6 tunnels allow, Teredo tunnels allow and etc.</p>
<p>You get this error because Your Xbox One can't create Teredo tunnel thru Your gateway, this tunnel is needed to support Voice Chats for example.</p>

<h2>            How to delete a user account remotely in Windows 8 Pro&#63;</h2>
                    Hey people!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a rather inconvenient question here, which is not urgent, but does give me a great concern.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am an administrator as well as an IT technician (sort of... no qualifications... self-taught only) at a small property management agency.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am currently looking for another job and when it comes to leaving I might no longer have access to the office computer at all. I still do (it's the PC I am writing this post from).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am logged on with my private microsoft account, the same I use everywhere, including my own laptop and family computers too. Needless to say that there are information only I have access to, but I don't want to risk any hack-in attempts in the future.
 It's my personal account after all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way not just disable sync and access to my account on this computer, but force the system to delete my files on this computer using my microsoft account from another computer? even if the files cannot be deleted remotely (they are encrypted),
 if there is a way to prevent my account to show up in the settings and the user selection screen would be a great help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please note that as of now I need to have my personal account on this PC so that I can access information on the office server on the go if needed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>thanks in advance</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS: yes, I did say I am IT technician, but please note it is not my profession. I am more into game development than Windows security functions. Everything I know of computers come from self-education (experiments and failures in my childhood), and even
 though I consider myself a pretty advanced person, beyond user level, I need to admit I am not an expert. especially when it comes to advanced security features. but my mind is open for suggestions, and ideas...</div>

            <p>There's not a way to do this unless you have Device Management suites of software and servers.&nbsp; So basically, not unless you're a massive enterprise company.&nbsp; But even then, there's no absolute guarantee, because the company could just unplug the network
 jack and then you'd never have a way to send a command to that computer anyway to erase it.&nbsp; Plus any local-administrator on the computer can always view all your files, regardless of what protections/security you setup (administrators are like god: they can
 always see everything with no restrictions at all).</p>

            I don't believe you understand the problem.&nbsp; DLNA is a method of&nbsp;playing files from the Win 10 computer (the server) on other equipment such as smart TVs (the client).&nbsp; This worked flawlessly until 3 days ago when the client could no longer see Video or
 Photo files on the server.&nbsp; Music files were unaffected.

    <title>Getting the mouse scroll wheel to navigate as well as zoom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_wc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting the mouse scroll wheel to navigate as well as zoom</h2>
                    <p>Almost lost in the uproar over the removed editing tools is the blow to navigation. &nbsp;All will be well if we get the old program back but it can't hurt to make our voices heard. &nbsp;It's by far the easiest to do so Microsoft should be willing to listen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This thread addresses several requests on the Feedback Hub (thanks, "Dave B") as well as questions posted here. &nbsp;I've created the request "Detailed suggestion to restore scroll/navigate to mouse wheel" on the Hub. &nbsp;Take a look and upvote if you agree. &nbsp;Even
 better, find a flaw that we can discuss here. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Why create a discussion? &nbsp;Mainly to make sure all the bases are covered; we probably won't get a second chance so we need to anticipate all objections. &nbsp;But it's also important to tell Microsoft something they don't already know and I welcome help with that.<br />
<br />
Normally the request shouldn't be created until the discussion is almost finished, but that ignores those who are happy to support it but don't want to wait until the discussion is over. &nbsp;And since it's already fairly detailed, I thought it was justified. &nbsp;Changes
 to the request (such as a link to this thread) can be done with comments.<br />
<br />
P.S. &nbsp;To locate it, start Photos and click on "..." in the upper right for Send Feedback. &nbsp;Then paste the above title into the search box.</p>

            <p>Another thread has provided some feedback. &nbsp;Aside from making navigation much easier, my request attempts to minimize the display of the new navigation pane. &nbsp;Since it now contains a couple icons we can't totally get rid of it but for those that want to
 use the wheel for navigation, it clearly shouldn't appear when the mouse moves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what about those who want to zoom with the wheel? &nbsp;The pane was created because otherwise there would have been no way to navigate without the keyboard (the former screen arrows did not appear if they would have overlaid the picture).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But can we partially kill the pane if &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;wheel&gt; scrolled through pictures? &nbsp;Although that leaves us with no way to navigate without the keyboard (or toolbar), its advantages may make it acceptable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So -- Does anyone need the navigation pane if &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;wheel&gt; is changed to scroll? &nbsp;It would always be available whenever the toolbar was present, but for all practical purposes suppressing it would require us to use the keyboard for navigation.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If the Caps Lock button emulated the &lt;shift&gt; key when the mouse wheel was used it would be much better than using &lt;ctrl&gt; to change the wheel's function. &nbsp;But it only upshifts letters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if nothing is added to Settings (by far the simplest approach), holding down &lt;ctrl&gt; while using the wheel is the best we have. &nbsp;If you don't want to use the keyboard use a mouse with extra buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for whether we can dispense with the clunky navigation pane when the mouse moves, why not have &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;wheel&gt; act as a type of flag? &nbsp;Once it's used Photos should suppress the pane except for when the toolbar is present. This makes sense because you've
 demonstrated that you prefer to navigate without the pane. &nbsp;And we don't need the convenient delete icon since we can always press &lt;delete&gt; (which is actually more convenient to respond to the prompt).</p>

            Have you tried updating your display drivers? Do you know what kind of GPU you have? I noticed the K320 could have a few different ones stock.
<br />
<br />You can find this by right clicking on the Start Menu, click on Display Adapters. What do you have in there? I'd like to try updated drivers, let me know and I'll help you find them.

            Have you tried another HDMI cable? Also have you tried setting different screen resolutions in Windows? I know the GT320 is an older card and it  might be having issues with with your 4K monitor. Have you tried the monitor on another PC/laptop?

            I'm pretty sure it's the card itself, but another thing we could try is we could check your version of Windows. Do you know if you are using the 1709 build?
<br />
<br />Also, have you updated Windows lately? Do you know what version you are running. You can check your version of Windows by by right clicking the Start Menu icon and clicking System. 
<br />
<br />You will see a field called version. What do you have in there? 
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Settings and click on Update &amp; Security. 
<br />
<br />Click the Recovery link on the left and then click on Get started under 'Go back to the previous version of Windows 10.'

<p><span>Hi Pedro,<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Welcome back to Microsoft Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Please uninstall if any third party security software installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. One of the third party services might be causing the issue. To check if any of the Non<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Microsoft service is causing the issue put the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Follow the steps given in the link below to perform clean boot:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span></span></p>
<p><span>3. Click Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories, right click on the Command Prompt option on the<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>drop<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>down menu which appears, click on the Run as Administrator option.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To start the System File Checker follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>a. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>b. Press Enter. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>c. You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>You will <span>&nbsp;</span>be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></span></p>
<p><span>4. If the above steps
<span>&nbsp;</span>doesn't <span>&nbsp;</span>fix the issue, try the steps given below:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>a. Click in start and in Start search box type CMD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>b. In the list right click on CMD and click Run as Administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>c. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>d. Rename C:\Windows \System32\Catroot2 folder to Catroot2.old.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>e. Open C:\Windows folder, and then rename the SoftwareDistribution folder as<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>SoftwareDistribution.old.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>f. At the command prompt, type net start cryptsvc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>g. Install the updates from standalone version that is saved on your desktop.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>h. Restart the computer in normal mode and Check for the updates.<br />

<span>Hi Pedro Borba,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>I do understand your concern but to inform you, this issue is not a bug in Vista. This issue occurs when we rename or delete SoftwareDistribution
 folder, which is located under C:\Windows.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>SoftwareDistribution folder is a location where all the Windows updates information will be stored and it helps to identify which updates
 are installed and which are the new ones which needs to be installed. Deleting or renaming this folder removes the Windows update history information and informs that no updates are installed and now search for Windows updates to install them. To keep one
 more thing in mind is Deleting or renaming the SoftwareDistribution folder doesn’t uninstall the Windows updates which are already installed on the computer, this is by design.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Searching for the updates creates the new list of updates that are already installed on the computer and it will prompt only the new ones
 which are not installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>When I had a look at your previous thread regarding the installation of Vista Service pack 2, suggestion was given to rename this folder inorder
 to install Vista Service pack 2, I believe you may have tried this step because of which you have this issue, correct me if I am wrong.</span></p>
<span>Hope this information was useful.<br />

            Hi again,<br />
<br />
I'm having a really hard time with vista's installation. I've decided to manage the updates manually and install them chronologicaly but somehow&nbsp;i don't manage&nbsp;to get my computer working, i'm getting desperate with this because it has been a few installations
 of the OS, and at a&nbsp;determined&nbsp;point o f time it just seem s to go crazy and nothing works, i've had a bit of everything i guess, blue sreens, computer freezing, whatever u may think. I've got to a point that i don't know what to think anymore, one thing i
 know i've tried everything, i guess.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Well at this moment i´ve finished doing another new clean installation, with only my OS - vista businsess 32 bit, avast home edition and my internet conection (thru a usb pen). I´ve selected "never search for updates" because i'm suspicious that it has something
 to do with windows updates, specifically with windows\SoftwareDistribution\ and windows\winsxs\ folders, and i say this from what i´ve been reading thru the net research i´ve been doing about what is going on with my computer and&nbsp;on the hope that i solve my
 issues. I red some threads about WUA conflicts and updates that show up in the updates historical as installed with success&nbsp;but don´t show up in the installed updates, well the first thing that use to happen when i connected to the ie for the first time after
 a new installation was&nbsp;that my update historical was saying that the latest WUA ......788 installed succesfully but it didn't show up at all in my "installed updates", is that the way it's suposed to be?<br />
<br />
After some crashes and blue screens, a few unsuccesfull restarts and disk failures, between here and there i´ve managed to read a few thing about similar issues with the ones i was going thru, i remember something related with deleting or renaming the Software
 Distribution folder, because of something related with corrupted or damaged files, i also remember somtehing related with a windows\winsxs\Manifest\ folder, that i simply didn't have at the time, the first thing i looked for after this my last installation
 of vista was to look for this Mnifest folder, and guess what there it was, is, but the other installations before this one, at the time things happened and i looked out for some answers and discovered&nbsp;a few threads related with the manifest folder thing, well
 it wasn't in my computer at that time. So because of all this and much more i'm suspicious that it has something to do with vista's updates. Is it ok to install them chronologicaly like i've doing. What about the WUA shouldn't it show up in my "installed updates"
 if it shows up in my historical as so?<br />
<br />
At this time i'm even afraid to register my windows, who knows if it will fail again and another activation will be needeed, i´ve also red that activations are limited too, what a mess. Will anybody help me out with this pleeaaaseee.<br />
<br />
Be well and don´t forget.... to breath.&nbsp;

            Hi Naveen,<br />
<br />
U see that´s the problem i didn't rename or delete any file or folder from c:\windows\ folder, my computer must be very messed up, it must of done by it self the worst is that i´ve been doing fresh new installations of my os because there is always something
 happening that collapses my system and i have no other choice than reinstall everything all over again.<br />
<br />
This is a brand new installation, since the last time i´ve wrote this thread my computer went mad again, bluescreens, computer freezing, disks failures u name it, to a point that i just couldn´t use so i reinstalled it again, this time all i have in my computer
 is vista business 32 bit os, avast antivirus home edition and an internet conection thru an usb pen service.
<br />
<br />
This time i´ve selected never search for updates because i'm suspicious that it has something to do with this, i´ve been searching and found a few things that i think tey are related with this, troubles installing sp1 and sp2, updates that show up in the historical
 as installed but don't show up in the installed updates, issues related with the WUA, by the way this was something that intrigue me the WUA&nbsp;3.0 x86 v7.2.600.788 is the first thing that shows up in my updates historical as installed, but i had my configuration
 set to, warn me but don´t transfer and download the updates, but this WUA just auto installs itself as bad as i set my first ie connection, well this bothers me because it auto installed and thats not how i set my configuration, isn't there something wrong
 with this? But most intriguing for me was that it showed up in the historical as installed but doesn't show up in the installed updates, is it installed or not?<br />
<br />
So here i am with my computer unabled to use it, because i´m afraid to install my apps or ms updates and at a determined point it wacks off again. Does anybody know anything about this and how i can fix it, i'll be much obliged for any&nbsp;good help.<br />
<br />
Be well and thank u so much for your concern.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi <span>Pedro Borba,<br />
</span><br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
We need to install standalone package of SP1 and SP2 so that it will install most of the necessary updates required by Windows.<br />
<br />
We need not have to install each and every update as SP1 will install the required updates.<br />
<br />
Service pack brings or give some addition features to your operating system.<br />
<br />
We need to turn off the Windows Update before installing any of the updates manually. In order to<br />
<br />
Turn off Windows update, follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
Click on start &gt;control panel.<br />
<br />
Under Control panel select System and Maintanence&gt; windows update, then click on change settings .<br />
<br />
Select ‘Never check for Updates’.<br />
<br />
You can also turn off Windows Update service by getting into services.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
Click on start and type services.msc , run as administrator.<br />
<br />
On the services tab, look for Windows update service and disable it.<br />
<br />
It will not let the updates install automatically.<br />
<br />
<br />
Install the standalone package of SP1 from the links given below:<br />
<br />
The links below are to Vista Service Pack 1.Chose your version of Vista.<br />
<br />
Vista 32 Bit<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
after installing SP1, restart the computer and if you find everything is working fine install SP2 from the link below:<br />

            Hi Manasa,<br />
<br />
Thank u so much for your time and concern, but please let me rewind a little bit to my previous thread because i need to add some extra information that i forgot last time.<br />
<br />
So, after the windows vista business 32 bit installation, i´ve used the support cd that came with the p5kr mb and installed the "Intel Chipset Inf Update Program", the "Attansic L1 Gigabit Ethernet Driver" and the "Realtek Audio Driver". Then i used the support
 cd that came with nvidia 8400 gs gpu and installed the driver, it was only after this when i installed the avast home edition antivirus and the usb pen internet conection sevice and finaly configured my system to "Never search for updates".<br />
<br />
A few moments ago my computer wacked out once more and it was only after 2 or 3 unsucessfull restarts that i used my windows vista cd to try a Repair my computer, and so it restarted but not in good health, i guess, because there's something wrong with my personal
 log, something to do with corrupted or damaged files, so the computer created a temp log wich is the one i'm using right now.<br />
<br />
So if i understood right, you're sayint that i should install vista 32 bit sp1&nbsp;&nbsp;right away, no kb949939, no kb937287 and no kb938371, just install sp1 standalone pack, after that and again no pre-requisites needed, just go and install vista 32 bit sp2 standalone
 pack, that´s it?<br />
<br />
I hope it works.<br />
<br />
See u soon and&nbsp;be well,<br />
<br />

            Hi again everyone,<br />
<br />
So this time this is what i did:<br />
<br />
I´ve installed Windows Vista Busines 32, right after that i ran chkdsk and sfc/verifyonly and everything was perfect, i guess, no damaged/corrupted files or folders were found.<br />
<br />
Then, once again, i´ve installed, one by one the "Intel Chipset Inf Update Program", the "Attansic L1 Gigabit Ethernet Driver", "Realtek Audio Driver" and the nvidia 8400 gs driver and ran for each one of them, the chkdsk and sfc/verifyonly, everything seemed
 fine,&nbsp;no damaged/corrupted files or folders were found.<br />
<br />
That´s fine for me, then like Manasa suggested i´ve installed the Vista 32 bit SP1 standalone pack and everuthing went just fine, so i ran the chkdsk and sfc/verifyonly once again to verify that everything was still ok, not that it isn´t but you´ll see what
 i mean,&nbsp;with the chkdsk everything seemed fine no damaged files or folders and no problems found, but the sfc/verifyonly reports integrity violations so i ran sfc/scannow and it reported sucessfull repair of the system, so i thought everything is fine now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ok i restarted my computer and&nbsp;just for confirmation i ran&nbsp;the chkdsk, sfc/verifyonly procedure as before, guess what, sfc/verifyonly reports once again integrity violations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The computer seems to be working fine, at least it's starting as normal as it could be, and no crashing, freezing or&nbsp;bluescreens happenning, at least till now.<br />
<br />
Does anybody can help me out with those integrity violations, is it ok to be like that or should they really be fixed once for good?<br />
<br />
Anyway, i´ll take my chances and i´m going for the second part as Manasa suggested me, i´ll try the Vista 32bit SP2 standalone pack this time. I hope everything goes fine, at least as well as it did with the SP1.<br />
<br />
See u soon and be well.

            Hello again,<br />
<br />
I was hoping that someone would have said/written anything by now, about those integrity violations refered in my previous threads. Anyway so i went on with the SP2 standalone installation, like i said i would,&nbsp;and everything went just fine, then i did the
 same procedure that i've done&nbsp;before with the SP1 and i have precisely the same results, after running the sfc/verifyonly it reported&nbsp;again integrity violations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Apparently the computer is working ok but, what are these integrity violations about, can&nbsp;they be fixed or sould i just leave it like that?<br />
<br />
Be well and thank u so much for any help&nbsp;with these&nbsp;"integrity violations" things.<br />
<br />
See u soon, i hope ...<br />
