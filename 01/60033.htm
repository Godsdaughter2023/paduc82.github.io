 this on my computer to download the file</p>

<h3> bghkoyama  say:</h3>
<h2>            What would cause the Printing preferences font&#47;size to be too large compared to other printer&#39;s printing preferences screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Win7 64-bit pro, installed an R1800 Epson printer and the printing preferences screen looks fine (where you can change the page setup, media, etc).&nbsp; Installed the printer driver for an Epson R2000 printer, but the Printing preferences screen has huge
 fonts that truncate the screen (cuts off some of the additonal buttons to the right).&nbsp; Tried changing the screen resolution (set to 1920 x1200) down to 1024x768 but didn't change the font of the Printing preferences.&nbsp; Changed the display dpi down to 96dpi
 but that didn't change the screen either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstalled and reinstalled just the R2000 printer and the Printing preferences screen (where you right click on the printer in devices and printers) still is large and truncates the screen.&nbsp; The R2000 driver installed just fine to XP and Vista, but just
 not on this Win7 box.</p>

<p>I would suggest you to download and update the latest printer drivers from the manufacturer website and check the issue.</p>

            <p>The above answer is not the right answer for this problem.</p>
<p>I've followed Epson (Eu) instructions to fix it but that doesn't work either. </p>
<p>I've replaced the font information in the registry (removed 120 dpi font info) and done everything except throw Windows out the window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system was working fine until Microsoft automatically loaded an update file without my permission and the next day, all three of my Epson printers are using 120 dpi fonts in the printing preference windows and I can't adjust the printer settings. This
 is most definitely a Microsoft issue, not an Epson one. Reloading Epson drivers is a total waste of time.</p>

    <title>change properties button for printer is missing in control panel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            change properties button for printer is missing in control panel</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to rename my printers. I open the control panel, click on view devices and printers, right click the first printer and click on printer properties which opens the general tab for that printer. On the bottom there should be 3 buttons, change properties,
 preferences..., and print test page. The change properties button is missing so I can't rename the printer. How do I get this button back or else is there another way to rename the printers? If it makes a difference both printers I'm trying to rename are HP
 OfficeJet 4650 all-in-one printers.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why you're no longer able to see the option to change the properties of the attached printers under
<strong>Devices and Printers </strong>in control panel. One possible reason for this is a recent update that was installed on your computer. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made or updates installed on your computer prior to the issue occurring?</li><li>When was the last time were you able to access the option to the change the properties of the attached printer?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>

<p>I've never tried to rename the printers until I bought the second HP 4650 to replace an older Brother printer so I don't know if this is a recent problem or if it's always been there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has installed security updates recently but that's automatic or done when I run Advanced SystemCare which updates the security when I scan the PC. Again, I don't know if this started after an update or has always been there.</p>

<h2>            Inacessible boot device BSOD chkdsk &#47;f does not work.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, My computer was working fine for most of Saturday until the screen on my computer started flashing on and off so I could barely&nbsp;see anything (March 20th around 5-6 o'clock). I could move the mouse but I could not click the start button shut down.
 Instead I held down the power button until my laptop powered off but when I turned it on again the purple light that tells me my disk activity would stay lit for a second or two and then flash on and off and then it would go off. I could see the Alienware
 logo and spinning&nbsp;gears but that was it and then I got a BSOD with the error message "inaccessible_boot_ device." Then my computer automatically restarted and said "Preparing Automatic Repair"it below the spinning gears and then I couple of seconds later it
 said "Automatic Repair could not repair your P.C" you can try restarting your P.C. This will fix most problems or go to advanced options. The same thing happened with HDD light again. Then I clicked on advanced options and went to the most recent system restore
 (March 19) and then I got the error message saying "System restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed." I also got the error code "0x80071a91." Then I clicked close and then I tried it again with a later
 system restore but the same thing happened again. When I got back at the recovery options I tried to boot into safe mode with networking and the same thing happened again. The last thing that I tried was to go into command prompt in the recovery options and
 run chkdsk but then it said "Windows could not run disk check on this volume because it write protected." error. I tried running chkdsk f/ too and that did not work either. I even tried typing c: to select my C disk and running those two commands and that
 did not work. I tried running disk part and then list disk and it found the drive and it said that it was online. Then I ran select disk 0 which is C disk and then attributes disk clear readonly and it said "Diskpart failed to clear disk attributes." After
 that I ran the attributes disk command and next to "Read-only" it said "no." Thanks guys I hope you can help me out.</p>

            Do you think that installing System Explorer, Anvir Task Manager, Process Hacker would have caused this problem with my computer. Also could this problem be caused by there not being enough hard disk space because I only have 47-48 gigabytes left out of
 500.

            I tried doing what you said and it did not work. I follow all of the instructions on the other thread except for the part where you click on automatic repair because the button was not there and so I clicked Startup repair instead because I thought it
 did the same thing. Thanks you for your speedy reply. What should I do now? Do would think you can look at my other posts for my other computer that is having issues:&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/low-fps-in-games/cec1db76-1358-411e-88e2-005f99616f07

            Hey there Jack,<br />
<br />
I would suggest taking the drive out of the laptop (if that doesn't void the warranty) and connect it to another working PC in order to test its health. I would use the manufacturer's tool and also check the raw values of the S.M.A.R.T. status. They should
 give you good insights on the drive's condition. This can either confirm or rule out the drive as the cause of the problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another thing to do is to reset the BIOS and check if there are any new updates for it. Contacting the manufacturer of the laptop may be the best thing here.<br />
<br />

            <p>How would I check to see if taking out the hard drive would void my warranty? How would I reset the BIOS? Is there a way to check the health of a drive via bootable linux? I know there is a recommended BIOS update, see here:&nbsp;http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/servicetag/GDXT662/drivers?s=DHS&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would I update my BIOS via flash drive using dos, bootable linux or mini xp?<br />

            There should be a Warranty Policy that either came with your drive (it should be stated there), or on the manufacturer's web page. If you are still not sure, contacting them with this question would be the fastest and easiest way of figuring that out.
 :)<br />
<br />
Resetting the BIOS may also require you to open the laptop up and the situation with the warranty applies here too. There should also be a setting in the BIOS that allows you to reset it to its factory settings (check your laptop manual for that). Again, contacting
 the manufacturer for this should also give you an answer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/Article/us/en/19/SLN148359/EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This KB</a> should explain well how to update the BIOS on your computer. &nbsp;:)&nbsp;<br />
Keeping the BIOS updated is a good idea, unless there's a known issue with the particular version.&nbsp;<br />

 it was because of the cancelled card and said they fixed the issue and the prepaid cards should work. According to them everything "looks good" on thier end. i called back last night and after a lengthy call i was told the status code 80169D94 meant we were
 banned! i was directed here. i posted on the "why was i banned forum"&nbsp; and the moderator said our account wasnt banned or suspended? So,&nbsp;someone out there in xbox land must know whats going on! can anyone help or point me in the right direction. Sorry for

<p>The error indicates that you xbox live purchasing functions have been “locked”. To unlock ensure that your personal details, name, address, etc precisely match your credit card details in terms of both content and capitalisation. Call xbox phone support
 and advise you have made this change and ask them to kick the problem to the credit department. Wait 24-48hours and miracle your account works.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Black screen, moveable mouse cursor, nothing else</h2>
                    Hi everyone.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to fix a friend's laptop. It's a Toshiba Satellite L455D-S5976.</div>
<div>In regular mode and safe mode, when I get into Windows (7), I see the same thing: a black screen and a cursor I can move.&nbsp;</div>
<div>No shortcuts work, including CTRL-ALT-DEL and CTRL-SHIFT-ESC. I can only get into "Repair your computer" because other modes lead me to the same thing, meaning "Enable low-resolution video," "Last Known Good Configuration," "Safe mode with networking,"
 and others just do not work. While on "Repair your computer" mode, I enter on command promt
<i>path %path%;c:\windows\system32</i> to try to execute software and utilities. Notepad works, but Write doesn't. Explorer.exe does not work, but I get the message "The program can't start because ExplorerFrame.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling
 the program to fix your problem." The DLL file is actually in Windows. I can also open Task Manager via command prompt, but not every command works.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, Startup Repair finds nothing wrong. System Restore tells me: "System Restore failed while scanning the file system on the drive C:\ The drive might be corrupt. You might want to retry System Restore after running chkdsk /R on this disk. An unspecified
 error occurred during System Restore (0x8007000e)."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've used AVG Rescue CD and can browse files just fine. I've connected the laptop to another monitor and it shows the same thing. I tried connecting the laptop to my desktop monitor but happens changes. I need help ASAP.</div>

<div>Unfortunately, this method did not work. I tried the option as stated by entering those commands on the DOS prompt. After that, I still can not get into regular or safe mode. Recent changes before this happened? No. I had installed AVG (newest version),
 but this booting into Windows problem happened like two weeks later. Because it's a laptop, the only things I can connect to it are USB-based devices.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After entering those commands and restarting the PC, I can not enter Repair Your Computer mode. It is not seen in any of the options now. I don't know what else to do. It was my only way to be able to do anything. Maybe AVG Rescue CD could help me undo
 it or using a USB with some version of MS-DOS, but how. I'm creating a MS-DOS Startup USB to try to undo RebuildBCD.</div>

<h2>            Data Integrity Scan for Crash Recovery</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First time poster to this forum, and I am hoping someone can help?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8, I find every-time I log on the 'Host Process for Windows Tasks' takes 50% of CPU use constantly. This never seems to decrease.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have found that this appears to relate the the following scheduled task 'Data Integrity Scan for Crash Recovery'. I have searched using various search engines, but have not found an answer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The laptop has been left on all day but this task never ends. I have run various AV software to check my system, so feel confident that there isn't an infection. There is very little hard disk activity whilst it's running.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Process can be terminated, and doesn't start back up until it is rebooted.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My question is, what is this, can it be stopped, or what is required to get it to finish the task?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Jason</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jason,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you posting in Microsoft Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>From your issue description I understand that the CPU usage is very high when you log on to Host process for Windows.Tasks.</span></p>
<p><span>I request you to perform the following steps and check whether the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1 </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Perform “Clean Boot”</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Step 1:</b><br />
a) Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’ </b>key on the <b>keyboard</b>.<br />
b) In the ‘<b>Run’ </b>windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’ </b>and click ‘<b>Ok’</b>.<br />
c) Click the ‘<b>Boot’ </b>tab and uncheck ‘<b>Safe Boot’ </b>option.<br />
d) On the ‘<b>General’ </b>tab, click to select the option ‘<b>Selective startup’</b>, and then click to
<b>clear </b>the option<b> Load startup items</b> check box.<br />
e) On the ‘<b>Services’ </b>tab, click to select the ‘<b>Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click ‘<b>Disable all’.<br />
</b>f) On the <b>‘StartUp’ </b>tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’</b>. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
<b>right click </b>on <b>each startup item </b>which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’</b>.<br />
f) Click ‘<b>OK’</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services:</span></b><span><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services </b>tab, and then click to <b>select </b>the <b>Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
</b>c. Click to <b>select half of the check boxes </b>in the Service list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns:<br />
If the problem still occurs, </span></b><span>repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
<b>If the problem does not occur, </b>repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<b>If only one service is selected in the Service list,</b> and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items:<br />
If no startup item causes this problem,</span></b><span> a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box
 in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns:<br />
If the problem still occurs,</span></b><span> repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
<b>If the problem does not occur, </b>repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<b>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, </b>and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<b>If no startup item causes this problem</b>, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem:</span></b><span><br />
<b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem,</b> contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.<br />
<br />
<b>Step 7:<br />
Note: </b>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) Restart the computer and check with the issue, if the issue persists follow the next method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the system mantainence troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1 :</span></b><span> You move your mouse to the right bottom and click on “Search”.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2 :</span></b><span> Choose the "setting Tab"; now type Troubleshooting in the search box and click on it which is displayed on the left side of the Windows.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3 :</span></b><span> After step 2 click on the "Run Maintenance task" under the System and Security. The System Maintenance Windows opens.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4 :</span></b><span> Click on the "Next" in the System Maintenance interface. Select "Try troubleshooting as an administrator" if you are using another account; enter the administrator password then continue. This starts detecting the issues
 as shown below</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5 :</span></b><span> If Troubleshooting is done, you can see if there are updates and close it. To choose informatin click on "View detailed information"..</span></p>
<p><span>If you clicked on next then again open the Troubleshooting has completed pop up window and then choose the option "Close the Troubleshooter" to close the Troubleshooter.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same issue. ProcessExplorer (SYSINTERNALS) helped me to find out that the Thread "Integrity Scan for Crash Recovery" causes the Problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if I disable all services, the Host Process still appears with 50% CPU usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I've found a solution for me. I have a Intel Turbo Memory (Robson) build in my notebook. Since I have deinstalled&nbsp;it's driver and disabled this hardware, everythink is OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this will help you too.</p>

<div>go to Task Scheduler</div>
<div>Expand Task schedule library, Microsoft, Windows, Data Integrity Scan. Disable Data Integrity Scan for Crash Recovery. Now both tasks there are disabled in my task scheduler. Seems to have solved it for me. Will be observing. &nbsp;</div>

            <p>I have this same problem&nbsp;(Win 8)&nbsp;--CPU at about 50% and it's the Data Integrity Scan. I disabled it like @JamesHoho and that solved the problem, sort of. Now I'm getting "Solve Important PC Issues/Restart to repair drive errors (important)".&nbsp;Much better
 than 50% CPU, but obviously something's still not right.&nbsp;</p>

            I recently discovered this same issue with "host process for windows tasks" (taskhost.exe) and "data integrity scan for crash recovery" (discan.dll). &nbsp;I have a Thinkpad t500 with windows 8 that was installed around May, however the problem was just recently
 discovered, perhaps within the last month or two.
<div><br />
<div>I was also having 50% CPU usage constantly by&nbsp;<span>"host process for windows tasks" (taskhost.exe). &nbsp;What I have done to work around the problem is to remove the&nbsp;</span><span>"data integrity scan for crash
 recovery" (discan.dll) from the windows\system32 folder. &nbsp;I have saved the file in a zip on my desktop for now. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So far, no more cpu drain. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>What could be the problem here?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks</span></div>

<h2>            Event ID 7023 Error. Computer keeps crashing</h2>
                    <p>My Win 10 X64 computer crashes (shuts off) periodically.&nbsp; It also shuts down when trying to backup using&nbsp;a third party backup program.&nbsp; Did not do this with Win 8.1 or before any November Win 10 updates.</p>

            <p>I had this same problem about three weeks ago, and ran all of the steps you listed here. That seemed to have worked for 20 days, until just now, when the PC suddenly crashed and rebooted again. This always happens during gaming sessions, but with different
 games each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Event Viewer, the last event right before the system shut down was ID 7023, "The User Data Access_8a7dac6 service terminated with the following error: Unable to complete the requested operation because of either a catastrophic media failure
 or a data structure corruption on the disk."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then right before that, there are a TON of Event 10016s:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;<br />
{E579AB5F-1CC4-44B4-BED9-DE0991FF0623}<br />

 tool.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I saved the log as a file and can provide it if needed. Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated - I've never seen a crash like this before.</p>

            <p>After living with crashes, troubleshooting the heck out of my system for months, and going a bit balder in the process, the solution to my problem came down to a hardware solution.&nbsp; Turns out my computer CPU was overheating more when more&nbsp;heavily tasked
 and crashing to protect itself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I stumbled on my solution when I opened the case and found the heat sink and fan was extremely dirty.&nbsp; I removed the heat sink and fan (attached to the CPU), cleaned them with compressed air and reinstalled.&nbsp; I booted my computer and used as usual.&nbsp; One
 exception; it wasn't crashing anymore.&nbsp; I leave my system on 24/7 and noticed that after hours, days, and eventually weeks it was no longer crashing under any condition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion for MY situation is the CPU wasn't being cooled properly causing my computer to overheat and crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone finds this useful.</p>

                    <p><span>It might be a new version of Windows 10, but it has the exact same problems as the previous Windows 10 Home version. Here yet again twice within an hour of upgrading from the previous version of Windows 10 to the new one I have been met with this SAME
 ERROR that I sometimes had on the previous version of Windows 10! The Clock on the Task Bar would go out and the entire Task Bar would stop working and require a entire restart of the computer or totally killing Windows Explorer to fix it. And yet I hoped
 beyond all hope that this error wouldn't appear in this version of Windows 10 and would actually finally be fixed but obliviously it isn't and here is proof in screenshot! The clock stopped&nbsp;</span>at 6:10PM<span>&nbsp;and the entire Task Bar is unresponsive and
 it is really&nbsp;</span>6:26PM<span>&nbsp;right now (I am prewriting this in email via Microsoft Edge because with the Task Bar inaccessible I can't even set up a screenshot to actually paste it into Microsoft Paint to save it as a picture to post until I either kill
 Windows Explorer or do a Restart.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So what's next? Am I going to be seeing that very annoying "Critical Error Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you sign in." error? Can't Microsoft get things right and actually fix their errors in Windows
<span>So what's next? Am I going to be seeing that very annoying "Critical Error Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you sign in." error? Can't Microsoft get things right and actually fix their errors in Windows

</p><p><span>Other issues still in this version of Windows 10 also Includes Windows Defender trying to update when I have Norton Internet Security installed and don't want to ever use Windows Defender since experience with both Windows Defender and Microsoft Security

            <p>On top of the above problem still being in the New Version of Windows 10, I've recently discovered within the past hour that yet again like in the previous version of Windows 10 that whenever Microsoft Edge stops responding and crashes still it effects the
 Start Menu where it only becomes accessible by a Left Click of the mouse and it also prevents the Microsoft Windows Store from working after such a crash involving Microsoft Edge. Also still when Microsoft Edge crashes like this attempting to relaunch it doesn't
 work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet again, a new version of Windows 10, yet it still has the exact same problems as the previous version! It appears that Microsoft hasn't fixed any of the errors within Windows 10, so far the only one I haven't seen yet is the: "Critical Error Start Menu
 and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you sign in." error but I'm starting to think that it's just a matter of time for previous experience has proven that such problems with Microsoft Edge and other "New to Windows 10 apps
 and programs" crash and stop responding eventually lead to getting that Critical Error message.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are facing issues on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the system files are corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Run the SFC scan</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc".<br />
This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's how:<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
<strong>2.</strong> In the Command Prompt, type the following command, <strong>sfc /scannow
</strong>and then press<strong> Enter</strong>. <br />
<strong>3. </strong>Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Run the DISM Tool </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the <strong>DISM </strong>(Deployment Image Servicing and Management) <strong>
Tool</strong> to fix any files that System File Checker can't repair and fix Windows corruption errors. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Right click on<strong> Start</strong>, click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth </strong>and click Enter.<br />
Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth </strong>and click Enter.<br />
Type <strong>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth </strong>and click Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: Run the Powershell command</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, run the Powershell command. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right click on <strong>Start menu </strong>and select <strong>
Task Manager</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Run New Task</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Make sure you have a check mark beside "<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong>".</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Type Powershell Type the following in the Powershell prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Close the Powershell window.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I've already ran SFC hundreds of times on my computer with both versions of Windows 10 and every time it comes back saying the exact same thing, that there are no System Integrity Violations whatsoever. There ARE no problems on my computer at all according
 to SFCand even PowerShell. Yet these problems occur and are NEVER fixed by SFC or even Windows PowerShell since they both come back saying there are no problems. There are not any system files on my computer that are corrupted at all; all are as they are supposed
 to be according to SFC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even the DISM Tool says the EXACT SAME THING ALL THE TIME THAT THERE AREN'T ANY ERRORS WHATSOEVER!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>And as I've stated above Windows PowerShell says the exact same thing!</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Every time the same fixes are suggested for a problem and I've always run them before posting and they NEVER fix the problems at all. If they had fixed the problem I wouldn't be posting here at all because since the exact same fixes are always suggested
 I do them before I EVER post the problem here because THEY NEVER FIX the problem!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thus every time the exact same fix is always suggested to be done is a big annoyance and waste of my extremely valuable time since I've already tried them and they didn't work! Th s if you're always going to suggest the exact same fix for every problem
 in Windows 10, why should I bother posting them to inform Microsoft of the error as well as the other users here if you're just going to suggest a fix that I've already tried that's already proven 100% not to work at all?</div>

            <p>Yet another annoying Windows 10 Problem from the previous version is still present in the New Version; after a full shutdown and the computer is turned back on and after the Windows Logo appears the computer goes to a Black Screen and does NOTHING. No screen
 with my background picture before I put the password in, just a annoying Black Screen and no trick works to get rid of it; except holding down the computer's power button and restarting the computer, only this allows the computer to startup right after the
 Windows Logo after booting and thus allowing me to be able to put my password into the computer to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also last night when shutting down the computer at 3:00AM it wouldn't obey a simple shutdown command! For close to 15 minutes it was spinning and saying it was shutting down. I attempted to get it to shutdown by removing all USB drives and that didn't help
 so I put them back into their respective USB Ports and then since my computer is a laptop I unplugged it from the power cable at the adapter part (the box connected to one part of the two part cable). This actually got the computer to finally finish shutting
 down or so I thought since it went through all the steps with the lights for power, wi-fi adapter and NUM Lock went out. Yet at that moment the computer decided to Restart all on its own! It got to my background screen before the password and from there I
 told it to shutdown again and this time it obeyed and at its true normal shutdown speed/time. This afternoon turning on the computer though brought the error reported in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of these problems occurred in the previous version of Windows 10 as well and yet they are in the NEW version of Windows 10 as well to still plaque Windows 10 users. And still a CMD SFC still says there are no System Integrity Violations, Windows PowerShell
 still finds no problems as well as running all the DISM Commands. The process of elimination shows that all these problems are part of Windows 10 and NOT my computer especially since I've discovered other Windows 10 users also experience the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>****So far still, no: "Critical Error Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you sign in." error has been seen on this version of Windows 10 but I've only had this updated "NEW" version for not even a full day yet.
 And after first upgrading from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home on August 11th it was almost a full week later when I first saw that dreaded Critical Error message, so if this version of Windows 10 is going to repeat the previous version it's going
 to be about a week from upgrading to the new version before the Critical Error appears.****</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>so Far Windows 10</strong></p>

            <p>I am now having many of the same issues you all are having on different pc's in the office after the upgrade to build 1511. We even had 2 microsoft support technical support specialists hang up on us. Talk about rude and unhelpful customer service!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC #1</p>
<p>Networking is all screwed up. I can access the internet and some other pc's on the network however no one can get to my pc anymore. It changed my network profile back to requiring users to use a password which I changed back off. Even still they can see
 me but now can not access any of my folders which were shared previously and still even say they are shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back in see who its shared with and its only me. So I had to re Add the people who to share it with and low and behold now I get an error which says I cant share this folder. What the hell???? This is freakin ridiculous and honestly I am now having
 to waste man hours trying to get this fixed. Networking is vital to my job!! VITAL!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deadlines that I have to meet that now I am not sure I can which means Microsoft Windows 10 just cost me about $500,000! A half a million dollars for my company. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC #2</p>
<p>Installed the update and explorer.exe keeps crashing and resetting. None of the tiles work and in my event viewer I have over 10,000 error messages in just an hour! 10,000!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error messages talk about tile repository database error. This is leaving the task bar completely unusable and continuously crashes explorer.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This has to be the worst update/upgrade ever in modern history! You have seriously cost me with this and I am not a happy camper.</p>

            <p>Exactly like what I'm saying yet Microsoft and their support here acts like I'm the only one with the problem. It's not the first time I've seen problems with Windows 10thst I'm not the only one having. Like the "Critical Error Start Menu and Cortana aren't
 working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you sign in." error; many people have had or are still having that error and Microsoft acts like it doesn't exist at times or says it's caused by something it isn't, apparently many different things cause
 it and some self fixes work for some well others don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft wants to act like Windows 10 is pretty much perfect and the best Windows OS ever, so much so that I've actually read an article that by January 2016 they are going to turn the upgrade from optional for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 to an "Important"
 ("Critical") Update and force it on to everyone with those PCs with those two Operating Systems and then after its downloaded and starting to install they'll get a chance to stop it. Windows 10 hasn't deserved all the high praises Microsoft has been giving
 it trying to get people to upgrade to it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to that article I mentioned:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/five-ways-microsoft-plans-upgrade-171514515.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.yahoo.com/tech/five-ways-microsoft-plans-upgrade-171514515.html</a><br />

            <p>Now I got that annoying "Critical Error Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you sign in." error on Windows 10 Home, Version 1511, 10856. Yet this time it doesn't have the error message or the ability to click
 sign out even though that never worked anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead all that's there is a Task Bar that isn't working and a spinning circle when you move the cursor over it. Also, the Start Menu is totally inaccessible like it is when you have the "Critical Error Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing
 it for you the next time you sign in." message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now though this annoying error even freezes the entire system so it's even impossible to get to Internet Explorer to get to the forums until it decides to un-freeze up and allow access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before anyone says to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run a SFC to find if there is any corrupt files, I have already done that with the scan returning the results: "That there aren't any System Integrity Violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run a DISM Tool scan, I have also already done that as well and it too has come back with everything not having any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Run the PowerShell Command, I've done that as well with it only turning up red text showing errors but that's how it always looked in the previous version of Windows 10 with this error on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're actually going to offer any help on this, PLEASE don't ask for things to be done that I've already done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've started a new thread directly for this annoying error for this version of Windows 10 since I'm highly sure that other people are going to have this error as well given how many people actually had this Critical Error message and problems trying to get
 rid of it on the previous version of Windows 10.</p>

<p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p>Validate Now:</p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.</p>

            <p>If the product ID's are the same numbers listed in the computer properties they could be the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Product ID's and product activation keys are two different things. You could very possibly have the exact same product ID's, but the activation keys are totally different. Also, there is no way to see the activation keys in computer properties. The activation
 keys should be on the COA labels on each laptop. The seller might have used the same disc to install the operating system, but used two different activation keys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could post an MGA report as Andre suggested&nbsp;for both laptops and we can indeed see if&nbsp;both operating systems are the same?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If both laptops have the same version of Windows 7 (Home Premium, Professional, Etc.) and Windows was pre-installed by the laptop manufacture (<strong>both laps from same manufacture</strong>) then both could not only have the same product id but also both
 could also have the same 25 character product key. The product key should be on the bottom of the laptop or inside the battery case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand if the seller installed MSDN / TechNet keys then you have a problem.</p>
<p>Run the Microsoft Genuine Diagnostics Tool using the link that Andre posted to find out what you really have.</p>

            <p>Operating systems preinstalled from the same manufacturer and of the same version will have the same product ID and the same 25 character license key as revealed by the MGADaig tool or by a keyfinder tool. The COA label key should however be different on
 each machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They should however differ if from individual manufacturers.</p>

    <title>Activation key won&#39;t work after clean windows reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timkev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation key won&#39;t work after clean windows reinstall</h2>
                    I bought the Windows 8 key in the end of 2012 officially, legally and upgraded my Windows 7.
<div>There were issues at the start, none of the official Microsoft applications didn't work in the start menu besides Desktop. Not even the App store.</div>
<div>I didn't mind for a while, but after some time I started looking for solutions for a fix. There weren't any that I could find of. I tried every method there was out there in the Internet.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So after a while Windows 8.1 came out. And because the App store didn't work I couldn't update. I was looking for the solutions yet again, but there weren't any for me because you can't install Windows 8.1 outside the App store.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So today I had enough of it and downloaded an official Windows 8 setup and did a reinstall with an option of not keeping any personal files nor windows settings etc. Everything now worked besides my activation key. I found out there was still windows.old
 folder so there must be hope. Are there any solutions so I don't have to buy a new key? I don't take any blame on this and for sure I won't be buying a new key so I hope I can figure it out with the help of someone out here. Thanks.</div>

<p><br />
Try the following:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows&nbsp;8 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then proceed to use phone activation;</p>
<p>1. Press <b>Windows key + X</b> then click<b>Run</b>, then type: <b>slui.exe 4</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have had so many problems, why don't you just wipe your hard drive, and reinstall Win 7, and then do the upgrade to Win 8 again... Keeping Nothing....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't need to install any Win 7 updates or drivers etc. before the upgrade... All you need is for Win 7 to be installed and activated...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that's what you mentioned in your 1st post, but I'm thinking you did the reinstall with Win 8 on the machine, not Win 7...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW... If you have any other hard drives on your machine, temporarily unhook them until everything is complete... This can save you some possible headaches in the future...</p>

<p>Have you tried the "Activate By Phone" feature, or doesn't it appear...</p>

<p>The problem may be with Microsoft's servers... If the phone activation doesn't work, you may need to call them...</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Headphones Latency Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dorklingshot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Headphones Latency Problem</h2>
                    <p>So, when I watch a YouTube video, there is almost NO latency. But, when you play any game, the latency suddenly jumps up higher and it is noticeable.</p>
<p>The latency is around 150ms-200ms, which is a problem for me. However, with Youtube video, there is like 30ms-40ms. Let's say you shoot a gun in a game, when you shoot it, for a fraction of a second, you won't hear anything, then the sound renders in. This
 is a problem for me since my other wireless headphones won't work anymore, which I have to use my Bose Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way to lower the latency when playing games, please tell me.</p>

 will not type. &nbsp;I try switching usb ports, nothing. &nbsp;So i manually restart. &nbsp;Upon restart my mouse starts working and my backlit keyboard lights up... but doesn't type. &nbsp;I tried to use the onscreen keyboard.... &nbsp;this doesn't work. &nbsp;So i try a restart from
 the login screen.... &nbsp;my computer shut the screens down, but hasn't actually rebooted and it has been close to 20 minutes not. &nbsp;any help out there?

            <p>I am in the same situation. The Windows 10 update has killed my keyboard. I can't use my computer until I get a new keyboard because I can't log in... &nbsp;Because the keyboard - which worked until the update and still works on other machines - is unable to
 type characters.</p>
<p>The mouse works just fine.</p>
<p>But yes. I think Microsoft owes me a new keyboard for SURE.</p>
<p>And if my computer is toast? Or i have to wipe all my files? I'll be exceedingly pissed off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because this is sommmeee buuuul shhhh itttt.</p>

            <p>After allowing Windows 10 Pro build&nbsp;1511, 10586 to install last night, I just had the exact same problem:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The keyboard keys work intermittently with long lag between strokes</li><li>The mouse is so laggy, it is unusable</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I thought this was related to the external logitech keyboard/mouse combo (wireless usb) I was using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting the external devices, I tried going to the Mouse and Keyboard Center. &nbsp;I was immediately presented an error that the mkc.msi file was missing. &nbsp;Thankfully, that was easy to find and download on the Microsoft web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that did not solve my problem as it didn't even recognize the devices I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, I did away with the external devices and tried the integrated trackpad and pointer on my Lenovo Helix. &nbsp;THAT's when I realized this had nothing to do with the external devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my drivers were up to date. &nbsp;So I knew I had to get rid of the build</p>
<p>Windows Update -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; View your update history -&gt; Uninstall latest preview build</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I've done that, my keyboard/mouse are back to normal. &nbsp;Maybe I'll try the next build which seems to be the only way to correct this. &nbsp;I'll be sure to do a complete backup of the system image first though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, I was already on Windows 10 and only started having the problems with this latest build. &nbsp;Maybe that will help people get to Windows 10 but not the screwy version.</p>

            <p>Your link is no good. My husband is having this "Windows 10 AKA -the newest pile of steaming poo to be dumped into my computer- has broken my mouse" problem. Now, my husband is not a laymen. He is certified in so much crap with computers I can't even tell
 you. So you can imagine how infuriating this has been for him. We've done it all. Updated drivers,changed ports, rolled back drivers, disabled settings, enabled others, changed this and changed that. ..All I want to know is, has anyone been able to get Microsoft
 to pull their heads out of their own butts long enough for air? Because if they did exit their cave under a rock they would see and hear how terrible the consumer thinks their product is. And the lack of help and support is astounding. I feel like you released
 a turd onto the market, forced everyone to use the turd and are now saying "Thanks for Downloading Windows 10, it might work in 5 years. We're not sure! XOXO Microsoft"<br />
In closing, please help me fix this mouse, or you could fix your product, so it actually functions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Can't move tabs from one monitor to the other. No click and hold function.&nbsp;<br />
**Update** First I updated the drivers AND software for my mouse. I changed the settings for cortona, basically shut her down on everything-that helped with the mouse buttons lag and click and hold failure rate a ton. Then I went into the mouse settings and
 turned on and off the "scroll through inactive pages" setting a few times, then left it off. I can now move the Windows File Manager tabs around and back and forth between monitors, but it's still a little clunky. I am waiting for the final verdict based on
 my husbands evaluation at lunch today. Jury is still out on why Windows is treating this issue like it's not "their" problem. It's okay...in this house we say" F you, Microsoft" and make it work anyways.</p>

    <title>Updates fail to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidmaxwell3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates fail to install</h2>
                    <p>I believe this is not uncommon.&nbsp; And the same thing happened a couple of years ago, ( I cannot remember how I eventually fixed it then, but it may have involved deleting and reinstalling Silverlight, whatever this has to do with downloading....)&nbsp; Two recent
 updates, (KB2952664 and KB4074598) downloaded happily, together with Definition Update for Windows Defender.&nbsp; Definition update installed happily.&nbsp; Two other updates, downloaded, installed as far as running to point of automatic close and restart, then running
 up to "Configuring Windows Update. Do not turn off your computer", and running up to 15%, at which point it fails, message says "Failure configuring updates.&nbsp; Reverting changes. "&nbsp; After a prolonged period thinking, closing down, restarting, closing down,
 and restarting, it eventually does get itself back to the pre-update state, (and runs perfectly happily).&nbsp; I have dealt with it for now by forcing update alerts and refusing to load the new updates, but this is not satisfactory in the longer term.</p>
<p>So far, in an effort to fix it, I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Run the Update Repair tool - this claims that it has fixed the Service Registration, reset the Update data store, Repaired Windows Update, and done this last a second time.&nbsp; But it says that it did NOT fix error 0x80070490.&nbsp; (This last appears to be a
 totally generic error which gets triggered by anything which Windows doesn't like, and gives no indication of where the problem lies)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Run sfc /scannow.&nbsp; The first time I ran this, it found some error, (and fixed it).&nbsp; The last time I ran it, it reported no errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Downloaded the Manual Update, WindowsUpDate.diagcab, and ran that.&nbsp; This did not fix the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, where do I go next?</p>

<p>hi there:</p>
<p>I hope I can be a help to you. Regards to the error message you received:&nbsp;"Failure configuring updates. Reverting changes.", please press the windows logo and R on your keyboard and type: services.msc. Services screen will be opened. Click on Background
 Intelligence Transfer Service and start the service. You can right click and on properties, click automatic. The reason why you got that message is because the BITS is not started. It should work.</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>The reason why you got that message is because the BITS is not started. It should work.</blockquote>
<p>Nope.&nbsp; The BITS was already running, and set to automatic.&nbsp; And the problem is not an issue of transfer - the updates download perfectly well.&nbsp; And when I download the updates manually, I get a message "Succeeded.&nbsp; The unpdates were successfully installed".&nbsp;
 But the problem arises in the configuration process - it starts the configuration, runs to the point of shutting down and restarting, runs for 15% of the process of configuration, before deciding that it cannot proceed, and rolling back everything it has done
 to that point.&nbsp; (I did, however, take the opportunity to stop the BITS and restart it, and reset it to automatic.)</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabriel bello portmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Replacement</h2>
                    <p>So about a month ago, I traded in my macbook pro and an ipad to get a surface pro 4. I was very happy with it, since I wanted to use it to take notes in class, and although I encountered various problems like the hardware being very delicate, flicker screen
 and problems with the keyboard connectivity, and decided that it was not major. I was not until a couple of days ago that the stand (which moves and folds on itself quite a lot) folded on itself, which caused the surface to fall from my bed to the floor. Now,
 consider that my bed is not elevated, and the floor is covered with carpet. The surface fell on its corner where it got a minuscule scratch, but the whole screen cracked terribly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am now considering purchasing a replacement (since the warranty will not cover physical damage) but I had a quick question. Given that I am quite unhappy with my purchase, is there any way I could get a replacement for another device of an equal price
 (or higher, I would gladly pay the difference)?</p>

            <p>Hello GM_729,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Windows Photo Gallery forum. Sorry to hear that your photos are missing when importing&nbsp;them in Photo Gallery.&nbsp;Since you've mentioned that you hit the Delete option
<strong>after</strong> importing them, we would like to confirm where did you save the files? By default, imported photos are stored in your My Pictures folder. Have you tried checking your My Pictures folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we would like to verify where did you actually hit the Delete option? Is it on your camera or in Photo Gallery?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime,&nbsp;please check&nbsp;your Recycle Bin to see if the missing photos are also located there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Xbox one games PreOrder codes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is the 2nd to a two part question, the other is asked in the correct form section.. i hope. So im a 360 owner without internet and in the past when i got preorder codes from like gamestop, i went to my computer and logged into xbox.com and typed in
 the redeemed code which set it up for me to download later. Since i dont have the One just yet and say i get the GREAT Halo: Master Chief Edition from gamestop and the preorder code is there, can i log onto to xbox.com and imput the code there or do i need
 to have an xbox one with the game in the unit to install the code? And yes, i know the game isnt out yet but previous xbox one games have come with preorder codes, how did those work?</p>

    <title>Unable to get a refund for Anthem due to pre-ordering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linkinprime  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to get a refund for Anthem due to pre-ordering</h2>
                    <p>I pre-ordered Anthem Legion of Dawn Edition on January 26th.&nbsp; Found out on Feb 22nd the release date, that none of my friends were getting it, so i submitted a refund request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is my requests are automatically being closed because they're looking at the pre-order date and not the release date.&nbsp; I've had numerous calls to support and they claim they can't help and tell me to keep submitting requests online for a refund.
 Numerous requests have been submitted and ignored.&nbsp; I don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp; Funny thing is, i purchased Far Cry 5 on Feb 23rd and i get the option to request a refund for it but Anthem that released a day before is impossible to refund!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions? Support won't help, they claim they have no way of escalating cases to the refund department or any way to contact them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had i pre-ordered a day before or purchased day one, i would have been refunded without issues.&nbsp; What's the message here? Never pre-order?</p>
<p />

<p>Hey there Prime thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, support was right on this one, neither we or them have a way to escalate these type of issues to the refund team. The best course of action would be to reply to the denial email to speak to them through there (its the only way to reach them).
 We hope this helps but let us know if we can further assist in this or any other matter!</p>

    <title>Wireless driver seemingly deleted after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderblyth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless driver seemingly deleted after update</h2>
                    So this morning I turned on my Acer Aspire laptop to find that Windows 10 had performed yet another unscheduled restart, despite no prior warnings... while trying to open the Chrome tabs I previously had open, I found that I had no connection to my usual
 home wifi. While investigating further, turning on wifi in the "Acer Device Fast Lane" did nothing, as did using the function-wifi command on my keyboard. Looking at the network and internet center in my control panel, the only network connection available
 is through ethernet. Investigating further by opening my device manager, it appears that there is no wifi driver at all, as the only options are 8 "WAN miniports" and a single Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller. Can someone please tell me where my wifi went??

            <p>Hi Ma.Lau,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer also went through an automatic update which restarted my computer today (10/12/16). I arrived home to find I had no wifi network options when I usually have about 30. There were no options for troubleshooting except the system telling me to hook
 up an Ethernet cable. I could not open anything related to wifi as all the options were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to restore my system to the recovery date of 4 days earlier in order to get my wifi networks back. To make matters worse - once I did all that I went and got something to eat only to discover that darn automatic update did it again while I was gone
 and once again all my network wifi options were gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since disabled automatic updates because I don't want this happening everyday. I am running Windows 8 and someone at MSFT should know they are disabling who knows how many computers because of this faulty update.</p>
