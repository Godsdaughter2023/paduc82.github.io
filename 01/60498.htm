<h2>            Can&#39;t activate windows on a new computer.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Help<br />
<br />
I have recently upgraded from a z97 system to an x99 system and my new system won't activate windows and the info I have found thus far has not been helpful.<br />
<br />
Would someone be able to help me out? Screenshots linked bellow will illustrate the issue. The first picture is a screenshot from my old computer (I reinstalled all the hardware to get that shot haha) where windows is clearly activated. Upon installing the
 "new" hardware and attempting to activate, I get an error telling my my old system isn't activated.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure I am missing something obvious here. </p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Just for background information this specific version of windows was from an old windows 7 version that I upgraded to windows 10 a while ago. I don't know if that would impact anything. Also on my Microsoft account under my listed
 devices I have 2 computers under the same name (DESKTOP-59TK1QC), one saying that it has a Z97X-UD5H-BK (old motherboard) with a&nbsp;i7-6800K (new cpu) installed, these 2 parts are incompatible, which leads me to believe&nbsp;that something has gone a miss on Microsoft&nbsp;end.</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><br />
Many thanks for any help.</p>

            Hi Scoot_Scoot
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need to verify whether it is OEM or Retail or Volume and other details, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Thanks for getting back to me. I have tried all of the things you have linked already, prior to making this post.<br />
<br />
My product ID channel is retail.<br />
<br />
I should also note that I have seen the "windows is activated" sign on my new computer, this happened when I started it up again the day after.

<p>Ok so update after troubleshooting this some more.<br />
<br />
I have managed to get my old computer to be registered in the devices section of my account correctly. Everything seems to be ok there. This was solved by just removing all my registered devices (PC anyway) and then rebooting, although now I only have 1 "Use
 apps offline" change left....<br />
<br />
After putting all my HDD's back in the new computer it will activate on first boot correctly (See Figure 1). Upon reboot it will pop the "please activate windows" error, although now I am getting a slightly different error when I try to use my old activation
 on my new computer (See Figure 2) stating that "<span><span>These devices were registered with a version of Windows 10 that does not support this feature.", I guess windows was not designed to be transferred? Although it
 clearly states that is is all over the Microsoft&nbsp;web site</span></span>.</p>
<p><br />
So I thought maybe I could just press change the product key and enter the product key I am using. I used a key-finder app to extract my product key and enter it into the "change product key" prompt. I now get this error (See Figure 3).<br />
<br />
Come on guys I'm just trying to use the product I purchased.... Does anyone have any idea what I can do, how can I get in touch with Microsoft directly (I live in Australia, the time difference is 11 hours)?&nbsp;<br />

                    Windows 8.1 does not include Windows Media Player unless you pay extra for Windows 8.1 Pro. I am unable to rip CDs without WMP and need to know if there is another app that will allow me to rip CDs.<br />

            What DVD Playback for Windows says is basically you have to search for a DVD Player app in the Windows store, but it doesn't tell me what which app will let me rip CDs. I have no interest in DVDs. So how do I tell which app will do what I want? I would
 rather not pay to upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro and have to buy the Media Package.<br />

            Have you tried to send to file to drive? Also there a lot of good free burning software. Even some of the paid one's offer a free version. If you haven't heard of it try softpedia.com a great source of software.

            <p>Geethu is quite possibly confused.&nbsp; You used the slightly vague name Windows 8.1: are you specifically using Windows 8.1 N or are you using Windows 8.1 RT?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are using "N" you can install Windows Media Player using the Media Restore Pack (or whatever the current name is).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are using Windows 8.1 RT, it is not that you are not using Pro, really, it's that your hardware itself is not supported by Windows Media Player at this time.&nbsp; Upgrade to "Pro" on your system probably wouldn't be possible.</p>

            When I put in the CD it comes up as "Unknown Album" but not under "Music." &nbsp;After "videos" comes "Pictures" then "Recorded TV" then "Other Media" and finally "Unknown Album" (which is the one I put in. &nbsp;However, when I highlight it there opens under "Audio
 CD" my "unknown album." &nbsp;That's when I try to "Rip CD" and I get that message "Windows Media Player cannot rip one or more tracks from the CD." &nbsp;Then I have to choose "close" or "web help" which as I explained yesterday doesn't help at all. &nbsp;I'm really stuck.

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0A not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0A not working</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Microsoft Wireless Multimedia Keyboard 1.0A and a Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0A and have had them around 3 years or so. They were given to me with a computer but as the computer wasn't working I didn't have a chance to use them until about a year
 and a half ago. Up until now they have been working fine, almost without event. I currently have them plugged into a laptop and my girlfriend unplugged them the other day to plug into her laptop so she could play a game. After plugging them back into the original
 laptop only the keyboard will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have pressed the sync button on the receiver and then on the mouse itself and it seems to work as the lights on the receiver go from flashing to solid, yet when I move the mouse it doesn't respond on the screen. I tried changing the batteries, moving all
 other devices away from the reciever, unlpugging it, resetting the computer, everything. I searched Microsoft Support but it seems my mouse is an outdated model and there is literally NO info on how to fix it. I tried the steps they suggested on other Wireless
 models but to no avail. What could the problem be?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi jaeger138,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•</span><span>Did you check the mouse on a different computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Test the device on a different computer</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue continues to occur, test the mouse on a different computer in a different environment. If you can replicate the problem in a different
 environment, you may have a defective device. If this is the case, see the "More Information" section for information about how to contact Microsoft Supplemental Parts to obtain a replacement device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the device works without any issue on a different computer, go to method 4.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Back to the top</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Test the mouse by using the Mousinfo diagnostic tool</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The Mousinfo diagnostic tool is installed together with the IntelliPoint software. If you do not have this software, you cannot open the tool.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To install the IntelliPoint software, visit the following Microsoft Web site:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=MK (http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx?category=MK)</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> This tool may not work with Bluetooth devices.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To open the Mousinfo tool, follow these steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Vista or Windows 7</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, Select All Programs and click Accessories.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Run.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Open box, type mousinfo, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Try another USB port for the wireless receiver.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If using a USB hub, try connecting the receiver to a port directly on the computer. The problem may be a bad port or hub. Restart your computer after
 reconnecting the mouse's wireless receiver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also refer the KB article for more information:</span></span></p>

<h2>            Ravenscar Keep demon door - glitch&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have completed the game and am now going around doing extra bits. I have all the clothes in the game and got the achievement for it. Now I'm wearing my prisoner outfit consisting of:</p>

<p>Yet the demon door tells me I'm missing something, any ideas what it is? Or is it a glitch?</p>

<p><span>Hi chris1863,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There could be a possibility that the Microphone is set to record only Monotype recording. Enable Stereo Mix and see if that makes a difference.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Show Disabled devices and Set Microphone as default device</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Go to Start and click on Control Panel.<br />
2. Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.<br />
3. In the new windows click on the tab "Recording" and right click on the empty space on the window and place a check mark for “Show Disabled devices” and “Show disconnected devices”.<br />
4. Now check if Microphone is listed there and right click on it and choose enable.<br />
5. Highlight that Microphone and click on "Set as Default Device".</span></p>
<p><span>Also click on “Stereo Mix” and select “Enable”.</span></p>
<p><span>Stereo Mix is available if the other devices (Microphone, Rear input) are enabled and set as default devices.</span></p>
<p><span>In order to enable and make the Stereo Mix available, you would have to right click on Stereo Mix and select ‘Set as Default Device’.</span></p>
<p><span>This would make the Stereo Mix available.</span></p>
<p><span>Note:</span></p>
<p><span>If the "Stereo Mix" type device did Not show up in the "Sound" window when right-clicking and selecting Show Disabled Devices, it may indicate
 that you have <strong>Integrated Sound</strong>, and <strong>recording streaming</strong>, etc. is Not supported. In that case (on a Desktop PC), installing a sound card into an available slot should solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>If you're using a Laptop or a Notebook and aren't able to get your preferred Input Sources showing, that is hard to resolve. The best thing
 to do in that case is to contact the manufacturer to see what they can recommend.</span></p>
<p><span>If your laptop has a PCMCIA slot, it might be possible to use a PCMCIA sound card to resolve the problem but haven't been able to test that
 yet.</span></p>
<p><span>(Sometimes downloading and installing your sound card manufacturer's latest drivers can add additional sources like What-U-Hear, Stereo Mix,
 etc. Also, some users have reported that "downgrading" drivers to older versions have helped them instead of "upgrading").</span></p>
<p><span>As a last resort, you can use a mini-plug Stereo-to-Stereo cable plugged in from Headphone/Speaker Out to Line-In or if Line-In is not available
 you can use a Stereo-to-Mono cable plugged in from Headphone/Speaker Out to Microphone In.</span></p>
<p><span>Then select the appropriate Input Source in the recorder's Options: Line-In or Microphone.</span></p>
<p><span>When using the cable connection method, make sure to start with very Low volume settings so you don't damage your sound card.</span></p>
<p><span>(Also using the "cable" method into Line-In activates and enabled the previously unavailable "Stereo Mix" Input Source).</span></p>

<p>Chris I have been having this same issue since getting my new Dell inspiron 530. This was never an issue for me before on my older computer. The funny thing is that even the sound recorder that came with the PC is doing the same thing, so I know it is not
 my Adobe software. I called dell the other day, a 3 hour call, they even had me uninstall adobe and reinstall it and nothing. Please tell me you were able to get an answer. I am so frustrated and I dont have the 3.0. Cant afford it :(.</p>
<p>Please let me know :)</p>

<p>Thanks Jerry, I already check it. The strange thing is that every single program I download to record on its does the same thing, it is crazy. I bought this new computer for my studio ( Home Grown) and now I can not even record because it only records to
 the right side. Anyone out there have a solution to this issue? The only thing I can think of is sending this PC back and getting them to send me another. It has got to be the PC? Maybe sound card? Dell is really no help at all. This is so very frustrating.</p>

            I know this thread is old now but I'm having a similar issue here. I am using Windows 7, and an external mic setup going through a Digidesign Mbox 2. Windows recognizes the Mbox as it should, because I use the Mbox to record into Digidesigns software perfectly
 fine too. I have the Mbox listed in my audio devices in Windows, therefore I can use the mic being plugged into it as my default Windows microphone.
<div><br />
<div>I have been using Fraps and/or Dxtory software to record my game-play of games. I would like my video to include two audio sources, and both Fraps and Dxtory have options to include more then one audio source in the recording for this reason.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My first choice is my main output (speakers - game audio and Skype come through here.) as one, and it works fine. I get my game audio and Skype call all recorded through both programs great, this isn't the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My second choice of audio sources in Fraps/Dxtory is my microphone that I use for Skype that's ran through the Mbox. This is the problem. Windows has no "stereo mix" feature and takes the Mbox mic signal and keeps it on the left side. Skype is able to
 take the VERY SAME signal coming through the Mbox and everyone in our call gets my voice at the right level and as a mono signal to both their speakers respectively. Fraps, Dxtory, and even Windows' Sound Recorder all take that signal and record it (super
 super quiet) as if on a "stereo track," putting on either the left or right sides, depending on which input it's going into on the Mbox. Yes the Mbox has a mono button, but this does NOT effect recording in windows. The mono button is for input-only monitoring
 from the Mbox BEFORE it hits Windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My end goal is to have the recorded video include all of these elements when finished: 1) Game video 2) game audio and skype call via main output source 3) My own voice via my microphone input source.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My issue is that Windows is the only thing not able to understand how to take my mic input and keep it mono so it outputs to both speakers. Somehow Windows is trying to take both inputs 1 and 2 from the Mbox simultaneously and pan them left and right.
 Why don't I have control over this in windows? Skype seems to be the only thing that know's what's up and can take my signal and automatically keep it mono.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Similarly, everyone here is just using their PC mic-in jacks on their computers and getting the SAME result.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows is hi-jacking their signals and putting them onto a magic unseen "stereo track" and mixing it onto left/right only, when really it needs
 to be kept on a mono track and output as such.</div>

<div>I have installed XP Mode and can run the game; the audio is fine but just a black screen. &nbsp;I have tried to decrease graphic resolution thinking this might help, but no luck. &nbsp;Is there some fix to downgrade the graphics card so I can play the game?</div>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Virtual PC and Hyper-V present an emulated S3 Trio graphics card with limited features to the
 virtualized operating system. There is no workaround to use the drivers for your physical graphics card because the virtual machine can't access the physical hardware.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>It's probably not compatible with the Virtual XP Mode video mode itself.<span>&nbsp;</span>The
 game is probably trying to set a specific video mode and it cannot do it.<span>&nbsp;</span>The video driver in XP Mode is a very basic driver.<span>&nbsp;
</span>XP Mode is not optimized for games at all.<span>&nbsp;</span>It's intended to run business programs like MS Word and such that are not graphics intensive.<br />
<br />
You can try running the game in compatibility mode and check if it helps, here is the link:<br />

<h2>            Only partial import of video VOB file with Movie Maker</h2>
                    I'm importing the VOB files from a made up DVD but they are shortened. If I draw the cursor back, then I can see the files there in full but there are only bits&nbsp; visible in the right hand frame.<br />
Is there a fix for this?<br />

            <p>Hi AdrianRK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for not responding on your query on a timely manner. I'd be glad to assist you with your issue that when importing the .vob files they are shortened. Kindly follow the steps below as it may help you resolve your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ensure that you have the proper codecs to play your videos and audio files</strong> - Audio and Video require codecs to play the file and it’s important to have the right codecs installed or updated in your PC.
<br />
<br />
·<strong>Try running the Microsoft FixIt tool for codecs: </strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/</a><br />
<br />
·&nbsp;<strong>Media info</strong> will be able to identify any issues with missing or faulty codecs and whether it’s already installed in your computer or not. You can get it at&nbsp;
<a href="http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net/en</a><strong><br />
<br />
Note:</strong> If can't find the codec you need you may convert the video to a supported format (eg. wmv) and then add it to your Windows Movie Maker project.</p>
<p><br />
Your cooperation on this matter will be highly appreciated. I'll look forward for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Ali.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can see if there's a separate factory recovery image which on HP will run by pressing the F11 key while powering up:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04758961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c04758961</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails then do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Possible gamertag change</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I've had the name Blest&nbsp;in mutiple ways on xbox/mixer/twitch/ps4/ps3 and steam. Now I've always wondered why I couldn't just have the name Blest on xbox. I find out&nbsp;that the&nbsp;account has never been played and has zero gamer score since the beginning that xbox360 has come out. I would like to get rights&nbsp;to the name if possible and have my account name changed to that.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Please explain what this means. You can't just 'change' an email address, so there are several possibilities for what you actually did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used the account button (the right-most button on the <em>Home</em> tab of the ribbon) to
<em>Sign in with a different email address</em>, you asked the program to load the calendar and contacts for the Microsoft Account that uses that email address. To load the calendar and contacts you had before, you must sign in with the same email address as
 you used before.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I deleted the old account ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, please explain what this means. Did you remove a mail account from the folder pane? Or did you visit your Microsoft Account web page and mark the account for deletion? If it was the latter, then you have a 60-day period of grace before your data are
 expunged.</p>

<h2>            Start Menu and Cortana with Updates stuck</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 several months ago and it's been a complete nightmare. It seems every time I turn on my laptop, another feature stops working. As of now, I'm unable to use the start button for anything, so I'm unable to get to any of my apps or
 programs. I can no longer open the action center using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts. I can't open Cortana or help. Basically anything on the taskbar doesn't work. If I don't have a shortcut on my desktop, I'm unable to access anything on my laptop.&nbsp; I checked
 for any updates to see if they were installed, and my update window shows an update in progress but it's been at 93% for days now. Doesn't appear it will finish the update. Many of the&nbsp;items show status as Error, with one item showing as installing and another
 one showing as Waiting to Install. Another problem I'm having is the time it takes to power down my laptop. It's takes over 15 minutes to shut down completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the following which was on the community, but this hasn't helped.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to help provide the assistance required to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have stated, I suggest that you perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, power down your computer by performing Power Drain. Once done you will have to restart the update and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Power Drain:-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unplug the charger and remove the battery of your laptop, if using a desktop remove the power cord.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the Power button for 30sec </span></li><li><span>Plug the charger/power cord and restart system</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist even after power drain, I suggest that you run Windows Update Troubleshooter. This is an in built tool which will help you detect and fix errors pertaining to Windows.

<h2>            High CPU Spikes Causing Intense Lag</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having issues with my laptop for about a month now, but the problem has been very gradual and it's now starting to become a major issue that is making laptop almost unusable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has intermittent spikes of high CPU (40-100%) usage about every 5 seconds. This causing the screen to completely freeze up for about 5 seconds and then it will speed up again to catch up. After this problem became apparent I did some digging online
 on these forums to try some fixes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have:&nbsp;</p>
<p>deleted unnecessary programs that I installed</p>
<p>Updated all drivers</p>
<p>Run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image / Restorehealth</p>
<p>Run sfc /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far none of that has worked. I have run a clean boot and that was successful and had no problems during that, but I'm unsure of where to proceed from there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also downloaded the program Process Explorer and have discovered the two main culprits: TiWorker.exe and ntoskml.exe both running at over 20% when the CPU spikes happen. What I can I do to try to fix these issues? Any help will be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sahaj
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You can try resetting your Windows Update components. 
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed. 
<br />
<br />Try this additional tips to see if they work:

            Hi SahajSatish, version 1903 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

    <title>20 digit volume license versus 25 character product key activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toneow  say:</h3>
<h2>            20 digit volume license versus 25 character product key activation</h2>
                    <p>A week or so ago I was given an HP computer running&nbsp;xp professional sp3.</p>
<p>The os and computer are over 5 years old</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to restore the os to its "factory state".</p>
<p>I DO NOT have the installation disk so I created a bootable xp professional setup disk using the files on my hard disk.</p>
<p>The disk was created; and to test it I used another computer with a newly formatted hard drive.</p>
<p>Everything went okay until I came to the webpage&nbsp;asking&nbsp;for the 25 digit Product Key and Volume License Product key.</p>
<p>I keyed in the 25 characters from the label attached to my HP&nbsp;computer case and was rejected.</p>
<p>I then keyed in the 25 character activation code (obtained from the HP computer) and again was rejected.</p>
<p>I found a 20 digit SPSS (???) Volume License key (???) but this was rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My objective is to have the xp professional arranged to suit my needs</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Have some way of reinstalling xp professional following&nbsp;a total catastrophic failure
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All help and advise welcome</p>
<p>regards</p>

    <title>KEEP GETTING DROPPED FROM GAMES IN HAPPY WARS&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            KEEP GETTING DROPPED FROM GAMES IN HAPPY WARS&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know what the problem is but I keep getting dropped out of games of happy wars with the message (lost connection to other players) which seems to happen every game. I played the beta but never had this problem until the public release. I've checked
 everything on my end including network and connection and all is good on my end and this issue only happens on happy wars. All my other online games work perfectly so it has to be something on your end and I'm wondering if this issue is going to be resolved
 soon so I can actually play this game or am I just wasting my time. I understand the game is free but I have invested MS points into it and sad to say the beta worked way better than this so called final version. Hopefully something will be done about this
 soon since my time with xbox live this last year has been less than stellar in my eyes with weak overpriced DLC, shotty games, poor customer service, cheap servers, and poor patch jobs for games that truly need fixing(ex. Forza Motorsport 4). So you can understand
 that it would be nice if this one game I would like to play would work like it is supposed to especially considering that my account is close to renewal and I'm really contemplating &nbsp;keeping my money and forgoing xbox and xbox live altogether. Being a long
 term customer of eight years I would think you as a company would want people like me as returning customers for the future but with what I've experienced lately it seems like all you care about is charging as much money as possible for the cheapest made games
 and services you can possibly throw out there. Karma has a way of coming full fold and you're greediness will come back to haunt you so my advice is get it together and fix these issues so I can enjoy what I paid for. It's sad too since xbox live used to be
 something special back in the beginning and now with every update and new game that comes out it is looking more like that half-a**ed service they have on the Playstation 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sincerely,</p>

<p>I never seem to have this problem as I was in a full game for most of the time yesterday. &nbsp;It is possible that the way they associate things with the full game that there may be a problem when going through your servers. &nbsp;Other times its based on the internet
 connection of everyone else in the room. &nbsp;I would keep trying and also contact your internet service provider to see if there have been any issues related to your internet connection during this time. &nbsp;If this is a problem microsoft should be releasing an
 update in the near future.</p>

<p>It would be a great game if it worked. &nbsp;But multiplayer is broken, and single player won't let you play missions until you grind in multi. &nbsp;So it's kind of a total failure.</p>

<p>Mine does the same thing, I noticed some issues as well, such as long time connecting to Xbox Live from within game. I have noticed a few fixes that may semi-work for games.
</p>
<p>1. Clear your cache out.</p>
<p>2. Disconnect your Xbox 360 from Wireless Network</p>
<p>3. Reconnect.</p>
<p>4. Try connecting alone</p>
<p>5. If all that fails then it's something broken on the MS Server end, which the game worked fine for me all week.</p>

<h2>            Right Click in My Document causes computer to freeze</h2>
                    While I am in My Documents, if I right click say to create a new folder, the computer freezes. It will stay frozen up to five minutes. It delays work significantly.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>More concerning is that the computer is less than a month old. It's an HP Envy h8-1414. We're running Windows 8, which has its own sets of issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone has experienced this or recommend a way to problem solve this, please let me know. We have warranty for over a year.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p><b><span>Hi
</span>Dave</b><b><span>,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error code / message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I’m glad to provide you with these steps which will help you to resolve issue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b>
<b>“Windows hangs or freezes”</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the link and follow the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286#method2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286#method2</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:
</b>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known
 as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>I</span></b><b><span>mportant</span></b><b><span>:
 Reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting,
 follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.<br />
c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b><span>I suggest you to update the latest version of
<b>chipset drivers</b> and also update the <b>
BIOS</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span>
</span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the
 configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

<div>I would also add some steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Delete temporary files:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click <b>Start</b> | type<b> %temp%</b> | Delete all files, if some files resist then leave it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Click <b>Start</b> | type <b>c:/windows/temp</b> | Delete all contents when

<h2>            Windows 8 updates won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>My pc is functioning as it should, except that updates KB 2770917, KB2737084, KB2761226, KB2769034, KB2769165 and KB2727528 will not install, despite numerous attempts and running the troubleshooter.

<p>Previous updates have installed without problem. </p>
<p>I have tried disabling the NLS service but this has not helped.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have tried fully uninstalling the only recently added software but the updates would still not install.
</p>
<p>I have disabled the firewall in my antivirus software.</p>
<p>My Windows 8 was installed from disc as an upgrade to Windows 7</p>

            <p><span>Hi GerryAC,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
As per the description provided, it looks like you are having issues with Microsoft updates after installing Win 8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>It would be grateful if you can reply to this question in order to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message or error code?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the Service status of Windows Update.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press
<span>Windows key + R</span> and type services.msc in the search field and press
<span>ENTER</span>.<br />
b) Scroll down to find " Windows Update ".<br />
c) Right-click " Windows Update “, and then click Start.<br />
d) Check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and then try to download and install the update manually and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Step 1: </span></b><span>Clean Boot will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1: </span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem.
 Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span><br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Step 7: </span></p>
<p><span><br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span><b><span><br />
Step 2:</span></b><span> Download and install the update manually and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow the steps to install the update manually:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft download center page</a>
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/default.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the KB number in the search box and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Download and install the update and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for responding</p>
<p>To answer your questions</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>No changes made that I am aware of. As I said in my original post, have uninstalled the only new software and the problem persists</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>There is no error code. There are 7 important updates. Installation fails at 15%, retries, and then reverts without completing the installation. The download and installation proceed
 and the failure is after restart.</p>
<p>I have spent 5 hours connected to Microsoft Technical Support with the result that my system was caused to freeze by their actions. I have managed to restore my
 pc and tried to reconnect the following day to the technical support website without success.</p>
<p>I have tried to install the updates innumerable times</p>
<p>I have run the troubleshooter innumerable times</p>
<p>Windows Update service is , and has been running automatically</p>
<p>I have tried a clean boot</p>
<p>I have tried installing the updates one by one</p>
<p>I have gained the impression that Windows 8 is fundamentally flawed and Microsoft seems to be ignoring this and their customers. Trial and error solutions are being
 proposed and tried by Microsoft personnel. The public are expected to carry out lengthy exploratory investigation; this should not be expected of people who mostly will not have the necessary skills. Windows 8 should be fit for purpose.</p>

            <p>As I said above, I tried the clean boot option and also the nls option, without success.
</p>
<p>Microsoft technical support tried every other option that they knew. </p>
<p>The only solution that worked was a reinstall of Windows 8 and that is what everyone with this download problem should do. It will save a lot of time and frustration and other programmes and files need not be affected. Of course, this is only if you have
 an installation disc or have made one from the upgrade download,</p>

            <p>I have been experiencing the same problem. Since this Monday the 26
 (4 days ago) I have worked with 4 different MS tech’s. They have all done all they could and each time thought they had the problem corrected. It all started with the purchase of an off the shelf machine with WIN 8 on it. I purchased the Pro pack upgrade key
 that day and it simply would not allow me to input the key. After using the msconfig option as Vijin V suggested and disabling all non MS services we got a successful upgrade.
</p>
<p>The next day prior to attempting to install my corp license of my antivirus and other misc software I attempted to do a regular update. After 2 different
 calls/tec’s today and 3-4 hours of work on both sides the update will not install. We have used everything available to the first level support staff including, msconfig options, DISM.exe options to correct image issues, uninstalling video, sound, and other
 drivers for updates to them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The technician has had to escalate this call to the next level of support now. While I need to put this box into service I will allow the time for education and understanding
 for any future problems with machines. </p>

<div>The amended recipee:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>1. Hit windows key + R to open Run command.</div>
<div>2. Type in msconfig.exe and hit enter</div>
<div>3. go to the Services tab on the top</div>
<div>4. Uncheck the "Nalpeiron Licensing Service (Nalpeiron Ltd.)</div>
<div>5. Click Apply</div>
<div>6. Restart the computer</div>
<div>7. Install the KB2770917 update</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can optionally restart the Nalpeiron Licensing Service (what is this stuff anyway?) afterwards.</div>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. However in my previous attempts, by stopping all non MS services would that not have also stopped the Nalpeiron Licensing Service?
</p>
<p>The update that&nbsp;will not install for me is KB2756872. I don't know if it makes any difference though.&nbsp;I will try the suggestion of only stopping the Nalpeiron Licensing Service by its self. At this point I don't have much faith in it but one never knows
 until one try's. The MS tech's couldn't make it work. I will have tried this before their second level support calls me back this morning. Either it will work or it won't and I will give them more&nbsp;"what I have tried" info. Unless I can tell them I found the
 answer online. :)</p>

            msconfig.exe cleared it right up for me...i had windows 8 64-bit updates (forgot to take notes on serial no's but were released 08 Dec 2012) and this cleared it right up. &nbsp;much simpler than i thought it would be - thanks!!

    <title>Strict&#47; Moderate NAT- Netgear WNDR3700 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strict&#47; Moderate NAT-  Netgear WNDR3700</h2>
                    
<p>I have been experiencing problems with my Xbox 360 and having moderate/strict NAT. I would really like to find a solution to this problem. I live in a newly built apartment building with internet access provided by the apartment. ( no idea what company they
 have providing the service). I have an ethernet connection built into the apartment linked to a powerline device, with the 2nd powerline connecting to the router. from there the xbox is wired into the router wired.
<br />
<br />
WNDR3700 v3 firmware V1.0.0.22_1.0.17 I have tried the following:<br />
<br />
1. Disabling the WNDR3700 NAT filter- changing the setting to open.<br />
<br />
2. Opening ports recommended on Xbox support website <br />
<br />
3. Disabling UpnP- with ports open and closed.<br />
<br />
4. Re-enabling UPnP- with ports open and closed.<br />
<br />
5. Port triggering with ports- also with UPnP enabled and disabled<br />
<br />
6. Placing the Xbox as a DMZ server.<br />
<br />
7. Powering down/ restarting the router between most of the above changes.<br />
<br />
When my xbox is connected to live, it does not show up in the UPnP portmap. Could this have something to do with it?<br />
<br />
I don't believe it has anything to do with the internet provider. I did not have these problems with my previous router while at this apartment.
<br />
<br />
I don't think it could be the double NAT issue that has been solved by bridging, because if there was a modem causing everyone in the complex to have decreased bandwidth/ strict NAT, the managament company would never hear the end of it from residents, and
 I have not had any neighbors have similar problems.<br />
<br />
Am I just down to a crappy router? or is there something I'm missing?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be great. I have taken the time to read about the issue and have learned a lot, but figure something must be missing my attention.</p>

<p>Hey there Edouardo! I understand you are having some issues with your NAT. Just to clarify, you said that your internet is provided by the building, and you simply have ethernet ports in your apartment, correct? Can you try connecting your console directly
 to one of these ports, just for testing. I want to see if you have an Open NAT this way.<br />
<br />
If you still show as a Strict NAT, my guess is that whatever network hardware the building is using is the problem here. I would suggest contacting them to see if they can check on the router(s) they're using and adjust the NAT accordingly. Let us know how
 that all goes. Thanks!</p>

<p>I just tried connecting the Xbox directly to the ethernet port. I was not able to establish an open Nat connection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I think I understand why I have strict NAT, but the question that has yet to be answered is when i connect with my old router, D-Link 524, I am able to have an open NAT and there is a considerable difference in bandwith/latency?
</p>
<p>I think I might just go back to using the old router since it seems to be working better without any adjustments. &nbsp;</p>
