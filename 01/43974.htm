    <title>Taksbar in windows 10 october update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taksbar in windows 10 october update</h2>
                    Why did Microsoft change taskbar color in this new update to lighter dark? Now it does not fit good to my background... is there a way to change this back to the way that it was?

            I use a customized taskbar (cyan color one) since a couple of month, so I didn't really notice and I don't have news about this change from anyone else, but it could be that's a change that doesn't effect most of people or just they don't care.
<br />Could it be that you need to remove transparency of the task bar?

<h2>            Windows Doesn&#39;t Give Me Shut Down Option, Only Log Off</h2>
                    
<p>HI all,</p>
<p>Sorry if this isn't in the correct forum, but I didn't see one that specifically addressed my question. I've had Windows 7 running on my current computer for a good 8 months now, and it has worked great. I would always be able to shut the computer down no
 problem.</p>
<p>However, and I'm not exactly sure when this started, Windows 7 no longer gives me the option to shut down. The only option I get is Log Off.</p>
<p>Any way to fix this? All help is appreciated!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not recognizing my Android phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidgrath  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing my Android phone</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop, and I can't remember exactly how my PC reacted to my phone when I first plugged it in, but I do know now that it's problematic.</p>
<p>I get no response most of the time when I plug my phone in and when I do get a response, my PC makes the little "device connected sound" at random. The cable was new but I checked anyway. I plugged it into a Surface and an Omen, and my phone connected successfully,
 though I just thought it was a fluke, and when I got home I plugged my phone into my old PC that has frustrated me time and again with various issues, but it connected just fine.</p>
<p>The next day, I checked the internet for a solution I hadn't tried before, and the only different solution I saw was to boot into Linux, and the person who wrote that answer said if the port worked for Linux, it was a Windows problem, and so I booted into
 Ubuntu from a Flash Drive. Immediately I plugged in the phone, Ubuntu recognized it. I didn't have to use the infamous "sudo" I've been hearing of or anything like that, and it worked. When I rebooted into Windows, I left the phone plugged in and it showed
 up in Explorer without any instability.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do and, please, I need help with this problem, I've tried a bunch of things and I'm not seeing anything different on the internet. I've tried:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Installing the driver from my phone's OEM</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Restarting my phone and PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Odin mode(I canceled halfway, though)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Restarting adb server in Android Studio</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Downloading the Windows Media Pack(the update doesn't apply to my system)</p>

            Hi DavidGrath 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. These options are independent and can be executed in any sequence. 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Right click on Desktop (at the top) &gt; Scan for Hardware Changes &gt; It should detect your device
<br />
<br />2. The issue might also happen because of driver conflict. 
<br />Type cmd in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Command Prompt &gt; Run As Administrator
<br />set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1
<br />(Note - Nothing will seem to happen. It is perfectly normal behavior)
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View &gt; Show Hidden Devices
<br />Expand all entries &gt; You will see even those entries which were loaded in the past and were not uninstalled and not currently started (they might be greyed out also) &gt; See if there is a problematic device which can potentially conflict &gt; If you find any, right click and Uninstall &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />3. You can also Uninstall &amp; Rollback MTP USB device driver
<br />3.1 - Rollback the Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Choose your phone device (may be under portable device) &gt; Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />3.2 - Uninstall the Driver

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

</blockquote>
=======================================<br />
You cannot edit the files on the CD. You would have to <br />
copy the photos back to your hard drive and then burn <br />
them on a CD after the editing was completed.<br />
<br />
And they will always be arranged first Alphabetically then<br />
Numerically. If you require a certain order on the CD...<br />
you will have to Arrange and Number them as follows<br />
before&nbsp;adding to the CD.<br />
<br />
Arrange the files the way you want them and go to...Edit / Select All.<br />
<br />
Right click the 'first' photo in the selected (highlighted) <br />
group and from the menu choose...Rename.<br />
<br />
For the first name...enter a descriptive word for the group,&nbsp; <br />
a space, and the first number&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Summer Vacation (10001).jpg<br />
<br />
(Yes...use the parentheses and begin the number with a 1)<br />
(If you wish to add a descriptive title to the batch...leave a<br />
space after the last letter and before the first parenthesis)<br />
<br />
Press...Enter and Windows will rename the remaining photos....<br />

                    <p>I received an email in my Hotmail account today from a friend which contained a handful of GIFs. I opened the email via Microsoft Mail, on my Surface Pro 3, and the GIFs do not animate at all. I also realized that I can't seem to save the aforementioned

            <p>This is a recommendation: open the web browser and go to http://www.outlook.com (and add it to your favorites) and it should automatically log onto your Hotmail account and open your email there and see if you get different results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get better performance, use that web page for you email and dump that stupid Mail app in Windows!&nbsp; That thing has never worked or worked correctly and probably never will.</p>

    <title>General Extraction Error Location ES1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p.a.r.v.a.n.i  say:</h3>
<h2>            General Extraction Error Location ES1</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this has been posted multiple times now, but I can't seem to solve the issue based on any information listed in the other threads I've viewed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue lies with trying to launch the original Diner Dash game. I purchased the game on a duo game disc that included both Diner Dash and Diner Dash 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that I was getting this error, then suddenly on one random try, the game actually launched. I played about 10 levels before quitting, and then haven't been able to launch the game again since. Of course, I lost that little progress from
 uninstalling it, but that's not really a big deal to me. The other weird thing is that Diner Dash 2 starts right up when I click the icon; Windows just doesn't want to run the first one now for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that there are two files to launch the game from: one will open a window first regarding the Playfirst games that gives you the option to play the selected game, or visit their website; the other one simply launches the game itself with no middle
 step in between. I tried running Diner Dash both ways; no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I've already tried:</p>
<p>1) Uninstalling the games, restarting the computer, and reinstalling the games.<br />
2) Trying to run as an administrator.<br />
3) Trying to run it in every possible compatibility mode listed; and as an administrator.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any updated insight on this issue, it'd be greatly appreciated. A lot of the posts I've read were from back in 2010, so Windows has had multiple OS releases since then, not to mention that we are on Windows 10 at this point with many updates
 completed. I would say that maybe it's because the game is too old, but if it was re-released with Diner Dash 2 on the same disc, I feel like it should run just as well as that one; but I'm sure there's plenty of factors involved in this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Hi, Marilou:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minimum requirement for installing and running the game is Windows XP to Windows 7, as the re-release was from 2005/2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pretty much every company associated with this particular release isn't really dealing with it any more. I'm trying to find a support e-mail for Playfirst, because that seems like my only hope at this point. Encore only sells software pretty much, and Gamelab
 is out of business as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that pops up seems to be coming from Windows itself, so if Microsoft can't help me, then I'm out of luck apparently? Is there a specific place I should go to get help from Microsoft on this issue, like a phone number or e-mail for support that
 might deal directly with stuff like this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            USB dongle for MS Keyboard&#47;Mouse stopped working</h2>
                    I have a wireless Keyboard/mouse combination.&nbsp; It has been working fine for the two years that I have had it.&nbsp; Suddenly, it was not recognised.&nbsp; I went through all the steps suggested, but it still did not work.&nbsp; I tried it in another computer and got
 the same message,&nbsp; I have now concluded that the dongle has somehow stopped working and needs replacing.&nbsp; BUT, I see that even if I got the same model of dongle, it still won't work because each dongle is specifically wired into the particular keyboard and
 mouse.&nbsp; My&nbsp; only option now is to buy a replacement, and throw a perfectly functioning keyboard and mouse into the rubbish because it is now totally useless without a replacement dongle that works.&nbsp; What a waste.&nbsp; I see that Logitech has a facility where a
 replacement dongle could be rewired to work with their keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; Pity that Microsoft don't have anything like that.&nbsp; So, for everyone's information, I am going to t

<p>Logitech has its "<a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/promotions/6072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Unifying</a>" system that allows for more than one Logitech device to be connected via a single transceiver, similar to how Bluetooth works. &nbsp; More
 devices can be added if they're compatible with the Unifying system.&nbsp; If you have a Logitech device that predates the Unifying system and lose its transceiver, you're in the same boat as you would be with a Microsoft device.<br />

<h2>            Adding Device Drivers to Unattended Installation of Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have read many articles on this issue, but none seem to answer my specific question:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the background.... I want to be able to automate (unattended) the installation of Windows 8 to a machine that is running Windows XP.&nbsp; I don't want to format/clean the hard drive.&nbsp; I want the Windows.old folder created.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once installed, I can use
 USMT to move user data into the correct places and be done with migration.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>My understanding is that I can't do that with Sysprep, but if I'm wrong, please tell me how.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I can fix the issues below, Sysprep offers no real advantages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have unattended installation of Windows 8 workinging in Hyper V environment...Launch PC (VM) via Windows PE, connect to network share and run setup.exe /unattend:unattend.xml.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only change I have made to the native Install.wim file is to add SetupComplete.cmd to C:\Windows\Setup\Scripts folder, so once the OS is installed, it launches a second script to install apps (Office, Reader, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I move to a regular PC (Lenovo, not a Hyper-V VM) I want the correct drivers installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, using DoubleDriver, I have all the drivers in a folder structure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using SIM, it looks like I should be able to reference them via the amd64_Microsoft_Windows-PnpCustomizationsNonWinPE in the Offline Servicing section.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the documentation suggests that drivers in the driver path would be copied locally and available
 for plug-n-play installation on subsequent restarts.... but it's not working or I have mis-read the documentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is this.... I want to be able to integrate typical, signed, drivers into an unattended installation of Windows 8, but can't seem to get it working.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody know how to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide as much detail as possible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, C</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade lock screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to windows 10 from 8.1. After upgrading I realised that when I try to touch number 1 as part of my pin code in the lock screen mode I need to touch the bottom left corners of number one. Anywhere else for example, middle or a different corner
 does not let me enter digit 1. All other numbers on the display key pad works fine (they work when I touch anywhere as in center, corners etc). So not sure what is causing the issue. I have a 10 point multi touch screen Dell XPS 2710 desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue only arose after upgrading to windows 10 from 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried uninstalling and reinstalling my Nvidia driver and changed the resolution to see but had not effect on getting it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Hello, I have been researching the web to see if the XPS 2710 AIO is approved for windows 10 upgrade. I have not seen much. I have run into your question concerning your touch screen issue. I would like to know how the upgrade to windows 10 was with your
 pc. Did you have any driver problems? I see Dell has not tested our pc for the windows 10 upgrade for drivers and support. It appears right now you only have this issue, am I right? Also did your pc have a msata drive to deal with during the upgrading of windows
 10? Any help would be appreciated. I also hope they respond to your request to show the support.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your response. I had no issues while doing the upgrade in terms of drivers etc. althoigh Dell has not tested it for windows 10. I Didnt get error messages either. everything went fine. I didnt get msata drive prompts from windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;it is strange that only the place where number 1 on touch key pad is having issues. all other areas on my display works fine with touch.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>MikeyesWorld and DFernando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When each of you were updating to Windows 10, were you asked to input a product code or key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I ask is that when I purchased my XPS 2710 on line from Dell Canada in December, 2012, it was delivered to me with Windows 8 Pro preloaded by Dell.&nbsp; I've since updated to Windows 8.1 Pro and have kept this fully updated as new "important" and
 "optional" updates became available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't received the upgrade scheduling desktop icon. from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Dell hasn't yet completed its evaluation of the compatibility of Windows 10 Pro with XPS 2710, but just want to know whether I'll have to buy Windows 10 Pro or will get a free upgrade once Dell gives the all clear to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bob</p>

            <p>Hello, I myself have not installed windows 10. I have been searching the web for answers. DFernando has shed the most light and positive out come. I believe Dell will not support 2710 for windows 10. &nbsp;I believe the installation will be ok, I am wondering
 myself if you have to turn off the Intel Rapid Storage Technology in windows for a successful install. I read not to turn off the RST in the bios.It appears you might get a blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe DFenando can chime in on the actual installation instructions. As far as the windows 10 procurement. You can create an ISO or install it on a usb stick and install it that way. It's just a matter of compatible drivers for your hardware. This is the
 link for the manual down. &nbsp; &nbsp;( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) &nbsp; &nbsp;You would have to upgrade first to windows 10, then at that point you will have a approved activated product key (windows 10). You will need this key to reinstall
 windows 10 (clean install). You don't have to purchase Windows 10, Just download it in the website. Upgrading the system will provide the new Windows 10 key. Also you will have the option to downgrade to your previous 8.1 pro if you have a problem with Windows
 10, provided the upgrade installation of windows 10 was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks Mikey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in no rush to upgrade to Windows 10 and will wait several months to see (a) if Dell will approve Widows 10 for the 2710 once Dell and Microsoft have further updated the relevant drivers, and (b) whether the normal general issues entailed in a major operating
 system are being adequately resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now know how to find the relevant Windows 8/8.1 key should this be required during the course of installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows 8.1 key is not required for the upgrade. When you upgrade to windows 10 you will at that time get a windows 10 key. When you try to do a clean install they require you have a windows 10 key. You won't have that key until you upgrade. You would
 want to save your windows 8.1 key incase you want to revert back to 8.1. Windows 10 will create a new windows 10 key for you.</p>

<h2>            Having exfat and windows ToGo partition in one harddisk&#40;Android exfat needed&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am trying to have a working exfat&nbsp; partition on my 1TB external Hard which I have installed windows 8.1 ToGo on it</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is Android phone can only recognize the first Fat32 or exFat created on external Hard.</p>
<p>and when installing windows 8.1 ToGo it create a 350 MB Fat32 partition and all the rest will be formatted to NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so even if I Shrink 300 GB of Hard for an exFat patition,the first 350 MB Fat32 partition would be the only partition that Android phone recognize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only solution would be that whether like windows Xp,the Fat file needed for installation of windows 8.1 gets writen in the NTFS Partition of windows 8.1 Togo,meaning that they change Windows ToGo so that only one partition is created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the better solution would be that if I have a created for Example a 200 GB NTFS patition and 700GB exFat partition,</p>
<p>if windows ToGo lets me select the 200GB partition instead of formatting all the Harddisk,then I will have my exFAT partition as I desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This way no one should erase a Hard disk while installing windows ToGo on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for the moment can anybody gives some advice if I can replace the 350 MB FAT32 partition with the 500GB exFAT partition
</p>
<p>(on the same external Hard as windows 8.1 ToGo),so that </p>
<p>my android phone(Galaxy Note Edge) can recognize the 500GB exFFAT partition instead of 350MB Fat32 partition as the first Fat32/exFAT partition of external hard</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts</p>

<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check if there is any exclamation mark on any of the devices.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>

That is determined by the system manufacturer.</p>
<p>You may have to order new recovery/restoration media and/or download an ISO of the Windows 7 edition and architecture you need, burn a DVD and perform a clean install using it and the product key on the sticker on the system itself.</p>

    <title>MIDI Interface Not Recognized - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MIDI Interface Not Recognized</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make music with M-Audio's Trigger Finger MIDI control surface and my Asus desktop with Windows 10 doesn't recognize the device when it becomes plugged in but when&nbsp;it's plugged into my Asus Netbook with Windows 10 it's recognized and drivers automatically
 install fine. Now I contacted M-Audio and I manually downloaded their drivers and the device was still not recognized. M-Audio then recommended me to contact you guys to see what further troubleshooting I can do to get it working. Any suggestions would be
 great, thanks!</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 7 &#43; Atheros network card &#43; Netgear &#61; frequent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rohithsharma84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 &#43; Atheros network card &#43; Netgear &#61; frequent connection drops</h2>
                    Windows 7 + Atheros AR5B93 Wireless Network Adapter + Netgear wifi router = frequent connection drops<br />
<br />
I just bought a Acer Aspire 5532 with Windows 7 pre-loaded. Wifi connection keeps dropping every few minutes making browsing impossible, forget about streaming from Netflix.<br />
<br />
I searched the fourums and found this to be on the same lines with what other users are facing on Vista, although I have 3 other Vista machines connected to the same router without the same problem. I'm also sitting within 10 feet of the router and the signal
 strength is 'excellent'.<br />
<br />
Please help me fix this problem as I need to decide if I bought this as a gift for my dad and I wanna make sure everything works fine before giving it to him.<br />
<br />
Thx!

            &nbsp;I don't know if this will help. I am checking to see problems i might have when i install 7. I came across this just now for my netgear router.
