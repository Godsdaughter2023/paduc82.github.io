<h2>            &#34;This app will not work on your device&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft community,</p>
<p>So, yesterday I upgraded to Windows 10 pro 64bit. I wanted to download Forza motorsport 6: Apex from the Windows Store, but the download button is greyed out and it says "This app will not work on your device".</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 pro 64bit 1511 build 10586, DirectX 12, newest drivers.</p>
<p><strong>My specs are i5 6600, GTX 970 4GB and 8GB ddr4 ram, plenty of space on the disc.</strong></p>
<p>So I should be definitely able to play the game.</p>
<p>I can't even buy Quantum break or Rise of the Tomb Raider because "This app will not work on your device".</p>
<p>I've tried everything, WSReset.exe, checked for new updates, even re-installed the Windows. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>Any help will be much appreciated, thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>I actually solved this problem the next day after I posted this :D The solution is really simple.</p>
<p>All I had to do was download the Forza Hub app from Windows Store, and suddenly I could download the game. Its really strange, but that was it :D Let me know if that worked for you. Cheers.</p>

            Hi, <br />
I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Adviser. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />
The error code 0xA00F4271 (0x80070001) is one of the Camera App error examples. It is specific to Windows 10 - it is for outdated camera drivers.
<br />
<br />
- Update webcam driver or roll it back <br />
- Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager. <br />
- Double-click on Imaging devices and right-click on the webcam's entry. <br />
- Select Update driver. <br />
- Close Device Manager and reboot your PC. <br />
<br />
If the 0xA00F4271 (0x80070001) error occurred after the installation of the latest webcam driver, remove the update:
<br />
<br />
- Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager. <br />
- Double-click on Imaging devices and then right-click on the name of your webcam.
<br />
- Select Properties and click on Driver tab. <br />
- Click Roll Back Driver and then Yes to confirm the changes. <br />
- Close Device Manager and reboot your PC &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi xoviat,
<br />
<br />Hopefully I can help you get this cleared up. It depends. Within this link is your answer: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms994395.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms9943...</a>
<br />
<br />Quote from the Microsoft article: If you choose to use Dotnetfx.exe for distribution with an application created by you, you must have a validly licensed copy of the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK and you agree that any use or distribution of Dotnetfx.exe associated with your Licensed Product as "Licensed Product" is defined in the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK end user license agreement (the "EULA"), is subject to the terms of the EULA. If you do not have a validly licensed copy of the Microsoft .NET Framework SDK or you do not agree to these terms and conditions, you are not authorized to distribute Dotnetfx.exe.
<br />
<br />In layman's terms, given that everything is obtained legally (which is easy in itself) in the sense of the .NET Framework SDK and the program you've made (if any), you may redistribute it. This is from 2002, so I'm not sure how this would hold up today, but this is the only documentation, especially with ~1.0-1.1.
<br />
<br />But the gist of is that if you accept to their terms, you may redistribute those packages with your program, if you've made one with the SDK.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Let me know if I could be of any more help.

            Hi xoviat
<br />
<br />All versions of the DotNet Framework may be freely redistributed.
<br />
<br />I am a developer and sometimes when I am creating installers for my software, I need to include the version of the DotNet Framework I am targeting with my software, so my installer will install that version if it is not already installed on the target PC
<br />
<br />Please read the following:

            Thanks for the help. To clarify, a publicly available application requires .NET 1.1 (specifically TI notefolio). I am not the developer of this application (as no one develops for .NET 1.1 anymore), but I want to redistribute the framework as a dependency
 in a automated dependency manager. It is my understanding that redistributing .NET 1.1 would be acceptable even though I am not a developer of the original application, though that is not specifically clear from the license.

            xoviat,
<br />
<br />Yeah, that's where the confusion starts. I think the safest route is to share a link instead of redistributing it to be safe. I'd intuit that redistributing these packages would be totally within the license but I'm not so sure. I even see some applications prompting you to directly download it from the source rather than providing it already, so perhaps that route is feasible?

<h2>            HP Color LaserJet CM1015 All-in-One Printer</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a new HP laptop g6 series with Windows 7. My HP Laserjet CM1015 MFP does not have a 64 bit driver for Windows 7. After browsing this problem in various support forums I downloaded a Generic driver form HP which allows me to print,
 even though it behaves erratically. However, the Laptop does not recognize the printer and I am unable to use the Scan feature or check print cartrridge status etc..</p>
<p>Spent several hours with HP to no avail...just got passed on from person to person and was finally told that my printer was "too old" (5 years).</p>
<p>Any suggestions to achieve the printer functionality?</p>
<p>As it is my Palm Z22 handheld cannot be used with my new laptop as there is no 64 bit driver for that either.</p>
<p>Just can't keep buying new accessories....</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hej RajithR,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for trying to help me. </p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot use&nbsp;the methods you give me to solve my problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I tried to download the fix (fix 50202) in the standard way. </p>
<p>I get this message: "The Microsoft fix does not apply to your operation system or application version".</p>
<p>I did not dare try the aggressive method as it says that I might lose somet things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the manual download, but it begins by explaining that you have to press the "Start" button and then "Run". I remember that from Windows 7. But I have Windows 8 now, and there are no Start button (which I generally miss a lot).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think that this fix&nbsp;only works&nbsp;for Windows 7, and not for Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I tried the direct download from Microsoft Download Center for<font color="#000000"> "KB2811660".</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">I chose the danish language, which I am a bit unsure about. Should I have left it be English?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Then the next step is a choice between 4 files. I have really no idea. Which file should I choose to download?</font></p>

<div>Do you have Danish language on Windows 8?</div>

<div>If you are using English, click on the download which shows '<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows8-RT-KB2811660-x86.msu' and install it.</span></div>

<h2>            Computer automatically wakes from sleep mode.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 8.1 Sleep&nbsp; - AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGGGGHH!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just bought a new PC, updated to 8.1 and I have the Windows 8 sleep problem that seems to affect so many people. The PC will just not stay asleep.<br />
<br />
So far I have tried:<br />
<br />
Disabling IPV6.<br />
Overriding srvnet (powercfg -energy highlighted the "Not sleeping due to : \FileSystem\srvnet " error, but this has now gone, and the PC still won't stay asleep.<br />
Updating the network card driver and disabling the network card wake option,<br />
The PC is not in home group, and has no media streaming enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I put it to sleep, but when I come back a bit later, it is always awake again.</p>
<p>This just drives me nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an unresolved problem with my old PC which keeps sleeping after 5 minutes (Win 8.1 again) but that's another story.
</p>
<p>Is Windows 8.1 power saving just fundamentally broken?</p>
<p />

    <title>How to undo password removal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> errocritus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to undo password removal</h2>
                    I have recently removed a password from an account on a PC with Windows 7 Home Premium, but now I wish I hadn't.<br />
<br />
I would like to reinstate or restore the previous password for said account, because I see now that creating a new password would be destructive of some of the data associated with that account.&nbsp; (i.e. saved passwords, .efs encrypted files and information,
 etc. etc.) <br />
<br />
Is there a quick and/or easy way to do this?&nbsp; I'd imagine there's a registry setting that effectively determines whether or not a user needs to enter a password in order to log on to the machine.&nbsp; I didn't see this in the control panel, however I would assume
 the actual password file and hash are intact.<br />
<br />
Additional info:<br />
I have disabled System Restore before clicking the "Remove Password" button for said account<br />
The account in question has not been logged-on recently<br />
I believe I have not changed the hash-length used for the password file(s) or anything to that effect<br />
In the regular control panel interface for User Accounts there is an option for "create a password," currently<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
<br />

Impossible! Windows does not store old passwords and Windows has no method to extract passwords from its password file (for obvious reasons!).
<div><br />
<div>I'll qualify the above: If the file c:\Windows\System32\config\regback\SAM predates the password removal then it ***might*** be possible to reverse the ill-considered action.</div>

    <title>Terrible Activation Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elongatedmusk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terrible Activation Problem</h2>
                    <p>First of, im not that good in English, so ill try my best to explain this as clear as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a half a month ago, i was struggling with Windows Updates. I didnt know i had to spend 8GB of memory onto another pointless update. At the time, i didnt have enough memory, so my laptop was struggling. An all of a sudden one day, without a warning,
 my windows 10 gets deactivated (the product key got deactivated) . So i spend some time and clear up some space and update the laptop (it took a whole night). So the update is here, but Windows was still deactivated. I tried to troubleshoot but noooo, there
 is no problem with the laptop (windows account). So what do i do know. Get stolen by Microsoft and now have to buy again something that was stolen from me? Now i have to watch the stupid watermark and the simplest of accessories got disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should note that Windows 10 came with this laptop i bought, so i dont have the activation key. Windows 10 was always activated before, and as much as i know, Windows 8 was previously on this laptop.</p>
<p>I did NOT change any hardware.<br />
</p>
<p>So here i am with a final question - can i reactivate my code without having to buy the product key again or contact the man who sold this to me for the product key. I just want to assure myself if this is some type of a money scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything microsoft support told me to do. This is my last attempt.</p>
<p>This is the error code i get: 0xC004F074</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S i am incredibly angry</p>

<p>First of all you say&nbsp;<span><em>You should note that Windows 10 came with this laptop
</em>and then&nbsp;</span><span><em>and as much as i know, Windows 8 was previously on this laptop</em>. So either the laptop had Windows 8 pre-installed from the manufacturer or it was Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you mean it had Windows 8 originally and was upgraded to Windows 10.?</span></p>
<p><span>If you go to Settings &gt; Update and security and select Activation can you provide a screenshot to post here so we can see the status that is shown currently. Or give the full text in the activation status.</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows 8 or 10 was pre-installed then the licence key is embedded in the bios. You can show the key using command
</span><strong>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey</strong> in a Command Prompt (Admin) or PowerShell (Admin) and press return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a chance the "man" that sold you the laptop used an illegal key and that is why you have lost activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Post back with more info, including.</p>
<p>Make and Model of the laptop and current Windows 10 edition (Home/Pro) and the version and build.</p>

<p>First, Windows 8 came with the laptop, the the previous owner upgraded it to Windows 10. The key worked for a solid year until the recent updates.</p>

<p>The response you get from using the command I posted means the key is not embedded in the bios. This means that Windows 8 did not come pre-installed by the manufacturer of the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have Windows 10 Enterprise installed which was not part of the free upgrade route from Windows 7 or 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could use a key finder like ShowKeyPlus to find the full key that ends with 2YT43</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus/releases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://github.com/Superfly-Inc/ShowKeyPlus/releases</a></p>
<p>I have to admit though the fact that Enterprise is installed, which would normally be used by a large organisation suggest to me that the key is not legit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get the full key you can try Chat Support to see what they say about the licence.</p>

<p>It's not weird. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This license cannot be activated in the usual way. To activate the license you must be able to connect to the server of the company that still owns this license.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When activated, this license needs to be verified periodically by the server and when it can't, the computer will no longer be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this is common problem. Usually the seller is long gone before the license is deactivated.</p>

            <p>I had trouble with this issue that began shortly after I got my new laptop with Windows 10 pre-installed. There was no problem with the initial logging on to our Wi-Fi and getting everything registered. Then the trouble started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try to make a long story short, after getting all the same advice from this forum about updating drivers, checking my Wi-Fi,&nbsp; etc. I had all that done and still the problems continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specific problem was that, after the initial boot-up, I always had to do a RESTART to get my Wi-Fi connection going. It was rarely running when I initially turned on the computer. I found out that this was due to something called
<strong>FAST STARTUP</strong>. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 has this turned ON by default</span>. It sort of takes a "snapshot" of your settings, the kernel,etc. just before you shut down. Then, when you turn on the power the next time
 it supposedly uses these settings to get the computer up and running very, very quickly. The only problem was that it did not have my Wi-Fi connection going. I learned from my own research that, if I went into the Control Panel and into Power Options, I could
 shut this FAST STARTUP <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">off</span>. Yes, it took longer to boot up my computer because it was doing a full startup including the POST, but it always came up with my Wi-Fi connected and ready to go. But I had to go through
 that anyway when FAST STARTUP was on because there would be no Wi-Fi without doing that RESTART. There was never anything wrong with my Wi-Fi. All our other devices that needed to connect to the Wi-Fi had no trouble at all so we knew it was running OK. It
 was simply because the FAST STARTUP feature was not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your internet connection is working after doing a RESTART, you might have the same problem. If it is not working no matter what you try, then this is not your answer. I hope you get it worked out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:&nbsp; You might have to turn the FAST STARTUP off again if there is a major Windows 10 update because Microsoft will reset it to their preferred default of ON.</p>
<p>

<br />
<p>Check with System maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and their forums<br />
(if any) for known issues. Some maker's have issued BIOS and other updates to help with battery<br />
problems.<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Power Options - Power Plans - Change plan Settings - check the Advanced<br />
Settings for drain and usage settings (this is how much to be used and not how much or how<br />
long to charge).<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Actually what causes a lot of wear on a battery is draining it too low repeatedly. With today's
<br />
systems over-charging is not an issue.<br />
<br />
Here are some tips to help and troubleshoot battery related issues.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Old battery? Unplug power to computer - remove battery and clean the contacts with a pencil<br />
eraser (do not use this if your battery has thin slots -&nbsp;just clean the knife edges that fit into<br />
them and be careful). Batteries do wear out if old, or it could be a problem with the computer.<br />
Check with the support of the system maker and many of them&nbsp;have on line forums.<br />
<br />
Newer type Litium-Ion batteries usually last longer if you do not discharge then below 30%
<br />
however on a laptop that will not extend their life that much. Best is to use A/C adapter
<br />
whenever possible.<br />
<br />
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery. Click the Green button on the
<br />
Yellow box on right side of page to download latest stable version.<br />
<br />

<a href="http://osirisdevelopment.com/BatteryBar/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://osirisdevelopment.com/BatteryBar/index.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Another good program <br />

<br />
You might also want to check with the System Maker and any forums&nbsp;as many use their own
<br />
proprietary software to monitor the battery and their could be known issues with your battery.<br />

Then Control Panel - Device Manager - Batteries - Double Click on each item - Drivers tab -

Update Drivers (which may not do anything) - then Right Click and UNINSTALL each -

REBOOT which will refresh the Driver stacks.<br />

<h3> vince086  say:</h3>
<h2>            The User Profile Service failed the Login. User Profile cannot be loaded. I am unable to create new user accounts.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 8 month&nbsp;Toshiba&nbsp;a500-17x with windows 7 64bit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My current profile and the guest one work perfectly. Those are the only 2 profiles on the computer.</p>

<p>I haven't done anything out of the ordinary that could explain the cause of this problem. &nbsp;This is&nbsp;really bugging me so any help would be&nbsp;appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi vince086,<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue.</p>
<p>Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based or Windows 7-based computer by using a<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />

            Here you go:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Repair PC" from the menu.<br />
5. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
6. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
7. Set Windows back to a point before you changed the password.<br />
<br />
When finished, how about planning a head a little and creating, testing and documenting a second admin account? It's so easy and takes so little time . . ..<br />

<h2>            screen time switching to Off</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've set the screen time limits for my son who'd unfortunately starve rather than leave his Xbox, but they keep resetting to off. So, every evening I set them on, and every morning, when I check them they are set to off again. Any ideas why this is occurring?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thjanks for your reply, sorry for my delay in replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly confident the screen time limits are set correctly. However, they keep being switched to 'Off'. I'm not doing that and I have 2 factor authentication set on logging on to Microsoft, so I don't think it's possible that my son has my password. I've
 changed it numerous times anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently I also checked the limits and they'd been reset to something completely different. Is there anyway I can monitor at what time I logged onto my Microsft Account? That would at least show if it had been hacked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, last night I re-set them and this morning they were off. I switched them back on I switched them back on and there was immediate howls of anguish, yet this evening they were off again. I switched them back on and, yet again, there was immediate
 howls of anguish. So either someone is hacking into the system, or the actual screen time limits program has a fault somewhere and it's failing. I've worked in I.T. for 30+ years and I know how poorly stuff is tested these days, I see it every day. So it cannot
 be discounted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shall remove him from the family and re-add as you've suggested tomorrow night to see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your assertion that they are smart and just love their games is disingenuous. As being totally addicted to a system, which is design to facilitate that addiction is not funny. If someone is constantly on these games, by definition they cannot be smart as
 they do not have a clue what is going on in the world, have anger issues and invariably will be heading towards health issues too. This is the gift of Microsoft (and Nintendo) to the planet. Making future generations stupid!!. My son fights war battles in
 COD and Battlefield, but shows utterly no interest in understanding about the actual carnage in these battles. His Great Grandfather was at the Somme and he shows no interest!!!!! I however, am something of a history nerd so I actually do read up about this
 stuff, and have friends who are even more nerdy than me. So there is no information or reasoning that we cannot provide, if asked, but never are.</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your XBOX has all the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>Try using wired connection if previously using wi-fi.</p>
<p>Try completely shutting down your console pressing the front face's power button for 10 seconds. Wait 30 sec and turn back on.</p>
<p>If the problem is still on, try removing your account from the XBOX and signing back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this solves your problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            Hi! Do you receive any error code or message when loosing&nbsp;<span>network connectivity? You might want to check your 'NAT status' in the consoles network settings in order to see if it's strict/moderate or open (the latter
 should be the case).</span>

<p>none of the solutions work. &nbsp;it also says some apps are not available now, check xbox status. all say they are up and working. it lies!! &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm about to make a newer post that hopefully everyone will see but I was having the same exact problems along with MANY other gamers. The problem is not with you, your connectivity, your network settings or anything YOU can do. It is a Microsoft problem!
 After months of going through getting disconnected every hour, I finally got someone competent enough to help me solve the problem. Microsoft is updating their servers which is kicking not all but some gamers offline and telling them they are not connected
 or dont have live on their account. What you have to do is use the virtual agent and get a real agent on to assist you or get someone on the phone, then have that person restart your live account. While they restart your live account you will have to unplug
 your xbox and when they finish plug your system back in. Sense microsoft is updating their servers this wont completely fix the problem but it will greately help. I went from getting kicked off every hour to only getting disconnected 2 times in what has so
 far been a week and a half. Good luck!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. The Ambassadors won't be any help they will definitely tell you it's your network, wifi, or you have to hard reset your xbox. NONE of those solutions will work. Here's a link of my recent post...&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            CTRL key does not work as expected</h2>
                    <div>Original title: Keyboard Help!!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is a recurring issue going on with my keyboard or most likely my pc...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>***Well first to start off with - I use a "ventrilo" type software called "mumble" which uses the key 'CTRL' as a key to speak with others while in the same channel.*** - could be a reason</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My CTRL key seems to be really screwed up right now, it randomly turns on sticky keys [where ctrl is virtually being pressed at all times] even though it isn't checked on the settings... which makes it really hard to web browse or play games because i
 am unable to type.</div>
<div>Even though I try to disable it by using both ctrl keys - it does not turn off....</div>
<div>when I try to copy and paste using my left CTRL key it just shows up as the letter c or v when i try to do so, but when I do it with my right ctrl - it's successful...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*steam issue*</div>
<div>I also use a program called "steam" which enables me to talk with others and play games - but the sticky keys seem to really get stuck on it, i'm unable to do anything...</div>
<div>Whenever I press "a" after it is already used once - it deletes 2 characters : for example : I type AGT -&gt; and I press 'a' once more -&gt; deletes G and T</div>
<div>or whenever I press backspace at all during a steam chat, it deletes everything.</div>
<div>Pressing W on it also closes a tab or any window im on...</div>
<div>pressing V would paste anything i had copied at all, and finally pressing z would substitute a letter - for example : za -&gt; type z once more &nbsp;-&gt; turns to zz</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope you understand what I'm talking about... help? Thanks..</div>

            <p>Hi Kent,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's make sure that this isn't a keyboard problem. Connect a different keyboard to check if the CTRL key works.&nbsp; If it works fine, then it's a faulty device issue. You may have to replace the driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it does not work on new keyboard, then it has to be a setting within the software that you have installed that is causing this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a work around, I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the keyboard drivers and check if that fixes this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Type <strong>device manager</strong> in the <strong>Start</strong> Search box and press enter.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Browse <strong>Keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Right click on the keyboard driver mentioned and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Once the driver is uninstalled, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Windows will automatically detect the keyboard and install the needed driver via Windows updates.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the keyboard prints incorrect characters, then try the steps mentioned in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows Update Failing - Code 0xc190020e</h2>
                    <p>I am updating an Intel NUC to the latest version of Windows 10, it is currently running Windows 10 but came out of the box a few versions behind.&nbsp; I keep getting error code 0xc190020e after numerous attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not much on the disk other than the OS.&nbsp; It has 8.2Gb free when I start the updater.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen on here where the updater gives the option to use an external drive to get past this error, but I don't see that option.&nbsp; I have attached an 8G USB drive to the machine, but still do not get the option to use the external storage.&nbsp; I also still
 get the above error&nbsp;0xc190020e with the external storage plugged in also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />After running Disk Cleanup and freeing up as much space on the PC as possible, install Media Creation too to download the ISO to external or flash stick or on another PC create the bootable media:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Open the media or click on ISO to mount, right click Setup to Run as Admin.  
<br />
<br />If any other hurdles see these steps to overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            <p><span>Hi GuyDeathscare,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I’m sorry to know that you have issues installing Windows updates.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Which Microsoft fix it have you run to fix the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message?</span></p>
<p><span>Reply with above information to help you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, I’m glad to provide you with these steps which will help you to resolve issue with installing Windows update.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>Follow the steps in the link:</p>
<p>“Troubleshoot problems with installing updates”</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot state and installing Windows update and check if the issue persists. Using clean boot, we can determine which app/program is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform clean boot:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the ‘<b>Run</b>’ window type ’<b>MSCONFIG</b>’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the ‘<b>Boot</b>’ tab and uncheck ‘<b>Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>General’</b> tab, click to select the option ‘<b>Selective startup</b>’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>Services</b>’ tab, click to select the ‘<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b>’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>StartUp</b>’ tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager</b>’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>: <b>Enable half of the services</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3</span></b><span>: <b>Determine whether the problem returns.</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected

<p><b><span>Step 4</span></b><span>: <b>Enable half of the Startup items</b></span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the

    <title>Forza Horizon 3 not detecting Xbox One wired controller on PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 not detecting Xbox One wired controller on PC</h2>
                    Hi everyone. I got Forza Horizon 3 on PC last month. Been enjoying it plenty so far. All this time I've been using my old wired xbox 360 controller to play and there hasn't been issues until the controller's analogue sticks have been going haywire as of
 late. I got myself a new Xbox One wired controller and it works fine on all my other games like Witcher 3 and GTA 5 but it's not detecting on Forza Horizon 3. My old xbox 360 gamepad is detected when I plug it in but not the xbox one controller.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I uninstalled the xbox 360 gamepad drivers as well. Anyone else having this issue?

            Hi Paul. Sorry I could not reply earlier. I managed to get the issue sorted. Completed removed both Xbox One and Xbox 360 controller drivers, restarted PC and plugged in the Xbox One controller only and let it install again. It's odd that the issue I had
 earlier was only for Forza Horizon 3. The controller ran fine on The Witcher 3. Anyways, the issue is sorted :)

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently made hardware changes on my PC (new disc drive). To do so I used third party cloning software.</p>
<p>I've noticed that since then I'm not able to download Windows Updates (Error: 0x800f0805).</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Miguel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>0X800F0805 Error Codes are caused in one way or another by misconfigured system files in your windows operating system. To rectify your issue with the error code you're getting, we suggest that you follow the guided walk-through on this<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Another possible reason as to why you're encountering this issue is due to software conflicts. We also recommend performing a clean boot. This will help eliminate software conflicts that may have occurred when you updated Windows. To perform a clean boot,

<p>We appreciate you getting back to us. Since you have used a third party software in cloning your drive, we need to check if your Windows 10 is still active. Here are the steps to check if your Windows 10 is active :<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Click Update and Security.</li><li>Click Activation.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you may also try performing the Windows Update troubleshooter on this<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2714434/description-of-the-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> link</a>.&nbsp;<span>When
 you try to install the latest updates from Windows Update, you will sometimes receive an error message. The Windows Update Troubleshooter resolves many of these errors.</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. </p>
<p>I see that my Windows 10 is active on the path shared above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've too executed WU Troubleshooter on clean boot generating a report informing four problems where detected and corrected. After closing the troubleshooter and attempting update the error message changed including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80240009</li><li>0x80080005</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I must add noticing that Quality Updates are downloading and updating normally. It is Features Update which present the problem according to my Update History.</p>

<p>Error 0x80240009 means another conflicting operation was in progress. Some operations such as installation cannot be performed twice simultaneously. You may also use the
<em>System File Checker tool </em>to repair missing or corrupted system files on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a>. <br />
<br />
While error 0X80080005 is due to conflict between inbuilt and third party antivirus software. It can be resolved by uninstalling any third-party antivirus software you have installed on your system. Once you have removed all traces of the unwanted software
 open the command prompt and type “<strong>net stop wuauserv</strong>” which will stop the windows update service. Once you delete the folder, type “<strong>net start wuauserv</strong>” and the update service will restart.&nbsp; If Corrupt files are to be the Culprit
 for 0x80080005 windows update error code, then this method should work and fix the issue.</p>
