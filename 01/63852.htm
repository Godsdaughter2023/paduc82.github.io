<h2>            Add app&#47;program to &#39;Open with&#39; apps list</h2>
                    <p>Am I missing something? I just want to add a program to the list of files in the "Open with" list; in win XP and 7 it was just a matter of associating the file type with the program but in win 10 this doesn't seem possible. To make it clear I don't want
 to change the default program just to add a program to the 'Open with' list for example .html .css .js files I am developing need to be opened with a browser as default or sometimes Dreamweaver ( which IS in the list ) but sometimes I want to open it with
 my text editor since it is quicker to see the contents of the file but in order to do so I need to... &nbsp; right click the file &gt; select open with &gt; choose another app &gt; select my editor from the list.</p>
<p>I used to right click &gt; select open with &gt; choose my editor. Since I do this many times it is a pain to have the extra step.</p>

<h2>            How do I remove the duplicated entries of the registry on the computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In my Registry/Hkey_Classes_Root all the files are duplicated, such as registry file (License.Manager), duplicated with registry file (License.Manager.1).&nbsp;The first&nbsp;duplicate file sends you to the duplicate file just below it&nbsp;named and numbered as file (xxxxx.xxxx.1),&nbsp;can
 I delete one of each duplicated file safely, in order to save operating space? If so which one? Oh! by the way a clean copy of windows vista was downloaded over the top of the old copy.</p>

            <p><strong><span>Hi
</span></strong><strong><span>HenryCastillo</span></strong><strong><span>,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You want to know if the duplicate files from the registry can be deleted.
</span><span>It can be difficult when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get
 this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you facing any issue on the computer due to the duplicate files?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you perform a “Custom” installation of Windows over the older version (installed on the same drive)?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You need to check if you have a folder called
<b>Windows.old</b> installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open the “C drive” and look for a folder called “<b>Windows</b>.<b>old</b>”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Let us know by your next post.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><i><span>Note: Assuming that you have the Windows.old folder in the C drive, I would have you perform the step-</span></i></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Highlight the
<b>Windows</b>.<b>old</b> folder and press the “shift+del” key simultaneously.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “Ok” and this should delete the folder permanently.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The process should take time and restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Editing the registry is risky. It can lead to serious consequences. I would have you backup the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</a></p>

                    I have been experiencing this for the past day while trying to install the new Windows Terminal. I am not able to access the store at all, first producing the 0x80072F7D code for a split second before switching to the error code 0x80131500, asking me to
 refresh the page. I have tried multiple potential solutions such as resetting the app, logging out, changing IP address, among other things. At this point I am lost in what could be causing this issue.

<h2>            Photo Transfer - Camera to Computer</h2>
                    Camera is Nikon P80 - Dell XPS 400 recently upgraded from XP to Windows 7 Enterprise 2013 on newly installed primary SSD.&nbsp; With XP, plugging USB connection in and turning on camera initiated pop-up with numerous transfer options.&nbsp; I've also previously
 also used Nikon;s Transfer program.&nbsp; With Windows 7, I hear 3 beeps, but nothing pops up - nor does a camera icon appear.&nbsp; Searching for answers, I found information that the Camera could not be installed because the software was out of date - or corrupted.&nbsp;
 Clicking update for software, notation was that my software was already current.&nbsp; I then downloaded the most current version of Nikon Transfer and successfully installed same.&nbsp; Retrying the connection, produces the same story - I get the three sounds that
 apparently indicates a failure to recognize device, and nothing related to the camera is displayed.&nbsp; Any advice will be appreciated.&nbsp;

If you have an internal or external media reader you might be <br />
able to remove the memory card from the camera and download <br />
from it.<br />
<br />
When the card is inserted...if you go to...Start / Computer...is<br />
the card reader listed as one or more Removable Disks?<br />
<br />
If_Yes_you can download the photos from there. Left clicking<br />
the drive letter that corresponds to the SD Card slot should<br />
display the directory of the card and you can copy/paste or<br />
drag/drop the photos to a folder on your hard drive.<br />

    <title>Spilled coffee on my MS Ergonomic Keyboard. 4000 v1 and now nothing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bbottger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spilled coffee on my MS Ergonomic Keyboard. 4000 v1 and now nothing works.</h2>
                    <p>I flushed it with water, took off all the keys and rinsed/dried them. They all feel fine. Used an air hose and blew 'stuff' out. Left it in a very low temp dry oven for several hours. Now have no evidence of liquid, but nothing works. When I plug into the
 USB port, it looks for and loads the driver, so it knows the keyboard exists. I have one witness light lit on the number pad indicate but I can't get it to go off. Another light on the F Lock indicator, but I can't get that one off either. But no a single
 key will work. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any one know if there is a central reset button anywhere on this model? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Microsoft 10 NON Enterprise and FERPA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayvenwolfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft 10 NON Enterprise and FERPA</h2>
                    <p>I am an instructor at a college. I use Windows 7 currently and our college has the upgrades to 10 available. However, I have read many articles discussing information privacy. My husband runs 10 Enterprise and has many settings he can alter because he works
 with sensitive and protected material.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a teacher, I am bound by the federal FERPA mandates when I communicate with my students. I am concerned that with all the data mining that is potentially happening, my non-enterprise version would not put me in compliance with FERPA. I have to use my
 own personal computer for work, there is not one supplied by the school that would be covered under their own license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need absolute assurance that my data, which includes sensitive student data covered under FERPA, is not ever allowed to go into some data mining. Is this possible if I upgrade to Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm more specifically asking about privacy settings than protection from attacks. It's difficult to try and figure out how many of these tech articles circulating are actually describing the truth of the matter so I thought it best to go straight to the
 source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if I do something simple like email a student about his or her absence, I cannot have my OS logging my typed words to my student and sending it off anywhere for any reason. I cannot have &nbsp;my OS data collecting while I am using our learning management
 system to enter grades and comments. I cannot have my OS looking for keywords as I type a document in Word that is meant to be printed out and handed to the individual student as homework feedback. It's something like working with HIPAA, but instead of working
 with medical information, FERPA covers educational information.</p>

            <p>This answer does not address the question asked.&nbsp; While I'm sure that Windows 10 is secure against random third-party attacks, the poster is obviously referring to securing Windows 10 from Microsoft's own in-house data gathering.&nbsp; Given the answer provided,
 should we assume that college instructors and other educational employees who are bound by FERPA, should avoid using Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You're barking up the wrong tree on a couple of different levels.&nbsp; First, this is a peer-to-peer community with little or no input from actual direct employees of Microsoft, and when one does make a rare appearance, he/she is almost certainly not in a position
 to offer any kind of advice about privacy laws.&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, in general the internet is probably the worst possible place to seek legal advice.&nbsp; I don't know why this isn't self-evident to anyone smart enough to use a computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The educational institution you work for must have a policy in place for dealing with FERPA concerns.&nbsp; Contact your institutions legal department for advice.

            <p>This was never a question about legal advice.&nbsp; The original post was about the functionality of Windows 10 and the apparent change in Windows that does not allow for users like us who handle protected data to secure that data.&nbsp; No one at any point has asked
 for legal advice here. We are seeking clarification.&nbsp; The answer seems to be that Windows 10 (other than the enterprise edition) is not suitable for teachers to use since there does not seem to be any way to stop Microsoft from reading and taking data as it
 pleases from my computer.&nbsp; As teachers in all academic levels are bound by FERPA rules, and teachers utilize personal computers for their work, the inability to secure Windows 10 from the data gathering of Microsoft seems to suggest teachers should either
 retain/acquire older versions of Windows, or change to another OS that does not read and record internal documents saved or authored in the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As far as the nature of this forum being "peer-to-peer" - then let me know if you, as a peer, disagree with that conclusion, or know of a method to secure the OS from Microsoft.

            <p>Whether you choose to characterize it as seeking legal advice, it's plain that what you're seeking is legal advice.&nbsp; Quoting your original post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em><strong>I am concerned that with all the data mining that is potentially happening, my non-enterprise version would not put me in compliance with FERPA. I
</strong>have to use my own personal computer for work, there is not one supplied by the school that would be covered under their own license.</em><br />
<em>I need absolute assurance that my data, which includes sensitive student data covered under FERPA, is not ever allowed to go into some data mining. Is this possible if I upgrade to Windows 10?"
</em>[My emphasis]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether or not you can have "absolute assurance" that you remain in compliance with the law is quite plainly a legal issue.&nbsp; No one here can tell you whether or not the limited options you have in forestalling the transmission of data by Windows 10 will
 protect you.&nbsp; The best place for advice in this case is, as I suggested earlier, the legal department of your school.</p>

    <title>Question about the Windows Firewall blocking incoming packets. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allen_666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about the Windows Firewall blocking incoming packets.</h2>
                    So i create an inbound rule to allow utorrent to accept connections.<br />
<br />
Then I start it up, and start to seed Ubuntu.<br />
<br />
Then I create a second rule, to block inbound connections from one single IP. (Someone currently downloading from me.)<br />
<br />
Their connection doesn't drop.<br />
<br />
Am I to assume that windows 7 firewall doesn't block incoming packets of previous sessions that were allowed? Do I have to 'toggle' the firewall off and on to make it take effect immediately?<br />

I purchased the game believing that it would be able to be played on my Windows 10 PC, but it does not give me the option to install it on PC via the Microsoft Store, and when browsing the PC Microsoft Store category of play anywhere games, Hand of Fate 2 is

<p>Anyone have any insight as to whats going on?<br />

<p>This is a picture of how the play anywhere game list is displayed on Xbox-<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f0b6dec-f1b3-4d0a-8ad8-d86362aa10f3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8f0b6dec-f1b3-4d0a-8ad8-d86362aa10f3?upload=true" /></a><br />

<p>Hi FaHiM Bin Mohiuddin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you, may I know if you're still getting this issue on your computer? If so, Windows 10 uses the latest DirectX version which is DirectX12. Even though your old games are asking you to install old DirectX version, you won't need to
 do it because they should work for the latest DirectX12 version. Regarding with enabling the DirectPlay feature, can you tell us if you disable first the anti-virus software on your computer? It is important that your anti-virus is disabled when enabling DirectPlay
 feature so that you will be able to save these changes on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>- I have seen other threads regarding trouble enabling Legacy Components and Direct Play and not having the options</p>
<p>stick, but have not seen a resolution to the problem that works for everyone. </p>
<p>I believe one of the recent Windows Updates has some new fixes for some Legacy DX issues though, and I no longer have</p>
<p>to <em>Sign Out</em> (not reboot), and back in again to change settings like I had to do prior to whichever update made the change.</p>
- Disabling your Anti-Virus before you install the game, as suggested by Ariel may help too.
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Yes, Win10 does have DX12, but it also has DX9,10 &amp; 11.&nbsp; 'Newer' versions of DirectX are not cumulative, and DX12 is still in it's
</p>
<p>early days. There are only relatively few games that are using DX12 effects as yet.</p>
<p>The game selects which DX files it requires, not Windows. The vast majority of games still use DX9.
</p>
<p>Even games that have graphics effects that use DX10/11 often have graphics options for DX9 as well to allow older machines,</p>
<p>or machines with low end graphics, to run the game.</p>
<p>If a game does not find the specific version of DX it requires it will not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(There are actually 20 different versions of DX9 d3d files eg- d3dx9_32.dll, as well as other related DX9 files.</p>
<p>DX10 has 10 d3d files, and DX11 has only two (in both System32 and sysWOW64). )</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- You can verify if your Win10 has all DirectX files by running the Direct X Web Installer. If any files are missing it</p>
<p>will install them. If not it will show a message to the effect that your DX is up to date.</p>

<h3> xeyelessjack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Randoms in GTA V Heists.</h2>
                    
<p>The past couple weeks in GTA V have been some of my most frustated times in the entire game, RANDOMS,</p>
<p>Go Flying around corners at 200 mph like the Brake doesn't even exist!</p>
<p>They think they ARE the Terminator at lvl 20! They charge in, run around in the open, use terrible weapons, don't heal themselves and then complain to others "its just a game" when they fail and YOU lose your s*** and cuss them out.</p>
<p>They can't even seem to see the Radar, charging into police when you're supposed to escape them and if they're not driving, then they're the ones sitting in the passanger seat Shooting they're gun like a firing range while your main objective, IS TO ESCAPE
 the police, completely giving away your position.</p>
<p>There is no hint of professionalism with these people, These are Heists like you just can't count on anyone for this. For alot of us that don't have 3 other well skilled friends. we have to put up with Randoms. these people who have no idea what they're
 doing, they are completely out of their League you'd begin to wonder if they've ever played more than 3 games in their entire lives with Such a LACK of common sense in the most BASIC of Jobs!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I don't play GTA, (so don't worry about running into my random self) but I love playing with randoms. Sometimes it gets stupid. You get a room full of ID10-t's and it all goes south. Sometimes the magick of xbox live happens and you have an epic session.
 Epic loot drops, wipe the entire opposing team, hijinks galore. &nbsp;I get some folks have limited time. But yeah. Start game, set match to public, profit.</p>

<p>GTAV is excellent online due to the main focus being about co-op.</p>
<p>Randoms are bad, but a game like this has so many user created gatherings/websites, that theres no reason to have to suffer randoms. Just join one of those communities and enjoy GTAV as it was intended. Team work.</p>

<p>And don't forget about the crews on rockstar social club. There are a ton of crews out there and GTA V allows you to invite people from your crew right into the game, so that should help you find some people to play with and get to know and work together.

<p>My son was playing NBA2K13 with some friends from school online and one of his friend's accepted requests from 2 gamers. &nbsp;These 2 people hacked into our IP address and my WebID and proceeded to call our house phone, spam text my son's cell phone, crashed
 his Xbox, our internet and WiFi. I want them and their IP address(es) to be banned FOR LIFE. What security or peace of mind can a parent have when our own home was invaded and then harassed??? &nbsp;The 2 (two) Gamer Tags were AOS FOR LIFE and Broken IS God.</p>

<p>You sent me a link and this (see below) is EXACTLY what happened to our family/home last night. So YES we were hacked. He had our IP address (or so he said) and shut off the Xbox, Shut down our Internet and shut down our WiFi router...that IS hacking! &nbsp;My
 13 year old son has no idea how to even look up our IP address to even give it to GT AOS AFTER LIFE who was bullying him to sing the ABCs over the headsets to further humiliate him. &nbsp;When my son refused, this 23 year old man from Glendale AZ, Patrick Box aka
 AOS AFTER LIFE (which I found this through Google last night) hacked into our system and wreaked havoc that took 4 hours for my husband and I to fix. I want him banned, and banned for life. I feel that it would be in the best interest of other gamers for Xbox
 to take the initiative and locate this gamers IP address and prevent him from further actions against other gamers. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>I'm being threatened to be "hacked"!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Strictly speaking, you cannot be "hacked" on Xbox LIVE; that is to say no one can forcibly take your information from our servers. Please make sure that your WLID and password are both strong and secret. Do not share
 this information with ANYONE! Also remember that no Microsoft of Xbox employee or support agent will ever ask you for this information.</span></p>
<p><span>If someone on Xbox LIVE is threatening to "hack" you, or they are asking for your WLID and/or password, you should let us know! These activities are strictly against our Terms of Use and we are serious about its enforcement.
 Please file a complaint and block communication as outlined above</span>.</p>

<p>If your WIFI/router/network has been hacked, then it is most likey because of crappy security on your end. &nbsp;There is no possible way that i know of to get an IP address, and hack a home network all through the Xbox. &nbsp;It could possibly be a DdoS attack, which
 can happen. In that case, you need to contact your local police department and file a report. Because DdoS attacks are a federal crime in the US.
</p>
<p>And you are advocating breaking the law in order to get someone banned, that is not good.</p>
<p>Report the gamertag, ignore and move on. Contact your ISP to see what they can do, this is NOT an Xbox issue. &nbsp;If your ISP says it was a DDoS atack, then contact your police department.
</p>
<p>ALSO, it is against the forum rules to post the gamertags of people on the threads. Please review the forum rules further.
</p>
<p>PS. Posting a thead in the link provided abopve will be more beneficial, as this boar is strictly for members, and the enforcement team does NOT visit these particular boards.</p>

<p>[quote user="Sir SwaG99"]I want them and their IP address(es) to be banned FOR LIFE.[/quote]IP bans are a waste of time.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of people have what is known as a dynamic IP, meaning that it changes. That change can be as easy to accomplish as turning your router off and then on again.<br />
<br />
I hope you have done what others have suggested and not only reported the tags over LIVE, but also reported the incident to your ISP and your local police.<br />
<br />
No-one in this section of the forum is a Microsoft employee and all we are able to do is suggest the above.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To me, the most troubling bit of all this would be "proceeded to call our house phone, spam text my son's cell phone". &nbsp;Once in a blue moon someone reports that someone knocked them offline, which is common enough I guess, but with additional details like
 that, that honestly are just scary, and leave me wondering how.</p>

 available to assist me asap as I am now waiting for the bank to open as I had used online bill pay and now since the 25 a payment was sent to my landlord and a confirmation to my yahoo account was sent the day it was sent and now it has been re sent daily
 to the compromised account. </p>
<p>I need to find out what I should do for my account security at the bank, the email accounts are trivial, but I don't know what the nest step is from the person or persons that violated me.</p>
<p>I am going to put a fraud alert on my account and I don't know if my keys are being logged as the virus comes back and the only software that finds it is advanced system protector</p>

            <p>Point #1</p>
<p>If you do online banking, anything financial or important..</p>
<ol>
<li>NEVER link it to a free email account. Support is always 'sketchy'</li><li>ALWAYS use an email account supplied by your Internet Service Provider.</li></ol>
<p>ISP accounts can be accessed locally through a Windows mail client, eg Windows Live mail, or throiugh your ISP home page. Your ISP will provide full and fast support for their own email accounts.</p>
<p>Point #2</p>
<p>Account passwords should never just be.. </p>
<ol>
<li>Any 'proper' name</li><li>A pets name</li><li>The name of your street</li><li>Any well known brand name</li><li>Any word which appears in a dictionary</li></ol>
<p>Use a combination of words. letters. numbers. A password does not have to be too long. It just should not be recognizable as&nbsp;anything in the list above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your computer is compromised and has sensitive info on it, the best way out is&nbsp;to save whatever you can or need to external&nbsp;media, and then do a destructive restore which will wipe out any malware.</p>

            <p>Point taken...... a little late as The apparent issue involved my installation of adobe products which I understand is a serious security issue if not updated.&nbsp; By not updating a computer on my network&nbsp;&nbsp; WLAN&nbsp;&nbsp; it apparently allowed malware of trojans, password
 thefts for several accounts, and 5 days of hassle trying to get rid of the maleware to include no sleep for the last 28hrs including a cell phone glued to my ear with ms support from India for 5 hrs.</p>
<p>Pleas see my posts and " Mike " I really appreciate your constructive comments, your knowledge, and hopefully as I have stated in my last post prior to this,,,, I am willing to let MS use my laptop if it will help with a solution and or identification of
 how this malware operates, propagates, etc.</p>
<p>If any one can tell me how to fix (recover my live.com) account as I would like to if it will be safe and secure please send me a fix or link as I tried earlier this am and I still don't know what or who to recover this email account</p>

    <title>Issue installing Camera App on Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanmc donnell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue installing Camera App on Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys &amp; Gals,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Surface Pro running Windows 8. I cannot find (on the Surface)&nbsp;or download (from the Store)&nbsp;the pre-installed camera App. When I search the Surface the App is not downloaded and when I go the Store the App is in the section "Apps installed on this
 PC". Once I click into the App in the Store it <strong>always</strong> gives me the option to install the App. I select install and it never installs. Because I cannot find it on the Surface I am unable to uninstall and reinstall. I do not get an&nbsp;error message.
 The App says installing in the top right of the Store for 2-3 seconds before disappearing.&nbsp;I have tried the following steps to try and resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- have tried to install from the search option in the Store, from the Apps installed option in the Store and from Apps not installed on this PC. All install options are available yet the App does not install,</p>
<p>- I have ran WSRESET,</p>
<p>- I have checked and confirm my region, location and clock settings,</p>
<p>- Have a MS account on the Surface and the same account is registered in the Store,</p>
<p>- can download other Apps,</p>
<p>- Surface is fully up to date with all latest updates,</p>
<p>- Have ran the App troubleshooting tool,</p>
<p>- Licenses are synced,</p>
<p>- Removed my MS account sync settings from the cloud&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=262691" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=262691
</a>,</p>
<p>- I am able to setup a second "Test" account on the Surface&nbsp;and successfully install the App on that acc.</p>
<p>- When I use my "Test" account in the Store on my main&nbsp;account I am unable to download to App and I get the install option all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not want to refresh/reset my Pro as I have programs installed that I do not want to lose or re-install (product keys). The WSRESET tool resets the cache in the Store. Is there a way to reset the local App cache that may resolve this issue? It seems
 to me like the Store and the Surface are not communicating correctly in relation to this App, like one thinks it's downloaded and the other does not think it's downloaded. I have exhausted all of my known troubleshooting steps and any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sean</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to update BIOS preboot via USB for Surface Pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently encrypted the hard drive of my Surface Pro 4 with Symantec Desktop Encryption. Upon restarting after encryption I realize that touch screen keyboard is not enabled to enter my passphrase, and even after entering the passphrase with an external
 keyboard, Windows will not load. &nbsp;Symantec instructed me to update to the latest BIOS to resolve the issue but I need to find a way to do this with a USB boot. Any suggestions on how to accomplish this?</p>

            BIOS updates for Surface are not performed from USB. UEFI updates are offered via Windows Update.

https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage</a> will get you bootable USB to reimage. Not sure if this will work with what you've done.

    <title>32 bit common dialogs not working on 64 bit os - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            32 bit common dialogs not working on 64 bit os</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Running windows 10 64. Common dialogs on 32 bit applications do not work/appear.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">First i thought there was only a problem with chrome, save dialog do not work/appear and i cannot download anything, unless you
 config chrome for autodownload. Then i realized that it was the entire system. 32 bit application common dialogs do not work. All 64 bit applications "open", "save" file dialogs work correctly. I cannot even open a project in Visual Studio 2015. I have installed
 chrome 64 and it works ok.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SFC didnt fix the problem, even after deleting common controls known files, such as comdlg32.dll, comctl32.dll from syswow64. With Process Explorer from Windows
 SysInternals, i have found that some 32 bit programs use comctl32.dll files from C:\Windows\WinSxS\x86_microsoft.windows.common-controls_... folders. I have not deleted them yet to see if sfc repairs them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried to reinstall windows 10 from usb but it does not work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have disabled all non microsoft applications and third party shell extensions from startup...nothing.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The only thing i have found to fix it is disabling visual themes in compatibility options (although windows 10 does not have this option, u can set the DISABLETHEMES
 flag in the registry, in HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers). I thought it was the solution, Visual Sutdio works after 5 days yuhuuuu!!, but besides it ruins all the aspect of the application, i have found
 some other applications that still do not work, such as openiv, a GTA Editor, when i click on "Browse" to select the path for gta, the dialog does not appear.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I made a simple visual studio solution and when calling openfiledialog showdialog, it does not wait, it continues running to the next line code. Normally it
 opens the dialog and the program execution is "suspended" until user closes/accepts the dialog. Maybe it opens and closes immediately, i dont know, i have not been able to trace what happens after ShowDialog is called.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Five days googling the same sites and no solution. Disable Firewall, windows defender, onedrive (thinking that "old" applications do not expect to find an onedrive
 access in the open file dialog side panel), i do not have any other network drive, nothing works. It's the only thing that i am doing from 5 days ago, trying to fix it, seeing the same sites once and again, and it does not seem to be a common problem, or at
 least i am not searching properly.</span></p>

                    Windows Media player always imports my pictures from My Pictures file, and I DO NOT want it to. How do I get it to stop doing this??? Every time I try to remove the file link, it just comes right back.&nbsp; I just don't want ANY pictures in my Windows Media

            <p>Hi Grant</p>
<p>I'm with you&nbsp;because I find this irksome too. I investigated the options and it seems the only certain resolution involves changing the registry, which I did not want to do... also, if you use any Windows programs like Photo Gallery it will immediately create
 the folder you have visited as a picture library location which is even more annoying!</p>
<p>I have found that the most acceptable way of dealing with this is to&nbsp;uncheck 'Pictures' from WMP navigation but keep the default 'My Pictures' location under 'Organize' -&nbsp;'Manage Libraries'. This means that WMP will still update its info from the pictures
 folder but you can pretty much ignore it (it's not taking up drive space - just monitoring). Image of the setting below... Cheers - Ric.</p>

    <title>Game Disks Cracking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i am wolf demon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Disks Cracking</h2>
                    
<p>my game disks for my XBOX 360 crack every time I put them in their cases.&nbsp; In fact my COD Black Ops disk has a small chunk missing in its top layer.&nbsp; Yes I know that the cracking can be prevented by buying a cd case, which is what I WILL do, but I felt that
 this should be brought to the attention of others as well.&nbsp; The clips that hold the games in should really be made differently or the disks themselves should be strengthened in their center.&nbsp; I have never had a problem with this for any other console and considering
 how expensive these games are they really shouldn't be cracking by placing them in their cases.</p>
<p>Anyone else having difficulties with this or have their own thoughts on the matter?</p>

<p>I have never had this issue, but I do see your point. I noticed that when the first few Xbox 360 games were released, none of this ever happened. The cases seem to have been changed lately, but as for why it happens on the center of most game discs is quite

<p>I've had the plastic clips break, where it holds the disc.. But, never the game disc itself...
</p>
<p>I know where your problem is though.. &nbsp;The clip on the case, holds the disc too much &amp; you end up flexing the disc, to get it out... &nbsp;Just press the clip through, while you lift the disc &amp; it won't break or crack etc..

<p>Wolf Demon, just push the center of the case in, then place CD with out it clicking. I do this for putting it in the case and taking it out. It's just ware and tear, after constantly taking in out constantly. If your careful and take care of your disks when
 you take/put in the case you should have no more problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I no longer keep my game discs in the cases, I've never had one issue with any discs cracking (games, DVD, Blu-ray, CD). You just have to treat them with some care. Make sure you press the center hub in properly when taking a disc out, and use three
 fingers to surround the hole when putting discs back in (so the pressure is distributed more evenly). That said, I know not all cases are created equal, and some can be pains in the... Anyway, you can always buy replacement cases. I know there used to be a
 few online distributors (like Meritline) that sold DVD cases in all different colors, including ones that matched the official Xbox green. With Blu-ray starting to take over, the colored DVD cases are getting harder to find. I would Bing 'green DVD cases"
 and see what comes up.</p>
