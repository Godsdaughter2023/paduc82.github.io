<h2>            Microsoft&#33; READ and DO something BEFORE E3 2013&#33;</h2>
                    I just came across this article from a very creditable source call CNET and I found the information disturbing. It appears while Microsoft dominated in system power in the 360 vs ps3 generation, Microsoft is behind in the generation coming with their Xbox
 One vs ps4. The difference isn't small either, CNET reports now that both Microsoft and Sony have revealed their specs, it's clear the ps4 is A LOT more powerful than Xbox one when it comes to game graphics. Graphics are the base and the primary reason games
 and gaming hardware SELL. Example, Microsoft and Sony don't see Nintendo as a competitor, why? Because the wii isn't a next gen HD console, it's for casual gamers with a bad control system. Here is the link to the article released yesterday. http://m.cnet.com/news/xbox-one-vs-playstation-4/57585484
 I have been an Xbox gamer for 10 years, it's on my profile. I praise what Microsoft has done by transforming, advancing and revolutionizing the game industry. Always LEADING the way with

<p>CNET stated fact about the console specs. Most people around the world do go to that site and consider it a creditable source. Hypothetically, if people didn't consider CNET as creditable, the specs are real. Microsoft has time before E3 to make changes
 in the hardware. The GPU is the primary spec that needs to be upgraded. Right now Sony has a lot more power. I'm surprised Microsoft didn't upgrade the GPU before their reveal knowing what Sony already announced. I don't know why Microsoft is allowing Sony
 to surpass on the most vital spec.</p>

<p>Do you think 12 year olds who have nothing better to do with their lives care about graphics? I know I sure didn't. The only people who will really care are the older people, and surprisingly, every year they're slowly fading from the gaming community.</p>

<p>Playstation has always had better graphics. &nbsp;What killed it, from what I have read and come to understand, was the lack of a hard drive, not being very developer friendly and their on-line network. &nbsp;All but the latter has now changed with the PS4. &nbsp;The two
 systems are basically the same from a techno perceptive with the exception of the RAMM. &nbsp;The RAMM the 1 is using is better for lots of smaller very fast calculations, which is to be expected from a primarily computer/software company. &nbsp;The RAMM PS is using
 is better for fewer but larger calculations moving at a slower pace. &nbsp;How that effects graphics, not exactly sure. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If PS upgrades their on-line network to something as good as XBOX, does not hamper the use of used games, is overall more consumer friendly, combined with the above improvements they very well may make a very strong come back-especially if the two systems
 are comparably priced.</p>

<p>Xbox One has 12 GCNs. PS4 has 18 GCNs. Xbox One uses a 32MB ESRAM cache and 8GB of low power DDR3.&nbsp;PS4 forgoes a cache and uses 8GB of power hungry&nbsp;GDDR5.</p>

<p><strong>For IceStorm III</strong></p>
<p>Xbox 360. 3 core processors that work together, combined processing power 9.6GHZ</p>
<p>RAM 512 ATI custom video card 3 times the graphical output of the nvidia card in the ps3</p>
<p>Ps3 1 core for games not 7 at 3.2GHZ, that makes the Xbox 360 3 times more powerful in processing.</p>
<p>ps3 RAM 256 that makes the Xbox 360 DOUBLE in ram</p>
<p>You were saying? Go research the rest for yourself, nobody's your slave. It's nobody's fault morons don't research but talk out of their *** instead.</p>
<p>What am I basing CNETS specs of the next gen consoles on? Are you that retarded, the specs on CNET are the same specs found on every site that has the specs. Both Microsoft and Sony have revealed their specs. Are you a kid?</p>
<p>Microsoft has lead the industry in sales for both hardware and software sales for the past 2 years straight and isn't far behind nintendo is hardware sales but far ahead of both nintendo and sony COMBINED in software sales.</p>
<p>uncharted etc, the crap sony games you listed are a joke. I don't doubt in the sony fanboy community of morons the games you stated are the best but to the rest of the planet who knows better hence Microsoft's massive lead if software sales, the games you
 stated are total CRAP. I've seen the games and their a joke both graphically and gameplay.</p>
<p>Again, do your research, developers have stated that in the next gen games will be made separate for each console due to the differences in power and technology, examples, the new kinect, nintendos console having far less power again etc, developers stated
 they are used to it from the current generation having to make a different version of multiplatform games for the wii. Developers want to take advantage of each consoles strengths. Multiplatform games will be the same in name and story line only. Aspects such
 as multiplayer, graphics and gameplay will be different. Obviously the new Xbox Live is dominate over any network the world has ever seen just as the current Xbox Live is. Graphics and gameplay will depend on the dev kits each year for every console.</p>
<p>You're exactly the troll I expected when I made the original post, some kid who knows jack and talks out of his ***.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh yes and Microsoft changed the RAM spec from 256 to 512 in a WEEK when the Xbox 360 was being made. You have no idea what companies are capable of. Lets not forget that most of the specs sony announced before the launch of the ps3 were lies, BUT WAIT,
 did sony CHANGE the specs and didn't lie?</p>
<p>You're a moron.</p>

<div>Microsoft does not have spare parts for Surface tablets. They are "non user</div>
<div>repairable". In fact, Microsoft does not repair Surface tablets when</div>
<div>defective/broken, they replace. Opening the Surface voids the warranty. You can</div>
<div>call support, but they will probably decline to assist since you opened the</div>
<div>device. </div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be something that is blocking the download aside from not having a family account since this app can be downloaded even on non-Microsoft devices. Allow us to verify some details so we can properly isolate the issue.</p>

    <title>Windows could not configure one or more system components. To install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sergeharvey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows could not configure one or more system components. To install Windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation</h2>
                    <p>While updating from W10-1803 to 1809 I received the following error message at 52% of the installation process : " Windows could not configure one or more system components. To install Windows, restart the computer and then restart the installation". UNFORTUNATELY,
 NOTHING TELLS ME WHICH SYSTEM COMPONENTS COULD NOT BE CONFIGURATED !<br />
<br />
After the OS completed the return to the 1803 version, I restarted the computer with a plugged-in mouse and I disabled McAfee, and then restarted the installation but it failed again at the same place.<br />
<br />
After that 2nd attempt, Windows update didn't show the 1809 update anymore so I ran the troubleshooting routine to check Windows update. It showed an error (…..still occupied on a process…). I think it's the double failure in installing 1809.<br />
<br />
A few weeks later I received update KB4023057 without any problem. I thought this had fixed Windows update (no more error message on Windows update) so I reloaded update 1809 from Microsoft. It downloaded&nbsp; ok but the installation failed again at the 52% mark.<br />
<br />
This time I did not try to reinstall it because I want to pinpoint the problem before wasting more time and internet money. I ran the troubleshooting routine on Windows update and it is still ok.<br />
<br />
These major W10 updates are very annoying because they can pup-out at any moment and slow down a machine for 4 to 6 hours. If you have limited internet like me, the 3-5Go can bust your maximum capacity if it appends&nbsp; at the end of your contract period and you
 have no time to buy more capacity. For these reasons, I prefer to "look for updates" when I'm ready or when it's possible.<br />
<br />
My computer is a Toshiba A660 laptop (Intel i5 CPU and 4Go RAM). Except the Logitech mouse, it is as it was out of the factory and it is mostly loaded with Big Fish games.<br />
<br />
I want to say here that I successfully updated to 1809 on my 2 other machines (a Asus desktop PC and an other Toshiba laptop witch is a much lower size C650D model with much complicated applications that in the A660).<br />
<br />
While looking for a solution on MS support forum I realised this problem as been encountered by many people trough the years since the beginning of major updates to W10. Like most of the people I ran the troubleshooting tests that were recommended without any
 problem being reported :<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth <br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of other solutions proposed on the net to bypass that error but it's too much abracadabra_ hocus pocus_registry&nbsp; tampering for me.
<br />
<br />
Could somebody tell me if there is a simple solution to this problem and/or if it will eventually be corrected by an update because this is getting very frustrating.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

<p>Same issue as Serge's scenario above except that I received an additional error code 0xC1900101-0X30018(which points to device driver issues). Under the Troubleshoot Settings options, I ran both the fix for Windows Updates and "Hardware and Devices" successfully.
 I also ran the SFC and DISM commands resulting in No Integrity violations and No Component Store corruption detected. All my device drivers show as current too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, then, reran the 1809 update via Windows Assistant unplugging possible suspect peripherals(Alesis mixer USB, HP J4550 Printer and a PS3 Eye video cam). The result was the same&nbsp; - failed at 52% mark again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an older COMPAQ 5107C desktop with a Q2009 monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I just wait until 1809 is certified for my PC? Will that happen when 1809 updates show up in "Check for Updates"?</p>

<p>Hi Guillermo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While waiting for help from Sumit I did an other test yesterday (using Windows Media Creation tool) after enabling CutePDF Writer which showed as "unsigned" in some reports (Panther and Rollback) but it failed again at the same 52% mark. I then checked my
 internet consumption and I realise that this new attempt did not reload the update but simply tried to install the same thing that is probably still stored in a temporary file in the machine : Very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Like I said in my original question, this problem was reported through the years and seems to resolve itself without people posting an "eureka". Maybe subsequent updates fixed the problem.<br />
Or maybe Santa Claus is gonna find a solution.<br />
<br />
Have a nice Holidays season<br />
<br />
Serge<br />

    <title>Xbox Live Gamertags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ndreca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Gamertags</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a 1400 card earlyer and still have 1000 points. I went to change my gamertag to a clan name with "Dice" in it. However it said it was taken. I tried a different way to spell it. It was taken. I kept trying different ways but they were all taken.
 So then i tryed random gamertags with Dice in it like Dice pd2dfgb1eda &nbsp;it was taken i tried it all in different ways and there was no way you could put dice in your gamertag. I deffinetly do not think its a coencidence and i think that Microsoft does not
 allow the word Dice. I even tryed putting it in my clan tag on most of the call of duty games and it says that they are bad words. I tried it with D1CE and it doesnt let me. My point here is what is so wrong with that word? I really want to change it to that
 but it doesnt let me. I even called xbox support and they said they would make a post because they see nothing wrong with the word however they didnt. Hopefully microsoft can help me with this but at the very least someone commenting trying to tell me why
 it would not be avalible. Thanks</p>
<p>Also.. there are gamertags like Help, hero, crazy that are taken my accounts older then 5 years old. I know that xbox live hasnt always had zune linked with xbox so how could these gamertags that have been around before zune be used and microsoft has not
 cleared them yet. Hopefully someone has the answers to my questions thanks.</p>
<p>Ps. Sorry for some errors in the writting rushed it.</p>

<p>I don't really understand your post after "Also... there are gamertags" but before that part, I have a question for you- does your current gamertag already have any variation of "Dice" in it? I am a Call of Duty player and sometimes I hear of glitches where
 someone's gamertag is something like "Spot On Trev" and for some reason they can't put "Spot" or "Trev" in their clan tag. If your current gamertag doesn't have any variation of "Dice" in it, then try restarting your Xbox. If that doesn't work, try deleting
 your profile, then re-recovering it. I hope you can get this problem solved.</p>

<p>Well, you ain't gonna like this: &nbsp;if you are getting that message there is nothing you, us, or anyone else can do about it. &nbsp;You just have to try something else. &nbsp;I am being blunt because for some reason this really freaks posters out and I have seen posts
 go on for weeks with something "I want that GT" and they just ignore the fact they can't have it. &nbsp;Anyway, as for the latter part, sometime ago MS issued a decree that they were going to start purging GTs from the original Xbox days...not the 360's. &nbsp;As is,
 there are Gts no one has ever used and they are still floating around. &nbsp;I know this from experience: back in 2008 my mother, in an attempt to renew her sub, accidentally spelled her GT wrong and the sever took it as an attempt to create a brand-new tag. &nbsp;All
 she did was leave off one letter. &nbsp;So now, this GT is still around...I called MS and explained what happened but all they did was lock the account so that no one could play with it. &nbsp;From time to time, I will log into it and it is still around...no GS, no
 friends, no games played, etc., yet it is still around.</p>

<p>@ Trevor never mind after the part "also.... there are gamertags" other people answered that, but anyways yea i once changed my gamertag to Dice pH so i guess that might be the reason why i cant change it. Ill try recovering my gamertag. Thanks for the help</p>
<p>@ RED SHIFT1 Wow that really sucks, but some people are saying that microsoft is trying to clear what they can on the 360's too, but thanks anyway.</p>

<h2>            Default Voice Used by Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change the default voice to a different voice OTHER than the default Microsoft voices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently use a voice I purchased from Acapela Inc. and I use it on a text to speech program that I purchased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like the quality of the Microsoft 10 voices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to change the default voice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Wallace,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the Text to speech voice in Windows 10 by purchasing a third party software, but you can use only the Microsoft voices as default voice as of now. I'd suggest you to refer to below link and provide your feedback and suggestions to help us
 improve your Windows experience. If you find a suggestion or feedback similar to yours, you can up vote it.</p>

    <title>Error Report with weird characters in Microsoft Word 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error Report with weird characters in Microsoft Word 2003 </h2>
                    I'm running Microsoft Word 2003 in Windows 7. Upon typing the first letters in Microsoft Word, I get an odd error report with weird symbols. It starts out in characters (that looks like Japanese or Chinese), and is than followed by: C:\Users\Daniel\Appdata\Roaming\Microsoft\Word.
 It doesn't say anything else about what is wrong. However, when I look for "appdata" in the "Daniel" folder, it doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
Please Help,<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may check with the driver manufacturer for the same. If it is not available for Windows 7, you may use the same driver in compatibility mode for previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click the driver installation file and select
<strong>Properties</strong> then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Place a check in the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Renders my TPLink or Wireless Inactive</h2>
                    <p>Every time my computer does the new Windows update, my internet stops working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I can search and find online for once the update is done as far as changing settings, testing and removing devices and nothing works unless I go back to the previous version or build.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a desktop, but because the computer is in another room then the modem and router, an IT persons setup a TP Link for me. I have tried unplugging and resetting all connections for the TP Link and modem and router after an update and it still doesn't
 work, post update, no internet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions? I am frustrated because the easy solution was to turn the update off, disable it, but it just turns itself back on a few hours later and tells me the update will happen in an hour, unless I am here to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having to go back to a previous build daily eats up a lot of the work day, please help!</p>

    <title>Touchpad Sensitivity issue after Windwos update, Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murtag182  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad Sensitivity issue after Windwos update, Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I never thought I'd have to do one of these, but it seems like I'm the only person on the planet who's ever had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I downloaded a Windows 10 update on my MSI gaming laptop.&nbsp; Ever since then, I've had an issue with my touchpad, where the sensitivity and momentum feel all weird:&nbsp; I can't make precise actions anymore, because my finger has to be moving much
 faster before the pointer even registers movement.&nbsp; I checked the update, and it was apparently something to do with security, which didn't make much sense, and even tried uninstalling it, to no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating/uninstalling/reinstalling my touchpad drivers, I've restarted several times, checked every setting I can find and searched over and over again for settings I may not have been aware of, but there doesn't seem to be anything online or
 in the settings related to this problem.&nbsp; The only types of sensitivity options that relate to touchpads are sensitivity for taps, not for pointer control.&nbsp; I've checked and unchecked the "Enhance Pointer Precision" box, but nothing has resolved the issue
 I'm having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, no, the issue doesn't exist when I'm using an external mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this type of issue before?&nbsp; I certainly haven't found any evidence of it.</p>

<p>I got the same update as well on the 13th or 12th...For me it looks like an HP component update is the issue. I restored my laptop twice to that date but the second time ended up turning off windows update since I had it on automatic install for updates
 and the same update was reintroduced before I turned it off. It's only happens maybe once a hour or more now so there is something still there. but it was much worst since I couldn't do anything at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps 1) do a windows restore (windows key + X and find the system restore - choose a specific date to restore) to the date say the 12 or 13th March 2) After the reboot,&nbsp; once complete, turn off windows update (under the settings - update &amp; security) from
 doing automatic updates 3) once turn off, go to the device manager and find the touchpad device, downgrade the device drivers.. Once this is all done and it reboots again, you should be fine until they address the real problem with a fix. I also lowered the
 sensitivity of the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't plan to do any more Windows update for awhile. Those last software updates were crap and it looks like no real integration testing was performed before they released them. The most current drivers being pushed will cause the issue to show up right
 away so the downgrade of the drivers is needed as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I, spend more time downloading updates that either<strong> FAIL, or CAUSE my PC, to have further problems
</strong>when it re-starts.&nbsp; I, am absolutely sick and tired to death of it!&nbsp; Either the touchpad stops working or the keyboard, If that wasn't frustrating enough the audio driver or video driver has problems!!</p>
<p>

<p>I wasn't certain where I was supposed to post my question but here goes.&nbsp; The situation I have is that I don't know how to lock the touchpad when using a mouse,&nbsp; While I am typing. I get gross errors which the insert jumps around and ends up in the middle
 of some other word I previously typed.&nbsp; This is so annoying and have to go back to correct it.&nbsp; I know it definitely slows down my typing as I have to do it, hunt for the letter trying to stay away from the touchpad,</p>
<p>.&nbsp; This is a HP laptop and other HP's I had before there was a driver called synapsis where you were able to open it up and make the change easily.&nbsp; I went to HP support to find that driver and there was none.&nbsp; I upgraded to win 10 and prior to that, even
 win 7 did not have that driver.&nbsp; I thought I could chat with a real person but all I got was a VIRTUAL agent.&nbsp; I was talking to a wall.&nbsp; If anyone can help me with this, it would be a blessing.&nbsp; Thanks very much.</p>

 win 7 did not have that driver.&nbsp; I thought I could chat with a real person but all I got was a VIRTUAL agent.&nbsp; I was talking to a wall.&nbsp; If anyone can help me with this, it would be a blessing.&nbsp; Thanks very much.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have been dealing with the problem for 3 weeks and read many articles trying to find the solution, until yesterday, I read a bit from a MS engineer that this could be related to a corrupted profile on your computer. Then it darn on me, how could your profile
 become that corrupted but then I realized it could cause a few times I had to redo my PIN setup for no reason. So, it was possible. My computer is also a HP with a touch screen just over a year old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, long story short I solved the problem and non of those solution changing the pointer settings, or updating drives will fix this. The problem is you USER account settings that links to the MS email address when your sing into your machine that is
 causing the problem. Something MS has done in an update that is tied to your email address is disrupting the user experience. There is a problem with the SYNC that MS is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Permanent Solution: On your user account, change it from a MS sign in account to a "Local Account" on your machine. Best if this account is an Administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open up computer settings and go to "Accounts"</p>
<p>2) Go to "YOUR INFO" and change from a MS sign in to a "LOCAL Account". It will also ask you to provide a password for your local account.</p>
<p>3) Make sure the account type is still Administrator when you do this</p>
<p>4) Under "Sign in Options", make sure to setup your PIN, Facial recognition if you didn't already have that done. You do these in case you forget your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, it will immediately stop the cursor jumping all over the screen. Any accounts that is signed in with the MS sign in process (which is providing the MS email address to verify) will have this problem. I really don't see how they haven't
 figure out that the whole issue is them (MS). This is the fix for the problem completely until MS corrects the problem on their side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A work around, not a fix, is to disabled the the touch screen if your computer has touch screen capability. This you can do by going into your device manager and disabling the touch screen. Performing driver downgrades or upgrades etc, will NOT work like
 most post suggest. Doing all this is just a waste of time and I have done all of those over the last 3 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary FIX:</p>
<p>1) go to "Device Manager" and you can use the keys:&nbsp; Windows key + X</p>
<p>2) go the section that has "Human Interface Device" for your devices</p>
<p>3) Right click on the one that says touch screen and disable it</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will solve your problem but your touch screen will no longer work. This is just a temporary solution.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Changing to Local admin account doesn't change anything except not use the windows servers to verify it's you via your MS email address. Everything will remain the same and you just have a another password to use for the local account. I found after a few
 days, the OS tries to force you to change it back by sending notifications reminding you to put it back the way it was. The min I changed it back, it started back with the symptoms. It seems to always find a way back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, Don't use that fix anymore I listed above. I ran it for a few days and the symptoms slowing came back and I was quite surprised. You just have to completely disable the touch screen to get rid of the problem. It's not really a fix but is stops all
 the cursor jumping and you have full control back. The touch screen drivers are old and there are no new updates from HP. They seem to be updating everything except the touch screen drivers and it's breaking the system. I even uninstalled the touch screen
 drivers at one point and let Windows install from the OS after a reboot but the symptom is still there but not as bad. Eventually, it becomes more aggressive the more you use the computer if you do that solution with the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix I'm running now:</p>
<p>1) go to "Device Manager" and you can use the keys:&nbsp; Windows key + X</p>
<p>2) go the section that has "Human Interface Device" for your devices</p>
<p>3) Right click on the one that says touch screen and disable it</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>No touch screen after doing the above but you have you computer back.</p>

            The pen works just fine for handwriting and navigational commands, but the screen does not react to the pen for certain tasks such as the on-screen keyboard.&nbsp; This is clearly not a driver issue but a design or setting issue.

<p>What specific option were you recommending I change?&nbsp; I've looked over all the menus and changed pretty much everything I can but still to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen knows the difference between the stylus and the finger, and that's great.&nbsp; But there must be some setting that is telling the keyboard to ONLY respond to the finger, but not the stylus.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            New patch - 2009 console&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, about a year ago I&nbsp;recieved a replacement xbox from microsoft as my previous 2007 model suffered from the red rings. This replacement model is from 2009 and is a premium console. I have heard that most of the consoles affected by the new disk format
 patch are 60gb 2009 premium model's. Could anyone tell me if mine would be affected&nbsp;or not? Bearing in mind the hard drive is 20gb(from my old 2007 model) and not 60gb.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Is it?</p>
<p>See I read this and thought otherwise, as it sounds like it's caused by an update from those that beta tested, not the latest one released to all.</p>
<p>If it was the one that everyone's getting then surely MS would launch the replacement program for this update as well.

            Hi Cathy, 
<br />
<br />The way to do this is go to Control Panel - Power Options
<br />On the left, click 'Choose what closing the lid does'
<br />Set that to do nothing . . .
<br />
<br />Well that is supposed to work, the problem in my experience is Windows 10 totally ignores this setting . . .
<br />
<br />It may work on your laptop :)

<h2>            Black Screen issue within the Wireless Display app.</h2>
                    
<p>As of the last few weeks i've been having issues with the "Wireless Display" app. The main one being I literally can't project anything to my Xbox One.</p>
<p>When I connect my Windows 10 laptop to my XB1, I get nothing but a black screen within the app, although my PC states that it is "Connected" with my console. Any ideas on why this might be happening? The app used to work fine for me.</p>

            If you happen to be using Edge and you get and error when you load a site requiring Flash, it’s possible it’s just disabled.
<br />
<br />To change that, open the More actions menu in the top right corner of the Edge browser, scroll down, click the View advanced settings menu then toggle on Adobe Flash Player. Refresh the web page or close Microsoft Edge then open it again. In rare cases, you might need to restart your computer
<br />
<br />If there’s no overt signs on the page that Flash needs to be enabled, but you still sense that there is some missing content, then it’s possible that Flash content isn’t loading.  This may be by design; as a security measure, Microsoft is limiting the use of Flash where ever it can. So, if you are greeted by a web page with only a puzzle symbol, don’t be puzzled. Instead, look in the address bar, then click the puzzle icon. From here, you can choose whether you want to allow the website you are viewing to always run Adobe Flash or Allow it once.
<br />Update Adobe Flash Player in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Since Microsoft bundled Adobe Flash in Windows, you also get Adobe Flash updates via Windows Update. So, if you have tried all the above and Flash still refuses to load in Microsoft Edge, you likely need to install an update.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Download and install the latest update for Flash if it’s available.
<br />
<br />Sometimes even Windows Update might prove problematic when installing updates for Flash Player updates. What you can do is download the update for Flash Player manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog. We showed you how to do that in our previous article on how to install Windows updates manually.

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems viewing Flash content, then you might want to try to repair or reset Microsoft Edge.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-microsoft-edge-web-browser-windows-10-1709/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-m...</a>
<br />
<br />What About Other Web Browsers?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 bundles Adobe Flash for use with the Edge browser. If you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or other web browsers, you will need to either enable or download then install Adobe Flash manually. In Chrome, when you visit a website that requires Flash, click the Secure menu in the left of the address bar then click Site settings.
<br />
<br />Scroll down, click in the list box for Flash then select Allow.
<br />
<br />If Flash still does not work, you likely need to update it. In the Chrome address bar, type chrome://components then hit Enter. Scroll down then click Check for the update under Flash Player.
<br />Mozilla Firefox
<br />
<br />In Firefox, first, check if Flash is enabled. Click the Open menu , then Add-ons, Plugins then click on Preferences for Shockwave Flash. Click on the Choose Change when this add-on runs list box then choose Always Activate.
<br />
<br />Updating Flash on Firefox requires users to visit Adobe’s download page where they can download and install the latest versions for their respective web browser.

<h3> savin smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 S   issue with 500GB harddrive   error code E68</h2>
                    
<p>We purchased an Xbox 360 S console about 3 years ago.&nbsp; For some reason we never added an extra Drive.&nbsp; My daughter had a new game that needed 20GB of storage.&nbsp; No problem!! Purchase a hard drive.</p>
<p>- Off to Walmart and purchased a 500 GB hard drive compatible with the Xbox 360 S model.</p>
<p>- Came home, followed procedures and installed new drive.&nbsp; everything was simple and fast.</p>
<p>- Turn on Xbox 360.&nbsp; Error code E68 appears after about 40-60 seconds.&nbsp; Hmm</p>
<p>-Turn off Xbox.&nbsp; Remove drive.&nbsp; Reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Error code is gone.&nbsp; Must be drive.<br />
- Drive connections look Ok.&nbsp; Cleaned dust out of Xbox slot, blasted air can at connection to remove dust.</p>
<p>- Put drive back in system and reboot.&nbsp; Error Code 68.</p>
<p>-Went online to research.&nbsp; Everything suggests that I hav a bad drive.</p>
<p>- back to Walmart.&nbsp; Exchange drive for new drive.</p>
<p>- Go home and install new drive.&nbsp; Error Code 68.</p>

<p>Question:&nbsp; How the heck do I know if I have purchased two bad drives in a row or IF the hard drive connection in the Xbox is the problem?</p>
<p>HELP!!!&nbsp; Should I go back and get a third hard drive?&nbsp; </p>
<p>BTW, how do I find out if the system is patched to the latest software?</p>
<p>Savin</p>

<h2>            How to tell if my version of Windows 8 &#40;OEM&#41; is single language or regular</h2>
                    I recently purchased Windows 8 OEM installation disk and I intend to use it for personal use. Text on the package said I must visit
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/personaluselicense" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/windows/personaluselicense</a> for license terms. When I visit that site a box appears letting me choose a version of OEM:
<ul>
<li>Windows 8 (OEM Version)</li><li>Windows 8 Single Language (OEM Version)</li><li>Windows 8 N (OEM Version)</li><li>Windows Pro (OEM Version)</li><li>Windows 8 Pro N (OEM Version)</li></ul>
<p>I don't know which one should I choose. Here is the product name: Win 8 64Bit Eng Intl 1pk DSP OEI DVD.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>
<p>[EDITED on August 9, 2013] <i>Fixed the license terms link</i><br />

            <p>Have you installed the Windows 8 yet?&nbsp; When you do the version and edition you have installed will be found in Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System. or by typing MsInfo32 in the Run Box or Search Box.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have a choice of at Installation time then you may want to install a language that is your own language.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>•Computers preinstalled with Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8 Chinese Language Editions will not support the installation of additional language packs.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows 8 N editions <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/n-editions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/n-editions</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can check the licence terms after the product is installed.&nbsp; Normally the edition you are installing is clearly marked on the DVD label.&nbsp; It should say something like "Windows 8 (OEM Version)".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you clarify, and repeat the exact link for the OEM link where you got the options message.</p>
