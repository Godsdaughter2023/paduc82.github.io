<p>MSTSC.EXE is the Microsoft Terminal Services Client, used to connect remotely to Windows Servers and some Windows PCs.&nbsp; It may safely be deleted if you don't need it.&nbsp; Before you delete it you should check to make sure you still have a copy of the file in
 the folder C:\Windows\System32 (or the System32 folder where your Windows is installed if not in C:\Windows) - if not put the copy from your desktop there instead of deleting it.</p>

<h2>            Changing an account name in Family Safety.</h2>
                    I have downloaded family safety in multiple windows 7 computers without much of a problem.&nbsp; However I did have one issue dealing with user account names.&nbsp; Prior to installing the program I changed some of the names on the computers.&nbsp; In every case after
 installing Family Safety it did not recognize the new name and therefore asked if I wanted to monitor the profile titled by the previous name.&nbsp; the only way I've found to fix the issue is to create a whole new account with the desired name.&nbsp; However I do not
 want to do this because of the files still on the account.&nbsp; I can't keep it the old name because I have multiple computers with the same login names which is why I'm giving them the name plus a numerical value.&nbsp;

    <title>cannot safely remove external esata disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctbram  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot safely remove external esata disk</h2>
                    I just upgraded from vista to win7.  I have an external single disk esata enclosure.  There is no option to safely remove disk!  This option to remove the disk existed in Vista!  Why is it missing in Win7!  It takes 30 freaking minutes to shutdown and restart my system and I have to shuffle a dozen disks in and out of that enclosure in a day!  Hwo can anyone design a system as user unfriendly as this? 



I have spent two weeks now trying to find if there is a way to get the option to safely remove my esata disk back. 



There is no quick removal option in the disks policies section.  I can only turn off disk caching.  Doing so does not restore the safely remove option. 



Trying to remove the disk even when not having read or written anything to or from  the drive corrupted the drive and converted it to RAW.  Trying to recover my data from the RAW file system completely killed the drive! 



I REPEAT!  HOW CAN ANYONE MAKE SUCH A USER UNFRIENDLY PIECE OF **** OS AS THIS!

            <p>The safely remove option is part of your chipset drivers, nothing to do&nbsp;with win7</p>

            <div>Em it's an evga X58 intel motherboard and I could safely add and remove disks</div>
<div>when I had vista installed so that would imply the chipset supports it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Also, yes, the system is most certainly win7 compatible. &nbsp;I had the esata</div>
<div>enclosure is win7 compatible it's a evga x58 classified board.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Going to drive properties and policy there is only the option to enable or</div>
<div>disable cache. &nbsp;No option to make the drive removable. &nbsp;I don't care about</div>
<div>hot swap that is a feature of the enclosure. &nbsp;Once I can safely remove the</div>
<div>drive from windows (ie all the buffers are safely flushed) I can remove the</div>
<div>drive from the enclosure without the need to power it down should I want</div>
<div>too. &nbsp;I just need to be able to swap disks without taking 30 god damn</div>
<div>minutes to shutdown and reboot my system. &nbsp;I have to swap disks a dozen</div>
<div>times during the day and this is unacceptable and has already cost me a</div>
<div>500GB disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All you have to do to see this is a major issue is google esata and safely</div>
<div>remove or eject disk and you can see many people are pulling their hair out</div>
<div>over this. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The least Microsoft could do is make a freaking statement</div>
<div>clearly defining what is needed to safely remove an esata disk and when it</div>
<div>simply cannot be done rather then let people keep on guessing. &nbsp;80% of the</div>
<div>suggestions I read are either just plane ridiculous or down right dangerous.</div>

            Furthermore, safely mounting and unmounting a disk should be a function of EVERY modern operating system. &nbsp;To try and blame the hardware is typical finger pointing. &nbsp;I can mount and unmount disks all the way back to my XP system and all of a sudden I cannot
 in win7 and people try to blame the same motherboard and chipset that I could unmount the same esata drive running vista????

            Really, why the eSATA connected drive has no option to safely remove it in Windows 7? It is very important feature to be taken out&nbsp; from a newer (Win7) OS!!! I have the same problem and I am looking for the answer but cannot find anywhere. The same applies
 to the removal of the SATA connected (placed into internal SATA mobile drive rack MRA-200). I am using HotSwap! software (version 5.0.0.0 by Kazuyuki Nakayama) to remove those drives from Windows 7. However, the software does not see the eSATA connected drives.
 Please help.<br />

            Hello, if I could get a response that'd be greatly appreciated. I'm still having the problem no matter what solution I try. I tried going back to the previous update, but the buzzing noise came to the previous restore. When I mute, the sound goes away
 and other headphones also have this buzzing noise coming from Windows, so it's not a problem with them. The laptop's internal speakers seem to be fine. This buzzing noise happened to me when I updated my old laptop to 1803 as well. I've updated my laptop further,
 I'm on version 1809 now. Please help me get rid of this buzzing noise.

            <p>Hi Joseph, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mention that other games which are downloaded from the app store works fine, it's pretty clear the issue lies with that particular game Modern Combat 5.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first step in getting the issue fixed would be to uninstall the app and then visit the store app again and install it and check the sound issue gets fixed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing which you can do is to Keep your app up to date. You can do this by making sure that automatic app updates are turned on in the Windows Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please revert if you face any issues with Windows in future. </p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>The spooler can be turned on quite easily -- usually a reboot does it -- but the real question is why it got turned off in the first place.&nbsp; If you can trace the problem to a power outage, you probably have a corrupted printer driver, but malware can also
 cause this.</p>
<p>Basic instructions to turn spooler on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK) </li><li>type the following and press enter </li><li>net start spooler </li></ul>
<p>Make sure that the spooler service is set to be turned on automatically on bootup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start &gt; Run &gt; services.msc &gt; OK </li><li>Scroll down until you see Print Spooler </li><li>Right click and select Properties </li><li>Ensure that "Startup type" is set to "Automatic."&nbsp; You can also Start (or Stop) the spooler service using this tool.</li></ul>
<p>Instructions for cleaning out your printer driver and reinstalling it:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm</a> (note: you won't be able to do step 3 until you turn the print spooler service back on; with the spooler service off, Printers and Faxes is unpopulated).</p>
<p>If you have a Lexmark printer, or you want to do a more thorough cleaning job, see<a href="http://members.shaw.ca/bsanders/CleanPrinterDrivers.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://members.shaw.ca/bsanders/CleanPrinterDrivers.htm</a> which also includes a method of cleaning things
 out without needing the spooler service on.</p>

<h2>            System crash &#47; freeze whilst playing Mahjong Titans on windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>My Daughter has recently purchased an Acer Laptop with Windows 7. Twice now, whilst playing Mahjong Titans the system has frozen. On the first occasion, she had no option but to power down; subsequently windows would not run. I tried to use the inbuilt system
 recovery to no avail and had to resort to running the system backup disks that I had made on first use of the laptop. The second time it was slightly easioer with the startup recovery actually working.</p>
<p>I find it a bit too coincidental that on both occasions She was running an inbuilt game, anyone else experienced this problem or have any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If these freezes are happening on a new laptop, it would not be a bad idea to contact the manufacturer of the laptop, since it could be an indication of some hardware fault.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you totally disable UAC&nbsp;Metro Apps will not function (see methods to re-enable<br />
them in second section below).<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Action Center - on upper left&nbsp;- Change User Account Control settings
<br />
- Never Notify is the lowest setting however that does not turn UAC Totally OFF.<br />
<br />
Or Control Panel - User Accounts - in the center - Change User Account Control settings.<br />
<br />
What are User Account Control Settings - several methods including registry hack<br />

<li><span>After which update you are facing issue?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any recent changes (Hardwar or Software) on your computer?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per my research and knowledge it is not possible to uninstall Internet Explorer permanently from your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer comes as an integrated component of Windows that cannot be uninstalled. Newer versions of Internet Explorer are sometimes released for existing operating systems, replacing the older version. Optionally, users may later choose to revert
 this upgrade. Starting with <span>Windows 2000</span> it is possible to disable Internet Explorer: The user can no longer launch it but its
<span>web browser engine</span><span> </span></p>
<p>remains operational for applications that use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you don't want to install Internet Explorer but want to use internet options to change security level. You may refer to the steps provided below to use internet options without using Internet Explorer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Window key and R</strong> at the same time.</li><li>This will open <strong>Run </strong>window.</li><li>In the run&nbsp;box type <strong><em>inetcpl.cpl</em></strong></li><li>Now press <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>This will open the <strong>internet option </strong>window.</li><li>Then you may select <strong>Security tab </strong>and change the level.</li></ul>
<p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h3> dementedde  say:</h3>
<h2>            F.E.A.R. 3 - alternate ending</h2>
                    

<p>I've almost completed this game using Pointman as the main protagonist. After the game finishes I have heard that you can do the campaign again, but this time through the perspective of Fettel, in which will bring a alternate ending to the experience.</p>
<p>So, are there any achievements for doing the Fettel campaign mode? I'm assuming there's an achievement for completing the alternate ending, even though I couldn't recall seeing one in its list. But maybe it's one of the secret achievements?</p>
<p>Can you guys please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Richard
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Move all your User Library folders to D:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, right click your Documents folder and choose Properties
<br />
<br />Select the Location tab
<br />
<br />In the Location box, type D:\Documents then click Apply and Ok
<br />
<br />When that move completes, do the same for Pictures, Videos and Music
<br />
<br />Each time, provide a new folder location, for example, Pictures will go to D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Move the location of all future content downloaded from the Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage - Change where new content is saved:
<br />
<br />Change all options you find there to D
<br />
<br />3.
<br />If you are a Steam Gamer
<br />
<br />Stop all processes associated with Steam
<br />
<br />Move the Steam folder to your D drive manually
<br />
<br />Then open the Steam Control Panel and point that to the new location
<br />
<br />
<br />4.
<br />Please Note: this should ideally be done before you begin installing any software
<br />
<br />For 3rd party applications, some will allow you to choose an installation location, for those, create a new Program files folder on your D drive, then for each application, create a new sub-folder of that folder
<br />
<br />Other 3rd party applications will not allow you to change the installation location, and there is no safe way to move those to your D drive . . .

    <title>Unable to complete remote assistance connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellyvet6971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to complete remote assistance connection</h2>
                    I am attempting to help a friend of mine using remote assistant.&nbsp; We both have&nbsp;Vista and I have walked him through setting up an invitation&nbsp;for someone to help him.&nbsp; At first he&nbsp;did this in an email but then we agreed that creating&nbsp;a seperate invitation
 in a file after which he sent the file to me to because he does not use Outlook for his email system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
On his computer he has opened remote assistant and is waiting for a connection.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;opened the invitation that he has sent me, entered the password, and the connection times out, indicating that other person must&nbsp;not have remote assistance opened.&nbsp; As I
 stated, he has remote assistance open.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NOTE:&nbsp; He is on Comcast, and he is behind a router.&nbsp; While he was setting up remote assistance for the first time I heard him mumbling something about needing the outgoing server address, whether it was a POP....&nbsp; He does not remember what he put in for these
 settings.&nbsp; Also, I have made sure&nbsp;that the Windows Firewall is not blocking remote assistance.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I am thinking he might have entered the wrong information for the server when he was setting up remote assistance and this is the reason that I can&nbsp;not connect to his computer.&nbsp; I have looked on the internet, inside Windows, played with it, and have not been
 successful at finding how to "reset" the remote assistance setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would appreciate any&nbsp;help that someone can provide me regarding this issue.&nbsp; If I need to add any more information please let me know.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your reply.&nbsp;

                    HI&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I AM PRABHA WORKING IN U.A.E. &nbsp;I AM FACING PROBLEM WITH HP PRINTER P2035 LASER JET. THE USB&nbsp;<br />
<br />
IS NOT RECOGNIZED AT ALL. I TRIED MY BEST LEVEL BUT NO WAY TO CONNECT. IT IS A BRAND NEW&nbsp;<br />
<br />
PRINTER RECENTLY PURCHASED. &nbsp;I AM &nbsp;USING ORIGINAL CD. I AM USING WINDOWS 7 ULTIMATE.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I HAVE UPDATED THE DRIVER FORM HP.COM/SUPPORT TOO. I RE-INSTALLED USB 2.0 + USB3 DRIVERS&nbsp;<br />
<br />
TOO. WHEN I RUN THE PRINTER SOFTWARE TO INSTALL IT, IT COMES UP TO TO MASSAGE CONNECT USB.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WHEN I AM CONNECTING USB PRINTER CABLE WITH COMPUTER IT IS NOT RECOGNIZED. I CHANGED THE&nbsp;<br />
<br />
USB PORTS BUT NO USE. ANOTHER MODEL PRINTERS LIKE (HP P1102, HP 127N, 125NW) NO PROBLEM TO&nbsp;<br />
<br />
INSTALL. ONLY THIS MODEL MAKES ISSUE<br />
<br />
IF ANYONE CAN TELL ME HOW TO SOLVE IT? &nbsp;SINCE THE PRINTER P2035 IS BRAND NEW I HAVE TO&nbsp;<br />
<br />
INSTALL AND USE IT.<br />
<br />
WAITING FOR THE REPLAY<br />

    <title>how to disconnect bluetooth speakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark de paola  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to disconnect bluetooth speakers</h2>
                    <p>I've connected Bluetooth speakers via the devices charm music plays great, but is there a way to disconnect the speakers via the devices charm and output sound via the built in speakers?</p>
<p>I was expecting a disconnect button like when using PlayTo with an Xbox, turning the speakers off won't work for me as I use them in a communal area where people&nbsp;take it in turns to connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems as though all available speaker/media renderers should be available from the devices charm to allow for quick output switching, if this isn't possible is there a Windows 8/RT feedback forum anywhere?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
