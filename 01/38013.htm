<h2>            Several blue screens, not sure what the cause is</h2>
                    <p>Hey there! Over the last week or two, since I put an NVIDIA GTX 550 Ti into this PC, I've been experiencing blue screens every morning. Usually there's only one or two then they go away until I turn off my computer again, however about two days ago I experienced
 five or six in a row, which made me really want to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a link to three minidumps that I have saved (only recently found out my settings were incorrect, so it wasn't properly saving the minidumps - even then, half the time when I do get a blue screen, it doesn't bother to create a minidump at all).<br />
</p>
<p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByaAUThIoUPVVExWY05mRm1neG8</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at them in BlueScreenView however I can't seem to pin-point what is causing this issue. After researching on the internet, I thought perhaps it may be my RAM however I am not entirely certain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent minidump is from today, where I switched the NVIDIA GTX 550 Ti to a NVIDIA GTX 960 as I thought perhaps the video card was the cause of the crashing, but it still occurs. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the video drivers, and I had not
 installed any other programs at the time of switching to the 550 when this first started to occur. I have noticed that the crashes do tend to happen when I've got a game running, usually 5-10 minutes after opening it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rest of my specs are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Intel i5-4670</p>
<p>&nbsp;- 8GB of RAM (forget the brand)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- ASRock Fatal1ty Z97 Killer Motherboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;- 700w PSU (also forget the brand)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would love if someone could take a look at the minidumps for me. </p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

Just wondering...have you installed one or more codec packs?</p>
<p>What are the formats of the source files?</p>
<p>How complex is the project? Many clips, transitions, effects?</p>
<p>What is the duration of the project?</p>

            <p>I think I've found the answer - since WSL leverage Pico provider drivers (lxss.sys, lxcore.sys) to emulate&nbsp;a Linux kernel by translating Linux syscalls, WSL actually doesn't have a real Linux kernel, or said the Linux Kernel are the Pico provider drivers.
 So unless Microsoft upgrade the Pico provider drivers, users are impossible to change the Linux Kernel by installing anything.</p>

    <title>CTRL and SHIFT keys virtually &#34;stuck&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> misterfox20  say:</h3>
<h2>            CTRL and SHIFT keys virtually &#34;stuck&#34;</h2>
                    I have noticed this problem ever since I got my windows 7 laptop, and it's gotten worse lately.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At random times, either the Control or Shift key will become virtually "stuck" on, meaning that (for CTRL) my keyboard opens shortcuts or (for SHIFT) my keyboard is stuck on capital letters.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sometimes the problem goes away in a few minutes with the shift key, but every time the control key gets stuck I have to either log out and log back in or restart my laptop to stop the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have disabled sticky keys and toggle keys on my laptop, so I'm not sure why this is happening.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have no idea if this is a problem with windows 7 or my laptop.</div>

            <p><span>My company had this problem on several devices.&nbsp; We originally though it was a keyboard issue but it turns out it was related to the Synaptics TouchPad driver.&nbsp; HP even lists it as a fix on the
 download page for the newer TouchPad driver.&nbsp; Our symptom was the CTRL key would intermittently stick and users would have to tap to release it.&nbsp; You can download the newest TouchPad drivers for the 8460p&nbsp;here:</span></p>

<p><span>Otherwise search for your model on HPs website if you check the release notes for the TouchPad driver you'll probably notice the sticky key issue addressed.</span></p>

            Hi ninjagolife 
<br />
<br />You did not cause this, this was caused by an update to Chrome . . .
<br />
<br />Open Chrome
<br />
<br />In the Address bar, paste this and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />chrome://flags
<br />
<br />In the resulting list, look for 'Hardware Media Key Handling'
<br />
<br />Disable that setting
<br />
<br />Restart Chrome
<br />
<br />That should remove that for you . . .

 recommended ports for Xbox One, and I also enabled all the port triggering, and made sure UPNP was setup (ALL&nbsp; this stuff was untouched before Xbox One, it just worked on my Xbox 360 -- I think the router recognized the 360 UPNP calls).</p>
<p>My friend has his NAT open as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can chat on the Party chat together but we can't play together, once again, we both have our NAT reporting (OPEN).</p>
<p>We both were past Rhonda's garage. He invited me, but then after it says its joining, it almost immediately says the connection to host was lost and kicks me back to my game. I need to endure the loading screen for about 30 seconds and then I'm dropped back
 in my game -- losing any progress I may have accumulated since my last save (WOW--just wow, what a design problem)</p>
<p>When I try to invite my party mate to a game, it almost immediately says that the invite failed -- he doesn't even get pulled out of his game, its like my invite didn't go anywhere.</p>
<p>Based on everything I have experienced on Xbox One, the very worst of it has to do with the Network configuration&nbsp;setup and the party system. I think the proof that this launch was rushed is right here in the multiplayer networking set up.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any ideas on how I can get the coop working. As it stands, I can't really recommend an Xbox One to my friends.</p>

<p>Same here. I live in Japan and my friend in France. We can play all 360 games and Xbox One game in coop and multiplayer but impossible with Dead Rising 3. Its like this game doesnt support a too high ping i think ... I really hope that the march's update
 will fix that because since the 22th november i didnt play Dead Rising 3 ... </p>

<p>Still no solution to this because a friend and I are trying to get coop to work and it's becoming very tedious. &nbsp;The fact that it seems to be spread out is telling that it's not the players and it's the system/company. &nbsp;The Xbox 360 had the perfect setup
 on joining a friends game or inviting them to play, so why change that and build something so complicated? &nbsp;Or was it just overlooked in an effort to push the console out for sales? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was bad enough that the Xbox One doesn't support HBOGO, but now we have to deal with coop issues. &nbsp;If this is what I have to look forward to with moving forward with other titles then I'm going to break down and buy a PS4 as my friend suggested because
 this is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Im having the same problem with a friend of mine who lives in Austrailia and ive tried to play with a friend who lives in the same city as me, but it never seems to work. I really dont understand why this game doesnt work. Cant we sue for false advertising
 or something cause its really annoying that weve yet again been duped by microsoft and payed full price for a game that isnt completely debugged of the essential requirements?</p>

            <p>Make sure the hardware switch for wireless is on (if there is one) and it is enabled in the BIOS and install the proper driver/software for the wireless device from Dell's support web site for your system.&nbsp; Then configure it to connect to your wireless network.</p>
<p>If that does not work - the operating system may be corrupted somehow - might try an SFC /SCANNOW to fix corrupted files - or you could have bad hardware.</p>

<p><span><span>When i download files of the internet, my speed is ok, for wireless, but when tranfering files between computers (The other computer is a win 7), the transfer speed is really slow (2-4 MB/s). The transfers takes forever, and are relly unstable.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>The same applys when streaming to other devices (Media Center). The video being streamd will just go frame by frame, and it is no fun watching...</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I use AVG Anitvirus, and I have tried disabeling it before transer, whitout results...</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>I can also mention that when I turn my computer on, the internet connection is lost to all other devices... I then need to reset the router, and then the connection is fine again. This was never a problem before I got Windows 8.1, and is not

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that the drivers you are using, even if the latest now available, are not<br />
100% Windows 8.1 compliant. Check with your System Maker's Support (Motherboard<br />
Maker for custom systems) and/or the actual device maker. The latter, such as Intel,<br />
RealTek, Atheros and others may have newer versions not available at the System/Mother<br />
-board Maker's site. And continue to check with them regularly over the next year +.
<br />
Also update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers.<br />
<br />
Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/get-apps-devices-working</a><br />
<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
Be sure to check for updates to the router firmware since that can have a definite effect<br />
on Windows 8.1 connections even though other OS&nbsp;systems connections are fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Check with&nbsp;the System Maker's Support (Motherboard&nbsp;Maker for custom systems) and/or
<br />
the actual&nbsp;device maker for driver updates. If there are no newer versions&nbsp;re-install the same<br />
ones. Ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) about any known issues.<br />

<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run,
<br />
and Settings as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using<br />
<strong>Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and Start Screen.<br />

<br />
Control Panel - Network and Sharing Center - Troubleshoot Problems<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />

<p>
</p><p>When you say "System Maker", you mean Lenovo? Or do you mean the maker of the components in the computer?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes the System Maker for you is Lenovo.<br />
<br />
New computers come with early stage drivers so you always need to check with the System</p>
<p>Maker to up date to the latest versions. Its the first thing I do on a new system.<br />
<br />
BTW as OEM the System Maker is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware<br />
and Windows.<br />

<h2>            Is it normal to have 20 Service Host running in the background with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I open my task manager up and look at the processes that are running I was amazed at having 20 different service host running in the background.&nbsp; What do all these things do? I'm not really having performance issues&nbsp;my rig is an old&nbsp;Alien Ware POS.&nbsp;i7
 CPU 920 @ 267 GHz (Gamming computer) with 6&nbsp;Gigs of Ram (this is from back when all you needed was 4 Gigs). The only real performance issue I have is every now and again my sound makes a really horrible noise and the screen blanks - the only way to turn it
 off is to unplug the computer from the power strip (kill the power to the computer). What exactly do all these Host Service thingymabobs do? Do I really need them?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, the service hosts are needed by your computer; however, it depends on what application installed on your computer that makes it continuously running. (e.g. anti-virus).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any questions.</p>

            <p>This might sound disjointed but what I am really wondering about is how much control is given to companies when you give software the ability to run as administrator. Do companies gain the ability (if they chose to do so) to modify your computer or turn
 on or off your microphone/video devices that could potentially see into your home - or the ability to change/modify your computer with tracking programs which could allow them to see what you click on or what websites you visit.&nbsp; - what I have noticed. I never
 give my real phone number out - I have a dumb phone - the equivalent of a rotary phone in this day and age. The alpha numerics are bound by the keys/buttons 1-9 and getting the correct letter by selecting it repeatedly. I gave my phone number out relatively
 recently for security purposes and now I am getting notifications to my phone about facebook.&nbsp; I have no interest in facebook what-so-ever. I do not want people to know what I had for breakfast or when I take a dump. I am not one of those people with a selfie
 stick that runs around taking pictures to impress others that I have never met in real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So exactly what am I agreeing to when I give a company's software the ability to run programs as administrator? Can those company make the kinds of changes I can imagine if they choose to do so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned most things off and have no 3rd party stuff running, and Taskmgr shows 13 svchosts, so 20 probably isn't that unusual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the sideways caret in front of the name to see what services the svchost is hosting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: your later question, there's an entire flock of pages in <strong>Settings&gt;Privacy</strong> that may be what you're looking for.</p>

</p><p>If an company requires that you run their proprietary software in administration mode as a means of accepting their license agreement - they can not make changes through their software to my computer? Is that what you are saying. I need to contact an old
 friend of mine that used to be a senior software engineer at Northern Telecom in NC - RTP area... unfortunately I haven't seen or spoken to him in about 20 years.&nbsp;

</p><p>Note: I'm not particularly computer literate, I thought DOS was cool. I don't particularly like windows, but it is very useful and I have become part of the point and grunt generation. (where you point at something, click on it, but don't really understand
 what it does. That is unfortunate but the truth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note: I think there is a warning when you click on administration mode that ask : Allow X software to make changes to your computer. Or a warning of some sort of that nature... I have seen it before and made a mental note of it - but I am not sure exactly
 what kind of changes are being made.&nbsp; I know some anti-virus software can throw a monkey into the mix. Recently, I found that my background antivirus programs were 'sidelined'. Could proprietary software that is given administration level access interfere
 with anti-virus settings on my computer?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You have/had a backdoor trojan that may have already been removed from the system however<br />
do a very thorough check with the methods below (use them all).</p>
<p>mspdb12.dll - Dangerous <br />
<a href="http://www.greatis.com/appdata/d/m/mspdb12.dll.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.greatis.com/appdata/d/m/mspdb12.dll.htm</a><br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

How do I get back to the conventional view where contacts have their names and I can select the sort sequence I desire?

                    <p>Original title: External CD/DVD drive not able to be accessed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Envy running 8.1 pro and an external HP CD/DVD drive. The drive, while recognized will not read or write. When in windows explorer, I can see that the drive is there, but when I select it&nbsp; "E: Not Accessible, access is denied"&nbsp; is the message.
 I am an administrator to my machine. </p>
<p>HP support wanted me to uninstall my Norton 360, that is not an acceptable answer.
</p>
<p>Under advanced security for the drive, &nbsp; is the message for owner - there is none. As well as permissions, auditing &amp; effective access. Under sharing, "everyone" and myself have full control.</p>

            <p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed information. </p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Did you try by connecting CD/DVD driver to different ports?</li></ol>
<p>Refer to the following troubleshooting methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Disable third-party Security Software, check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>You should see an icon for your Antivirus program in the Task-bar notification area. It is usually at the bottom right corner of your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Important Note</strong>:</span><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Uninstall the CD/DVD drive, restart the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Press Windows and X keys together.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Click on <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Locate <strong>CD/DVD drive</strong> and expand the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Select the drivers for DVD drive, right-click and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Restart the computer, if prompted. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span><span>Turn off the User Account Control and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. </span><span>Press Window and X keys together. </span></p>
<p><span>b. Select</span><span> Control Pane, then click on Users.</span></p>
<p><span>c. </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click on Change</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> User Account Control settings.</span></p>
<p><span>What are User Account Control settings?</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-user-account-control-settings#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/what-are-user-account-control-settings#1TC=windows-8</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

            Hi there Andrew! The file location path is actually C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\
<br />
<br />WindowsApps is actually hidden, so you need to unhide it.
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer from the taskbar.
<br />Select View &gt; Options &gt; Change folder and search options.
<br />Select the View tab and, in Advanced settings, select Show hidden files, folders, and drives and OK.

<p>Your user settings are stored in many places throughout Windows. It's not as simple as copying one file or one folder.</p>

            Hi Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />A few specific Settings can be sync'd in Windows 10 via your Microsoft Account so they can be used on other Devices.  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; SYnc your Settings to check them out.
<br />
<br />Othewise you wouldn't want to save your User AppData as it's a corruption path into another or a fresh install.  Just start fresh with each app.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The floating toolbars are not a feature of 7. You might find or create a gadget to do it.

<h2>            Windows 10, Boot error 0xc000014c</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>I recently upgraded my Dell Inspiron 14 to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp; I've had zero issues with Windows 10 since I upgraded until yesterday, when I went to open up my laptop and, before getting to the sign-in page, received a blue screen with the following
 message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your PC/Device needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
The Boot Configuration Dara for your PC is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \Boot\BCD</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc000014c</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My brother had provided 4 recovery discs for Windows 7, but when I put the CDs in the computer, nothing happened. I do not have recovery tools for Windows 10. The error message screen refreshes itself every 30 seconds or so, as if it is trying to fix itself,
 but it always go back to the blue screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a diagnostics test and everything passed. I am no tech guru, so maybe there is something obvious that I am missing, but I need a helping hand to walk me through this step-by-step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!</p>

<h3> kevor208  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; CPU usage</h2>
                    My computer will all of a sudden for no reason go to 100% CPU usage and the computer slows way down and quits responding. Svchost.exe, searchindex.exe, PctsSvc.exe, dwm.exe, explorer.exe and audiodg.exe seem to be using all the memory, Svchost.exe uses
 the most. is there some simple way to fix this problem. My computer is a HP pavillon dv6700 with an intel core 2 duo CPU 1.83 GHz and 3GB of RAM. I dont have any of the discs that originally came with it. it's my girlfriends computer and her EX set it up and
 must've taken the discs with him. Is there anybody that can help me please?

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />

<br />

 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2231/vista_run_system_file_checker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2231/vista_run_system_file_checker/</span></a><br />
<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928228</a></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />
<br />
Read this Tutorial on how to do a Repair Install:<br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to
 put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>
