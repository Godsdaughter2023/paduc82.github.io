    <title>Class not registered. MovieMaker error message. Also clip-player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianeclus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Class not registered. MovieMaker error message. Also clip-player shakes in trying to start but never does. Is that memory&#63;</h2>
                    Always "Class not registered" is the answer for why MovieMaker can not import so many files. I finally realized that if I have any "Windows files" associated with QuickTime (which I do often because QuickTime Pro has been my editor that works but I sure
 would like MovieMaker to work because it has a different user interface that QuickTime Pro does not have and also it looks like a really good program)<br />
<br />
well then of course MovieMaker will say that it does not have the "Class registered". But then I associate everything with Windows and I use Windows Media Player on files that are Windows media (that's a whole nother ball game as to why PhotoStory3 WON'T recognize
 ANYTHING either to import into IT because Windows Media Player and its unbearable playlists (sorry Windows but really .. how much of a control freak do we have to be???? Windows Media Player is a great product but those playlists and how psycho they are and
 how they control so much else if you don't have them right ... I mean I do not even categorize my media like the Playlists insist!&nbsp; It drives me bonkers that they will not even sort per directory!&nbsp; Okay okay .. I am sorry .. but these are truly relevant statements
 and probably a reason why people eventually shift to Mac. Windows Media Player wants to control how PhotoStory3 works and opens your media .. it wants to sort what you want to associate with it in a way that is so amazingly frustrating and it shifts all of
 the time so that you do not know what is left in some archive that it still continually seems to come up with ... UGH)<br />
<br />
Yes back to Movie Maker. I am sorry .. but it turns out that Movie Maker also does not seem to recognize any "class" of files that it should easily import. My *.wmv and *.wma and *.avi files .. but it says "Class not registered". And believe me I have registered
 every single file that seems to be a DLL per the "library" that I guess MovieMaker may refer to. I am out of my element when it comes to talking about these "libraries" and controls but I have registered continually the 5 main DLLs in Movie Maker as well as
 the outside System32 Dlls that seem to impact on it. <br />
<br />
I have trouble though registering the final 3 files in MovieMaker that all look the same. I keep on holding out that maybe these will be the trick to getting MovieMaker to work. AT LEAST to get the timeline clip player in it to work. Does anyone know where
 that clip player is originating from .. .. is IT also associated with Windows Media Player. And as I am probably suspecting ... do I have to find more room on my computer or go buy more memory (there is no room to install more unless I probably get a new computer)
 to get this clip player to work. <br />
<br />
So the 3 *.dlls in MovieMaker that I can not get to register are:<br />
<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\regsvr32.exe C:\Program Files\Movie Maker\wmm2eres.dll<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\regsvr32.exe C:\Program Files\Movie Maker\wmm2res2.dll<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\regsvr32.exe C:\Program Files\Movie Maker\wmm2res.dll<br />
<br />
AND that is just only ONE of the many ways that I have attempted to register them. But they won't come up with a "success".<br />
<br />
And finally the codecs associated with MovieMaker. I even went into that codec identifying program under DirectX diagnostics ... the "Softella Filter Manager" or something like that ... and I poured thru it and found all instances of the MovieMaker filter DLL
 and I reUpped its relevance in each instance of its being associated with some codec. I don't know exactly what I am saying there but in the list of codecs and filters ... so many of the things associated or listed with the MovieMaker wmm2filt.dll - they were
 designated to "never use".&nbsp; And I clicked them into usage again. Whatever that might mean I do not know but I thought at least it would give some input into the program and tell it .. it is being used.
<br />
<br />
Sorry for my long rant. I obviously don't understand programming that much but I do go around and research pretty much and I have been wresting with these two programs (Windows MovieMaker 2.1 and PhotoStory 3.1) for a good month or longer .. in trying to get
 them to work. <br />
<br />
Any tips would be appreciated if you bother to make it thru my rant. <br />
Thanks

            <p>I thought it might be from automatic Windows update (as Jan 17 is when a "critical" one was done). So, as advised, tried Disk Cleanup (and CCleaner): folder still here...</p>
<p>Straight to Recycling bin or Restore to date pre-Jan 17 and see if subsequent automatic updates will get rid of suspiscious folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, I tried deleting the folder. I got "You need permission to perform this action. You require permission from NETWORK SERVICE to make changes to this folder". Choosing Try again, just brings same dialog box up.</p>

<p>The folder in question is more then likely a system restore point. &nbsp;Not too sure you want to delete this folder at this point. &nbsp;And you probably are not going to delete at any point while the OS is up and running. &nbsp;You can verify this by creating a new system
 restore point and then checking your drive. &nbsp;Restore points are a valuable resource should your OS become corrupted or strange things are happening in there. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>1) What I'd love to know is why this is even installing when the program isn't supposed to be in Windows 7??? Yes I did 2 restores since I got my new HD because of this file being locked and my system going nuts either reading or writing **** to my disk
 constantly,I could barely navigate!!! I also had to do a fresh install twice because of this! Last being Feb.5th This file was also locked and I had to do the same as below just to look at the sucker.( why on Earth does MS not claim this as there's instead
 of seeing unknow user)I know what the hell it was and where came from!!! Geez it was the freaking .iso for Windows 7 with SP1!!! :P</p>
<p>I have an unlocker from my Advanced Systemcare,it shows as unlocked yet I had to take ownership and adopt all parental settings just to move the sucker into the recycle bin,then shred it via My ASC shredder!It said the file was already unlocked,then why
 couldn't I get into it?The application does nothing when clicked on even after taking ownership!!!</p>
<p>I did this 2 weeks ago and this shows back up ever 5 or so days!!! These last 2 showed up while My PC was off! I checked the time stamp I was asleep and the PC WAS OFF!!!
</p>
<p>2) How can I get updates when I have windows updates SET to NOT allow any,have it set to manually update in services,have not allowed and have remote access of my PC turned off as well as remote registry or anything else involving a remote connection to
 this without MY PERMISSION!??? Any scan shows I'm clean of any infections with all of my scanners as well as your own malicious removal tool!!! Don't worry I only use MSE as my full time protection so it's not the problem.</p>
<p>3) Whenever these files are present I have to go into safe mode to do a system restore or it says it worked when booting yet within 5 minutes it states it failed!!!Which all leads back to question 1)!!!</p>
<p>I was finally able to remove these files,just wondering when they'll reappear! lol,next restore? :/
</p>
<p>After removing and shredding these files My PC is back to normal!!!</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>It's fairly easy...once you go to the advanced&nbsp;section where it asks you to take ownership,on the bottom left,there should be a place to click to except all parental policies as well as taking ownership.You may get a warning that it will diminish security.lol
 Don't worry about that if you're going to get rid of this unneeded file as all it is was from when you updated,either manually or automatically.The update remains,just the file is gone. As I do not like being locked out of anything on MY PC I get rid of these
 types of files as all they do is take up space and are non-functional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was getting some from doing a manual updates,ie. going directly to the update page and downloading them&nbsp;for some,others I had forgot I had auto update set!</p>
<p>As of having to do yet another install on another PC of mine,I have yet to see any locked files,thank the Gods!!! lol</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender slowing everything</h2>
                    <p>We have had 4-5 users over the last 2 business days reporting extreme system slowness all of a sudden. This appears to be cause by the ‘antimalware service executeable’ in task manager, using high CPU and Disk write capacity (up to 150MB/s). This makes our
 affected laptops and desktops almost entirely unusable. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Updating defender</span></li><li><span>Disabling defender (in regedit) </span></li><li><span>Killing the process (unable to kill it)</span></li><li><span>Excluding defender install directories from defender scans</span></li><li><span>Running full system scans</span></li><li><span>Running in safe mode (stops it happening, but only in safe mode)</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Event viewer shows issues with some of our GPO’s pushing to systems, but the issue persists with systems that are off the domain.
</span></li><li><span>No clear indication of what defender is actually trying to do on the system.
</span></li><li><span>Windows is up to date on 1709, we’re not rolling out 1806 to all users as standard currently.
</span></li><li><span>Not everyone is having this issue, it only seems to affect random users.
</span></li><li><span>More and more users are starting to report it. </span></li></ul>

            It turns out that it was trying to download an update and spiking everything, excluding the C drive freed up enough thinking room for it to download and install everything and then it all behaved itself.

<p>Hi Andre,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice here - i'm relying on behalf of OP, William.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to be able to get an affected system to be usable enough to provide this information, we have to completely exclude C:\ from Defender scans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make: Dell&nbsp;<br />
Model: Latitude 7480</p>
<p>SKU: 07A0</p>
<p>(Please note that this is also occurring on multiple other Dell models, including desktop units).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No blank icons on the desktop to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internal SSD is a Micron 1100 SATA 256GB. Device manager says driver up-to-date already. No new driver available for this from Dell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Successfully disabled all the background apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Dell Command update to ensure all other drivers are up to date (2 new found: Ethernet controller driver, Thunderbolt 3 firmware update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed C:\ from defender exclusions following these steps to test if the issue persists: it does.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Readded C:\ to defender exclusions to continue troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabled Windows update service and stopped it running, followed by once again removing C:\ from exclusions, and rebooting. No difference, issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, no startup items at all showing up in task manager, which is odd as there are certainly some things kicking in, including Teams, Defender, Skype for business, the usual tasks. Nothing out of the ordinary - or different than the standard build
 on all the rest of our corp machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used msconfig to hide all MS services, then disable everything else, and restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>This actually worked!&nbsp;</strong></em>Correct me if i'm wrong, but this is almost a 'safe boot', is that right? Starting up with only MS services and apps seems to keep the issue at bay, with the Antimalware Service Executable sitting using a cool
 0.1 MB/s disk read/write. Worth also noting at this point that i'd re-enabled the Windows Update service from before, and the C:\ drive
<em><strong>ISN'T</strong></em> excluded from defender security settings. I suppose what i can do from here, although tedious, would be to go through the disabled services 1-by-1 and see what kicks off the problem again!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cleared all problem reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled Chrome. (tried this beforehand actually, and this didn't seem to make any difference).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>User accounts don't seem to matter, problem is system-wide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also hesitant to reset BIOS defaults as all our builds are standard, and use the same settings across the board. I'm going to revisit the idea of the services on startup and see if i can isolate a third-party app causing the issue from there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Most grateful for your advice!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are having the same problem here.&nbsp; Windows Defender started taking 30% of the CPU in few computers.&nbsp; I was able to fix one computer with sfc and dism&nbsp; commands, but after a week it came back on that computer.&nbsp; I could not fix the other 4 computers with
 the same commands,&nbsp; I had to run a Windows Reset (keeping the data).&nbsp; It fixed the issue, but I don't know if a windows update will bring it back,&nbsp; and also I'm looking for a better solution, because after a Windows Reset I need to go and reinstall all applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Jon,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to hear a feedback from you.&nbsp; Any luck on the startup services investigation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some things I have done so far that did not fix the issue:</p>
<p>uninstalled some latest windows update</p>
<p>uninstalled MS Office</p>
<p>update Windows Defender</p>
<p>installed KB4103714</p>
<p>SFC /scannow</p>
<p><span>DISM.exe /Offline /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span><br />
<span>DISM.exe /online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></p>
<p><span>added windows defender executable to exclusion list</span></p>
<p><span>added windows defender directory to exclusion list.</span><br />

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've largely found that the Windows 1803 Feature Update has resolved the issues on our machines - we've got one we've deliberately not updated to continue troubleshooting, however. Everything else that we tried, no matter the order, seemed to bring the
 problem back in either a matter of minutes or days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry i can't offer any further insight - but i'd recommend ensuring the 1803 feature update is installed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unwanted Bot</h2>
                    My contact list has been invaded by a Bot calling itself Cortana . I have wasted ages a) discovering it was a Bot and not a person and b) trying to find out how to delete it and not only delete its invasive message wanting to give me information I do not
 want. Very angry. How do we delete and prevent Bots?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the tip.&nbsp; However it didn't work.&nbsp; Tried this twice - each time during the period "configuring for Windows 10" screen went blank with same message about input timing needing to be 1920 x 1080 60hz.&nbsp; I checked on the compatibility site and the
 S2440L Dell display shows compatible with windows 10.&nbsp; One thing - I use a VGA connection, not an HDMI connection (my computer doesn't have one).&nbsp; Could that be the problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>What happen for this issue to arise? Any changes or new software/hardware installed?</p>
<p>Did you install a new theme/wallpaper recently?</p>
<p>Download this scanner and the anti-spyware programs and run a full/complete scan<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or try to reopen a new Explorer.exe to run and see if that will solve the issue.</p>
<p>Press ALT+CTRL+DELETE . On the Task manager see if the expolrer.exe running or not. If it is running try to End It and then click File &gt;&gt; New Task &gt;&gt; type in explorer.exe click [OK] and you should get your desktop back with icons and everything else. If
 not then you have an issue somewhere on your machine, either infection or a corruption!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 faulty installation - is there a fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Windows 10 upgrade. Now I havea partition labelled 'Data' which is almost full; I get regular warnings but am unable to do anything about it. I am unable to see what is takin up the 99 Mb filling the disk (100Mb).</p>
<p>The installation was 2 weeks ago and I am unable to revert to Windows 7 as the files have been deleted (I thought I had a month). Various tools seem to be missing I can not set up a File History as components are missing. When I try to bake a backup dribe
 the tool does not appear.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>

            <p>The rollback option can be cancelled by any of several actions, such as creating user accounts. &nbsp;The one month is just the maximum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do a repair install to fix issues. &nbsp;Download the Media Creation Tool from</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>and create either a dvd or usb. &nbsp;With Windows running insert the media and follow the prompts. &nbsp;You will be prompted on what you want to keep. &nbsp;Choose Keep Everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will install a completely new copy of Windows without disturbing your stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do NOT restart the computer with the media inserted or you will lose your files and apps.</p>

<p>Update: &nbsp;I ran the free download of Malwarebytes and it seems to have fixed it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still watching my PC, but no "Powershell stopped working" message, the memory usage is down to 3GB (normal), there are a low number of processes running and normal data transfer through my network adaptor. &nbsp;Fingers crossed it's a permanent fix.</p>

            <p>Hi Kumar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. It was caused <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
by Poweliks.</span></p>
<p>What I did was: reset the IE (version 11) security to default; download the updated Malwarebyte free edition version in safe mode with network connection; restored the system to the point before it was infected by the Poweliks (I was lucky that restore point
 was not deleted by the system yet); then re scan the whole PC in the safe mode with network. So far, almost a week, the PC works fine and wish the Poweliks never come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for everyone in the community to help.</p>
<p>Happy New Year to everyone!</p>

            I think you may have misunderstood the Powershell command.  In th start menu you hav search for PowerShell, right click on it select "Run As admin".  Then you paste the command STARTING at "Get- ...", skipping the PowerShell part.
<br />
<br />Here is a 5 step process for trouble shooting the Settings problem. It may help with Update also. If you are having problems RUNNING update, there are some separate trouble shooting steps we can provide.

            Hey Antonio.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can reinstall the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/</a>...
<br />
<br />If these fail then I would run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Disc Read Error Just Outside Warranty. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the judgement  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disc Read Error Just Outside Warranty.</h2>
                    
<p>I am going through this with my Day One right now too.&nbsp; I began experiencing that my XboxOne would not read game discs in February 2015 (just shortly after the warranty expired...), but did not report it as it would work some times, but not others.&nbsp; Now
 it fairly consistently will not read game discs.<br />
<br />
Clearing the Persistent Storage did not work.&nbsp; Doing a hard restart did not work.<br />
<br />
I just got off the phone with Xbox Services.&nbsp; My two options are to either pay $135 to set up a service request by phone or to pay $115 to set up a service request by going online to set it up. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am more than annoyed with Microsoft at this point.&nbsp; I am mad.<br />
<br />
I have been a customer since 2003.&nbsp; I paid $500+ for the system itself.&nbsp; I pay a yearly Xbox Live subscription when it now feels down more often than it is up on the weekends when I attempt to log on.&nbsp; I spend hundreds of dollars per year on games on Xbox Market
 Place movie rentals (should we even begin to discuss the Master Chief Collection debacle?). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now they want $135 to fix a defective disc reader, a problem which they began recognizing was prevalent immediately after launch ("disc drive of death")?&nbsp; Why should I bother?&nbsp; So I can pay them another $135 in a year when the new disc reader fails too?&nbsp; This
 is insult to injury and I am done.<br />
<br />
Isn't interesting that the system that did not want a disc drive to begin with (so that they could force you to download games off their market place) is now seeing disc drive failures juuuuust outside the warranty.&nbsp; Even more interestingly, the read issues
 are primarily game related, not Blu Ray or DVD related. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I experienced the Red Ring of Death with the Xbox360, I was impressed by how responsive Microsoft was, fixing the system quickly and free of charge.&nbsp; Not anymore. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If someone at Microsoft is willing to look up my account and fix my counsel, I would consider staying.&nbsp; If not, I am done.&nbsp; I'm out.&nbsp; I will cancel my Xbox Live account by the end of the week and sell the system within the month.&nbsp; Maybe I will get a PS4.&nbsp; Maybe
 I won't.&nbsp; What I do know is that I will be wiping my hands clean of Microsoft unless they step up now to save a customer who has been loyal for over a decade.</p>

<p>I have also run into similar issues. My first Day One Xbox One broke the day it came out. I opened it, set it up, played for a little and then turned it off. When I went to get back on, the Xbox would not power on. I was sent a new one about a week later,
 it was working for about a year and a half and just yesterday did the same exact thing. They want me to pay $115 to repair a clearly broken Day One device? I don't think so. Sony will most certainly be getting my business after this incident. Not even a discount
 for being a Gold member for well over 8 years, and spending hundreds if not thousands each year on accessories and video games. It just disgusts me that Micro$oft has the nerve to treat loyal customers like this. I can't imagine any other company would act
 this way towards customers. I have had 2 original Xbox consoles, 3 Xbox 360 consoles, and if I get my Xbox One repaired or replaced, I will be on my 3RD XBOX ONE CONSOLE in LESS THAN 2 YEARS. That is absolutely absurd. And because my warranty expired in March
 I have to pay $115-135?? I do not think so. Good joke Microsoft. Prepare to have even less sales than Sony. Sony +1, Microsoft -1.</p>

            Hi Veronica,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>I suggest you to refer to the following article for more details<br />
Microsoft policy about lost or forgotten passwords<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/189126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/189126</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> First, try the easiest thing: if you remember your password but it isn’t working, make sure that Caps Lock is turned off, and that your email address is spelled correctly, and then try again.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Forgotten password and other sign-in problems<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Let us try to enable the built in administrator account and try to create a new user account and transfer all the user profile data of the old account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Press and hold on the Shift Key from the Windows sign in screen and click on Restart.<br />
2. Follow the path Troubleshoot&gt; Advanced Options &gt; Start Up settings.<br />
3. Click on Restart.<br />
4. Choose Enable Safe Mode with Command Prompt.<br />
5. At the command prompt, type net user administrator /active:yes and then press Enter.<br />
6. Type net user administrator &lt;Password&gt;, and then press Enter.<br />
Note: In this command, &lt;Password&gt; represents the actual password that you want to set for the administrator account.
<br />
7. Type exit, and then press Enter.<br />
8. Log off the current user account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Type net user administrator /active:no to disable the Built-in Administrator after adding the Microsoft account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hey elor13,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MPQ file type is primarily associated with 'Blizzard Game' by Blizzard Entertainment.</p>
<p>Do you have any application installed that opens this kind of file extension? If you don’t have, ensure that you install one such.</p>
<p>The lock icon indicates that Right-Click on the file in question and select Share With &gt; Nobody. &nbsp;If this doesn't remove the lock, see if taking ownership of the file and granting permissions to it helps you in unlocking the concerned file.</p>
<p><strong>Take ownership of the file.<br />
</strong><br />
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the file on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer.<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on file and select “Properties” from Context Menu.<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on "Security" tab.<br />
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Advanced” button.<br />
5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click on "Owner" tab in Advanced Security Settings for User windows.<br />
6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Edit Button and select user from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list.<br />
7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on other users or groups. Enter name of user/group and click ok.<br />
8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select User/group and click apply and ok. Check “Replace owner on subcontainers and objects” if you have files and folder within selected folder.<br />
9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click ok when Windows Security Prompt is displayed.<br />
10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Owner name must have changed.<br />
11)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now click Ok to exist from Properties windows.</p>
<p>By now you should be able to open the file in question.</p>
<p>If it doesn’t, use your favorite search engine and browse for applications that provide you the ability to unlock any file that has been locked in Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.

            Before doing a repair upgrade you can try doing an in place repair
<br />
<br />SIMPLE, 1ST STEP IN TROUBLE SHOOTING- CHKDSK AND REPAIR WIN WITH DISM
<br />
<br />In start menu type “CMD” or “PowerShell”
<br />Right Click on the result and select “Run as Administrator”
<br />
<br />Type (or paste) the following command and press &lt;enter&gt;  to Scan the integrity of all protected system files and replace incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
<br />
<br />SFC /SCANNOW
<br />
<br />Then run next command to check and fix the disk and display a status report.:
<br />
<br />Chkdsk c: /F
<br />
<br />You will have to restart the computer for that check to work. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />After ChkDsk is done go back to the admin prompt and run following commands, one at a time to Repair The Installed Windows Image
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth 
<br />
<br />(this command checks whether the image has been flagged as corrupted by a failed process and whether the corruption can be repaired.)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth 
<br />
<br />(this command scans the installed windows for component store corruption.)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />(this command performs Window repair operations automatically.)

<h2>            Unknown device on Nework Map between laptop and wireless router</h2>
                    I am running windows 7 64bit on a laptop connected wirelessly to the router and internet.&nbsp; The router is the Linksys WRT160N connected to the internet.&nbsp; On the network map, there is an unknown device question mark between the laptop and router.&nbsp; However,
 I still have internet access.&nbsp; On the network map, if I hover the cursor over the laptop, it does not show an IP address.&nbsp; It only shows the computer name and its MAC address.&nbsp; Any assistance would be much appreciated.

            Solved my own problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;I unticked the IPv6 protocol button in network connection properties on the laptop, and now I can see it's IP address and the unknown device has been replaced by a switch and hub that is part of the router.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;did not untick the
 IPV4&nbsp;button. &nbsp;I am guessing that this is a bug in Windows 7 that you need to shut off ipV6 protocol when you have an Win XP computer on the network if you want to see a clean Network Map.&nbsp; As I said before, everything was working before, so this seems to be
 a cosmetic fix only.&nbsp; I do notice that my shared files on the XP computer show up faster following a reboot.

<h2>            Problems With Multiple Xbox One&#38;&#35;39&#59;s and Open NAT</h2>
                    
<p>Is there an issue with the xbox one that will prevent me from having two xbox ones online and open NAT on both? Only one of the will show open NAT. I have a brand new Linksys WRT1900AC router and I have followed all the old methods and looked in the new
 methods as well. Upnp is on. I tried it off. I have tried all combinations possible. Put one xbox in a DMZ. Tried port forwarding for one xbox. Dhcp reservervations. Static ip’s. Port triggering. No matter what I do only one will show open. If one shows moderate
 and I turn the other xbox off it will still show moderate unless I hold the power button down to completrly shut the xbox off. Then turn it on and that xbox will show open again. But the other one will still say moderate once it comes up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? In a Linksys thread a member said L2 xbox live help said the xbox one uses windows ME tcp/ip stack and it’s a xbox issue not a router issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) ** (added 3075 due to ghosts).</p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>Port 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>UDP Port 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>UDP Port 4500 (UDP)</p>

<p>If this is the wrong forum can someone direct me to the correct place to take this issue? thanks.</p>

<p>It really all depends on the router.</p>
<p>Not all routers can have multiple Xbox's connected and have an Open NAT on both.</p>
<p>My d-link was able to have 2 on at once both with open NATs</p>
<p>This should be moved to the Connecting forums under support.</p>

<p>Are you in the US or UK, in the UK i have a standard plusnet router done nothing to it, and don't have any major problems, occasionally have to reset or turn pnp off and on, to fix any nat issues but very rarely.</p>

<p>newegg is having a sale on a new netgear nighthawk for under $200, I was going to pick it up but my 5 year old Dlink DGL 4500 gaming lounge is still doing the trick. &nbsp;What you might have to do OP is set one of your xboxs in an "DMZ" zone outside of the router.
 &nbsp;One will be open and the other will be outside the router completely but may also leave that xbox open up for DDOS attacks...but doubtful.</p>

<p>its not outside the router - its in the demilitarized zone - you can DDOS any router if you have the correct tools. Being in the DMZ or not bares no relevance</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies guys. Yeah I had the Netgear r7000 but it was a piece of junk for me. I took it back. So it appears the user saying microsoft claming its an xbox one problem with the tcp/ip stack was misinformed. It must be a bad implementation of
 upnp.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It comes down to each ip only having 1 nat port . You cannot run multiple machines behind the same ip and have open nat on multiple machines . you will need to run a multi port switch with multiple ip address from your isp to have open nat on
 every machine . You can have a open nat and restricted nats &nbsp;and blocked nats all running at the same time .behind one ip address . it comes down to direct play inside direct x basically xbox live can only have direct play open once per each Ip&nbsp; address .</p>

<p><span><br />
What is the make and model of your mouse?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are using a Laptop, then disable the touchpad and check if it makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would also suggest you to check if the issue occurs in safe mode.</span></p>

            No, it is a regular pc, Dell.&nbsp; I was using a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; When I started to experience the problem, I changed out both keyboard and mouse with the standard mouse that came with the computer, but that did not help.&nbsp; I have gone
 in and adjusted the settings, no luck.<br />
