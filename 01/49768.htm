<p>As steps that are followed, it is just the regular process of setting up an account when first opening a unit.</p>
<p>Do you think that the apps opened are causing this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that, creating an account on a different unit, and then signing in on this pc, is not possible as you don't get the log on screen in windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this step be skipped, and modified afterwards ?</p>
<p>

            Opening of app should not be an issue. Recreation is a challenge for me as I don't have a fresh unit.

    <title>Function Address Protection Fault Problem With Printing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandpa john 77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Function Address Protection Fault Problem With Printing</h2>
                    When clicking on printing preference on my newly installed HP 380 all in one, I get a "Function address 0x60619b91 caused a protection fault.(exception code 0xc000005) Some or all page(s) may not be displayed" I've installed and re-installed four times,
 3 times with the original CD and once direct from HP's online driver. Each time the printer works for about 1-3 print jobs as expected, then the fault message appears thereafter. The copier function works while the pc to printer problem is happening. I've
 performed a registry cleaner program, and a printer spooler start/re-start in administrative tools in my XP home edition. I had a previous HP printer that operated without incident, and of course I removed all traces of the program prior to installing the
 new printer. Not sure if a DLL problem exist. Could use some advise/suggestions.&nbsp;

<p><br />
</p>&nbsp;<br />
<span>As I understand you are receiving errors while trying to check the printing preferences, such as
</span><span>"Function address 0x60619b91 caused a protection fault.(exception code 0xc000005) Some or all page(s) may not be displayed" after install the HP f380 all in one, is this correct and all attempts of you
 trying to troubleshoot the issue on your own has failed, is this correct?</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span><span>Please provide some additional information for a better understanding of the issue.</span></span></div>

a) Go to Start, Control Panel and Administrative Tools. Double click on Services icon.</span></div><span><br />
<span>b) Scroll down to the Print Spooler service and right click on it and select Stop. In order to do this, you need to be logged in as

<br />
<span>c) Next you need to navigate to the following directory:</span><br />
<br />
<span>C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. Delete all the files in this folder. This will clear all print queues (it’s a good idea to first
</span><br />
<span>make sure there are no other print jobs being processed on any of the other printers on the server because doing this step will delete those jobs also)</span></span>

            Hi Carmen
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. If this is a Windows problem, this can be solved by below. Otherwise, you may require local support.
<br />
<br />Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; On the right side, Click Printer &gt; Run the troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Select your printer &gt; Remove device
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Cortana Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed
<br />If you are using Bluetooth / Wirelss printer &gt; Select Add a Bluetooth, wireless or network discoverable printer &gt; Choose the printer &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />If you are using wired printer &gt; Select Add a local printer or network printer  with manual settings &gt; Select Use an existing port &gt; Select your Printer and follow on screen directions
<br />
<br />4. Clear Spooler
<br />Type Services in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to Print Spooler &gt; Right-click and choose Stop for the Print Spooler service &gt; Go to C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS. You can also type %windir%\System32\spool\PRINTERS into the address bar in Explorer if the C drive is not the default Windows partition &gt; Delete all the files in this folder &gt; Services console and right-click and choose Start for the Print Spooler service
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Carmen
<br />
<br />Before you try anything, check if your Printer will print a Settings page, from the printer itself, not from your PC
<br />
<br />Disconnect your printer form your PC
<br />
<br />On the Printer's Panel, press the System button
<br />
<br />Then select Report / /List, then press OK
<br />
<br />Select System Settings and pross OK

</p><blockquote>A saved Word/Excel document sometimes has a blank box alongside it instead of one showing Word or Excel&nbsp; ... What am I doing wrong.
</blockquote>
<p>Probably nothing at all. The 'blank box' indicates, I think, that Windows doesn't recognize the file type. This can happen if you save a document with the filename that the program suggests. This will be the very first bit of text in the document; if this
 is a document title or heading that ends with a dot (e.g. <em>Annual report 2015.</em> ), then you'll end up with a filename with two consecutive dots in it, like &nbsp;<em>Annual report 2015..docx.
</em></p>
<p>Because this can cause problems in certain situations, programs like Windows Live Mail will 'correct' the fault by changing one of the dots to something else, like an underline character. Unfortunately, Windows Live Mail picks the wrong one to change,
 so instead of transmitting a file with filename <em>Annual report 2015_.docx, </em>
it transmits one with filename <em>Annual report 2015._docx. </em>Of course, the extension
<em>._docx</em> isn't recognized, so Windows shows it as an 'unknown filetype' as shown in the picture.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/036fe9e4-6bf8-4122-aad2-366789362a84" />The top one has an unknown filetype, while the bottom one has the extension .xlsx indicating
 that it's an Excel file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can avoid this by always checking the filename to ensure that it doesn't have any extra dots in it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a good idea, too, to make sure that you can always see file extensions. To do this,
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd286b6a-073a-4ae2-9997-4f58225b5da4" />&nbsp;+ R, type
<strong>control folders</strong> and press <em>Enter</em>. <br />
This should open the <em>Folder Options </em>dialogue in Control Panel. </li><li>On the <em>View</em> tab, deselect <em>Hide extensions for known file types</em>.</li><li>Close the dialogue.</li></ol>

<h2>            Unknown Software Wants to install</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 64 bit. About every 10 minutes for weeks now, a pop up in the lower right&nbsp;of my monitor keeps saying "Software download complete. Install Now&nbsp; Install Later" The problem is I have no idea what this software is, how to find it or anything
 so I keep clicking Install Later. How do I find out what it is?

            Hi!<br />
<br />
In case it's looking like this: <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcommunity.norton.com%2ft5%2fimage%2fserverpage%2fimage-id%2f39011i5DF805ED91BF6215%2fimage-size%2foriginal%3fv%3dmpbl-1%26amp%3bpx%3d-1" /><br />
<br />
it could be a program called UA.exe. This a Verizon application to support Samsung Android phones.<br />
Or it might be a product of Uniblue.<br />
<br />

                    My laptop freezes about maybe every 20 or 30 seconds for about 10 to 15 seconds. It does not matter what I am doing whether I am on the internet or if I am using some software. &nbsp;I have checked for malware and viruses.&nbsp; I have tried fixes from microsoft.&nbsp;
 I have 60 Gigs of space on my hard drive.&nbsp; I have 1 gig of ram.&nbsp; I&nbsp; deleted programs I do not use. I still have a few. I defragged the hard drive.&nbsp; I cleaned the registry.&nbsp; I used the microsoft disk cleaner and I have tried other things I don't remember. I
 would deeply appreciate any incite and help to solve this problem. Thanks in advance.

<p><br />
"I cleaned the registry." &lt;-- red flag.</p>
<p>Truthfully - it sounds like you have done most things I would recommend to someone trying to clean up their machine.&nbsp; Your best choice now - honestly - is a clean installation.&nbsp; Back up everything you will need (installation media, product keys, your data)
 and cleanly install the operating system, update to the latest service pack, install the newest hardware device drivers *from the individual manufacturers' web pages*, install your antivirus and hop on the Internet to update the other 100+ post-SP3 updates
 for Windows XP before installing any other programs.</p>
<p>I mean - you can run through this list...&nbsp; But you said you do most of it (although with twhat products - who knows.&nbsp; Maybe there is something in here you missed.)</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a></li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find. Rebooting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> to figure out what all is starting up when your computer does/when you log on. Look up anything you do not know about using<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or
 ask here.) You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their own built-in mechanisms is the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources
 without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> to see exactly what is taking up your processor/CPU time and memory. This can help you recognize applications you might want to look into alternatives for and/or get rid of all together.</p>
<p><strong><u>Do some house cleaning and dust off that hard drive:</u></strong></p>
<p>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</p>
<p>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 9GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>
<p>Other ways to free up space..</p>
<p>SequoiaView<br />
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/</a></p>

<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html</a></p>
<p>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used. Then you can determine what to do.</p>

<p>While likely not 100% necessary - it is probably a good idea at this time to make sure you continue getting the updates you need. This will help you make sure your update system is ready to do this for you.</p>

<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Download/Install the latest Windows Installer (for your OS):<br />
( Windows XP 32-bit : <span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloadS/details.aspx?familyid=5A58B56F-60B6-4412-95B9-54D056D6F9F4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WindowsXP-KB942288-v3-x86.exe</a></span> )<br />

<p>and...</p>
<p>Download the latest version of the Windows Update agent from here (x86):<br />

.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />
%SystemDrive%\windowsupdateagent30-x86.exe /WUFORCE<br />
--&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>

<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you<em>may</em> wish to do:</p>
<p>Obtain and install the latest hardware device drivers for your system from the system/hardware manufacturers' support and/or download web site.</p>
<p>If you wish, come back and let us know a little more information about your system - in particular the Make/Model of the system you have - and perhaps someone here can point you to the right place(s) to go to accomplish this. This is not 100% necessary -
 but I would bet that you would gain some performance and features by doing this part.</p>

            Hi Stefan,
<br />
<br />If this a Windows Update trying to install or is it Windows Installer trying to install other 3rd party software
<br />
<br />If it is Windows Update - can you actually get into Windows?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?       
        </p>

<p>Hi.<br />
<br />
It boots up and I can see the Desktop but when the Windows Installer screen appears I cannot do anything else than push "Abort" or press Ctrl-Alt- Del and access the Task Manager.<br />
<br />
Noting else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it is a Win update..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was hoping that I can do something from the Command Promt since I can access that when booting from Safe Boot.</p>

            Hi Stefan, that is definitely not Windows or a Windows Update, some item on your system startup is causing this . . . 
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See if any installer or updater is listed there 
<br />If it is, select it and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list, see if any installer or updater is listed there , uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Restart your System and this annoyance will be gone . . .

            Hi Stefan, 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . .

            Hi Stefan, sorry, I did not realise, you are unable to get into Windows . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally       
        </p>

No luck there either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No System Restore Point, which is very strange.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>When booting into Safe Mode it does just the same thing as when I try to boot normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Installer starts here to and then I'm back in thee loop again.</p>

So I cannot copy any files..</p>

Yes, it could be malware.&nbsp; You need to identify what is issuing this prompt. I suggest running through scans for malware using your anti-virus program and additionally:<br />
Malwarebytes http://malwarebytes.org/<br />
SUPERAntiSpyware&nbsp; http://www.superantispyware.com/<br />
TDSS Killer&nbsp; http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/solutions?qid=208280684<br />
<br />
Also, review startup items in msconfig.&nbsp; You may be able to identify the programs by testing in selective startup or trying to track it in Task Manager.<br />

<p><span><font color="#000000">A-Winlogon.exe, found on all Windows operating systems since the release of Windows XP, authorizes
 users to log into a computer, according to Process Library. This is an essential file and you should not modify it.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Computers running Windows need winlogon.exe running at all times because it allows users to log
 in and out of Windows.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">Process Library reports that winlogon.exe is necessary for a stable computer system, so do not end
 the process.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">B-Dwm.exe assists in displaying the operating system's visual theme and format. The Dwm file is
 responsible for some of the graphic effects in Windows, including live previews, window transparencies and 3-D effects. It also serves to control icons and desktop themes, and offers support for high-resolution graphics. The Desktop Window Manager program
 performs these graphic-based functions every time the user opens a new program window.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">While the Desktop Window Manager assists in smoother graphics and more detailed effects, the amount
 of memory it utilizes can be a concern. As the user opens more program windows, the Dwm.exe program increases its use of the computer's memory, up to several megabytes. As each window opens, the Dmw.exe process uses additional memory to store the window's
 contents. Generally, this only causes an issue if a limited amount of memory is available, or if the user is opening several program windows at once.</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The high amount of memory the Desktop Windows Manager requires may affect other programs. This is
 resolved by shutting down the file when not in use. Although Dwm is a not a virus, it's possible that a malignant virus may hide in the same file name. It's important to keep your anti-virus programs up to date to avoid potential infection.</font></span></p>

    <title>Player Review System not exactly working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Player Review System not exactly working.</h2>
                    
<p>My player review system isn't working well.<br />
<br />
I cannot count how many people are leaving or lagging out of games, or teamkilling/teamviolent, yet they appear with me in the very next game. Nor can I believe how many annoying persons whom I have muted because in the past I didn't want to hear their dysfunctional
 microphone, rap music blaring, high-pitched squaker absurdities, or other problems with people who just don't understand communication is supposed to be a two-way street.<br />
<br />
I work a lot on my player review, a good way to get out frustrations without doing a complaint that wasn't merited. However, I feel like it isn't working for me, regardless of how much I put into it...</p>

<p>"Major Nelson recently explained how the reputation system works in a new Xbox 101 video that appeared on Inside Xbox. Apparently there were many questions about what the stars under your gamertag were for. When you register a new gamertag on Xbox LIVE,
 you start off with a three star rep. This is the default "neutral" reputation. Supposedly, as other players leave positive or negative reviews on you, your star rating will either go up or down to reflect if people like playing with you or if they tend to
 avoid you.</p>
<p>Having previously written an article on the reputation system, I decided to revisit the subject and put rep to the test myself. I created two new gamertags to test whether or not player reviews and reputation actually worked. On one name I was very polite
 and teamwork-oriented while on the other name, I hoarded power weapons, drove erratically in vehicles, and teabagged opponents after killing them. After thirty-five games on each name, the results were surprising.</p>
<p>The "good" name was 100% preferred though this was probably only one or two positive reviews as most gamers don't bother wasting time leaving positive reviews of other players. This is actually one of the major faults with the reputation system as it claims
 that the positive number is an accumulation of those who either preferred you or did not leave a review. If it actually counted players who did not review you, the avoided numbers would be insanely low because how many hundreds of players does the average
 gamer encounter online daily? This wouldn't be a problem if it didn't claim to count people who did not leave any feedback. Despite this glowing percentage, I was still stuck at only three stars. My rep had not moved.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the "bad" name was a whopping 90% avoided (again, this isn't to say 90% of all players, only 90% that left a review) and 10% preferred but had worked its way up to over four stars in rating. Why did the rep rating of the gamertag that got avoided
 go up? This is the exact opposite result of what should have happened. It makes absolutely no sense and this would seem to indicate that the star rating is completely useless in determining the actual conduct of the gamer. Although I never used the headset
 on this name at all, I received several negative reviews for "trash talking" and "disruptive voice" which goes to show that many gamers do not even honestly review a player but simply pick something from the list they think they will be most harmful to their
 reputation.</p>
<p>But what of player reviews? According to the Xbox 101 video and the description of the rep system, avoiding another player will make it less likely for you to be matched up against them in the future. This also did not seem to be true as it was not uncommon
 to see players that I avoided (on either name) again in matchmaking during a future session or even later in the same day. This was on Halo 3 so there were tens of thousands of players online at any given time. With such a huge player pool, there really is
 no excuse for me to be matched again with someone I have already avoided.</p>
<p>Based on these findings, the Xbox LIVE reputation system is severely flawed and does not tell you anything about a player's actual reputation in the community. It seems that your star rating simply increases proportionally with the number of people who review
 you whether they leave positive or negative feedback. The more feedback received, the higher the star rating. Have you ever seen a rep under three stars? Leaving feedback on another player also seems to have no effect on whether or not you will be paired up
 with them in matchmaking again despite claims to the contrary.</p>
<p>As it stands, player reviews are only good for two things. The first is trying to make someone else feel bad when they notice they have a high percentage of avoids. Many gamers who troll on LIVE take pride in this number though so ultimately it becomes pointless
 and a complete waste of time. The second is that it allows you, as the reviewer, to feel better when you believe someone has wronged you. This renewed attitude will be short-lived, however, when you notice you are in yet another game with a player you have
 previously avoided."</p>
<p>from <a href="http://forum.teamxbox.com/showthread.php?t=649006" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forum.teamxbox.com/showthread.php</a> this should explain that it's not only you with a problem on the player REP.</p>
<p>Hope this helped!</p>

<p><span>The problem I have is that I have both an XP and a Widows 7 workstation that I do most of my administrative work from. &nbsp;RMTShare
 works fine on the XP but I can not even get it to install in the windows 7 x64. I've read several article on this, that says that Microsoft does not support the command in an x64 environment. I'm dealing with a production AD that I will not take the chance
 of hurting. If Microsoft says it does not support (trust) an applet then I want to know if I should trust it in a x64 environment and more importantly, how to properly get it running in that environment.</span></p>

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am looking forward to buying an Apple Mac for school business. I find that my current Windows 10 device is pretty fast and performs in an excellent way. I want a Mac just as powerful as my current Windows 10 device. In order to do that, how can I check
 what core my device holds (dual or quad). I hope you guys can answer it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mohammad Aziz</p>

            That keyboard is likely more than 25 years old.&nbsp; Why would you think there would be updated drivers at this point? Assuming the keyboard can be somehow connected to a USB port, it should function.&nbsp; Why would you need a driver?

            I RECENTLY HAD MY NEWER ANTEC TOWER'S MOTHER BOARD, PROCESSOR AND RAM ALL UPGRADED.&nbsp; ON THE PRIOR BOARD I HAD WIN 10 WITH A PS2 KEYBOARD CONNECTOR ON THE BOARD AND IT ACCEPTED THE KEYBOARD WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS.&nbsp; I NOW HAVE A NEW MOTHER BOARD AND I DO HAVE
 A PS2 TO USB ADAPTER THAT WORKS.&nbsp; WHEN I PLUG IN THE OLDER KEYBOARD THE NEWER SYSTEM WITH WIN 10 NOW SERVES UP A NOTICE THAT IT DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE USB DEVICE CONNECTED.&nbsp; YOU ARE JUST ABOUT RIGHT ON THE AGE OF THE KEYBOARD, BUT IT IS BUILT LIKE A TANK AND
 WAS WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS ALL THESE YEARS. &nbsp; ONLINE I SAW A PLACE FOR UPDATED DRIVERS FOR THIS OLDER KEYBOARD, BUT WHEN I TALKED WITH MY MAJOR TECH,&nbsp; HE SAID NOT TO USE THAT PARTICULAR SITE.&nbsp; SOME OF THE NEW GAMERS" KEYBOARDS THAT ARE WIRED AND MECHANICAL WERE
 RATED IN PC MAGAZINE AND I MAY GO TO ONE OF THOSE.

            Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which can ignore.
<br />
<br />You can download Classic Skype and use that.

<p>Hi Noevir_1.</p>
<p>To &nbsp;my Contact List (Family)&nbsp;&nbsp; I added my wife&nbsp; (who has been a Skype Contact (audio and video) &nbsp; for 5 years). I added her from selecting her from the default Skype Contacts List.&nbsp;Until Version &nbsp;7.37&nbsp; only 5 people (the frequently called people on Skype)&nbsp;
 displayed in my&nbsp; :Favourites Contact List' She was one as were my 2 daughters..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under this new version&nbsp;in my Family Contacts List &nbsp; I select Conversations&nbsp; and click on&nbsp;my wife's &nbsp;name&nbsp; and click the Call&nbsp; tab but &nbsp;only the "Pay' option comes up.</p>
<p>YET&nbsp; </p>
<p>when I select Conversations ,click on&nbsp;a &nbsp;daughter (also a 5 years' Skype Contact-audio and video) and&nbsp;click the Call tab &nbsp; both "Pay"&nbsp;and "Skype Call (free)&nbsp; options appear.</p>
<p>I would prefer that the Skype (free) tab option automatically displays for all Skype Contacts..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas&nbsp; on why these 2 long-term &nbsp;contacts would show&nbsp; differently?</p>

<p>I can only assume whatever contacts you are dialing differ in creation or status.&nbsp; It is possible something may have changed recently in your contact list.&nbsp; The below is how it continues to work on the latest 7.x release of Skype.&nbsp; In the past everything
 defaulted to the group call behavior.&nbsp; If anything, the latest versions actually prompt you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Skype 7.40 on my machine.&nbsp; The right click context menus mirror what I see when I click on Call in the top menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempt to perform a call to a Skype contact, I am prompted&nbsp; to select a Skype Call or one of the phone numbers attached to the account.&nbsp; I am unable to proceed otherwise, no matter what route I take.&nbsp; A Skype contact will have the default image of
 a person or a custom image for the contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea305bf6-67d6-43f7-aab0-542d49a33714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea305bf6-67d6-43f7-aab0-542d49a33714" /></a></p>
<p>If I attempt to perform a call to a phone-only contact, I am given only the option to call that singular number contained within that contact record.&nbsp; The phone contact will have the default image of a phone.&nbsp; A custom image is not possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55692c89-7eaa-42b1-bcd7-143db5d1d3e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55692c89-7eaa-42b1-bcd7-143db5d1d3e7" /></a></p>
<p>If I attempt to perform a call to a group containing one phone contact and a Skype contact and the Skype contact is offline, the Skype contact's phone number will be dialed.&nbsp; If the Skype contact is online, the Skype name will be called.&nbsp; There is no way
 to change this behavior short of having that Skype contact remove phone numbers attached to that record along with you having no custom phone numbers attached to that record.&nbsp; If you choose this method, nothing stops you from creating a separate phone contact
 for your loved one(s) to maintain this division.&nbsp; The other option is to check their online status prior to calling them.&nbsp; You can always send a test IM to be sure that contact is online and their status is refreshed in real-time. A group will either have
 an image of a group or a custom image.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35b9dc06-e48a-4253-836a-f1ea6ddedb5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35b9dc06-e48a-4253-836a-f1ea6ddedb5f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempted to dial an imported contact from Outlook or through any other means, that contact would be a phone contact with a phone image.&nbsp; There is no way to make a free Skype to Skype call with a phone contact.</p>

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />Thumbnails in Windows 10 are generated by the default application set to open those files, perhaps an update has broken that file association, of you go to Settings - Apps, is there an option to repair your Corel Painter installation?

<h2>            Gears of War 4 not detecting graphic card Nvidia GT540M</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p><p>I have installed GOW4 in my pc, but the game does not run as it does not detect the graphic card Nvidia GT540M. I&nbsp;also have an integrated card in the laptop, HD&nbsp;graphics 3000, and when running the game a window appears saying i have 0GB VRAM when 2GB is recommended. Then the game stops.</p><p>I have everything up to date (SO, drivers, etc..) and have also changed configuration in Nvidia control panel to use the Nvidia card for the game specifically, and also to use Nvidia for everything. Nothing worked.&nbsp;</p><p>Any idea what's the problem?</p><p>thanks</p>

    <title>Samsung soundbar no longer powering on&#47;off with Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Samsung soundbar no longer powering on&#47;off with Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p><span>HDMI Equipment Chain: Comcast/Cisco RNG200N &gt; Xbox One &gt; Samsung Soundbar HWF450/ZA &gt; Samsung Plasma TV PN51F4500AFXZA&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>In the last 30-45 days my Samsung soundbar stopped turning on/off with my Xbox One. The other devices still power on/off and function as expected. Nothing has been physically moved or changed in regards to the Kinect or the soundbar, however 60+ days ago
 I had to swap Comcast boxes from a Scientific Atlanta to a Cisco (due to a bad DVR in the SA). The Cisco originally had problems with the Cisco box receiving multiple IR messages from the Kinect at once (Channel 49 would be sent as 4499, Channel 396 would
 be sent as 339966 etc). I contacted Xbox support via phone and as informed that thy were aware of the issues with certain cable boxes/IR Funtions and it would be resolved in a future update. The problems with the soundbar did not occur at that time, but instead
 happened around the time the Cisco box/Kinect started to play nice (assuming that the Cisco issue was fixed in an update). I just feel in all technical fairness I should include that information too. After extensive searching online for a fix to the soundbar
 issue I called Xbox support today. I was informed that everything is working properly (even though I lost on/off functionality), that Xbox updates do not contain any Kinect/IR functionality updates, and that this is a Samsung issue. I was instructed to contact
 Samsung which I did, who confirmed my firmware versions, and Anynet+ functionality (i.e. Off for the soundbar and not available at all for my tv).&nbsp;</div>

<div>Here's the other troubleshooting I have done so far.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If I manually power on the sound bar, Kinect voice commands, Xbox Media Remote, and a Xbox Chatpad X1/X2 Buttons (mapped to Vol Up/Vol Down respectively) all work fine so I can only assume the Kinect IR path is clear. I have tried deleting and setting
 up the audio device on the Xbox &nbsp;a few times mo. when the problem originally started with the soundbar the "guide me" function no longer can "find" my soundbar (originally it was the 3rd or 4th code the Xbox tried). If I enter the model manually I regain myfunctions
 as stated above but still have to manually power on/off the soundbar. Samsung Anynet+ is off on the soundbar and my Samsung TV does not have that feature. I have tried disconnecting / reconnecting the Kinect, Kinect troubleshooting/setup, full power cycles,
 different Samsung remote codes entered manually, as well as assuring both Samsung devices' firmware are up to date. I have tested powering on/off the devices with All HDMI cables disconnected to try and confirm there is no HDMI-CEC/IR conflicts. With all HDMI
 cables disconnected the Xbox One will power on via voice, front panel, controller or media remote. The sends a power on signal to the Cable box and tv as expected. With all HDMI cables disconnected if I manually power on the soundbar, I can control volume
 up/down and mute with Kinect Voice Commands, the Xbox Media Remote, and a Xbox Chatpad X1/X2 Buttons (mapped to Vol Up/Vol Down respectively).&nbsp;</div>

<div>I apologize for a long winded explanation/rant and if I have missed any troubleshooting steps any help would be greatly appreciated. I was able to find that this was occurring in early 2014, but Xbox updates then cured the problem. I can only assume this
 is the case and something was possibly missed in the last update(s).&nbsp;</div>

<p>Seconded. All of it. Minus the changing Cable boxes. My Samsung HWF450/ZA was working PERFECTLY up until a couple months ago. The Kinect struggled to find the code at first in the "Guide Me" setup, but inevitably did so, and in turn all functions worked
 as expected. Now, seemingly without any change to the hardware or setup on my end, my Xbox refuses to send power on/off commands to the sound bar. It's quite annoying, and I'm crossing my fingers that whatever was contained in a previous XOS version will be
 restored in a future release. I've not contacted Microsoft about it, as I was assuming I'd get the same response OP did.
