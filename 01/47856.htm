<h2>            Toll Free Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have 60 minutes of Skype calling via a shared Office subscription from a family member. Before I got my shared subscription from my family member, I dialed US toll free numbers (1-800 numbers) and did not have to pay Skype Credit before the call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have the subscription, if I dialed a UK toll free number (0800) would my minutes be used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello guys, I am having the same issue with the game pass ultimate. Here's the only solution I find that works. If you go directly to the Microsoft store app on your PC. You can download all the game pass ultimate games there without any issues or errors
 asking you to resign up.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Ayaz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let's make that program run again in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you uninstall the program again and this time you should also delete the program on the program data folder, Windows registry and clear your temporary folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To delete in Windows Registry:</strong></p>
<p><span>1. Type <strong>regedit</strong> in RUN or Start Menu search box and press Enter. It'll open
<strong>Registry Editor</strong>.</span> </p>
<p><span>2</span><strong><span>. </span></strong><span>Now go to following keys one by one:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE<br />
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you go to the above mentioned keys, look for a key with the name of your uninstalled software. If you find a key, delete it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Empty your Temporary Folder</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To empty Temp folder, type the following one by one in RUN or Start Menu search box and press Enter:<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>%temp%</strong><br />
<strong>temp</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It'll open Temp folders. You can empty them. If Windows shows errors while deleting a few files, leave them. These files might be used by some running software or Windows services.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can also try to ask your program’s developer in their website to ask for steps regarding your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let us know what happens.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Fatal error - RegOpenKeyEx failed</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>About a week ago my Dell Dimension Windows XP machine refused to boot up, stating the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Windows XP could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><span>So
 I started following the instructions at&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545</a>&nbsp;to try and restore the registry. I completed Part One with no problems, but now the computer hangs whether
 entering safe mode or booting up normally. The same error message pops up -&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fatal error - RegOpenKeyEx failed</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>along with another error message related to Creative which I can't see, because neither the mouse nor the keyboard (both USB) work either, and so I can't click to close them. So I'm unable to continue restoring the registry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't find any similar problems reported elsewhere, so I wondered if anyone has any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

Running check disk from recovery console should solve the "Fatal error - RegOpenKeyEx failed" error message and allow you to boot the computer in safe mode. The error you are getting pertaining to the Creative software is probably your sound driver and you
 will need to uninstall it then reinstall. <br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows XP CD into your CD drive and restart your computer. If you are prompted, select any options required to start (boot) from the CD.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
2. When the text-based part of Setup begins, follow the prompts. Select the repair or recover option by pressing R.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
3. If you have a dual-boot or multiboot system, select the installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
4. When you are prompted, type the Administrator password. If you have not set a password for the admin account simply press enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. At the command prompt, type chkdsk /r &gt; press enter. (Note there is a space between the letter k and the forward slash).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
6. At the conclusion of the scan type exit &gt; press enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
7. Restart your computer.<br />

The procedure below is performed from recovery console. The procedure basically consist of performing a system restore. If this method doesn't resolve your issue I would suspect you have only two option remaining. One would be a clean install of Windows. The
 second would be a repair installation of the same. Of course there are tools out there which can be used to perform a system restore in a more easy manner, I cannot direct you to those tools since many contain hacks to otherwise paid software. Microsoft Answers
 strictly prohibits me from including directions to the use of such tools. <br />
<br />
If you have problems performing the below steps you can contact me through my forum linked below and I will attempt to walk you through the steps.
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.repairbotsonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Repair-Bots Online</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The text in bold will be what you type and the other text will be what the system outputs or what is put there by the system. READY, SET, GO.
<br />
<br />
C:\Windows&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">CD C:\system~1\_resto~1 </span><br />
C:\system~1\_resto~1\&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">dir </span><br />
<br />
After you enter the DIR command and hit enter you will get a list of folders like such rp1, rp2, rp3, rp4, etc. etc. The "rp" part of the folder name denoting it's a
<strong>R</strong>estore <strong>P</strong>oint <br />
<br />
What you'll want to do is find the 2nd highest numbered folder in that list. So, for instance, if it listed rp1 thru rp24 you'll want the rp23 folder. I'll use rp23 for the rest of this little fix just to keep things simple but substitute rp23 for whatever
 folder is the 2nd highest in the list on your pc. <br />
<br />
Now, we have more commands.. <br />
<br />
C:\system~1\_resto~1&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">cd rp23 </span><br />
<br />
C:\system~1\_resto~1\rp23&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">cd snapshot </span><br />
<br />
C:\system~1\_resto~1\rp23\snapshot&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">copy _registry_machine_system c:\windows\system32\config\system</span> (read below)
<br />
<br />
Overwrite system [y,n]:<span style="font-weight: bold"> y </span><br />
<br />
1 file copied <br />
<br />
C:\system~1\_resto~1\rp23\snapshot&gt;<span style="font-weight: bold">exit</span> (before typing exit, please remove your Windows XP CD from the CD Drive)
<p>After typing “exit” and pressing “enter” on the keyboard your computer will restart, hopefully into a working machine. If by some chance this did not fix your issue you can either go through this option again and try a different restore point or continue
 with the other options.</p>
<br />

            Thanks for the information, but I couldn't get very far. In the Recovery Console, I tried&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div><span style="font-weight: bold">CD C:\system~1\_resto~1&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />
</span></div>
<div>but it came back: Access is denied.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So looks like a clean install is required :( Thanks again for your help though, much appreciated.</div>

<h2>            Deal breaker for me</h2>
                    
<p>If there is no regional search filter or server list, I wont bother with BF3. Im sick to death of being stuck in servers full of people a full ocean away from me. And the lag in the last weak or so has been ridiculous for me. I mean the game has basically
 been unplayable for the last two or three weeks. So, I think its time to put this game down for good. And my excitement for BF3 has reduced greatly...</p>

<p>It has nothing to do with our connections. I was still getting the same kind of lag when house-sitting for my parents so I know it wasn't my connection. This has been going on for at least the last month and is really getting frustrating. It's getting rare
 to even be put in to a server on home soil anymore. I've on the east coast and have been playing with people as far away as Japan and New Zealand so it's probably a world wide thing going on. Really hope this issue gets fixed soon or there's going to be a
 lot of people not playing this game anymore.</p>

<p>If there is no regional search filter or server list, I wont bother with BF3. Im sick to death of being stuck in servers full of people a full ocean away from me. And the lag in the last weak or so has been ridiculous for me. I mean the game has basically
 been unplayable for the last two or three weeks. So, I think its time to put this game down for good. And my excitement for BF3 has reduced greatly...</p>
[/quote]
<p>DICE&nbsp;&amp; EA&nbsp;are down sizing their severs&nbsp;to make way for BF3 and the Beta due in Sep, that's the reason&nbsp;why there&nbsp;is a lot more&nbsp;lag then usual&nbsp;and&nbsp;not being able to access stats.<br />
<br />
"<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So, I think its time to put this game down for good</span></strong>." your going to find lag in any game you play.</p>

<p>Actually yesterday I did get dash boarded. &nbsp;But it was end of the game we had less then ten tickets on the final crate and we had hard time getting it. &nbsp;Blueberries weren't helping much and we had a 3 man squad. So if we didn't do it it wouldn't happen.
 &nbsp;Just like when we played attackers think we got 95% of the crates. &nbsp;But dinner was ready and I heard the guys say we just lost. &nbsp;Then i'm like yeah dinner getting cold later guys. &nbsp;lol &nbsp;Was great night of gaming until that last map.</p>

    <title>Windows blurry when moving and mouse is jittery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeo sullivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows blurry when moving and mouse is jittery</h2>
                    <p>Basically as the title says but I'll clarify a bit...<br />
</p>
<p>It seems like my desktop is running at about 30fps when I move my mouse. The pointer seems to flicker on and off rapidly as opposed to a smooth motion. Same with dragging windows around, all the text gets blurry.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I only noticed this when watching a random tutorial on Youtube that was recorded at 60fps and dragging windows around looked so smooth compared to my desktop.<br />
My refresh rate is definitely set to 60Hz and I have no trouble gaming or watching videos so I'm guessing it's a windows problem. I have all the latest drivers and no shortage of power: 4790k, 2x970, 12GB ram and an ssd.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't think it's a mouse problem either as it's the same jitteriness when using my Wacom tablet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't flicker if I move the mouse REALLY REALLY slowly... It's been like this for months but I only realised today.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't have any issues with latency (drivers, etc) either..</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC gives no errors!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply,</p>
<p>I've already done this multiple times over the last few months, and I have also used 'Display Driver Uninstaller' to completely remove the old drivers. The issue has been present for a long time now but I only took notice recently when I realised other peoples
 desktops (as in the youtube video) didn't look this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also done multiple installs of W10 clean installs and insider versions and it always seems to be the same.</p>

    <title>Must restart computer every time I unplug my headphones. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windowsuser85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Must restart computer every time I unplug my headphones.</h2>
                    <p>Every time I update Windows 10 something goes wrong... </p>
<p>
</p><p>This time my headphones stop working when I unplug them and try to plug them back into the jack later on. I have to restart the computer for them to work. Previously, a mini-screen would pop up and would let me choose that I want to use my headphones. Now
 this option has disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time, half of my programs stopped working because some file was missing. The time before that my entire desktop was transformed into some green screen with bars around the icons and began working very slowly. At least these two items are now fixed after
 some digging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is becoming a royal pain...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!</p>

<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot

<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.

<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.

            Hi Brent.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible for fixing failed Windows Updates, so that at least something will work before you work through them all: 
<br />
<br />Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />A running log of Update History with known issues is here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619/windows-10-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/446461...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1903 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />

<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I know that the driver is a XPDM driver and that it is not supported since windows 8 but, I was wondering if there is any chance to force install it with some software or hack. I will also like if their is another driver that supports it too</p>

            Hi loz21,<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot the application, you have the option to reset it through Windows Settings before completely uninstalling it.
<br />
<br />
To reset the app, follow this path: <br />
<br />
<em><strong>Start menu &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; </strong>search for<strong> Bingo Blitz &gt;
</strong>click on the app, select<strong> Advanced options &gt; Reset</strong></em><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you might need to uninstall it, then re-download it from the Store.
<br />
<br />
Should you continue to experience the same issue, please contact the software developer of the game.
<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have other concerns.<br />
<br />
Regards.
        </p>

            Based on the additional detail you've stated in your response, loz21, it would be best to contact the game developers or support of the said application for further troubleshooting of this issue.<br />
<br />
You may reach their support by searching through the web, or going to Store, search for the application, then at the bottom part of the page, it will have the link to their website and support site.<br />
<br />
Best of luck. <br />

    <title>Pointless Chat Bans - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ymerej0998  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pointless Chat Bans</h2>
                    <p>Xbox needs to start actually having people checking reports instead of auto-banning accounts. My friend got a week chat ban because he was calling two players out for throwing a competitive gears&nbsp;game, which itself is something you can be reported for. Saying something shouldn't cause an issue sooner than something that ruins a game for other people.</p>

People get chat banned instantly but I've seen people ruining games for others and nothing happening.

            <p>but if your playing a game that is M FOR MATURE AND YOU HAVE ALL YOUR SETTING PUT TO MATURE . Why do people get suspended for cussing in a mature game? Or talking smack in a Mature game FPS??? THAT MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL BECAUSE SOME 23 YEAR OLD COULD DISH IT OUT BUT COULDNT HANDLE IT BACK AND HE REPORTS YOU, YOU GET SUSPENDED AND HE DOESNT WHEN YOUR TRASH TALK WAS CLEAN AS WELL. UT STILL YOU GET SUSPENDED CAUSE HE LIES IN HIS REPORT . YA THAT MAKES ALOT OF SENSE&nbsp;</p>

            <p>and there is auto banning it's impossible for a team to keep up with all the reports they get in a day let's say that 4 million players were online today and just 75000 report are made that day alone. This team goes through every single one of them ya right nothing you say could change my mind either they would get so far behind on the reports it wouldn't even be worth it to put in reports than cause it would take a year or two for them to get to your report&nbsp;</p>

                    Have a Samsung Laptop Model NP-P580-JS01AU have had the hard disk replaced under warranty and have downloaded the Windows 7 updates. Cannot type numbers from the number keys only get symbols even with holding the **** key or not !@#$%^*() this is the numbers
 I get. The numbers pad does not type anything with the Num Lock ON or OFF. The Caps Lock works in reverse ie when ON can only type lower case The . does not work on the keyboard have to use the one on the number pad. Not sure if a software issue or another
 warranty problem. Very frustrating, any suggestions greatly appreciated.

<h2>            Dead Rising 2 Xbox One, Case Zero &#38; West Importing</h2>
                    <p>On the original Xbox 360, you were able to import your saves over to these games to get neat little features however it doesn't seem that you are able to do this on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>I question whether you should be able to play these games and not be able to import a save over if there's something I'm doing wrong or if the "Remaster" broke this type of programming?</p>

<p>I was unable to fix the problem with your suggested solutions above. I then created a different account on my Surface and deleted the old account. I did not experience the problem with the new account until just a day or so ago. I went back and looked at
 programs I had recently installed. I started uninstalling the programs one by one to see if the problem got fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the Dish Anywhere video player from Dish network was causing the problem. Once I uninstalled that program, I no longer experience the screen saver issue. I will notify Dish of the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate Cortana</h2>

</p><p>Windows 10 Home, version 10.0.17134, build 17134</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got it I disabled the locations &amp; Permissions for several apps, including Cortana.&nbsp; I did go into Locations &amp; Permissions and turn her back on.&nbsp; Rebooted, still no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't seem to get her to work and would like to now that I've learned a few things.&nbsp; I guess it's a her, but be nice to have a sexy, voiced guy;)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, Cortana is in my Start Menu List, and I can click on it.&nbsp; It opens another window but it's not the Cortana "dash board" or whatever it's called to set her up.&nbsp; Here are a couple of screenshots of all I get, thank you in advance for any instruction on

            Hi Denise,
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Thanks for repor that to us, it's really important. We would like to help you promptly. 
<br />
<br />Could you please follow the steps below?
<br />
<br />Sometimes The Start Menu, Cortana or the Taskbar may behave in unexpected ways. To resolve you may use the following troubleshooter
<br />
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails you can try re-registering your Start Menu/Cortana
<br />
<br />1. On the search bar, type powershell.
<br />2. From the list, right-click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />3. On the new window that will appear, type the following command: Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
<br />4. Reboot your computer and see if the Start menu will work again.
<br />
<br />
<br />If this does not work you can reinstall by entering the following into the Admin Command Prompt
<br />
<br />$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Cortana).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest
<br />
<br />Press enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"}
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Alternatively, you can follow these 3 methods below:
<br />
<br />Solution 1 – Check the region settings
<br />
<br />According to Microsoft, Cortana is available in USA, UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, and China. Microsoft plans to expand the number of supported countries in the following months by adding support for Cortana to Japan, Australia, Canada (English only), and India (English only). In addition, later this year Cortana should be available in Brazil, Mexico, and Canada (French). If Cortana isn’t working for you, you probably aren’t located in the country that supports it, but there’s a simple trick to enable Cortana even if aren’t located in a country that doesn’t have Cortana support.
<br />
<br />So, here’s what you need to do:
<br />
<br />    Open Settings and go to Time &amp; Language.
<br />    Click on Region and Language from the sidebar.
<br />    Find Country or region option, and select a country from the list that supports Cortana. For example, if you want to use Cortana in English, select United States.Can't find Cortana 
<br />    Save your settings, and that’s it.
<br />
<br />This is a neat little trick that lets you try Cortana even if you’re in a country that doesn’t have support for it. If you country gets Cortana support, you can just repeat the process, but instead of United States, you need to select your original country.
<br />
<br />We have to warn you that changing your Country or region might have some consequences. Don’t worry, it’s nothing drastic, but your default currency might change, time and date format etc. In addition, Windows Store might show you the apps designed for your currently selected country, but you if you need to download an app available only in your country, or make a purchase, you can easily switch it to your original country like we showed before.
<br />
<br />Solution 2 – Check for updates
<br />
<br />Microsoft delivers Cortana updates through Windows Update. So, if there’s something wrong with the virtual assistant, there’s a good chance Microsoft is working on a fix, and will push it through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />To check for updates in Windows 10, go to Settings &gt; Updates &amp; security.
<br />
<br />Solution 3 – Check your Microsoft account
<br />
<br />Just like it’s the case with numerous other Microsoft features and products, Cortana is tightly connected to your Microsoft Account. So, if you’re not signed in properly, you won’t be able to take the full advantage of using Cortana.

<p>besides all of these players also want them near level 50 or level 61 so that means they can't be more than 2 levels away so a level 48 or a level 59 would be almost as good as the maxed out levels.</p>

<p>I am not sure, but it does incorrectly state that weapons at level 48 will be "almost as good" as 50, and the same about 59 compared to 61, which is just flat out wrong. &nbsp;There is actually a pretty significant difference between damages of the weapons at
 those levels that if you are trying to fight level 61 enemies with level 59 weapons, it will be much more difficult that if you were using level 61 gear.</p>

<p>nope your wrong rma...</p>
<p>you can fight enemies that are two levels above you weapon level if you have a decent weapon that is a unique, purple or legendary, but if your fighting a Boss or Invincible you better have a weapon for your exact level because you'll need everything you've
 got to beat them.</p>

            <p>Disable Norton. <br />
Download Microsoft Safety Scanner to scan&nbsp;your computer for virus infections. <br />
It is a free security tool you can run.&nbsp;It works with your existing antivirus. <br />

<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</p>
<p><br />
Once it has run, you should re-enable Norton. If the Microsoft Safety Scaner does not remove the virus, I suggest you contact Norton support since it does find the virus, it just can't remove it.

    <title>Windows restore points not being saved - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows restore points not being saved</h2>
                    There are some _similar_ situations discussed in this forum but I am not sure these exactly cover my situation.<br />
I noticed yesterday more or less by chance that I have no restore points apart from the very latest one.
<br />
<br />
I managed to create a restore point manually and it is visible (actually 2).<br />
In task scheduler there is a schedule to create points daily at 00:00 and at Startup.<br />
I (nearly) always shut my system down overnight.<br />
After startup today, the Task Viewer history shows a new restore point being created at system startup ("Successfully finished")<br />
In event viewer I can see the Volume shadow copy service and MS Software Shadow copy provider service starting and stopping at times consistent with this (no errors apparent)<br />
vssadmin list shadowstorage tells me I have 3.3Gb used 4.5Gb Available 33.7Gb maximun<br />
But no new restore point listed (if I run rstrui)<br />
<br />
I don't know if its ACTUALLY connected, but I suspect a connection to the fac that I manually ran defrag a day or so ago and set the automatic option to "on" for that. Defrag took a very long time and I think I have not run it since who knows when. I actually
 thought I had it on a scheduler.<br />
<br />
Disc has 77Gb free, I do NOT have Spybot (with Teatimer) running - ref other posts. I am (and have been) running Trend Micro Internet security.<br />
I cannot be sure when I last had automatic restore points but they have been there in the past for sure.<br />
I have not switched restore on/off or changed its disc config which I understand could lose me old restore points but would not explain anyway why no new one this am despite the scheduler running it.<br />

            <p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like Windows restore points not being saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps which should assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restore points are saved until the hard disk space System Restore reserves is filled up. As new restore points are created, old ones are deleted. If you turn off System Protection (the feature that creates restore points) on a disk, all restore points are
 deleted from that disk. When you turn System Protection back on, new restore points are created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more about System Restore, visit the link.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The probable cause for the System Restore not to work is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>a The Automatic System Restore point depends upon Task Scheduler service, though Scheduled Tasks will not show System Restore as a job. System Restore Checkpoints may not be created if Task Scheduler service is Stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. System Restore requires the machine to be in an idle state to create system check points. This is by design so that System Restore never intrudes when the user is using the machine by taking processing power to create a system checkpoint. Hence, if system
 restore never sees any idle time on the machine, it will not be able to create System Checkpoints. This usually occurs if an virus scan is running and the anti-virus software is running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. To troubleshoot the issue:</p>
<p>i.&nbsp; Click <strong>start</strong>, type <strong>services.msc</strong> and press
<strong>Enter.</strong></p>
<p>ii. Double click on both <strong>system restore service</strong> and <strong>Task Scheduler service</strong> to make sure the
<strong>startup type</strong> is set to <strong>Automatic.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, visit this link for reference:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more about System Protection, refer to this <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use a dual boot operating system, refer to the<strong> </strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/926185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a><strong>
</strong>and try the steps mentioned in it.</p>

            OK - thanks for the responses but I have a theory now which might be useful to others too.<br />
The default settings in task scheduler (at least in my PC) are to run system restore at midnight every day and at system startup.<br />
Last night I left my PC runnning and it DID create a restore point at midnight. This by the way proves that it is not space which is the problem. It CAN create a restore point both manually and automatically so I am not low on space.<br />
Also, just to confirm, this is not a dual boot machine.<br />
Thanks, however, for the comment about needing to be in idle state this, I think, is the clue.<br />
I have now unchecked the box in "Conditions" which requires the machine to be idle and I will see how this goes on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at the history its not TOTALLY clear but I THINK what happens is this:<br />
I nearly always shut down my PC at night.<br />
When I restart in the morning, it wakes up a bit and tries to begin the startup triggered restore. This cannot actually start because the PC is not idle. Possibly also some dependent services are not yet "up"<br />
It then tries to start the midnight time-triggered restore point which is set to be started as soon as possible after its been missed BUT this is abandoned because the startup one is active and its set to "If the task is already running do not start a new instance"<br />
So then only the startup one continues. This was set to try to run 3 times, every 5mins.<br />
However, I have installed RCs "Startup delayer" some months ago to give me a more gradual and smoother booting experience. But it probably also has been guaranteeing that the restore process never sees an idle machine in those first 15 mins and therefore gives
 up after 3 tries.<br />
Finally ,since the restore points last only 90 days, all my restore points from before I installed that application have been purged!!!<br />
<br />
I will try to satisfy myself that this is actually true but one observation for others is that if your machine is switched off when the time-scheduled restore is meant to take place then, like me, you will always have clashes between the startup and time-schedule
 and you may want to change the default time to when the PC will be running. This may end in 2 restore points per day. but better than none!<br />
<br />
If I am wrong I will post again to correct but have I said anything which is clearly wrong??!<br />
<br />

            Hi again!<br />
All was not totally as I posted above but I am getting closer!<br />
<br />
On the plus side:<br />
Have now changed the System restore task scheduler properties as follows:<br />
In "Triggers": Timed restore point at 15:00 each day (when computer is likely to be on).
<br />
Modified the "At startup" trigger to be actioned with a delay of 1hr i.e not when the PC is anyway loaded with all the other startup actions<br />
<br />
In Conditions:<br />
Removed the condition that computer must be idle (I trust my Quad Core to handle it ;-)<br />
For good measure, removed the "only on AC power" condition. But this is a desktop so no effect from that, I hope!<br />
<br />
In Settings:<br />
Changed to try 5 times (default 3) and at 15min intervals (was 5 I think) just to be more robust<br />
<br />
All of this I think gives a much better config for my system and usage and has now resulted in restores being triggered at 3pm yesterday and at startup today.<br />
<br />
On the downside:<br />
After I changed these settings yesterday, I restarted the PC and on THAT startup, it again showed what looked like a successful attempt to make a restore 1hr after startup (as configured) BUT no restore point appeared. So I am still not convinced that this
 is totally reliable. I am still baffled why that restore point is missing. I saved the event log of it being "done" if someone wanted to take a look. But it looks exactly like the successful runs to me. Just no restore point visible afterwards :-(<br />

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi malavsharma, this may be caused by a device driver, it may also be caused by software with a virtual driver on your system, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .
