<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33; explorer.exe Entry point not found</h2>
                    I restored my computer to an earlier state to undo changes I had made and after the computer restarted and I enter my password I get a message box with the header 'explorer.exe Entry Point Not Found'. Theres a lot of garbled coding of some sort in the
 message and at the bottom I click ok. The message goes away and I'm left with a blank black screen and the mouse arrow. I need help BADLY!! What do I do?

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div><font>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>

<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>

<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>

    <title>Xbox Elite Controller to Windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nit pik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Elite Controller to Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    
<p>As the Subject says. My XOne elite controller doesn't connect to my PC anymore since I upgraded to Windows 10. I would rather use a usb cable to connect to it. The device manager doesn't show it either. I plugged in my controller to my PC and the controller
 vibrates but nothing happens after that.</p>
<p>I really wanted this to be an easy fix with chat support or a phone call. Plus, I'd really rather not make a forum post about this. It doesn't seem very personable.</p>

<p>Interesting. I have Windows 10 running on a Boot Camp partition on my Macbook Pro, and plugging in the Elite controller using a USB cable automatically connected it to the computer. I even used the streaming feature in the Xbox app with no issues. Drivers
 for the controller should be included in the most recent Windows 10 updates, so make sure that everything is up to date and try again?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on our findings, the issue is caused by the <strong>ntroskrnl.exe</strong>. This is a shortened version of Windows NT operating system kernel, a fundamental component of the OS. This driver is in charge of several high-level processes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also means that something else caused the issue with <strong>ntroskrnl.exe</strong> being the affected driver. In this case, the best thing we can do is to follow the instructions in this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17074/windows-7-resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should no longer experience blue screen issues after performing the steps. Otherwise, let us know and we'll gladly help you further.</p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Having Trouble Connecting&#63;&#38;quot&#59; Pin on home screen and Random Restart</h2>
                    
<p>After power cycling my console the "Having Trouble Connecting?" Pin appeared again. I am currently on the preview dashboard update OS version: 6.2.11653.0 (xb_rel_1410.141009-1648) fre. I didn't have enough time to check if I was
 actually online or not because upon having my controller plugged into the console via the provided micro usb cable, my controller became unresponsive even though the home button light was on. After trying to move the left stick to navigate the menus, my console
 just decided to shut off and turn back on. I am now operating the console and it is working okay (for now). I will not plug in my controller to the console while trying to play normally, but if needed i will do so for diagnostic purposes. This pin has been
 showing up on my home screen for the past week or so. After the 24 hour friends list issue on October 13th, 2014, I don't believe there has been an update but besides that very hindering issue everything else appears to be functioning normally.</p>
<p>My second major issue is that my Turtle Beach XO7 headset is almost always plugged in. Upon exiting parties or coming back to the console, all of the audio coming through to the headset is off until I either power cycle the console
 or sometimes unplug the headset which works (sometimes). My friends which have other headsets such as Astro A50's and even the standard xbox one chat heaset have similar issues with their audio turning off randomly. These issues are huge and I'm submitting
 as much detail as I can so hopefully we can cooperate to get these things fixed, one day making the xbox one as smooth and flawless as the xbox 360.</p>

<p>But as you are on the preview dashboard and all your issues may be related to that please go ahead and post your problems on the preview forums
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a> as this is the right place for this and you may get better support by the developers right there.

            The cause for this problem seems to be third party shell extensions. To get rid of culprit extension, you can download ShellExView. ShellExView is a free third-party application that can be used to manage, disable and enable all of the shell extensions that you have on your computer
<br />
<br />Download ShellExView - <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.zip</a>
<br />
<br />Extract the zip file
<br />
<br />Launch ShellExView by right-clicking on the application named shexview and clicking on Run as administrator
<br />
<br />You will be met with a list of all the shell extensions installed on your computer once the program is done compiling it. Once you see the list, click on Options &gt; Filter by Extension Type &gt; Context Menu.
<br />
<br />In the newly compiled list, you will see entries that have pink backgrounds. All of these entries are shell extensions installed on your computer by third-party applications.
<br />
<br />Hold down the Ctrl key and click on each of the “pink background” entries to select them.
<br />
<br />Once all of the “pink background” entries have been selected, right-click on them and click on Disable Selected Items to disable all of them.
<br />
<br />Click on Options &gt; Restart Explorer. Try right-clicking on your Desktop, and File Explorer should no longer crash.
<br />
<br />Once you have fixed the problem, next comes identifying the culprit and disabling it for good. To do so, you are going to have to:
<br />
<br />Right-click on any one of the “pink background” shell extensions that you disabled and click on Enable Selected Items to enable it.
<br />
<br />Click on Options &gt; Restart Explorer, right-click on your Desktop and see if File Explorer
<br />
<br />If File Explorer does not crash, keep on repeating steps 1 and 2, enabling a different third-party shell extension every time, until File Explorer crashes and you start experiencing the problem again.
<br />
<br />The third-party shell extension you enabled just before the problem returned is the culprit. You can go ahead and enable all of the “pink background” shell extensions you disabled except for this one as this one is the culprit. Keep this shell extension disabled for good – in fact, it is recommended that you uninstall the third-party application that installed this shell extension on your computer altogether.

            <p>Hi Colker,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows 8 by default there&nbsp;are no UpperFilters&nbsp;or LowerFilters values at that registry key so you could remove the LowerFilters value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remove the LowerFilters value right-click LowerFilters and select Delete, confirm the delete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a System Restore Point beforehand and restart the computer afterward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterwards&nbsp;if you&nbsp;find a program that uses the CD/DVD drive does not function correctly reinstall the latest version of that program&nbsp;making sure the program is compatible with Windows 8.</p>

<p>Olá! Gostaria de saber como faço para desativar a opção de vibração do Controle do XBOX 360 para PC. Pois alguns jogos que eu jogo não fornecem a opção para desativar essa função, e isto me atrapalha. Ficarei muito agradecido à quem puder me ajudar, pois
 eu quero usar meu controle e preciso desativar essa função!</p>

<p>Olá Daniel. em Configurações do Sistema/Console há uma opção destacada como "Preferências"; lá você vai deixar pré-configurado algumas coisas em jogos, como a câmera inicial de jogos de corrida, volume de microfones e fones de ouvido, status online e inclusive
 se a vibração do controle ficará ativa ou não.</p>
<p>Se houver mais dúvidas, comente. </p>

            <p>Hi RLPalmer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and we are glad to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I can understand, you are finding it difficult to use mail app in Windows 8 as you are unable to read the contents of some of your emails.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your feedback and I will definitely pass on the information to the concerned department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assist you further, I would like you to answer few questions:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you able to see the contents of the email in your webmail?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What kind of emails are you not able to see?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that there is no such settings in Windows 8 mail app where in you can change the settings to see the contents of the email. Windows
 8 will not open the emails which it will detect as a spam<span>&nbsp; </span>
or defective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. For further Windows related issues feel free to get back to us.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this occuring with a Gmail account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a known issue in with the way Gmail sends inline images in messages recieved from Gmail accounts that use Exchange ActiveSync to sync email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you using a Gmail account and are not using it for contacts in the People app or calendars in the Calendar app, You may be able to address this issue by removing this account and adding it in again as an IMAP account from Settings -&gt; Accounts -&gt; Add an
 Account -&gt; Other account -&gt; IMAP.</p>

@ RLPalmer</p>

<p>You should not have marked the post you are responding to as an Answer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing that means that you are satisfied that your question has been answered and that this thread can be ignored by responders, in particular by the first responder whose questions
 you may have been answering by this response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW where is "webmail"?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that Hotmail or some other HTTP E-mail server?&nbsp;&nbsp; One possibility might be with Hotmail that you would need to have Silverlight installed to see some of its features.&nbsp;&nbsp; But you probably cannot have Silverlight in the new Modern
 UI (Fullscreen) Mail app.&nbsp;&nbsp; In that case, I suspect your chosen workaround would be the best solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a procedure that you can think of which would reproduce your symptom, e.g. constructing a post on Hotmail and E-mailing it to yourself and then opening it using the new Mail app, that would probably be the best way to see if that idea is on the
 right tack and perhaps help you find a workaround for such cases which would not require use of a different E-mail client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a common fault that affects some BT users, as a quick check of their <a href="https://community.bt.com/t5/Email/Error-quot-The-mail-server-responded-Too-many-messages-quot/td-p/1311125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums</a> will reveal. It may be that you have in fact sent too many messages, but it's just as likely that it's an over-aggressive setting at the server that's causing the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, BT only allow their own customers to use their SMTP servers, while you appear to be connected to the Internet via TalkTalk. The first thing to check, then:&nbsp; right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Servers</span><span> tab,&nbsp;</span>ensure that
<em>Advanced</em> tab to 587, then try again. After each change, remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane), then compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself (i.e. from the BT account
 to the same account). Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply. You can click on an error message to select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it into the text entry box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These troubleshooting steps are essential if we're to rule out account settings as the cause of your problem. We may need to make more changes if you're still unsuccessful.</p>

    <title>Asus q200e, Drivers, BSoD, BAD_POOL_HEADER, update failure, don&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruthielarubia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus q200e, Drivers, BSoD, BAD_POOL_HEADER, update failure, don&#39;t know where to start&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have never posted in a tech forum before so please be patient and let me know if you need further information. I am at my wits’ end!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got an Asus q200e with i3 processor back in January with Windows 8 preinstalled. It doesn’t have a CD/DVD drive. A few weeks into using it, it started trying to install updates and failing to do so, with the computer stopping me doing what I was doing,
 trying, failing, and then uninstalling the updates, leaving me with the BSoD and the whole process taking about half an hour. I eventually stopped shutting it down and just put it to sleep instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when it does this I get the error BAD_POOL_HEADER. So far to fix this I have tried refreshing (not reinstalling) Windows 8, looking online for updates, booting it in safe mode (but I don’t really know what that does) and searching endlessly on
 forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also think I may need some drivers for the Asus, but I haven’t yet found a satisfactory answer about what exactly these are and which ones I need. The Asus website has over 60 for my computer….can someone tell me, do I need to download all of them? One
 by one? Surely that will just clog things up more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I can think of is that Windows 8 is not compatible with something I am using like my Kaspersky antivirus. Gmail is also a nightmare with this computer, constantly giving messages like “something’s not right”….well thanks Gmail, I could
 have told YOU that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have given a good description of the problem and I truly appreciate any help you can offer. There are similar questions on here and other forums but I have not found anything that helps me identify where the problem is originally coming from. In
 other words, where do I start…drivers? Windows 8? The Pool Header thing? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many, many thanks</p>

            <p>Hi ZigZag</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say remove it, do you mean the whole Kaspersky programme? I have downloaded the zip you sent, but I am a little hesitant to do this as I have always found it to be excellent and I feel a little nervous about just relying on the built in defenders
 (the ones that come with WIndows Defender).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would hate to leave myself open to viruses/attacks. I wonder if Kaspersky do a version that is compatible with Windows 8 (or 8.1 when I upgrade) and won't corrupt the memory. I will check that now, but do you have any thoughts/experience on that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, referring back to my OP, do you have any advice around downloading these mysterious drivers please? I am thinking they are actually separate from this BSoD issue but I still don't know if I should download all 60 of them, or how to work out what
 I need (if any).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your ongoing help,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I do indeed mean remove it ALL.&nbsp; Kaspersky is one of three malware applications that cause FREQUENT BSOD'S and freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't trust defender you can use any other malware app of your choice EXCEPT&nbsp; McAfee &amp; Symantec as these also contribute to crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding drivers you need to download the ones that are relevant to your specific computer and only download them if they are old, corrupt, or causing you problems.&nbsp; I would need more specific info to be able to give you a better answer in this regard.</p>

    <title>Miracast unable to connect windows 10 laptop to android tv - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akannankeril  say:</h3>
<h2>            Miracast unable to connect windows 10 laptop to android tv</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Lenovo U41-70 laptop (Windows 10) with core i5 processor. Display drivers are Intel HD graphics 5500 and NVidia GeForce 920M</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to connect with a generic Android smart TV which supports miracast (i have no problem in casting my Samsung Galaxy S5 with it). Windows recognise the TV as "SMART TV videos" when it searches for wireless display. it actually connects with it
 and the TV displays "Miracast Connecting..." but after a few seconds disconnects without showing any pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My refresh rate is 60hz and had an issue initially by connecting the TV (which was only &nbsp;59hz) &nbsp;through HDMI and had to tinker with the settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            If this is a domain member computer, you have DNS set incorrectly. See your IT Dept.<br />
<br />
If this is a home computer, something you have starting with Windows is slowing things down. It could be legitimate or it could be malware. Since you haven't provided any information about your computer, start with the basics of troubleshooting:<br />
<br />
The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
After you are sure the computer is virus/malware-free - and <strong>ONLY</strong> after you've done this - if the problem persists manage your Startup:<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
</span><br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad). If possible, have all your data backed up before
 you take the machine into a shop.

<p><strong>Do you enjoy doing police-work?</strong> <strong>
Or maybe pretending to be cops and crooks in free modes with your friends?</strong> Then LC 911 is for you! Our clan was started in 2011 by
<strong>Epsilon Vi, Wulfzz213, and Duane1344</strong>, and we have a grand total of 16 members, and we plan to have events weekly! Our clan offers multiple divisions and license-ships for those who are interested. Our motto is to "To protect with courage, To
 serve with compassion" and we live by it. We are not the best clan, and no one is. Every clan has it's flaws somewhere down the road, but we like to cooperate with our members and staff, to help resolve our weaknesses. Our officers know the meaning of Respect,
 Responsibility, Integrity, and Honesty, and they live by it each time they patrol with us. However, we are not just another police clan, as our clan offers other game modes and types for GTA IV/BOGT, such as zombie modes, AI police wars on free mode, racing
 for fun, etc. Here's a brief description of each of our divisions/licence-ships, so feel free to read them!</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong>Aviation Air Corps
</strong><em>(aka Air Corps)</em> <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a division in our clan that involves highly trained officers to take on the roles of every day police pilots to assist not only the police department, but Fire/EMS, SWAT and other divisions that
 are involved in every day police work.&nbsp;Police helicopter pilots allow law enforcement professionals to conduct airborne surveillance, as well as respond quickly to crime scenes in minutes or less. They are even able to pursue speeding vehicles and alert patrol
 officers of a suspect's location, allowing patrol cars to follow at safe speeds and prevent injury to civilians. Some of the functions of our Aviation division are to quickly look over neighborhoods or cities to pursue a criminal, to aid patrol officers during
 vehicle pursuits, to assist SWAT with lifting to high buildings that criminals may be on, &nbsp;and experienced pilots may be called to help the fire department put out wildfires or building fires, or EMS to transport patients to the hospital faster.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>S.R.T. Special Response Team</strong>
<em>(aka SWAT)&nbsp;</em></span>is a team of extraordinary individuals who resolve high-risk tactical situations. They are the highest trained unit of a police department, right next to the detective agency. an S.R.T member’s special training and flexibility allows
 the S.R.T team to tackle hostage situations, search and rescue operations, covert and undercover tactical operations, crowd control, rural searches and many other high-risk circumstances.They work in unison with the detective agency to solve crimes that ordinary
 police can not. They are trained in fire-arms, as well as tactical grenades.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 153, 102, 1)">Detective Agency (aka DA)</span></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;is an elite unit of certified people who investigate homicide, robbery, burglary, auto theft, organized crimes, missing persons, juvenile crime, fraud,
 narcotics, criminal intelligence, aggravated ****/battery, sexual ****, computer crime, domestic violence, surveillance, and arson. They also investigate crimes such as kidnapping, extortion, espionage, and sabotage. To carry out their jobs, they talk
 to witnesses, observe the activities of their suspects, do research, and participate in raids.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Fire &amp; EMS</span></strong> is a courageous group of individuals who help the civilians of Liberty City. The fire fighter aspect of this division involves the protection of life and property by combating,
 extinguishing and preventing fires.&nbsp;The job of fire fighters involve extremely difficult physical work as well as the skill to apply previously acquired knowledge to work effectively as part of a team in emergency situations. This includes saving people from
 burning buildings, applying the jaws of life to remove victims from a totaled vehicle, and to aid people who are suffering from a health disorder. The EMT aspect of Fire/EMS&nbsp;functions as a primary care provider in the pre-hospital development. They are responsible
 for care of the sick or injured.&nbsp;The paramedic provides both basic and advanced life support, including comprehensive patient assessment, invasive airway management, cardiac monitoring and administration of medications. The paramedic is frequently in a leadership
 role working with a small team of lesser-trained prehospital care providers.</p>
<p><strong>Our clan offers license-ships as well, which basically means that you learn it, and you are done. The above divisions actually involve more leveling such as seniority or experience.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 102, 1)"><strong>Advance Driving School (A.D.S.)</strong></span> is a license that officers with the rank of&nbsp;lieutenant and up can participate in. This license gives you the right to drive the police stinger and
 the police bike during clan events. These officers have the special ability to be the lead unit during pursuits, as well as using the bike in back alley ways to set speed traps.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">State Trooper (S.T.)</span></strong> is a license that basically gives you the right to drive the dodge charger, to patrol out of beats (sections) during events, and training to be a certified patrol
 host and Patrol C.O.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong>Crook Department License (C.D.)</strong></span> gives people the right to be a civilian during clan events. They are mainly known as the ones who cause trouble through out Liberty City, and they
 come up with crazy scenario's to keep the police busy, such as hostage situation, car pursuits, drug deals, suicide jumps, and more.</p>
<p><strong>F.A.Q.</strong></p>
<p><em>I am currently in a police clan like this, but I would like to stay involved with your clan, so how can I go about doing this?</em></p>
<p>Our clan offers an <strong>ambassador program, which basically means, our clan is friendly with your clan.</strong> We work and have clan events together some times, and we have had positive outcomes of the ambassador program from
 other police clan leaders. We work to be friendly with police clans, as clans do not want drama. More information about ambassador guidelines and how to become one is located on our forums.</p>
<p><em>I would like to join your clan, but I am not going to be a very active patrol officer because of work and school, so can I stay in your clan?</em></p>
<p>Of course you can! <strong>Our clan has reserve officers, basically people who can not be that active but want to stay in our clan</strong>, and come to events 2 or 3 times a month. You have the same rights as a regular patrol officer,
 and you will not be removed from our clan because of your activity. More information about this can be found on our forums.</p>
<p><em>How often do you guys patrol? and at what times?</em></p>
<p>We aim to patrol on <strong>Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Our times range from 6:30PM EST to about 9:30/10:00PM EST. On the weekends we like to start around 7:30PM EST to about 10:30/11:00PM EST</strong>.
 Our clan has a lot of people who have to work or go to school, so we aim for the time between dinner and the time that most people go to sleep. Sometimes our officers may host events during other days of week, or different times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link to our forums, please feel free to look around and register if you would like. If you have any questions, please send them to me in any form you would like. To the people that strongly dislike our clan, please refrain
 from posting in our recruitment post, as it only makes yourself look ignorant, and if you decide to post, I will contact a moderator to remove your post.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Printer Problems With MS10</h2>
                    Just purchased a new laptop with MS10.&nbsp; Alas, my 3 year old printer which was working fine, now does not print.&nbsp; I have downloaded the Ricoh driver for MS10X64 which I am running on.&nbsp; The system sees the printer, but test documents&nbsp;print with alien hieroglyphics
 instead of English.&nbsp; The Print Manager under devices and printers states "no driver" and "driver not available" despite my downloads. &nbsp;Any suggestions or troubleshooting advice?&nbsp;

            <p>I have followed through several pages and finally got my new devices to recognise my HTC but it is greyed out.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to enter the pairing code but although it tells me to enter the number on my device keypad (I do) it doesn't say which one.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
 I do it on the phone key pad I have to click on 'call' and get told there is no such number.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I enter it on the text keypad and press 'enter' nothing happens at all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot bring up a keypad without opening some sort of programme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry to be so
 stupid</p>

            <p>Hi Vinay,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that&nbsp;you've got brightness issue in your ideapad.<span> The issue could be if the drivers are either not updated or get corrupted. So, I would suggest you to update the touch and display drivers and check if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could also arise due to outdated drivers that might not be compatible with Windows 10</span><span>. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important one but optional too. If any available try to install them
 and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the&nbsp;display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to: Install and Update drivers
 in Windows 10</span></span></a></strong></em><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the Lenovo website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />

            <p>I am running Windows 10 64 bit&nbsp;on my Lenovo Z400 and the registry edit below worked for me.&nbsp;I am also running the latest Intel 4000 graphics driver that I downloaded and installed from here:

https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/81499/Intel-HD-Graphics-4000-for-3rd-Generation-Intel-Core-Processors</a>&nbsp;I installed the driver first but not sure if that is important. Hopefully a windows update does not mess any of this up.</p>

<h2>            Creators Update 1703 15063.13 network card does not exist</h2>
                    <p>My laptop runs Windows 10 Pro 1607, build 14393.969. It works very well all drivers are running and up to date.</p>
<p>Yesterday In upgraded to 1703, build 15063.13. Within half an hour or so the installation was completed. But after that, my wifi and external display no longer worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used an external wifi dongle to get back on the internet and checked for updates. No updates found.</p>
<p>I uninstalled both devices and rebooted - &nbsp;a couple of times. No luck. &nbsp;I went to the intel site and reinstalled drivers for my network card there. This seemed to do something, but in the Device Manager I saw the device had failed. &nbsp;I searched for solutions
 but found none. I reverted back to my previous Windoes 10 version, swiftly and without any problem. Wifi and video card are working like before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the new Creators Edition of Windows 10 no longer support hardware like my card below?</p>
<p>Is it not strange that this new version of Windows reports that network card device "does not exist"?</p>
<p>Any ideas to solve this?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>BTW, in my current/old version of Windows 10, the network card works well and reports like this:</p>

            <p>Hi André,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Sager NP9261. Yes it is old and the manufacturer does not tell anything about compatibility wit Windows 8, 8.1 or Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, the system currently runs Windows 10 Pro anniversary update perfectly an just out of the box. Meaning I did not have to tweak anything to make it work until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Creators Edition, 1703 - 15063.13 installed smoothly, and does not report any errors. It works. However, it has a problem with a very common network card, the Intel Centrino Ultimate N-6300 AGN. It seems to have a software conflict somewhere. As
 I said, my laptop can connect to the internet with an external usb-adapter. But I just want it to work with the Intel N-6300.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What shall I do?</p>
<p>

<p>Let's try if rolling back your drivers might help. Follow the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you probably know, the list only holds about 10 brands, that does not really help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my first post I told that my computer runs the AE very well. In April and in September I did forced installs of CU. In both cases my system passed the (very basic) compatibility test and in both cases installation went fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that WiFi did not work and the device manager had about 5-10 yellow flags indivating device driver problems-. All device drivers were and are up to date. WiFi does not work, I had to use an external dongle. I do not see ways to rollback drivers, updating
 always reports that the latest driver is already installed, uninstalling devices does not change anything. I even physically removed my wifi card but replacing it after a few reboots did notchenge anything either. No fixes here, I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the CU make changes in device registration (registry) that cripple my system. Should I save parts of the AE-registry and restore it after installing the CU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not unimportant, after rolling back to AE, everything was working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
