<h2>            Microsoft Windows 10 running slow after plugged in..</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I have an issue that has been going on for quite a while now and I was wondering if you guys can help me.
</p>
<p>So, I got this laptop (Windows 10) in about August for my school work and the charger worked fine then. In October, my laptop started to run slow every time I would plug in my charger. Things like videos, games, and websites started to run slow. I know for
 sure that this is the right charger because it came with the laptop. I don't think that the charger is the problem though because it would charge my computer normally. It is the computer that runs slow while being charged. Also, I know it can't be the internet
 because the internet works just fine when it is not being charged. I would go to a place to get it fixed, but the price would be too much. Can someone tell me what to do to fix this problem already?<br />
~Emily<br />

<h2>            Delete pictures of Photos app live tile</h2>
                    Original title: Deleting Photographs Off "Photos"<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
There's pictures from Facebook that have downloaded onto my laptop and has appeared the "Photos" app, seeing as I use this laptop for school and not just at home, I'd rather not have some photos on the app (or on y laptop at all), as on the home screen it does
 a slideshow of the photos on the app icon. I've tried my hardest but I cant seem to work out how to delete them? They aren't in Libraries ---&gt; Pictures, only the "Photos" app.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Same here. Since the last update the media player app keeps crashing after 40 minutes or so of watching videos. Mkv, mp4 it doesn't matter. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice. Still didn't help. My usb drive videos work fine on the Xbox 360. I'm gonna try the suggestions from mister beep.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>tried all that. Reformatting worked but for a short time , one movie. My usb stick works fine on 360, ps3, and ps4. I hope Microsoft is looking into this. The Nov. update screwed something up. I never had media player issues until now and this is my third xbox1.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hey there Mister Beep, nice to see an official response in one of these threads all about the same issue, there's actually a more recent one which outlines the specifics of this bug, which is pretty much confirmed and easy to reproduce, both me and my friend have confirmed it happens whether on Xbox One X or Xbox One S, it's as easy as getting any .m4v video file (H.265 video + AC3 audio) and set it to play... after about 25 minutes or so, media player will hard crash, every time, there is no way to resolve this, even hard-resetting the console and deleting all apps makes no difference... something happened with the Nov 16 Update that has basically BROKEN media player this way. Note that this problem does not seem to affect playback of other file formats, such as .mkv within media player, it only seems to affect files which have a .m4v or .mp4 file suffix, which is effectively every single video that I've ever encoded onto my external drive, and I&nbsp;used to quite enjoy being able to just

<h2>            HP Printer driver reinstalled after reboot</h2>
                    
<p>I have an HP F4180 printer with the most current driver installed. Vista is SP2. Every time I reboot the system Vista creates another copy of the printer in the printer folder and then reinstalls the driver.&nbsp; This printer copy becomes the default printer
 and is named 'HP Deskjet F4100 series (Copy 1)'. The next reboot creates Copy 2 and so on.</p>

<p><span>Hello JimofDC,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might try backing up any software or driver for this printer then use the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility to remove the Hp software from your computer.
 You could then reboot your computer and retry installing the printer as a fresh install. I have included a link below for the Installer Cleanup Utility.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this process does not resolve the issue you may need to contact the manufacturer of your printer to determine if there is some kind of problem with the
 software that is causing the printer to reinstall itself.</span></p>

    <title>Creators update, where is it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottyboy99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creators update, where is it&#63;</h2>
                    are people still waiting on creators update to be offered on windows update? My machine got the preceeding privacy settings kb back on 4th july and i reviewed the settings. Yet 6 weeks later and it still isn't coming through windows update. I am still
 on v1607. It seems this roll out is taking far far too long as some friends and family are also still waiting. It is not like any of us run obsolete hardware. My machine has skylake cpu, SSD drive, nvidia 980ti so it is pretty modern. I just dont understand
 why its so delayed getting it. All previous feature updates were offered shortly after release (and i get all the v1607 cumulative/security updates without any issues) but the creators roll out seems pretty shambolic. We are not far away from another fall
 creators update being released but many still await the first creators update. I know upgrade assistant can force the update but i guess the point is - windows update/ms servers are not doing their job. Many users who are not informed

            Thank you. I am aware of the method. But my gripe is why isn't windows update pushing it. The roll out is an epic fail on microsofts part. If windows update does not push it then the vast majority will not move onto the creators update. Exactly how long
 is this 'phased' roll out supposed to last. It seems to be far far too slow and leaves me wondering if windows update has not pushed it by now then will it ever? Someone from microsoft needs to explain exactly what is going on

<p>... lasts until the next version upgrade is pushed, so you have a while - at least 4-8 more months. &nbsp;The Fall Creators Update will be put out then the official CB status will go into effect ~3 months later and that is when this current push to 1703 will
 end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why some people are so anxious and need answers like this if everything is ok with their current system. &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ago, a lot of people I help with their home / personal systems got pushed the update automatically. &nbsp;Perhaps it is somewhat geographic / public IP range based / install time based, or maybe other things have been detected on your system and
 you will be informed of them as things get closer to the next push.</p>

<p>.... Alarm Bells? &nbsp;For what?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That 20 days ago Microsoft made Creators Update <strong>fully available</strong> to everyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That one of the first links in that article detail out what I alluded to with the "Creators Update" --&gt; "Fall Creators Update" schedule thing and how they release these updates with the three month or so period of targeted pushes before making it more widely
 available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think if you read that article you linked and everything it links to, things are fairly clear. &nbsp;Just because you (or anyone else of the millions upon millions) hasn't been automatically upgraded to the next release in the first 20 days of "full availability"
 where one of those weeks involved is a normal patch week (second Tuesday of every month - like clockwork) seems perfectly fine to me; what alarms you about it? &nbsp;The given SaaS schedule reminiscent of OS X / MacOS for an operating system or...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you are still sitting and waiting after Christmas: that might be cause to take advantage of the "full availability" and self-manage that complex device yourself. &nbsp;:-)</p>

            I am not sure i appreciate your tone. It seems like you are talking down to me. Current branch, current business branch, olive branch, branch this, branch that. It does not make alot of sense. All i know is i am frustrated windows update is not pushing
 it to our modern gaming pc, yet our old decrepit one got it months ago. I do not understand why the privacy kb came 6 weeks ago yet we still wait. I know full well how to force the update but i maintain windows update should be doing its job

<p>Then you are reading into things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are are having a discussion where you and I don't necessarily see the same thing and I am asking you to explain to me what you see while I use the articles you have linked to not only explain my side, as I see things, but ask you to clarify specific points
 &nbsp;we do not seemingly see eye-to-eye on so we can better understand each other and come to perhaps a consensus about what is going on and how it could be better explained to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point is that this is far from worth the level of concern you seem to be giving it. &nbsp;Full availability is only 20 days in. &nbsp;So what if one of your systems got it and the other did not - they are not identical system and their age may or may not have anything
 to do with anything. &nbsp;Could be that the older system has less running, less going on, etc. and that was detected and thus, it was upgraded. &nbsp;Could be just a random roll of a million sided die.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this will be the new norm. &nbsp;Every 18 month or so, a new edition/build of Windows 10 with new features will be released. &nbsp;It'll go thru this "hey, look at me" period where people can get it, but it is not 'generally available', meaning individuals
 may have to do something to get it. &nbsp;During that ~3 month honeymoon period, likely in the last two to four weeks, something similar to the privacy thing will be installed and it will ask the users some stuff, suggest some things and likely quietly scan and
 report. &nbsp;Then, general availability day will come and over the next ~15 months, said upgrade will be available and trickle out to millions upon millions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It's not a BOOM - every computer gets it at once situation. &nbsp;Millions of computers mean billions of variables and new things will likely still be learned every time one of these trickle out and if a few thousand people have similarities and it is discovered
 those cause issues, then the issue might be caught and remedied during the rollout (opposed to after) with only a few dozen being affected because of the extended time and meticulous nature of the rollout: so much the better. &nbsp;This is similar to Mac and OSX
 only in idea, the design is more complicated because Windows users have more choice about their hardware and even software - increasing the variables that can muck up the works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as one is running either the current branch or the version before the current branch: they are running a current supported OS (getting patches.). There's also a "grace period" in there of about 3 months where they could be as far back as three branches
 of the major releases and still be fine. &nbsp;So, one could run a individual build of Windows 10 ~ 3 years and 3 months and know they were still getting security patches. &nbsp;Also, going to the next build(s): free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, will their hardware possible get to builds they cannot upgrade to? &nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p>I would like to apologise for a touchy response. I am frustrated at how slow the roll out is. But i guess your right, there is no hurry. My system is ticking along just fine. I hope it will be pushed eventually, my worry has always been why it has not. What
 does MS not like about my machine which was only bought latter 2015 and is still a strong gaming desktop. Unfortunately am a stickler for things working as they should which is why i want windows update to do the job. I may eventually give into using the upgrade
 assistant but will wait it out for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really dislike the policy of frequent big feature updates as i feel its over the top. Especially as it defaults some settings. I cant believe everytime a feature update comes through system restore is turned off. This vital feature should be on by default
 and certainly any updates should respect a users settings. Also it feels like too much roulette playing with expensive machines with such frequent changes being pushed out. So i dread the update but because i know its out there in the wild i dont want my machine
 to be left behind. If it does not come i worry at some stage certain apps/software may become windows v1703 and above only.</p>

<p>Hey Wayne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working with a lady here in the Community Forum that just received the 1703 Creators Update this morning 8-17-17&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She is happy as a lark now because previously her Windows updates were failing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's rolling out day by day.</p>

<p>I cannot disagree with the sentiment about the feature upgrades.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The build you are likely on (1607) will be supported for a good while now. &nbsp;It'll get the same patches, etc. that 1703 will. &nbsp;Take comfort in that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no date yet ("Autumn 2017" - probably September/October) for Fall Creators update and unless it comes out REAL SOON, it'll still be a few months before it goes final (the grace period)...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you read this article? &nbsp;It tries a little harder to explain things:<br />

<h2>            Thoughts on Players with Guests</h2>
                    
<p>Wanted to get a feel for everyone's thoughts when they play a game and they see a player with a guest...</p>
<p>Normally when I see that...especially if they're on my team, I get worried.&nbsp; I'm not sure about an exact percentage, but I would say that around 75% of the time, the guest is either AFK or just absolutely useless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I know that I have seen a few players with guests where both players at least hold their own.&nbsp; But the majority of the time, you're gonna get one of the two doing nothing.&nbsp; Very frustrating.</p>

<p>well, when I see them in the game lobby, If they're on my team, I assume they're noobs, and if they're on the opposing team, I assume they're the crazy good MLG people that have no life. Helps me do better in the game. Although, If you see somebody with
 more than one guest, it's more likely they're noobs, just messing around or something. Of course, assuming the player and his guests know what they're doing, they have no problems with communication, and can just annihilate you in the game. Also, I got my
 best medal ever on a guest profile(it was in firefight though) on Sniperfight I got a 40 killstreak, and I ended at the top of our leaderboard.</p>

<p>Yeah that's the same way I feel and if they leave I don't lose 1 teammate I lose 2. I wish they would put a restriction on some playlists such as Big Team so you can't bring a guest. Countless times I've had split screen people who quit right at the beginning
 of some games which seems to cause an uproar with everyone else on my team and one by one people leave. I don't see much fun in being spawn camped for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Usually when I see them on the other team I figure "Easy win". When they're on my team I figure "We lose". Lol. In the vast majority of my experiences, that's the case. I've only run into a handful of guests who were actually good, if not better than the
 person they were playing with.</p>

<p>When there's one guest I generally don't make assumptions because I've been spanked by guests before and I've also destroyed entire teams as a guest when I'm too lazy to recover my account. Whenever someone is splitting the screen with several players, then
 I know they'll be terrible. Splitting the screen 4 times is never a good idea unless you're a millionaire with an 85 inch tv in which case you might as well just buy more tvs at that point.</p>

<p>I'm with Noble 29 and his opinion. Some guests are good but most are just average and are there to just have fun with whoever they are playing with and don't care if they win or lose</p>

<p>When my cousin comes over most of the time he plays on a guest account...... but sometimes when my brother is not playing with us he uses my brothers account... he does not do that bad considering he does not play as much as most of us... He get 5-7 kills...
 I dont find it that bad since he is a guest and all so... I dont mind playing with my cousin anymore. Heck he sometimes does better than my brother who plays all the time..... But he keeps telling me I have a modded controller because he looks at my screen
 sometimes... He is like how did you make that shot.. um... I did because I am good like that... You r a hacker... No I am not... Yes you are.... what ever

<p>Who doesn't love seeing a guy with 3 guests on the other team in a Team Slayer lobby? &nbsp;lol, I'm licking my chops!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure sometimes I get a bad guest on my team too so it goes both ways, but overall it's all good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think if you play the competitive playlists (few people do it seems) there are no guests.</p>

            This is quite normal if you swap the controller around between systems.&nbsp; It would be more convenient for you to buy a separate controller for your PC, as I do.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there Saeleth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! You may want to try <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
update your controller</a> if it is not behaving normally, though this can happen like how Obsessive Power has mentioned. Normally, with my setup, I use a wireless controller for my Xbox One and I use a controller connected via USB for gaming on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            Yeah, this does happen. You can either buy another controller, or unplug your console while playing on PC.

<p>You would either need a seperate controller for the PC not synced to the xbox, or just live with the pairing.&nbsp; If you pair your controller with the USB wireless dongle it would force the pair to the dongle instead of the console.&nbsp; But then you would be require
 to re-pair the controller to the console when you wanted to use it there as well.</p>

            I would recommend to get an extra controller to play on your pc. This is in my opinion the only way besides unplug your xbox to prevent this.&nbsp;

            You could try contacting the manufacturer of your laptop about obtaining the 32 bit version of Windows 7 Home Premium for your laptop. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. Worth a try. If your laptop supports hardware assisted virtualization,
 you could do an Anytime Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Professional for $89 and use the free XP Mode software to run your version of AutoCAD:<br />
<br />
Virtualization Detection tool:<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0ee2a17f-8538-4619-8d1c-05d27e11adb2&amp;displaylang=en<br />
<br />
&nbsp;You simply need to have a CPU (processor) that supports hardware based virtualization: Intel-VT or AMD-V, you need to install two files:<br />
1. Windows6.1-KB958559-x64 or x86 depending on the architecture you are running<br />
Restart the system, then install:<br />
2. WindowsXPMode_en-us<br />
<br />
Please follow these steps to enable hardware virtualization:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Restart the computer and enter BIOS setup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Search virtualization setting in BIOS and enable the setting.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Save BIOS settings.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Power off the computer, wait for few seconds and start the computer.<br />
<br />
Both Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual PC can be downloaded from http://www.windows.com/business/downloads.<br />

    <title>Converting from DVR-MS file format - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Converting from DVR-MS file format</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows Vista on my PC and have been using Microsoft Media Center to record my favorite TV programs. &nbsp;These are being stored in a .dvr-ms file format, and I see no way to have the shows recorded in some other file format. &nbsp;I want to be able to watch
 these shows on my Panasonic LCD TV in the living room, and that TV is connected to a Samsung BD-C5500 Bluray player. &nbsp;That player supports a number of file formats, such as .avi, .mkv, .wmv, .mp4, .mpg, and .mpeg. &nbsp;So I think the easiest solution is to convert
 the .dvr-ms files into one of these other file formats, and then load the converted file to a thumb drive and insert the thumb drive into a USB port on the BluRay player. &nbsp;But I am definitely open to other suggestions! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, how can I readily convert the .dvr-ms files to one of these other file formats?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doug</p>

<p>A sleep timer needs to be added to the xbox for the TV. I understand that there is an automatic shut down feature for the system but it doesnt work when you're watching tv. I like to fall asleep while watching tv and there have been many times where I would
 be woken up at 4am because the Xbox didnt shut itsself off. Every TV has a sleep timer and one needs to be added to the XB1 to improve the experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Brenna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with DVD's. You can try the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
troubleshooting specifically for that error code</a>. Also have you tried to clean the discs? If you like you can try a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft reset</a> to see if it helps the situation. IF you do the reset make sure you know email/password to each account on the console as they will need to be added again. You will not lose any save data for these profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

    <title>Creative sound card will not work after Windows 10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimoxford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creative sound card will not work after Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>I've downloaded Windows 10.&nbsp; No sound from Logitech 5.1 surround sound speakers (driven by a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi xtremegamer sound card).&nbsp; Went into the Microsoft playback menu for sound and noticed no driver was installed. Still tweaked with the
 Microsoft controls and set to 5.1 surround that way, and got sound from speakers, but only controlled three front speakers, no woofer or rear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I knew I needed to get the Sound Blaster driver for Windows 10.&nbsp; Went to Creative's site and there thankfully was a Windows 10 version for my card (and it detected my card and wouldn't let me erroneously download a driver for the wrong card).&nbsp; After downloading
 driver did all the restarts etc. as instructed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the proper playback device selected in Windows menu and its set to default device. Still no sound.&nbsp; I indicates it has the latest driver and the device is working properly.&nbsp; Any sound test I run does not produce sound.&nbsp; Tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 the driver 3 times to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can a Microsoft expert or employee help out here?&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; I'm afraid to rollback to Windows 7 after all this work only to have the sound card still not work (I'm afraid that will happen).</p>
<p>

            <p>Joy,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I'm not sure what you mean by typing troubleshooter in the search bar. &nbsp;Do you mean type troubleshooting on this community web page, or in what search bar should I type that and how do I access it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I did run the "Troubleshoot sound problems" on the playback menu but that didn't fix anything.</p>
<p>I also referred to the support article you provided the link for and that didn't help. &nbsp;Actually, one of the proposed solutions was to use Microsoft's high definition audio device driver, and that cause the sound card output to not even show up as an option
 for sound anymore...and I certainly couldn't get my surround sound speakers working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there may be a compatibility problem between Windows 10 and the Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi xtremegamer Windows 10 driver...they don't seem to work properly together. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solution would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;I'm not sure how many more hours over however many more days I can dedicate this before I give up and roll back to Windows 7, which I'd rather not do.</p>
        </p>

            <p>I rolled back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surround Sound now works PERFECTLY again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a problem with the new Creative X-FI xtremegamer sound card.&nbsp; It was an easy tweak to get things working properly again after rolling back to Windows 7!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really caused me to not wait a little longer was because other little things were happening on my computer as well with Windows 10 loaded.&nbsp; When the computer went in to idle/sleep mode the login screen locked up a couple of times and I had to reboot
 to fix it.&nbsp; This morning I woke up and computer said it had no internet, though my internet service in house was fine; mind you this pc was not connected via WiFi, it was via Ethernet cable, which means there was also probably a problem with the Ethernet card
 driver!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one good think I'll say about this experience was that at least Microsoft made it painless to roll back to Windows 7. The process took a fraction of the time it took to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 definitely does not have all the kinks worked out yet, and the drivers aren't working properly.&nbsp; If you buy a new computer designed to operate on Windows 10 I'm guessing things will be fine, but you roll the dice if you upgrade an older&nbsp;computer&nbsp;with
 components (e.g. sound cards and&nbsp;Ethernet cards) not originally made with Windows 10 in mind.&nbsp; I don't have the time to wait and hope those issues are&nbsp;resolved.&nbsp;</p>

            It's nearly infuriating to deal with customer service "specialists", because much like Joy has done in this thread they don't listen to what you say at all.&nbsp; She responded to jimoxford's anecdote about the problem NOT being fixed, by making the empty and
 dishonest statement "Glad the issue has been fixed...".&nbsp; The issue wasn't fixed.&nbsp; The issue is his Creative product's drivers didn't work on Windows 10, and they still don't work on Windows 10, and he had to go through the inconvenience of rollback to a legacy
 OS and ultimately abandoned the issue.

<p>They dont listen and they have no idea how to fix the issue. The suggestion that you should run the sound trouble shooter is as dumb as the sound trouble shooter. The Win10 Developers update is a pos that I have to continually uninstall becuase it screws
 my sound every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft...fix your pos updates before screwing us.</p>

    <title>Recover stolen laptop with Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recover stolen laptop with Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop was stolen from my car. The thief couldn't break my PIN or password so he formatted it (my office 365 account confirmed). Since he couldn't log in, the new location could not be ascertained. However, since the Windows 10 Key was linked to my Microsoft
 account and saved in BIOS, whenever he installs new Windows (or if he already has) that key will be automatically picked up from BIOS I believe Microsoft can trace it using the serial number of the laptop (which I have). I do have police report and in fact
 the CCTV footage of the incident. Any help will be appreciated.</p>

            I don't think Microsoft can do anything beyond whats provided with the operating system such as Find my device. You should continue working with the authorities to recover your device.

            What type of WIndows 10 Product Key do you have?  You can move a Retail Product Key to another PC of your choosing. 
<br />
<br /> If it's the free Upgrade or Factory installed Windows then that license stays with the PC whether you have it linked to your Account or not.  The ability to link it to your MS Account is only for changing hardware so you can reactivate it afterwards easier with the Activation Troubleshooter.  Not sure that can help you here. 
<br />
<br />Remember to lock your laptop in your truck or (to avoid notice) slip it under the seat so it's out of view and not bait.  We live and learn.  Sorry about that.

<h2>            pdf &#39;Reader&#39; app not working properly after Windows 10 update on Surface 3 tablet</h2>
                    I recently upgraded a Surface 3 device to Windows 10, and the 'Reader' app for reading pdf files (which had been factory installed in Windows 8.1) is not working fine. Sometimes it works well but other times it doesn't allow me to highlight, neither zoom,
 and passing from one page to another is very slow. Is there any way I can get this fixed?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I ran the troubleshooter and still find problems with the app. It must have some kind of bug I'd guess.</p>

    <title>User name or password is incorrect. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            User name or password is incorrect.</h2>
                    
<p>When I lock my computer and then try to log back in, Windows 7 tells me that my login credentials are incorrect.&nbsp; I know with 100% certainty that the login name and password are correct and correctly typed in but when this happens, I have no choice but to
 power down, power back up and log in using the exact same credentials.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, this is an intermittent problem.&nbsp; It can happen when my screensaver kicks in (I have set the sreen saver to display the logon screen) or it can happen when I lock the computer with the &lt;Windows Key&gt; + L.<br />
<br />
This issue occurs on both my Lenovo R61 laptop and my two desktop computers so I know for certain it is not a keyboard issue or problem with not remembering the logon credentials.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7&nbsp;Professional&nbsp; - latest updates as of November 9.</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
These are the reasons, where you cannot login:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Caps Lock might be on.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Passwords in Windows are case-sensitive, which means that every time you type your password, you have to capitalize each letter in exactly the same way that you did when you first created it. If you have accidentally pressed Caps Lock (sometimes the key name
 is spelled CapsLk), then you're inadvertently typing your password in all capital letters. Make sure Caps Lock is off, and then type your password again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. You might be typing the wrong password.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you can't remember your password, you need to reset your password, either with a password reset disk or an administrator account. For more information, see Reset your Windows password.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. An administrator on the computer might have reset your password.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If your computer is on a network, a network administrator has the ability to reset your password. If you think this might be the problem, check with your network administrator. If your computer is in a workgroup, anyone who has an administrator account on the
 computer can change your password.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. You might be trying to log on to the wrong user account.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have more than one user account on the computer, make sure you're logging on to the account that matches the password you're using.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Insufficient MTU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snowguard187  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insufficient MTU</h2>
                    
<p>I frequently have issues staying connected to XBOX Live, and recently my XBOX will not connect at all. The error is my internet not connecting to XBOX Live and it's telling me that my MTU is insufficient. My router configuration page says that I have 1500
 MTU and the XBOX says I need 1364. I have opened the appropriate ports on my configuration page, and when I plug my XBOX directly into the modem it will successfully connect. I have 3 laptops and a notebook that use my wireless signaI. I have turned all these&nbsp;computers
 off and my XBOX still will not connect. I&nbsp;have contacted XBOX Live, my internet service provider, and my router manufacturer. None of them can correct my problem. Anybody got any help??</p>

<p><span>Since you have narrowed the issue down to your router I would suggest you do the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On the back or bottom of your router should be a reset button. If there is not one then check the router settings and see if it is there. You need to reset the router to factory settings (the day you took
 it out of the box). That will wipe out any conflicts that you may have inadvertently created. Just an FYI, you can not have uPnP, Port Forwarding or DMZ enabled at the same time. You must pick one and disable the rest, if they are enabled. If you leave them
 all enabled they will cause more issues. <br />
