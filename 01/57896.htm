<h2>            Windows 10 Not Recognizing My Phones Hotspot</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 on my Acer Aspire does not recognize my galaxy note 3's wireless hotspot. I've checked for updates, scan shows I have the latest drivers for my network adapter. I never had this problem with windows 8.1. Is there anyway to fix this? Also is it
 possible to use my phones hotspot by tethering with the usb cable?</p>

            The links provided are all very helpful as I did manage to access the internet by tethering the laptop to the phone with &nbsp;a usb cable. I would, however, prefer to use&nbsp;the wireless hotspot on my galaxy note 3 with my laptop. So far I have found no solutions
 after scouring the web for days. My main problem is that my phones hotspot does not show in the available networks list.

<h2>            Sign In Problem</h2>
                    <p>Alright, I've been scrounging the web trying to find a solution and nothing is working so, here goes nothing... A while ago my skype stopped working on my PC. It wouldn't log in at all. I attempted to try again today and still get nothing. I've tried uninstalling
 and reinstalling, tried scrapping the registry files and even made sure my antivirus wasn't an issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here is what I can tell you. I put in my username and it brings up the password screen. When I enter my password or use the authenticator nothing happens. The screen goes blank and it kicks me right back to the password screen without so much as an error.
 Just, nothing at all. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm getting sick of using the web app version.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
For tray drives :<br />
<br />
Sometimes they get stuck. There is a little hole on the front of the CD drive that you can stick a&nbsp;<br />
paperclip in which will release the drive and allow it to open.<br />
<br />
Create a Paperclip Drive Opener<br />

<br />

<br />
=================================<br />
<br />
For Slot Drives :<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker on how to eject the disk.<br />
<br />
Dell xps m1330 dvd drive will not eject cd inside <strong>&lt;-- check these methods</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Be careful as you can damage the drive using the&nbsp;method below :<br />
</strong><br />
You may need to get the driver working 1st however this might still work.<br />

<p>Hello Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You certainly can set other installed programs to be your default app to always open file types with in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tutorial below can show you different ways on how to do so. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.</p>

            What's stopping you? I don't use any Microsoft products on Windows 10, with one exception: I do use Microsoft Office. But if I really wanted to, I wouldn't have to use Microsoft Office either, since there are so many alternative office suites.

<h2>            Dell Latitude E6430 starts up, black screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few weeks my laptop (Dell Latitude E6430) has been acting weird. I always turn my laptop off the ‘correct’ way (via Start menu), but a few weeks ago, when I turned on my laptop it started up fine, but there was no screen whatsoever; it was just a
 black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned it off, removed the battery and unplugged the battery cord, pressed the power on button for 30 seconds and then i plugged the battery etc etc in. Sometimes only doing his worked, sometimes I had to press F2 and then F1 (if I press F2 while also
 pressing on the power button, a “keyboard initializing failure” menu popped up, that’s how I could press F1 and it just continued starting up and booting to the Windows 10 system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, none of these things work now. I’ve been trying this whole evening to get my laptop to work, nothing happens :(</p>
<p>Here is a video to “demonstrate” my issue:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/FO-9Tncub5I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/FO-9Tncub5I</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/FO-9Tncub5I?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/FO-9Tncub5I?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help (and understood my issue, English is not my first language so I hope this was clear)</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

            Thanks for the suggestions. Since my speakers were working fine after a hard boot but failed after the computer went to sleep or whatever and woke up again, I've reset it so only the monitor goes off and the CPU stays on. Speakers working fine now that
 it doesn't power down! Meanwhile, while it was working I checked and found there was no newer driver than I already had.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I had tried the first method above already and got nervous about uninstalling the sound card, not knowing if I had the program to reinstall it. So I called the folks who built my computer (Computers, Etc.) and they said I'm already doing the only
 fix they can think of, leaving my computer on but turning off the monitor when not in use. They say it's not rare for some drivers not to like waking up. Not unlike myself some days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for taking the time to answer my question! Jean<br />

            <p>Hi Jean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can uninstall and reinstall the Sound card driver as Windows 7 will automatically detect the driver. As they said about some drivers not to like waking up is only about Keyboard and mouse when the option "<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device
 to save power</strong>" is enabled.</p>

            Hi again Job!<br />
<br />
So, I went ahead and uninstalled the sound card driver, having faith that you were right, unplugged the speakers, restarted, plugged the speakers back in and the sound was working fine. Then I set the power options to go to sleep in just one minute, sat back,
 when it went off I powered back up and the sound still works! So, I hope this did the trick and thank you SO MUCH for helping me!
<br />
<br />
(By the way, I checked the options on the keyboard and mouse to see if they were set to save power and they aren't, so I left them as-is to avoid problems down the road. I have had situations in the past when the mouse wouldn't "wake up" but it's been working
 all right recently.) <br />
<br />
Really appreciate you! Jean<br />

            Sadly, I actually didn't fix the issue! I was confident that things were good after reinstalling the audio so changed the power saving setting back to putting it to sleep after an hour. Now the speakers don't work again, so I'm keeping the system on all
 the time except for the monitor. I'll probably need to replace the whole system before too much longer anyway, so I'll keep the workaround in place until then.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for working with me on this! Jean<br />

            Thanks again. I started doing this, but I saw that after each step I would have to change the power settings to let the computer hibernate to see if the audio came back or not, since it always works after any kind of boot--and then do the next step. It
 seems to me a lot of trouble when for now I can just leave the CPU always on&nbsp; until I need/want to restart for some reason. At any rate, I thank you for continuing to try to help me and if things get too bothersome at least now I have this link to try. Appreciate
 you! Jean<br />

<h2>            Late night Rant.  &#38;quot&#59;this is a secret achievement&#38;quot&#59;......</h2>
                    
<p>Its 1am, I can't sleep and after going through a few of the other forums on games I am playing, something dawned on me.&nbsp; Yes it is actually annoying me now that I have this knowledge.&nbsp; I feel like ranting just a bit here, because...I want to and its a worthy
 rant IMO.</p>
<p>' </p>
<p>What is up with the majority of games not showing the majority of the achievements via the achievement guide in game?&nbsp; Yes, I know I can look up any achievement known with a few clicks, but that doesn't matter, its a hassle, why should we and its not my
 point.&nbsp; I am just at a complete loss as to why achievements have to remain so secret?&nbsp; I get having a few, the fun ones, like stabbing the cat 4 times with your pocket knife....ya cool make it a secret one.&nbsp; But for the majority of the achievements, they have
 to be secret too?</p>
<p>Sure, like everyone else, a few clicks and I can look them up.&nbsp; Glance at them on the internet, forget most of them, come back to my game and know if I am going to run across some payday points or just maybe I might be aware to shoot 10 chickens in the courtyard
 while I am fighting terrorists, ok cool.&nbsp; Is the information that rough it needs to remain a secret?&nbsp; Why can't I just go into my guide, look at the achievements for one of the games I am playing, know what they are WHILE I am actually playing, not being forced
 to multi task from the PC to the game 50 times to remember to shoot the pink guy when he runs across the screen?
</p>
<p>Do the developers feel, its best to just keep them secret on the 360 to prolongue the life of their game?&nbsp; Hate to break it to ya, but theres 2 types of 360 players out there, gamers who are anal over them and the rest of us.&nbsp; Who all enjoy getting them,
 we will do something extra to get them, but if we walk away from the game with a score of 200, we are ok with that.&nbsp; Not like we are gonna run through MW2 on veteran difficulty just for the achievements right?&nbsp; I mean, we already...AREN"T that good....we could
 beat it yes, if we dedicated hours and hours of our life to it.&nbsp; Cursing, yelling, repeating the same parts over and over to beat that insane, bogus cheating computer so I can get an extra 50 points that no one cares about....</p>
<p>So, point is why are they still a secret?&nbsp; The only ones they could possibly benefit are those moral choice ones, like we won't save the game right before, make both choices right?&nbsp; So keeping that one a secret and all of the others on the 360 is a must.&nbsp;
 So we can play it again or something?&nbsp; Seriously, stop.&nbsp; We all look if we want too, only the gamers who truly go for that max gamerscore for their games are going to remember half of them.&nbsp; The rest of us, can't we just look at the guide and have the information
 that is already supposed to be there?&nbsp; It might actually improve the time we play on some of these games....I mean the game bites, you know you don't like it, but $60 bucks for a not like is always a...you just have to play it.&nbsp; You don't like it, you aren't
 going to look up the achievements for it...you are just trying to get a few of your hard earned dollars back in time at least before you off it at Gamestop.&nbsp; But if the achievements were handy, on the guide....you might actually find some purpose that isn't
 out of your way to keep playing.&nbsp; Just a thought.</p>
<p>Seriously though, I get having a few secret ones, I really do.&nbsp; It would be actually cool if the secret ones weren't even listed (OMG!) and they just "popped" if you did it.&nbsp; So we couldn't even take a few clicks on launch day and know everything.&nbsp; But do
 most all of them have to be like that?&nbsp; Its stupid to hold out that knowledge from us via the 360, its a pain in the butt, the system is in place, your game will be played no matter how you did them, stop making all of them secret.&nbsp; If your game building skills
 are that awful, I expect to invest 6-8 hours into your game only to have maybe 15 points anyways from a few like "you beat level 20 without dying!&nbsp; 5 points"....aka you suck at even giving us achievements.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>End of my pointless rant that is easily fixed.&nbsp; Obviously I don't play games for achievements, but I do like them.&nbsp; I hate a hassle though, I shouldn't have to go to websites to see what they are,&nbsp; It even takes away bragging rights, cause the rest of us
 can't see that you made it through Fallout 3 by only throwing rocks at the enemies...its a secret achievement for the rest of us...we just see you did it...um good job.&nbsp; Its a pointless system, the surprise sucks, it isn't holding us down for&nbsp;more playtime...its
 just straight up stupid and time to stop.&nbsp; Make them visible so we can see them....</p>

 call him john john, or how about JJ........Lets say your looking at your friends achievments and you see an achievment that says "youve sucessfully killed the boss and JJ has died" &nbsp;WHOA!!!!! huge spoiler!!!! &nbsp;Yeah thats not something i want to see, that needs
 to be a secret achievment. And like you said, You can always look up the achievments online anyays, so if you really want to know.........

<p>[quote user="Wolvklaw"]</p>
<p>Its 1am, I can't sleep and after going through a few of the other forums on games I am playing, something dawned on me.&nbsp; Yes it is actually annoying me now that I have this knowledge.&nbsp; I feel like ranting just a bit here, because...I want to and its a worthy
 rant IMO.</p>
<p>' </p>
<p>What is up with the majority of games not showing the majority of the achievements via the achievement guide in game?&nbsp; Yes, I know I can look up any achievement known with a few clicks, but that doesn't matter, its a hassle, why should we and its not my
 point.&nbsp; I am just at a complete loss as to why achievements have to remain so secret?&nbsp; I get having a few, the fun ones, like stabbing the cat 4 times with your pocket knife....ya cool make it a secret one.&nbsp; But for the majority of the achievements, they have
 to be secret too?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, like everyone else, a few clicks and I can look them up.&nbsp; Glance at them on the internet, forget most of them, come back to my game and know if I am going to run across some payday points or just maybe I might be aware to shoot 10 chickens in the courtyard
 while I am fighting terrorists, ok cool.&nbsp; Is the information that rough it needs to remain a secret?&nbsp; Why can't I just go into my guide, look at the achievements for one of the games I am playing, know what they are WHILE I am actually playing, not being forced
 to multi task from the PC to the game 50 times to remember to shoot the pink guy when he runs across the screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the developers feel, its best to just keep them secret on the 360 to prolongue the life of their game?&nbsp; Hate to break it to ya, but theres 2 types of 360 players out there, gamers who are anal over them and the rest of us.&nbsp; Who all enjoy getting them,
 we will do something extra to get them, but if we walk away from the game with a score of 200, we are ok with that.&nbsp; Not like we are gonna run through MW2 on veteran difficulty just for the achievements right?&nbsp; I mean, we already...AREN"T that good....we could
 beat it yes, if we dedicated hours and hours of our life to it.&nbsp; Cursing, yelling, repeating the same parts over and over to beat that insane, bogus cheating computer so I can get an extra 50 points that no one cares about....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, point is why are they still a secret?&nbsp; The only ones they could possibly benefit are those moral choice ones, like we won't save the game right before, make both choices right?&nbsp; So keeping that one a secret and all of the others on the 360 is a must.&nbsp;
 So we can play it again or something?&nbsp; Seriously, stop.&nbsp; We all look if we want too, only the gamers who truly go for that max gamerscore for their games are going to remember half of them.&nbsp; The rest of us, can't we just look at the guide and have the information
 that is already supposed to be there?&nbsp; It might actually improve the time we play on some of these games....I mean the game bites, you know you don't like it, but $60 bucks for a not like is always a...you just have to play it.&nbsp; You don't like it, you aren't
 going to look up the achievements for it...you are just trying to get a few of your hard earned dollars back in time at least before you off it at Gamestop.&nbsp; But if the achievements were handy, on the guide....you might actually find some purpose that isn't
 out of your way to keep playing.&nbsp; Just a thought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously though, I get having a few secret ones, I really do.&nbsp; It would be actually cool if the secret ones weren't even listed (OMG!) and they just "popped" if you did it.&nbsp; So we couldn't even take a few clicks on launch day and know everything.&nbsp; But do
 most all of them have to be like that?&nbsp; Its stupid to hold out that knowledge from us via the 360, its a pain in the butt, the system is in place, your game will be played no matter how you did them, stop making all of them secret.&nbsp; If your game building skills
 are that awful, I expect to invest 6-8 hours into your game only to have maybe 15 points anyways from a few like "you beat level 20 without dying!&nbsp; 5 points"....aka you suck at even giving us achievements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>End of my pointless rant that is easily fixed.&nbsp; Obviously I don't play games for achievements, but I do like them.&nbsp; I hate a hassle though, I shouldn't have to go to websites to see what they are,&nbsp; It even takes away bragging rights, cause the rest of us
 can't see that you made it through Fallout 3 by only throwing rocks at the enemies...its a secret achievement for the rest of us...we just see you did it...um good job.&nbsp; Its a pointless system, the surprise sucks, it isn't holding us down for&nbsp;more playtime...its
 just straight up stupid and time to stop.&nbsp; Make them visible so we can see them....</p>

<h2>            Volume Shadow Copy Service not working on C&#58; drive, error&#58; &#34;There are no previous versions available&#34;, on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi There!<br />
<br />
I have two physical disks in my notebook, one simple partition each, BitLocker encrypted. Drive C:, which is my system drive and drive D:, for some media stuff.<br />
Windows Version is Windows 10.0.10586 x64</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have configured VSS to use the "Previous Versions" feature in case I accidentally delete or overwrite a file. I did this on my Win7 install to and it saved my butt at least three times.<br />
Anyway, I am IT Tech and I usually know what I am doing. VSS is running (Volume Shadow Copy Service set to "Manual"), snapshots are there but when I right-click on a modified file (or on the root of the disk) and click "Previous Versions", my D: drive correctly
 displays the existing snapshots, on my system drive C: there is always a "There are no previous versions available" message. But, when I click the "System Restore..." button, I get a list with my snapshots, so I guess I could restore my system.<br />
Googling around I was not able to find a solution, not even a hint. I am hoping for help here.<br />
<br />
Here is the output of vssadmin. As you can see, configuration seems to be ok and the two manual snapshots are there on both drives. For the moment there is no system restore point, but it does not work with snaps created by them either.<br />

 single time i want to go to setup of something also says "This installation package could not be opened" on some different files I'm trying to install...my downloads also do not complete all the time, they get to like 90% then stop going up... im running windows
 7 and already reformatted once with the recovery thing only to come back to the same situation...right when i get into the computer after setting it up after a reformat i have full access like a normal computer but then it starts to give me win32 error and
 download issues...i dont know what is up someone please help!&nbsp; i just transferred a downloaded file by USB from my workout computer to the new one that doesnt open files correctly and it works fine installing...something with the download process is jacking

<h2>            Xbox One controller won&#39;t reconnect to adapter.</h2>
                    <p>So when they first came out, I got the Xbox One Controller PC adapter. I was glad to finally be able to play games on PC with my Xbox One controller without a stupid wire. Now, in recent times, it barely works, and I&nbsp;think Microsoft broke it. After the most recent big update to Windows 10, 1803 in May, it's been buggy as all hell. First, after wanting to use my controller with it, it just wouldn't connect. At all. I would try to hold the buttons, it'd connect, then poof, the controller just turns off. Nothing worked. Until I found a post telling me to uninstall the drivers for the adapter, and to restart and re-plug in the adapter.&nbsp;It reinstalled the drivers, and it worked fine. Until now, again. Now, it works when it connects, no problem. But after some time, the controller turns itself off. Ok, no problem. But when I turn it back on, it does that same thing, where it connects, and just shuts off. It will keep doing this. Until I restart my computer. Then it works again. Unti

 </blockquote> <p>This does not help. This is mostly blaming it on lack of line-of-sight. My adapter is never more than 2 feet away from my controller and I&nbsp;have it hanging from the extender off the side of my PC&nbsp;that faces me. I've already tried reinstalling the drivers and that doesn't do anything.</p>

                    I created a recovery USB drive and would like to test it out. How do I setup Windows 8.1 (Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro) so that it boots up from the USB drive? Pressing Function-F12 on power up did not work for me (I could not get a screen which allows me to select
 the boot order).

<br />
I would suggest you to check the manual provided by Lenovo Yoga Pro 2 on how to change the boot priority. If you don’t find a way to change the boot priority, then I would suggest you to contact Lenovo support to check on how to change boot priority.<br />

<h3> noobesque  say:</h3>
<h2>            Defiance, region locked on Xbox 360 - Unacceptable.</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to request that a representative from Microsoft explain the reasons as to why Defiance will be region locked on the Xbox 360, and whether individuals will be able to select the region they play in prior to beginning with a character.</p>
<p>Not only does this limit connectivity between players and friends, but it shows a clear disregard for Xbox customers, in terms of taking a step backward in service and understanding customer wants.</p>
<p>Granted, some won't care. But based on the response from the Trion World forums, this news of region locking servers to either NA or EU has been met with concern, confusion and even sadness.</p>
<p>For me, personally, I play games socially. Since I am Australian, I won't be able to join the NA servers, apparently. So now I will be forced to consider whether I want to play a potentially great game
<strong>without</strong> the interaction of my friends overseas, save through party chat.</p>
<p>Region locking <em>servers</em> for a game is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Please explain.</p>

<p>I would assume its an issue of lag being carried over seas, as people from EU would have a slower connection when connected to a US server. Overall, this can decrease the quality in the connection for everyone and not just them and by that I mean, lets say
 your doing a co-op instance or a death match.. &nbsp;Every player needs to be present before the match can begin. so while 3 people take 20seconds to load, the one from EU can take 2mins.. Causing the other 3 to sit there going wtf and then you have 3 mad people
 to deal with.</p>
<p><br />
I'm not trying to stand up for why its should be region locked as I too have friends in EU that would be nice to play with like the PC version allows. &nbsp;I would assume its also a result of processing ability, as I've notice in the PC version people that drive
 by you take seconds to load, yet on Xbox I've been standing there waiting for like 30+ seconds and they still havent loaded. &nbsp;90% of the people that drive by me never load, which says to me the bandwidth coming in or being given out to the Xbox server's, is
 just not at the speed of the PC servers.</p>
<p><br />
Regardless, I do agree with you, but can also see it from their point also.</p>

<p>This is the first real MMO on Xbox 360 and Microsoft have bandwidth requirements for games to ensure a smooth and good online experience. Keeping players in their region helps to provide this experience.</p>
<p>Yes it is not great and means I can't play with my friends in the UK but I'd also prefer a smooth experience in Defiance than people warping around the terrain.

<p>People warp around the terrain now. Go into any Ark fall battle and you will experience that. Not to mention that Shadow wars is totally screwed up. Don't get me wrong I love the game but I am sorry I think not being able to play with my uk friends is something
 that should of been made clear before we bought the game. I like most gamers have friends I play with on a regular basis and it is those friends I want to play with. People I know and trust. Not like some of the people I have been seeing in coop and match
 making who you can not touch or take no damage. But that is another subject for another time.

<p>keeping defiance region locked helps the gameplay experience better. everybody would have connection issues if it werent region locked. trion did say though maybe in the future they will try to not make it region lock. no guarantees though.

<p>^^ Clearly you dont have friends in other countries you want to play with. One of the main reasons I brought the game was for variety to play with friends and I find it disgusting thats not even possible. I watched reviews of the game before I brought it
 and wasnt aware of this problem until yesterday.</p>
<p>I think its pretty clear some people are gunna be getting some angry letters. I hope they do sort this out</p>

            It sounds like it logged you in using a temporary profile. &nbsp;There's a lot of reasons this can happen on Windows NT-based operating systems and has been seen with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and now 8. &nbsp;Usually, it's a corrupt registry database file called NTUSER.dat
 that couldn't be loaded (or took too long to load and make the system default back to a temporary copy).
<div><br />
<div>There are some advanced methods you can use to try to repair the profile, and these methods are discussed
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/windows-8-keeps-loading-with-temporary-profile/583abee6-645d-42a1-88da-063547c6eea0">
here</a>. &nbsp;However, I would truly recommend trying the following instead. &nbsp;It will take far less time, be less difficult, and in most cases, more reliable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>Reboot</b><br />
You probably already have, but just make sure you give this a shot. Sometimes an install process blocks your profile from being read and you'll get logged into a temporary profile, but a reboot will resolve it. It's worth a try.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li><b>Try System Restore</b><br />
System Restore takes regular backups of key system and registry files and keeps these. You can use System Restore to "go back in time" to a previous backup. &nbsp;The best part is that this restore won't touch your files or pictures -- it only restores system files.
 &nbsp;I'd recommend trying this first.<br />
<br />
From your Start screen, type <b>rstrui</b>&nbsp;(search results will appear as you begin typing). &nbsp;Click the search result. &nbsp;You'll be guided through a few steps where you pick a date/time you know your computer was working correctly, then the Restore process will
 reboot your computer to that time. &nbsp;If the issue isn't resolved, you can pick another date or undo it entirely. &nbsp;That's why this is by far the best first step.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li><b>Make a New Profile</b><br />
From Control Panel, add a new user account to your computer. &nbsp;Then login to it, open up C:\users and drag-drop your files into the new profile. &nbsp;Then you can (or after a few days when you're sure you don't need anything from the bad profile) you can just delete
 it.</li></ul>

                    <p>I can go to Google, but all links go to -&nbsp;McAfee, etc (same in Bing)</p>
<p>My virus scanner&nbsp;that I have Avast says:</p>
<p>WIN32:PUP-gen [PUP], and moved it to the vault</p>
<p>now it is in:</p>
<p>C:\System Volume Information\.....\Aooo5185.exe</p>
<p>Avast won't, - move, repair, delete!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>StopZilla says:</p>
<p>HOSTS file.C &amp; HOSTS file.B (non restorable)&nbsp; (not Critical)</p>
<p>and now I have more in stopzilla:</p>
<p>TrojanSpy.Agent! 4VvxxLjZW2U&nbsp; -(Critical)</p>
<p>TrojanSpy.Agent!K5zD4Vm7xs8&nbsp; -(Critical)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the file HOST in C:\windows\i386 </p>
<p>(there is not one in)</p>
<p><strong>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC</strong></p>
<p>Is this OK?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p># Copyright (c) 1993-1999 Microsoft Corp.<br />

# This is a sample HOSTS file used by Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows.<br />
#<br />
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names. Each<br />
# entry should be kept on an individual line. The IP address should<br />
# be placed in the first column followed by the corresponding host name.<br />
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one<br />
# space.<br />
#<br />
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual<br />
# lines or following the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.<br />
#<br />

<p>127.0.0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; localhost<br />
</p>
<p>Is this a good HOST file?</p>

<br />
Have you ever actually run that Fixit KB972304 to see if you end up with a hosts file?<br />
<br />
I had in my notes that the Fixit doesn't fixit.<br />
<br />
I don't usually have a hosts file anyway so I ran the Fixit and still did not have one and I thought it was supposed to make a default one for me.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if you could temporarily rename your hosts to something like 'wunders' and run the Fixit to see if you end up with a new hosts file or not...&nbsp; there is a reboot required.<br />
<br />
Is this another Fixit that doesn't really fixit or am I just not getting it?<br />

Actually, no, I haven't tried the Fix-it.&nbsp; In general I don't trust the Fix-Its and always follow the "Fix it myself" path (I learn more that way).&nbsp; I'll only do the "Fix-It for me" path if there is no alternative.<br />
<br />
Ken,<br />
You should create the file as described, using the "Let me fix it myself" section.&nbsp; If the file that you create disappears from the etc directory, then you almost certainly have malware problems.<br />

            I don't use/trust the Fixits either, but since the Microsoft Support Engineers often suggest running them or a link to some KB article with same (they never try them either), I like to break my system on purpose, follow the MSE advice to see if it works
 or not (and it never does).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If one is not too XP savvy, one would think that the advice to run a MS Fixit would work since that is their job, and one would be inclined to follow the MSE advice.&nbsp; But, I digress as my expectation exceed reality...<br />
<br />
So, Ken Sams - do you still need help with your hosts file?&nbsp; I have some more information/stuff that actually works I can post up that may help you if you still need it :)&nbsp;

    <title>My question is, why is it displaying Limited Touch Support with 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> will chen03  say:</h3>
<h2>            My question is, why is it displaying Limited Touch Support with 2 Touch Points&#63; I run Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I was in my system information and saw that my laptop showed Limited Touch Support with 2 Touch Points under Pen and Touch. This is very weird since my laptop is a Lenovo Thinkpad T440 which does not support touch screen. I have also read that it
 could have been because of the touch pad but my touch pad &nbsp;has settings that allow me to customize gestures using 4 fingers which work. So my question is, why is it displaying Limited Touch Support with 2 Touch Points? I run Windows 10 if that helps. Thank
 You! :D</p>

            Um... that link doesn't help at all. My laptop is not touchscreen but it is displayed as limited touch support with 2 touch points. My question was why it says I have limited touch support with 2 touch points when my laptop is clearly not touch screen

<h2>            How do I stop my screen from blacking out&#63;</h2>
                    When I play <i>Need For Speed World</i>, my laptop usually blacks out; most recent blacking out was when I played
<i>Battlefield Play4Free</i>. Ever since I downloaded <i>Need For Speed World</i>, it started doing this.

            Please consult the games&nbsp; publisher's web sites and check each game's specifications.&nbsp; There should be listed which graphic adapter that the publishers have tested / certified for use with the games.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, it should be noted that most "graphic" intensive games are usually&nbsp; not recommended for laptops, in general.&nbsp;&nbsp; The main reason is that the graphics card included are usually set up to be using the main RAM in a "shared" mode,<br />

    <title>Skype App for Windows 10 malfunction. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leokyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype App for Windows 10 malfunction.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Skype as the main application for communication with my colleagues and family but I have several issues with the Skype application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When I tried to change the black background, I started getting flashes in the screen similar to what happens when I printscreen. It happens when a new email comes etc. Really annoying but I can still work.</p>
<p>2. In my work I use my laptop and I use an external screen, camera and microphone for better picture and sound. When I move my laptop and disconnect the equipment it forgets the settings and is disorganized (most of the times). Still annoying but I spend
 some time to set up the application properly and can function.</p>
<p>3. When I place a call I do not hear any sound that is calling but i only see trying to connect. The other party hears me calling. No too much trouble.</p>
<p>4. Last week an update arrived (the one with the bicycle) and I lost all the contact history as well as the ability to chat through Skype. Although it allows me to type a message it does not send it to the other party and does show it in my screen. I also
 do not receive any messages any more. I can do a conference and see the other party.</p>
<p>I believe that the set up is messed up so I tried to remove the application and install again. I managed to uninstall it and reinstall it but all the problems persist.</p>
<p>Can someone suggest something more practical rather than format the disk and start installing all the software from zero?</p>
<p>Desperate!</p>
