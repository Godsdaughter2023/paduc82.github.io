            <p>You would have to have someone to file a complaint on you through Live so the enforcement team can issue a gamerscore reset. However, keep in mind with a gamerscore reset all of your achievements would be removed, not just the ones you modded, and you would never be able to re-earn those achievements on that account. So if you're looking to unlock them the legit way, it would be better to create a new account.</p>

            <p>I, too, had this problem after updating to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp; My system would snarl at me (based on the Windows Nature theme I had installed at the time of update).&nbsp; It has been quite annoying, but tonight, I got to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would get the "Unknown NT Operating System System Code 10 Detected", followed by "Read Config File Failed".&nbsp; This would happen in pairs.&nbsp; It wouldn't crash Explorer like some have reported; oh and I'd get it again when opening Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with the last "set" of errors (that of going to the Control Panel) to see if I could sneak up on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my C:\ drive (the root of c:\), and then performed a global search for "*.cpl".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found four flavors of cmdiag.cpl (one for Windows 2k, one for Vista, one for XP, and one simply named cmdiag.cpl.&nbsp; The former OS flavors were located in one of the myriad Windows SideXSide folders.&nbsp; Only cmdiag.cpl was in system32.&nbsp; An Internet search
 helped me pinpoint what cmdiag.cpl was associated with.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Cherry Smart Card reader ST 1044U installed, and was working fine, but decided to poke around some.&nbsp; And, obviously, the Cherry&nbsp;version I had originally installed for must have installed more than&nbsp;it needed to in terms of Windows SideXSide folders
 (i.e., this machine had never had Windows 2k or XP on it).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the Cherry web site and did find a newer install package, so I downloaded it.&nbsp; I uninstalled the V1.9--merely executing the uninstalled blind without checking to see that it actually removed everything.&nbsp; I then installed&nbsp;the new V3.3.&nbsp; This did
 not change the status quo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I went back and re-ran the *.cpl search and saw something I missed before....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of all the *.cpl files Search had found on my system, all of them had a 2015 install date (coincident with my upgrade date) EXCEPT the cmdiag.cpl associated files.&nbsp; These sported&nbsp;a 2008 date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This told me these objects did NOT undergo any metamorphosis stemming from the Windows 10 update (and was, therefore, "Unknown"--just like the error message was telling us).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.&nbsp; I temporarily renamed cmdiag.cpl to cmdiag.cpl.orig</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closed Control Panel and then re-opened it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more annoying Nature raspberry sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew I was onto something now....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more Nature raspberry sound at start-up, either....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I looked in Registry and found 3 key references to cmdiag.cpl....&nbsp; Thinking maybe the new Cherry software couldn't overcome some remnant of the older version left behind, I decided to do a more thorough uninstall/re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the uninstall of the new Cherry software.</p>
<p>I went into Device Manager, and right-clicked on my Smart Card reader and uninstalled the driver (and told the system to remove the software, too).&nbsp; Next, I manually removed the Cherry directory that was left behind in Program Files (x86)----Note:&nbsp; I have
 32 bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>Lastly, I re-checked for "cmdiag.cpl" in Registry, and removed those 3 keys I had found earlier.&nbsp; Obviously, the new Cherry package either did not remove these keys, or, no longer relied on them, and these were relics from the older V1.9 I had previously
 installed.&nbsp; At-any-rate, they were orphaned, so I manually deleted them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the 3 keys, I believe the one perhaps most problematic was the one that existed under HKLM_Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Layers</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least, this would be in keeping with the "Unknown NT Operating System" part of the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I rebooted and ensured the system came up (without annoying Nature raspberry sounds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then re-installed my new V3.3 Cherry software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This package still seems to install the exact same version of the driver that had been previously installed, but conspicuously missing (i.e., NOT installed) is cmdiag.cpl. Cherry still provides a diagnostic mechanism--they just don't seem to do it via a
 control panel object.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, in my case, this was never a driver version, but rather simply the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>presence </strong></span>of cmdiag.cpl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this file (and its associated reference removed from Registry), I no longer have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who are experiencing this when opening Control Panel, perform a search for "*.cpl" and see if your "flavors" of cmdiag.cpl have a much older date than the date you performed the Windows 10 update.&nbsp; If so, you've likely found the object causing
 the issue.&nbsp; I suppose it's possible some other object could be causing it, too, but I'd expect to see a pre-update date for the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone.&nbsp; This is a far easier fix than Resetting Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck.</p>

<h2>            Skype To Go</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I just registered numbers to call via Skype To Go and I have a subscription kredit for another country, for example USA and I live in Sweden. Does Skype To Go works within USA if I travel there? If it works, how much does it cost? Please answer me easy English,
 because I need help by transfer program. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />Complementing on Dave's response, one other option is: to get a Skype credit or subscription to call Sweden (if that is where you want to call).
<br />
<br />That way you make the call using your Skype application and you can phone numbers (landline or mobile), at the cost of a local call (without international charges)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates/</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

            Hi
<br />
<br />If you have a subscription (not Skype to Go) it only matters where you call to, not where you are calling from because you make the call from Skype application.
<br />
<br />If the subscription is to call Japan, you probably have a number of minutes for a fixed cost? So as long as you use those minutes, there is no extra cost.
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />Margarida

<h2>            Hello won&#39;t complete login after facial recognition</h2>
                    <p>Hello recognizes my face but then will sit and not complete login. I can choose the option of entering a pin and can then get in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After sleep, it does recognize my face and allows me back in without my having to enter a pin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled facial recognition and then enabled and set up again. That did not help.</p>

            1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

<p>I've had this issue before and done that, and iirc it only made my pc WORSE. I apparently have the icon cache in a different place on my computer or something and it deleted somethign else which made my pc incredibly slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when i say ive had this issue before, it was my fault that time. And i had to completely reinstall windows 10 again.</p>
<p>This time, ive done nothing to deserve this. I have no idea how it happened but i know that the update did this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure i should clean the icon cache because of what happened last time, is there any other alternative?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i just ran the .bat and it didnt do anything. All my icons are still gone. It said that some folders or whatever were denied access, which i weird. I tried to screenshot it but i couldnt open paint after i had done it so there isnt a screenshot i can
 give you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do not want to reinstall windows again. This makes no sense, why are my icons gone overnight i didnt even do anything to deserve this it completely ruins my computer because i dont know what is what... please give me a solution that actually works</p>

            <p><strong>1</strong> If the icons suddenly just disappeared, personally I'd update my Anti Virus program and run a full scan to see if it now finds and removes any malware. Reboot and see what happens then.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2</strong> If the Icons are still missing then try an <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2895-sfc-command-run-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SFC /scannow</a> and see if that finds and fixes any errors. If it does, reboot and see what happens then.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3</strong> If that still doesn't help, you could then at least as a test, try to create a new user account and log into that to see if the Icons are working in that account. In which case, you could consider migrating your data across to the new
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR finally,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a choice. If you think an update caused it you could try a <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4588-system-restore-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
'restore'</a> to a date just before the Icon disappearance. Or you could possibly try a
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4090-refresh-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Refresh</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both should leave your accounts etc in place, but some programs may need to be re-installed, esp with the REFRESH option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE: However, either way, IF you have any data on the PC thats important to you, its best to back it up first before trying either, just in case. Or wait a while to see if someone has alternative suggestions.</p>

            <p>1. I clearly said in the OP that its not a virus. I ran a good scan, with malwarebytes. Its up to date, so no it isnt a damn virus</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did it, nothing happened. No errors detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Did it, still no icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Seems to be the only **** option here huh.</p>

            <p>A System Restore to a date before the problem occurred should not lose anything other than programs/drivers/updates you have installed after that (restore) date. So its probably at least worth trying a restore and then maybe a refresh before completely reinstalling.</p>

<h3> ltcolselect  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Boot loop malfunction</h2>
                    So, I have an Asus essentio desktop PC that I recently updated to windows 10, it worked great for a little bit, and at one point, there was a power outage, which brought about an endless "preparing automatic repair" boot loop where it gets past the Asus
 to the windows boot screen, tries to start the auto repair functions, but before it can do anything, it restarts and goes through it all again. I have tried to use the media creation tool from a usb, but the only option that gives me is to do a clean install.
 really want to avoid doing that. any tips on how I could recover my computer?

<h2>            Large video files won&#39;t transfer with Win10 from iPad</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to transfer some video files from an iPad to a Win10 pc. I have 2 smaller (less than 5min) videos and 1 large video (about 35 min). When I connect the iPad to the Win10 PC file explorer will display the two shorter videos, but not the long video.
 If I connect the iPad to a Win7 PC, all three videos will display in file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me like there is a setting or restriction in Win10 that is preventing file explorer from finding/displaying the larger file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span> and check if the issue persists.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"> </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> </span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong> </span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I also suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC scan (System file checker) scan.</strong></span></span></p>

<h2>            Zombie ranking up</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so I played a lot of zombie games when I first started I sucked I will admit it, I would go to like 10 rounds, and I had a lot of downs well I finally wanted to know how ranking works. I can tell you about 80% what you read is false. but what seems to
 be most accurate is the k/d&nbsp; and team helping. If you don't know what this is than you should not worry about ranking. I played on my account for long enough i have 99k kills but a kd of only 110 with a high level of 39 and over 700 downs I sucked like I said
 I never played zombies tell BO2. I wanted to&nbsp;be good and pro at it so I learned&nbsp;and taught my self strategy's heard about running trains what not. moving on&nbsp;I read for skull with knife you need to be 80 to 100. well that's false every new map pack that comes
 out they move the bar up a little each time. because so many people are getting the skull shotguns now. So if you have an account with over 500 downs than start a&nbsp;new one it will take you a lot of game play to get any new level. I started my new account being
 experienced and now have&nbsp; 30,560kills and&nbsp;72 downs which is a kd of (424.44). my avg round is 31.5 and a high lever of 51. I figured avg round by tracking my rounds for a week from good to bad.
<span>so I have come to think if you have a kd of 100 to 175 you will get dagger shield, and 230+ you will have shotguns side note this is about 15 rounds with no downs.</span>&nbsp;but note when you start new account you need to

 at least get around 20k before stats mean a thing, you can play one round and get skull but you will be there tell around 20k kills. and to get good stats try for at least
<span>2k kills&nbsp;a day</span>. oh and deaths don't worry about that so much just try to survive&nbsp;1 game to 1 death. as in you can all go down in a round and round ends I mean a death as in being silly and doing RIP perk and what

 not. and killing self more than once if you want know more ill post more its just to early to type more.</p>
<p>and know to if you go down 2 times in a game try to have 400 kills at least so that 2 downs will equal to 200 I know in solo round 20 is about 550 to 620 in kill range so you can avg 2.5 downs a game</p>

 it? Don't contradict other people if you can't back it up mate, or you make yourself look like an idiot, you may not be but that's besides the point.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell from researching, people have tried out heightening their stats in specific areas to see how it affects their rank. K/D was a part of it, but a small one. I read somewhere (lost the page, I'll see if I can quote source later) that the
 ratio of your team mates who have died to the amount that have gone down. So the percentage of times you revive a downed player instead of letting them die. Not in any way confirmed something to chew over. Which would mean the TombStone perk is not a great
 one to use if you die more than 3/4 times in a game with a team.</p>

<h2>            Are Gamertags under Copyright&#47; trademark restrictions&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was considering changing my gamertag to a very well known branded name, but it is trademarked/ copyrighted. Could there be legal action taken against me if I use such a name? What are the rights given to us as members of the Xbox live community and limitations
 to which our Gamertags can be?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 display support problem</h2>
                    I have hp Compaq nc6120. I recently install Windows 8, previously I use Windows 7. There was a driver problem with Display Adapter but on Windows 7, driver of Vista was used after some adjustments. Now on Windows 8 the problem can not be fixed, it has
 Mobile Intel 910/915GM. I know it does not support Windows 8 but I was wondering is there any way to fix video playing problem only, I am not interested in display effect just video playing.

            Hi! unfortunately, it's up to the developer to make them backward compatible, plus when it comes to sport games licences can be a problem.Also remember that backward compatibility was put on hold.

If for some reason system restore fails to get your desktop icon back, try these tutorials :<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 do not use the same controls as XP - see the previous<br />
reply above for some methods.<br />
<br />
Don't forget you can set Permissions to restrict access though any ADMIN can<br />
change them.<br />

    <title>SP4 and Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter&#59; Video distortion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jenelle 2  say:</h3>
<h2>            SP4 and Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter&#59; Video distortion</h2>
                    <p>I've set up the MSDisplayAdadapter_3C as a wireless Bluetooth connection to my HP2009m monitor. The display BEFORE its connected looks great. But AFTER I connect, display is distorted.
<br />
<br />
Firmware has been updated (Wireless Display Adapter app from Windows Store).</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP2009m recommended setting 1600x900</p>
<p>Available through Windows Device Manager when connected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SP4 firmware install date 1/25/2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>Miracast MSDisplayAdadapter_3C --</p>
<p>Driver install date 3/15/2017</p>
<p>Driver&nbsp;date 6/21/2006</p>
<p>Driver&nbsp; Version 10.0.14393.0 (update driver, it's up to date)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Identifies as a PnP driver. And its known connection is to HP2009.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SP4 Intel HD Graphics 520 driver is up to date</p>
<p>Driver Date 7/6/2016</p>
<p>Driver Version 20.19.15.4436</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitors<br />
HP 2009 Series Wide LCD Monitor</p>
<p>Driver Provider HP</p>
<p>Driver Date 6/16/2009</p>
<p>Driver Version 2.0.0.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On the monitor, the Menu shows it is set to 1280x1024-60Hz, with recommended setting of 1600x900-60Hz<br />
<br />
This configuration is not available in the Advanced display settings &gt; Resolution picklist. Best fit (for full monitor use is 1280 x 1024 (1280x768 is recommended, but it is also distorted and the top/bottom inch of the display window is black/unused).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pro resolution of 2736x1824 (Recommended) display is appears in&nbsp;the Customize your display image as 6 times larger than the (physically 2 times larger) HP 2009 monitor.<br />
<br />
Any idea how to get some parity? The extended HP monitor shows fonts in 2 or 3 times the size, plus&nbsp; everything is stretched about 30%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>For us to effectively assist you, kindly provide us the information we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you checked if the monitor that you're trying to use is compatible with your Microsoft Surface Pro 4?</li><li>Have you tried to check the latest update for Intel HD Graphics 520 driver since as you have stated, the driver date was from 07 / 06 / 2016.</li><li>Have you tried to match the resolution from your Surface to the monitor that you're trying to use? Since if the resolution from your main screen is different from the monitor that you're trying to use, then a difference for the quality would show.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Please provide reference for verifying "compatibility" because Windows 10 pro on other machine (HDM connection) looks great. I'm using the MSFT Miracast for wireless connectivity. And it defeats the purpose of a surface pro to change the resolution to
 something that would barely display 1/2 a small dialog box.<br />
<br />
As I said, I updated the drivers, verified, they're all the most current from the device provider. Appealing to the MSFT community because I've gone to the bother to use MSFT products, yet they seem to have dropped the ball on end to end device drivers even
 internally. &nbsp;My thoughts are that the Miracast does not have sufficient functionality for video monitors. And I have 2 to choose from: a 2 year old Samsung and a 6+ year old HP. This shouldn't be rocket science: win 10 on a 5 year old Toshiba can handle 2
 monitors. I should be able to extend the drivers--the underlying dialogs for everything in Control Panel looks like...Windows 7, Windows XP, and Windows 95.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But thanks. All I can do is uninstall the graphics driver and hope that Windows updates is correctly. But. I repeat: that is forcing a brand new preloaded computer &nbsp;(to which I applied a firmware upgrade in an effort to fix this issue). If MSFT is issuing updates,
 I shouldn't have to tweak every driver, including the graphics card in their hardware. Besides, your suggestion assumes Msft doesn't know to do that for their own product.&nbsp;

    <title>&#34;My Documents&#34; went hidden after an NTBackup restore. How do I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#34;My Documents&#34; went hidden after an NTBackup restore. How do I undo this damage&#63;</h2>
                    I installed the legacy NTBackup on a Windows 7 system that was setup last summer, and is new to me in the last couple weeks, to recover a half dozen files, from my failed XP system.&nbsp; (Bad motherboard, HDs were OK. I'd fetched most of the files and folders
 directly, mounting the old C: in an external box connected with USB.)<br />
<br />
Although the restore didn't show any errors that I noticed, the result was that the PATH to the files was restored (in the alternate location I'd specified, a subfolder under C:\Users\tvalten\Documents, aka "My Documents"), but the files were not. I ended up
 using another XP system to restore the files out of the backup with no trouble.<br />
<br />
But... things got interesting on the Windows7 side, after running that 64-bit version of NTBackup from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
<strong>The "My Documents" folder no longer showed in the Windows Explorer view of C:\Users\tvalten\</strong> .&nbsp; It was still accessible from my user account, typing the path directly into Explorer, or a command prompt, and it still appeared under Libraries
 \ Documents.<br />
<br />
I shut down the system overnight, thinking a reboot might bring things back the way they were. But no! Now
<strong>C:\Users\tvalten doesn't appear in Windows Explorer</strong> , or a "normal" directory listing of C:\Users. It has gone hidden for some reason.<br />
<br />
I DO have Explorer set to<br />
<em>&nbsp; Show hidden, files, folders drives</em> <br />
but I see Windows Explorer has TWO levels of obfuscation here. This has also been claissifed as a SYSTEM file. If I uncheck<br />
<em>&nbsp; Hide protected operating system files</em> <br />
as well, I now see the folder listed in the right pane of C:\Users (even though it still does not appear in the left, folder-tree pane).<br />
<br />
C:\Users\tvalten\Documents appears as a top-level folder in Explorer, labeled "Tom von Alten", as well as<br />
&nbsp; Libraries \ Documents \ My Documents<br />
Looking the Properties dialogue from that location, I see several previous versions:<br />
&nbsp; Today - 3/9/2010 9:12AM<br />
&nbsp; Yesterday - 3/8/2010 7:19PM (This is just before the NTBackup "restore" ran, creating that folder tree under this directory at 7:26PM)<br />
&nbsp; Earlier this week - 3/7/2010 5:10PM<br />
and a bunch more from last week, as I worked to restore files from the system HD of my failed XP system, in an external enclosure, mounted via USB.<br />
<br />
<strong>Let's just say I'm a bit nervous about restoring a previous version of a high-level folder.&nbsp; What ALL would that do?</strong>
<br />
<br />
I can still get to the tree and contents, by typing the explicit path(s) into Windows Explorer, or a command prompt, without providing any special permission or click-approval. My apps work as expected, opening data files in the now semi-secret directory tree.<br />
<br />

The properties of "My Documents" (queried via the context menu and GUI dialogue out of Libraries \ Documents \ My Documents) shows the Hidden attribute, and changing it disabled. (Explorer run as Adminstrator.)<br />
<br />
The command "ATTRIB +H tvalten" returns<br />
&nbsp; Not resetting system file - C:\Users\tvalten<br />
<br />
The ownership of this directory (reported by DIR) is the same as the other user's home directory -- NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The UAC stuff showing out of the GUI shows that SYSTEM, tvalten (which is in the Adminstrators group), and Adminstrator all have Full Control
 on it. It's not "Shared".<br />

            As far as I know, ntbackup is not compatible with Windows 7. It is not even included with Windows 7 and you have to use some tricks to make it run.<br />
<br />
If you believe that your only problem is your home folder that has a hidden and a system attribute then you should be able to resolve the issue with the attrib command that I gave you in my first reply.<br />

<h2>            Someone using my sister&#38;&#35;39&#59;s account on another Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>To start off I was Facetiming her while at my apartment in another state. This morning while Facetiming her I decided to turn on Pandora on my xbox one and noticed her account was online playing Titanfall, (a game she has never owned) while she was in her
 kitchen cooking. Obviously we took the correct measures required during a standard account hack, changed passwords, change passkey, etc. The problem we have is when checking her recent activity using the Microsoft website, xbox one logins on her account were
 not present from the site. Also while loading up her save in GTA V (a game that the account hacker was playing before she logged onto her account) had a save in it on the cloud from another xbox one, basicly saying another xbox one was logged into her cloud.
 My question is how do we check where her account was last logged into, as in how do we find the culprits location (IP Address) from where they last logged into her account?</p>
<p>And on a further note how do we remove another xbox from her cloud.</p>

<p>Hi there. </p>
<p>Now that you have changed the password to the account I would delete and recover it. This will then disable it on the other console and when the unknown person attempts to sign into her account again it will ask them to sign in and provide the password.
 If they cannot provide the password they will not be able to use the account. </p>
<p>Has your sister ever used her account on someone else's console? </p>
<p>No one on these forums will be able to help with where the account was last used but your best bet is to contact xbox support and take this matter up with them directly. They will be able to ensure your account is secure and not usable on another console.
 Whether they can tell you where it was being used, I don't know, I doubt it. </p>

<p>Hey, </p>
<p>To supplement what MeanMachine 47 said. The only way for the hacker to be able to gain access to your sister's account is for him/her to sign in the new password. Also, by adding a new security proofs such as email or phone number and removing the old ones.
 This ensures that the account will be safe from any unauthorized access. </p>
<p>However, with regards to contacting support to check where the account is being used. Unfortunately, they can't. I tried that before and as what they have explained. Such information is not available through there end. Its a breach of customer's privacy
 if they can locate or determine the ip address where the account is being used. It can be used against the customer if by chance the account was hacked. They can know the address and any other valuable information. But I know it is also beneficial if such
 information is available to them to relay to us. </p>
