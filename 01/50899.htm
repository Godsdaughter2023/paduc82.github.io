<h2>            Who else finds windows 8.1 confusing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm admittedly new to windows 8.1 but had no problems with 7 and xp in the past (this is probably where my issue stems from). I just CAN'T get my head around 8.1! I'm sorry Microsoft but you've made a neat OS that is just too confusing for people to adapt
 to. The experience is jarring, and does not feel natural.&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;was quite easy to navigate - why change that?&nbsp;Please get rid of the cheap looking tiles and just give us a desktop again. At least everything will be in one place again instead of spread haphazardly
 over two different types of interface (a third if you include the strange charms/search thing).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else out there have a similar opinion? I've spent more time on my new laptop trying to get around the nausea of 8.1 than actually use it productively. I'm writing this more to try and get a message through to Microsoft rather than seek actual
 answers or responses. It's just there seems to be so few avenues for a regular person to give feedback to Microsoft developers.</p>

            I agree with you.&nbsp; I found that the desktop was easier to maneuver instead of searching for hidden icons all over the computer. As of now I don't even know what search engine to use.

            Your not alone. I'm ready to through Windows 8.1 out the window. If something is good, don't fix it. This is how they keep there jobs. Creating a new program. If they sit around, there would be a lay off. So they try creating new things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seen the
 same stuff in manufacturing with engineers and management. Windows 7 is much easier and faster. I had the Geek Squad try to fix my windows 8.1. They made it worst. Now I;m between a rock and a hard place. I use word and office and scanner often. now I can't
 use it the same or none at all.

            <p>I have been around windows 7 mostly. Recently I have been trying many, many Linux versions. I am sort of a distro freak. Recently I had to get into windows 8.1 to help a neighbor. 8.1 is very difficult for a laptop user. I&nbsp;do not care for the Fisher-Price
 colored, &nbsp;toddler lego blocks. After trying many versions of desktops, my favorite one is still 'enlightenment' . I intend to advoid 8.1 as much as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel there several main problems that the system designers just don't get.</p>
<p>1. Quit assigning names to things that tell nothing of what they are. Keep the names simple. If it is a house, quit trying to call it something else. Guessing what they call it is difficult. Layout should be logical to the point that you don't have to search
 for things.</p>
<p>2. Naming groups of things. The best example of this is 'control panel'. They went from having a thing with a large number of items in it to just a few. So few that you would not know what to pick to find what you wanted. The trouble with the many thing
 approach is the names. You would have to guess what uninstall was under. Windows is not the only ones bad at this. Some Linux distros are worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many other things, but you must have the people able to use it at their level. The learning curve should lead toward the masses.

            <p>I bought a new desktop computer at Christmas time. It had windows 8.1 already installed. It is stupid, very confusing and downright useless. Also most of my old programs that I used on Windows 7 are not compatible so in order to use this stupid computer
 I will be forced to buy new programs as the old ones dont even have an upgrade that is compatible. &nbsp;I use my PC to work with photographs a lot and am forced to use an old Laptop that has windows 7 in it. &nbsp;Please Help and make this stupid computer work. as
 I am very dissatisfied with windows 8. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Works for windows files will not open on Windows 8.1, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also 8.1 will not allow me to install my Ulead photo program 4.1. the older program Ulead 2.1 will work but does not have all the features of 4.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also The Print Shop by Broderbund will not install on 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>all of my older files typed on my old PC are not compatible with 8.1 nless I rent Office program. Why should i have to rent a program when I already have these files typed up and on disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I hate windows 8.1.</p>

<p>Is okay to plug the Xbox one power supply in to a surge protector power bar ? Or better directly to the wall. People say Xbox will lag when pluged in power bar? &nbsp;The other thing is why does the light on the power supply stay Orange after unpluged from wall
 for say 30seconds.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>like mentioned by gds1972 the support pages recommend not using a surge protector because as far as I know there is already one build in the power supply.</p>
<p>Regarding the light staying on for 30 seconds, that is caused by some power still present inside the power supply etc when disconnected and since a led light consumes very little power it will stay on for some time. The same thing occurs with my console and also happens with our TV, nothing to worry about.</p>

<p>Have they changed the power supply since released date. One of my friend have have had his Xbox one since realeased date and when he unplugs his power supply and plugs it back his makes a sound like the fan is coming on and color goes white to orange, but
 mine I just bought 1 week ago has no sound or fan coming on just goes to orange light

            <p>Not that I know, but I have seen people experience different fan sound levels, maybe his is just a bit louder.</p>
<p>Regarding the light, since there is a surge protecter in the power supply, his could just do something more when connected to power.</p>

<p>It's normal for it to run warm when you say "hot" &nbsp;dose it burn you to touch it? Or is it just hot in general within you being able to touch it.It dose have a fan and capacitors in the power brick the capacitor explains why the light stay orange for 30 sec
 mine dose that as well.</p>
<p>Also do you have the Xbox One on Energy Saving mode or set to Instant On? If it is on Instant On after you shutdown the Xbox it goes into a lower power consumption mode to look for updates and so it boots faster but the light will stay white if you have
 it on Instant On this will also cause the power brick to stay warmer. But it should run warmer when the Xbox is on playing games or using apps etc.</p>

<p>I recently got the Elite Bundle and the power supply that was in the box did not seem any different from the Day One Xbox Power supply I used.</p>
<p>Also have a look at these two pages hopefully they can shed some light on the issue.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Professional edition and I'm setting up the family computer. Seeing as we have a rather&nbsp;large family, and most members of the family have requested their own account, there's going to be a LOT of accounts. I don't want all of those
 accounts to pop up in the start menu when you click the name &amp; picture of the currently logged in user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way to do this?</p>
<p>I have access to gpedit.msc, if needed.</p>

                    <pre>     Guys, I need very important information. I need to find out what kind of component is on the joystick boards
(see the photo). In my opinion (But this is not exact), it is an SMD transistor. I met markers 303 and 304 on it.
I need exact information. I want to repair my joystick, because the LT key is not working on it because of this 
transistor.

I apologize for my English, I was bad at school =)
( Forum dont give me download more photos =( )   &gt;&gt;&gt; http://uploads.ru/EkhTm.jpg&lt;&lt;&lt;    &lt;== This ZOOM picture transistor 303 (or not)

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on rating stars in the details pane the star color is pale blue. The button doesn't respond to the rating&nbsp;selected.The help instructions are pretty much useless. When trying to rip music from an audio cd it took me about 45 minutes to find the
 rip button. I found out, one must click the device first. I'd like to learn how to use it but as Windows OS changed I haven't been able to keep pace. The instructions got more confusing. Pleas help if you can?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 movie maker no sound on imported videos</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and recently updated Movie Maker. I am creating video off a Panasonic GH4 and have crystal clear audio when I just open the movie file. But, when I move it into Movie Maker, I lose all audio. I am using a file converter and changing it
 from MP4 to WMV because that's what I read to do previously. No luck...still isn't working. Any suggestions? (And I'm not overly technical, so I don't really understand code and such.) Thanks!<br />

            I deleted the version I had. It was actually a part of the Windows Essential 2012 edition. But it was with all video files. I purchased a file converter to swap the video from MP4 to WMV after reading that would be the solution. It wasn't. What version

<h2>            Cannot turn on Network Discovery</h2>
                    <p>When I try to turn on network discovery, I do not get an error it just ignores the request and does not turn on. I have researched and turned on all the services. I just can't see any way to get this to turn on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I turn off the windows firewall it works fine, but as soon as I turn it on it stops working. Im using Windows 7 OS and Microsoft Security Essential. I have removed and reloaded the MSE but I get the same results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I select Network Sharing Center (1) then</p>
<p>Windows Firewall (2) then</p>
<p>Allow programs and features through windows firewall (3)</p>

            <p>Hi Arthur,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community!</p>
<p><br />
I understand that you are unable to turn on the network discovery. I will try to help you with this.</p>
<p><br />
1) Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p><br />
Method 1: Make sure that Network discovery is not added to firewall.</p>
<p><br />
1. Open Windows Firewall by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type firewall, and then click Windows Firewall.<br />
2. In the left pane, click Advanced settings. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
3. In the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security dialog box, in the left pane, click Inbound Rules, and check if any exceptions are added.</p>
<p><br />
For more information please check this link:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-a-port-in-Windows-Firewall</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional information:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Method 2: You may verify if the following services are started and set to automatic in services window.<br />
To do this, follow the steps below:<br />
1. Click on Start<br />
2. Select Run, type "services.msc" and check if these services are enabled:<br />
- TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service<br />
- DNS Client<br />
- Function Discovery Resource Publication<br />
- SSDP Discovery<br />
- UPnP Device Host<br />
To start the service and set it to automatic, follow the steps below:<br />
1. Right-click one of the services listed above and click on Properties.<br />
2. Click the General tab, and then, next to Startup type, select Automatic.<br />
3. Click Apply, and then click Start.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;If the above steps do not help, create a new user account and check if you can turn on Network discovery.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;Create a new user account check if it works.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p><br />
If it works in a new user account, then you can consider the old user account as corrupt. You can check the link below on how to ‘Fix a corrupted user profile’</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Please post back if you are still experiencing the issue. I will be glad to provide you with the additional options available that you can utilize to get the issue resolved.</p>
<p><br />
We look forward to hearing back from you.<br />

<h2>            The Humble indie Supplement&#58; Not a licenced product in the MW3 brand</h2>
                    
<p>Well I’m back and before I get moaned at for how late this one is kindly cram it as I’m in no mood, nor have I been in much of a mood for a fair while, which makes it perfect for me to do more reviews of whatever piece of crap some indie developers are trying
 to rip us off with this time and if any have produced anything worth the asking price.</p>
<p>So now I’ve emptied the water out of the phone line, listen to BT apologise because their local server farm exploded or whatever they did this time, r had a lot of people point out how sad it is I’m still single while I appear to be the only one out of my
 4 cousins not in a steady relationship it’s time to get on with this weeks supplement before my ex decides to once again message me blaming me for everything from her dog now being ill to the drought in Africa.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Math Fighter</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> OK having reviewed a maths game last time and given it a passing grade I went into this one expecting to have the average readjusted quality wise but it turns out the quality of Indie marketplace Maths games is definitely proving there’s
 a large standard deviation from the normal kind of maths games. This game is fun, this game is challenging, I’m no moron I did pass A level maths but man even playing this game on normal the computer still got a few over on me as there’s some quite tricky
 mental arithmetic stuff such as 90/6 which unless you use the quick shortcut trick will have you scratching your head. The game itself plays like a puzzle fighter game-ish, you get questions right you attack, more questions answered first in a chain gives
 you more powerful attacks, you can taunt (which I’m not quite sure what it does but it’s funny) and with sufficient chained attacks or when your opponent is close to death you are allowed to use your super weapon attack. Additionally there’s a hint system
 in the game for those struggling, it has a wider range of questions than the previous title with pretty much every numerical question you could want, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions , decimals and percentages and a wide
 range of comic characters to pick from Robots to Caveman to Einstein to a **** teacher (okay maybe it’s not overt but have you seen her)</p>
<p>One ever so slight fault though is&nbsp; the Americanisation present in the game as unless you’re fully versed in American currency and its values (yeh yeh it’s not hard but I know pounds and Euros and not the American currency method of coin values ok) maybe
 if had been Euro values I’d give the developer credit but its dollars.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Actually worth the 240MSP asking price even oddly if you’re not studying for a test as the game is fun and by fun I mean more fun than doing the countdown maths round what, that’s sad ? well you know where to go, that’s right to the music
 department to pick up a guitar and suddenly be considered a more worthy human than people trying to better mankind while all who have been stuck in labs slowly die. **** you ex **** you making me choose between you and education</p>
<p>[Technical issues please stand by]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Pigs Can’t Fly</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well the game is quite fun, it’s like Extreme baby maker but without the humour concept, its pressing A to dive and build speed then oddly hammering right bumper to keep flying all for points, there apparently some upgrade system but that’s
 not in the trial or even mentioned more than the option and it trying to get you to buy the game.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> There’s better out there, if you want a quirky 360 game try one of the Extreme babymaker games or “try not to fart”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Avatar Fighter online</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> ah an avatar fighting game, the last time I reviewed one of these it was a terrible game where you could win by mashing the buttons like mad, so imagine my surprise when this turned out to be a deep experience with plenty of premade fighters
 and the ability to use your own avatar and customise it into the fighter you want, sure the trial is a bit limited move wise but there’s still a variety there, and nothing was funnier to me at least that watching my captain Smiley inspired Avatar beating the
 pixels out of the other avatars.</p>
<p>I also found it amazing for the price that this game does have online play (though I haven’t tried it but it can’t be worse than some fighting games netcode ) also the game seems to fix what I consider a serious problem in fighting games and that’s the unstoppable
 combo, every game seems to have one or more, a way that poor players can learn to beat anyone by using the same 1 or 2 moves in combo to permanently juggle the enemy or make it so they can’t fight back, well in Avatar fighter a well timed block and attack
 following can act pretty much like the Mortal Kombat combo breaker special as I found out when I was being hammered by an AI controller player only to block a flying kick and return with a dragon punch, the reason this works is by blocking a physical attack
 the enemies animation chain slows so the move takes slightly longer to complete, letting you use the short extra time to attack back, essentially rewarding you more for learning to block.</p>
<p>The game also has a rather amazingly done power move gage to let you do a super powered devastating move such as the giant fireball or a stun attack which for an 80MSP fighting games is amazing.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> OK so it doesn’t have as many moves per character as many modern fighting games but I consider this better as it doesn’t require me to know a complex finger gymnastic sequence do do the special moves and it relies more on the right moves
 at the right time that to me is the essence of fighting games yes it might be a bit of a pureist attitude but I still feel fighting games should be about the moves and timing and not about great knowledge (same with shooter where I believe being able to shoot
 should be considered better than knowing where on the map you can sit and kill people without being hit by the enemy easily).</p>
<p>Easily the best fighter on the indie marketplace and it takes the crown from Pajamorama especially due to its low cost, a must buy for all fighting game fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Project Windstorm</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> ah talking about the game a bit, well it’s hard to talk about this game as I don’t think I’ve ever played a game quite like it before with possibly good reason as this game seems to take ques on development from the pilot wings games in
 particular the parachuting sections, however decided rather than make a game about skilled parachuting trying to make a combat game. The game is unique it must be said, but then again its unique like that guy who is totally not me with a tie round his head
 air guitaring along the club floor at 2am in the morning. The game has control issues, despite the tutorial I still can’t tell you what the controls do and I’ve played the trial twice already, what I can tell you is they seem to be a mystery in themselves,
 some react right away however pulling the parachute seems to take an age and in a game where parachuting is kind of the main aspect not knowing if it’s working is a huge *** you to the player as is the insane precision required to do some of the missions.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> In most sky diving games or ones with skydiving you open the shoot and that’s it, in project windstorm it becomes an apt metaphor for the game itself as you can close the shoot once opened and plummet to your own death, and this pretty much
 sums up the game, it shoots itself in the foot by appearing at first glance to be an above the odds indie title with real appeal and depth only to cut its own shoot by having nothing on the thing actually work.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Tunnel Vision</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> do you have the ikuraga instinct ? do you have the ikuraga instinct ? do you have the ikuraga instinct ? do you like having thumbs ? do you have a masochistic streak ? do you think I’ve worn this joke out already ? Well Tunnel vision can
 only be described as the result of a developer going “You know Ikuraga well I wonder if it would be better as a 3D game like Lylat wars ?” Well the answer must be no. This isn’t to say tunnel Vision isn’t a playable game it’s just to say it really doesn’t
 know what it wants to be and has an annoying habit of its faults being the reason it’s hard.</p>
<p>The screen quickly fills up with projectiles and you have to dodge them the problem being while with Lylat wars you could dodge and shoot due to the aiming system working however in tunnel vision you seem to have to dodge shots or fire nipping in and out
 not dodging and shooting. Also the shooting has a major issue which for a tunnel shooter makes the problem stick out like a sore thumb, the crosshair doesn’t indicate where the shot will go, much to the confusion of most shooter players (especially COD players
 who expect all guns to fire as lasers) however this isn’t some attempt at development, bullet travel time or any other thing the shots fire in the direction your ship is facing meaning shots will go a fair way off target, this leads to you to learn to copy
 the film Wanted and magically curve shot to hit targets, its true you get 3 hits before you die but when it hard to judge projectile distances to avoid them it makes the game much harder with many stupid unfair deaths resulting not from poor player skill but
 poor game design as some sections require you to be able to judge projectiles distances as the screen is full of them.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If you must have an Ikuraga hard game and are prepared to die a lot and have to put up with a fairly broken system then the game is good but for me a shooter with broken shooting is like COD without the constant you’re awesome pats on the
 back and flashing lights, a little dated, boring and making you wonder why you’re playing this rubbish rather than a far superior design of game.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span></b><b>:</b> Moe Mekuri 2.5</p>
<p><b>Cost: </b>240msp</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Every Week I seem to have one of these appear on the indie market place, a game designed round the concept of *** selling, it’s a very weird concept where you fire a ball into a field and have to turn all panels round, each round bringing
 a more provocative shot of the anime esc girl. The game feels a bit like chu chu rocket with the same sense of WTF do I do to finish this level and sense of confusion. The trial is very limited so how nude the girls get I don’t know though as xbox live indie
 games rules mean you can’t have a game showing nudity based on turning / breaking blocks (not meaning some cunning individual couldn’t make a non block breaker turner with nudity etc) I’m going to guess at very little actual nudity maybe some teasing shots
 etc. And If you think this is the same as my review of Moe Mekuri 2.0 then yes it is indie developers don’t bother with any real new content in new releases, so why should I bother ?</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> some nice music selection options for the full version but with another puzzler of arguably better calibre released this week you have to ask yourself is it work paying 160MSP more for a game just for some “tantalising” pictures of anime
 esc girls. I’d say no as the internet exists to save you those 160MSP but it’s up to you in the end.</p>
<p>And another indie developer manages to pump out essentially the same game with fixes for the problems however releasing it not as a patch but a full new game. Wow I’d be annoyed if companies did that to say balance characters, would be more annoying if they
 then added paid DLC for people to get up to the latest version, isn’t that right Marvel vs Capcom 3 fans ?</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Wirral Railway and garden plants</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok really it’s a quiz game, I know nothing about the railway stations of Wirral nor do the rewards of information about plants make me want to learn. Now taking the ven diagrams of being a gamer, having an interest in plants and knowing
 about railway station of Wirral and being interested in indie games must have such a small cross over of those groups its almost the same as people in the civilised world who claim to never have heard of the Twilight series (lucky gits) and before a maths
 graduate tells me ven diagrams cross over are ors not ands let me just say get back to modelling the maximum profit for soup cans like most maths graduates will find their degree being used for.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Well if you are in that small group you’re in luck this is the only game you will ever find for your exact loves of railway stations of Wirral and plants. I don’t know if it’s actually the most sad thing ever even more so than being a train
 spotter though probably not as sad as writing reviews like this with pathetic attempts at humour.......</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Wacky waving inflatable arm flailing avatar</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok I found this bit on family guy mildly amusing and that’s why I got this game trial and OMG kill me now this is horrible my eyes are bleeding with the horror and my ears are trying to kill themselves to stop me hearing the horrible robotic
 speech function thing used to put the audio in which constantly loops while your avatar waves its arms and you play a version of Simon says while random animal noises are played. I think this could be used as a form of torture at least&nbsp; until the Geneva convention
 bans it for being a particularly cruel and unusual weapon, the game does have one use though. If you have someone telling you how MW3 is the best game ever, show them this, then tell them that’s what MW3 is like if you remove what little game there is under
 it and just showed the flashing lights and whistles.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Avoid it even if you really loved the family guy sketch, your eyes and ears and brain as a whole will thank you for it.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Don’t Feed the trolls</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well I probably should hate this one as its almost another glorified Simon says game however I don’t as unlike most other Simon says rip offs this one has tried to be new in so much as it can be new. You have to feed the bears as they
 appear with the A,B,X,Y buttons while using the left analogue stick to slap any pesky trolls about, so feed the bears not the trolls. All in all its kind of enjoyable in that it’s not super brain consuming but it doesn’t feel like its brain rotting either.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 80 MSP well there’s better out there for this price but if all you want is a quick relaxing game you might have found the one for you here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Falling Blocks</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok I made a snap judgement on this one based on the games box as I was all fired up to write a scathing critique about how this game is ripping of tetris very poorly. Then I started the game up and read the tutorial and went “wait what
 !” as unlike it appears this is not some tetris based puzzle game about slotting blocks together, it’s a very intelligently designed platformer game you see the whole game is in first person and sees you trying to dodge the falling blocks in order to climb
 higher up to get more points, the game is near perfect in this aspect as it has power ups such as the zapper which removes blocks that might be in your way, the warper which teleports you extra jump power ups, and a double jump with its own cool down meter
 . Finally the game does something amazing which if violition had thought of for red faction 3 it might have been a very different game. A warning system to tell you when something is about to drop on you and an in built look upwards right away button. This
 game is challenging from the get go and has multiple difficulty levels to help make you feel you are getting better and advancing at the game</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> for 80 MSP its worth a look in, if it had multiplayer split screen or something I’d have been singing its praises much more but as it is 80 MSP is a fair asking price for the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Robotriot</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> hhhhmmm it seems very apt in this time we have a game about working as an intergalactic repo man (and no not in the sense of repo men from the genetic Opera as that would be a lot cooler though probably banned from XBLIG) well Robotriot
 sees you take on the role of an intergalactic repo man, boarding ships and shutting down their generators so the main repo ship can come in a tow the ships back to yard and reposes them, you also have to shut down the boss on board. All in all this game feels
 very much like megaman game though without the hair pulling difficulty level or actually much of the charm as such. It’s not a pad game its quite well made but its missing that extra wow factor.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> &nbsp;A fine game if you have finished megaman 9 and 10 and want a break from constant deaths but don’t expect anything out of this world, but for 80 MSP it can claim it has value for money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Convict minigames</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well if you’ve read most of the previous humble indie supplement stuff (who am I kidding no one reads this stuff) you’d know I haven’t had the best luck with games claiming to be made up of minigames and well this one puzzles me. I don’t
 know if I can legitimately put it down for being bad when each of the games could manage the 80 MSP asking price of a low end indie game heck at 48 points per minigame its hard slate them so I’ll look at each game on its own now so you know what you’re getting.</p>
<p>Bop! Is a combat game for two players, you pick you character then the idea is to jump on the opponents head until you flatten them, with only one character in the trial it was fun enough but the full version promises more characters each with their own
 set of extra abilities, so it sounds quite fun and is to play from what I played.</p>
<p>High hopes – the guy of the girls dreams has been stolen by a giant it’s now up to you to race your rivals up to the top of the beanstalk avoiding lightning clouds and bones thrown by the giant on and shoes thrown by your opponent. Quite fun if a little
 too frantic.</p>
<p>Jurassic bar – a side scoller beat em up that doesn’t scroll so just a beat em up survival game really, last as long as you can as one of the four dinosaurs (only two available in the trial) each with its own attack and special attack, though I must say
 even with only two I couldn’t help feeling they weren’t balanced as the short one actually has a rolling special attack and a large area where its less vulnerable while attacking while the t-rex can heal itself using its special ability.</p>
<p>Cave in – a randomly generated run for your life game, this has the advantage of every game being different but the problem that often it will generate no win run scenarios, it requires luck of the draw and quick reactions to finish, but it’s fun enough
 when you’re not facing kobayashi maru scenarios.</p>
<p>Triangle man – Ok super meat boy has nothing on this evil evil platformer, seriously this game is tough I think 5 levels in I had 13 registered deaths and this is an indie game and apparently is the easy setting with slower speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok the menu might make me want to puke as it jumps from picture to picture but the games themselves are fine</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> for 240 MSP it makes its asking price it doesn’t really surpass it but it makes the asking price so if you are minigame mad and want an alternate to kodu gamelab then this might be the one for you, though personally I say pay the 160 extra
 and get kodu gamelab but still.</p>

<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>: ZOMBIECRAFTT!!1 SAMPLER
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok this is the third game in the skyfish series (though the only way you’d know that is the description or if you bothered to look at the box art and made the connection to those two other indie games with similar box art which I have
 never reviewed or played) Now I have no idea what the aim of this game is, there are enemy things to kill, you can um mine and place blocks in the 2D world and find mysterious ticks. I’m sure if I’d played the other games this would make some kind of sense,
 though then again maybe not, the game explains nothing, no objectives etc, and unlike minecraft or its clones its quite clear that there’s no real point building as you can’t seemingly vary the blocks you place as this seems random.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> &nbsp;240 MSP I don’t know if this game is a very poor attempt at parody or some kind of surrealistic poking fun at the minecraft clone games on XBLIG I don’t know if I should be congratulating it for managing to poke its fun or dragging it over
 hot coals because not only does it fail to come close to the level of the clones it even then makes mistakes not evident in the clone games. Either way this game is not worth the 240MSP as there’s not the gameplay in it it’s just the question as to if this
 was intended to mock XBLIG developers who copy other games or if its genuinely designed to sell at that price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> There will be brains</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well it’s a horde defence game, it’s not a bad one with plenty of options to spend points on but then again it doesn’t go much further than being a pretty simple tower defence game with some fairly nice visuals</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> It makes the 80 point value marker but there won’t be many brains required to play it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Dark Delve</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Dark Delve is a hybrid take on the dungeon crawler very similar to old school games in that you crawl a very well made 3D dungeon with plenty of traps and complexity but every so often you will run into enemies in the dungeon and begin
 a traditional RPG style fight with classes, limit breaks and magic / skills the fights are quite nice with status effects etc and the finishing fight having a weird item roulette along with fight ratings based on efficiency and hits taken etc. Also you get
 HP and SP recovery from finishing the fights to help restore stuff without having to carry maximum health potions and ethers. There are quite challenging challenge dungeons with timers and the promise in the full version of a running plot. My one minor gripe
 is that some of the dungeon puzzles are one shot only ones so if you mess a move up you can’t get to the treasure but this is probably more of a minor issue I’d say as you don’t really need to get to the treasure chests behind these puzzles they only exist
 more to help you out.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> The best 80 MSP dungeon crawler I think I’ve ever played in indie games that brings back memories of old snes games but with slightly better graphics a must buy for RPG fans as this is possibly one of the best so far.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Flight Adventure 2</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> well having had the pleasure or should that be torment of playing flight adventure 1 game I went into this one knowing or at least expecting it to be bad, but it wasn’t it was almost fun, the controls now work and I managed to get the
 plane off the ground fairly easily and it was possible to fly the thing, I’m sure given more time I could actually get quite good at this game though I don’t really have a desire to as other than the race mode this game doesn’t have much more than a flight
 simulator appeal to it and having tried a flight simulator this game isn’t as detailed nor without effort could you use the complex flight setups people build for those simulators.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 240 MSP for a game when really you’re just paying for the Boeing licence cost I don’t know if i can really say it makes the cost, if it were 160ish MSP I’d be saying go for it or 80 MSP and i’d suggest snapping it up, but for 240 I can’t
 really say it’s worth buying</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> escape the car</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> I don’t remember ever seeing a room escape game on the 360 before so this is a first, and it solves one major problem the fact you can’t screen wipe to solve it which also means it’s fairly easy to get stuck, it’s quite basic compared
 to many others on PC. The one thing that does annoy me is the fact there’s a good chance the trial version is sabotaged to stop you finishing it which is annoying to say the least.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> There’s no escaping it this is the only escaper on XBLIG so if you’re after an escaper I can only recommend this one. I’m sure this isn’t the end of this genre then.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Pixel animator 3D</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A very Very interesting little thing I myself am an animator of sorts [huge youtube plug alert] so I know what its like to animate (and yes I have animated stuff using art programs not just what’s seen as an easy animator but I’m terrible
 at 3D animation and don’t find it fun hence muvizu). But this program offers some interesting options allowing you to animate your own model then put the models into a scene and create and share videos, the problem with this game is its short sighted, you
 can only share with other people with the game and not export them to upload on say, youtube and share with people which is a shame as I’d like to see other animation stuff try and beat out go animate on youtube..</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> The question must be can and does it compete with free programs, well it offers more freedom than say go animate (though not as much ease of upload by far) to put stuff on youtube you would need game recording hardware which though it exists
 It’s not as widespread amongst people into this as it needs to be as mostly its montage makers with this hardware that daddy paid the £150 for just like their copy of COD MW3 where they make terrible montages. Back to the point the issue is the program I use
 for animation (muvizu) offers more freedom and options really for free, though you do need a fairly powerful computer to run it as even mine with fast HD rendering capability struggles sometimes with complex scenes due to the numerous entities in them so people
 might want to get this if they have the recording software for games but lack the computer power to use it might enjoy this however otherwise I see no point to buy this really, sorry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Merball tournament</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Quite a good game with a unique principle of fully 3D gameplay (as in up and down not just left to right), navigate the maze and grab the ball then avoid the opposition team and get to their goal area. The game however falls on some aspects,
 first there no multiplayer which is a sports game is very poor, the next is the fact the camera often leaves the field of play into the void you can still see what’s going on but it ruins part of the game when you screen suddenly ends up with a big black border
 and very little of the fairly original sets.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> It’s a nice game, but I’d wait for the 240msp Merball 2 game with multiplayer and a fixed camera as though they are small annoyances to me at least they have a big impact on the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> The $1 zombie game</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> It seems Zombie games are now a staple in their own right now and most on the indie games marketplace and each one follows the same pattern seemingly as you are placed in an arena facing wave after wave of zombies, and this one is no different
 enter the city as a swat team member trying to survive with different weapons each day provided to wipe out the enemies in a fairly generic city environment. The weapons are a fairly standard selection with two each day, one low powered infinite ammo weapon
 and one high powered limited ammo one the selection of weapons you get given is fairly standard though surprisingly as well as the normal selection of infinite ammo pistols including a shameless parody of the Desert eagle there’s also an **** rifle. In
 the high powered weapons there’s shotguns, heavy **** rifles and a sniper rifle, my main gripe is that though headshots are quite easy to do, with the infinite ammo weapons they don’t kill 1 shot in fact shots anywhere on the body do the exact same damage
 and with the only real incentive to play on being different weapon combos and to survive there’s no great incentive to play on further</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> it may only be 80 points but there’s already a better one out there, so get that one instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> &nbsp;Lumberjack</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> oooooohhhh I’m a Lumberjack and I’m OK and something about women’s clothing, but forget about all that as this is a top down shooter where the enemy is nature, that’s right it’s time to kill&nbsp; Bambi’s mother, thumper and killer trees using
 weapons such as giant saw blades, exploding beer bottles, tommy guns and the chainsaw. With boss enemies to take down etc I can’t really call this any more than a quirky top down shooter, it doesn’t seem to have any great extra humour value that I could spot,
 it’s playable but doesn’t really offer anything to keep you playing.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> There better out there so don’t fall for this Lumberjack in womens’ clothing or you’ll most likely spend a night in for some disappointment followed by a lot of regret and weird feelings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Bird Assassin</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well two redneck games in one issue who’d have thought it, but this one is a side scrolling shooter as does its job a lot better, the game opens with the main character visiting his father at his retirement home when out of no-where a
 evil gang an feathered fowls show up and brutally kill his father, the main character then grabs his father’s old rifle from the mans cold dead hands and sets out on his quest for revenge. You play through various levels and can replay levels to earn more
 cash to spend at gun-mart on more weapons and upgrades, with health coming in the form of a moonshine jug you carry to drink from as you play the game. The levels have a variety of hazards from damn spikey bushes to thorny vines to bear traps and even members
 of the fowl gang out to get you, with a variety of enemies some dangerous and some not and the promise of bosses this game is one to watch and even with a variety of weapons and bonus levels seeing you use miniguns to mow down enemies. In the trial only one
 hostile enemy can be found but as its only the first level its very probable it’s the first of many and when that enemy is a suicide bomber chicken you know the game clearly has its site set on humour and parody. Hell even jumping is a comedy act in this game.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> I think indie games might have found a great area that fits them and that’s comedy and the game quite literally contains something that perfectly describes it, a golden goose. Because this game is great and for the comedy value it’s well
 worth the asking price so this is a must buy for fans of that rarest area of games, the comedy game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Nuclear wasteland 2030</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Welcome to the wasteland gunman it’s up to you to do pretty much the same as every other damn zombie game so far in this first person shooter version of a horde survival game as you fight off the mutant horde which walk exactly like comedy
 zombies, the zombies have fairly well programmed AI and won’t always rush you some hanging back to catch you as you escape. After each wave is killed off it will open a weapons shed for you to get a new gun and heal up.... or it would if it were the full game
 because it screws you over in the trial by having the bunkers be empty oh and they form great zombie traps too meaning the zombies come in behind you and trap you in.</p>
<p>This coupled with the very dodgey aim, the fact headshots don’t count here either (yeh the aim for the head idea seems to have died by now) and the fact in the trial it cuts you off part way through the 2<sup>nd</sup> wave saying buy the game to continue
 means it’s really managed to annoy me</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Again theres a better zombie game out there for the same price, it’s called Dead pixels and is a real amazing game, so leave this game in the nuclear wasteland where it belongs.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Firing range</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> an amazing little game with great graphics and quite enjoyable firing, very reminiscent of the very old game 007 firing range, shoot the targets get scores and use a varied range of weapons with a variety of targets , also with customisable
 targets and gun skins in a very COD approach.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A nice little indie game for 80 points for those who want to shoot at targets that won’t shoot back or want a little bit of a less competitive challenge, so It’s say it’s perfect for both COD morons who want to sit shooting things that won’t
 shoot back and like bright colours and people who just want something a bit more relaxed. Though I can’t help feeling its missed its time a bit as if it were out with kinect compatibility added in so you could finger gun it then I’d be saying it was worth
 more than the asking price</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> If there’s something dead, after the brain in your head, who you gonna call ?</p>
<p>Zombusters..... That’s enough of that terrible joke I should say. Zombusters is another zombie fight the horde game this time with an isometric perspective again zombies take multiple hits to go down, some drop points items, some drop weapons which help
 remove the masses you get to select from 4 characters and change location after 10 rounds, there nothing else I can mention really it’s quite a standard formula by this point the only real extra is the fact you can change the soundtrack at will and listen
 to some of the rock music tracks.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> &nbsp;Well all your paying for here really are the rock tracks so rather than buy this game just put on some rock music and buy the zombie game I reviewed a few issue back because that was far far better and probably won’t be surpassed for a while.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> DLC Quest</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> A game right up my isle as it parodies DLC culture asking how far will DLC go and how much it can break games, you collect in game currency and have to go to the store owner to buy DLC, some stuff you have to ask, will we ever have to
 pay for as DLC as this game has you spending in game currency on use of the pause screen, audio for the game and animations for characters moving etc. Also including useless stuff like top hats or sexy outfits for the NPCs (just a warning there’s only one
 female character in the game so use this DLC as your own risk) The story is very generic by design but worth it and the game include a new staple of indie games, Awardements basically achievements for doing certain tasks in the game some sensible some strange
 like killing all the other NPCs you can in the game.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 80 MSP is a bargain for this little gem, it may be short but its damn fun and worth buying for the comedy aspects of finding what DLC you can buy and the sarcastic jokes about the DLC such as weapons that totally don’t unbalance the game
 and non genre fitting enemies.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> 4-tet music maker</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> The Tenori on is a high tech instrument for the non musical from Japan with a touch interface adjustable instruments and built in speakers, its loved for its connectivity to headphones and other devices and how portable it is allowing
 composing on the move. You might wonder why I’m talking about the tenori on and not about the game, well this game is pretty much a basic tenori on for 360 with all the features so when the real ones cost £599 for the standard version and it goes up from there.
 The problem being with Tenori ons the MP3s you make can be easily exported and its portable with the features on there, so while it is possible with technical messing to wire a recording device to a digital output from your TV or 360 to play and record your
 productions the Tenori on offers a much easier way. So as a way of making music this game fails how all music makers fail in the fact it’s hard to export any work you do make also from playing about its actually much harder to use than a Tenori on (I don’t
 own one yet..... I’m not rich I’ve played on the free flash version online for the Tenori on)</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If you must make music and don’t still have that old phone with the polyphonic ringtone maker about after having played snake on it, and are musically illiterate than me (if that’s even possible) then you might want this, but there’s plenty
 of other stuff out there much easier to use and easier to export stuff from as though I’m no musician I can work out ways to export stuff and record sound stuff well, the issue is it’s a pain. Avoid it like a tone deaf tramp playing a violin in a garden chair
 in the street with his hat on the pavement collecting whatever people throw to him to shut up.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Avatar Planking</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Welcome to Avatar Planking , “what’s planking ?” you ask well it’s the Darwinian theory of evolution in action as the people stupid enough to lye still in dangerous places like the middle of the street or on high structures or in front
 of dangerous or deadly wild animals. What’s Avatar planking then ? well avatar planking is totally removing the fun I see in Planking in that I get to enjoy to tales of horror as stupid gits die from trying to show off to friends by planking some where moronic.
 Avatar planking puts your avatar into the planked position in a number of stupid spots on public licensed photos, you can lye still to see the avatar plank or change the music and scene and that’s pretty much it</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If you like the idea of planking you probably should do it in reality on the top of a cage with a lion in the enclosure under you, If you think Avatar Planking is a great idea feel free to buy it, its your points just don’t expect me to have
 any kind of respect for you at all or sympathy when you realise how stupid and pointless the game is.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Castle Miner Z</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240 MSP</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> OK I don’t know where to start with this one I’m like a kid in a sweet shop where the sweets still have artificial colours and flavours and so taste fine and not like..... I’m drifting back to the point. Do I first rip this a new hole
 for being another minecraft rip off, for being a minecraft rip off with zombies or for being a remake of an already existing minecraft rip off with zombies added in. Well let’s start with the painfully obvious and that it is a minecraft rip off and not a great,
 sure the graphics are better but there’s something about that later on, the essence of the game is gone, in minecraft when you mine stuff you get a sense of progress in this it just clunks with no real idea of how long is left, crafting seems reduced or that
 could just be as it’s a trial version either way it’s not as good as the real thing. Next onto the fact it’s a zombie survival game meaning most of the stuff you craft is related to survival, so bullets and guns basically, also unlike minecraft the zombies
 will spawn in daylight for no apparent reason so there’s no logic like place torches to stop them, you can in the full version place blocks to make shelters but if the same screwed up zombies rise from anything logic holds then there’s no real point and without
 the option for doors shelters are kinda pointless. Which brings me to the next point the zombies spawning they rise from the floor randomly meaning no area is permanently safe and they rise underground too. Now onto the zombies, there’s a reason in minecraft
 they are how they are, they spawn and if you see one you can run and get away, the only creature who can hunt you really are the spiders who being two wide are easy to trap, this isn’t the case in castle miner Z as the zombies can kill you in two hits and
 run faster than you so you have to kill them if they see you, next onto killing, yes you have guns but they might as well have armed you with minecraft weapons as with arrows in 1.9 killing in 2 fully charged shots zombies in this game take 3 shots from the
 gun because it requires you to find diamonds to make diamond ammo, so you can’t run from the zombies, headshots don’t kill them any quicker because you know all horde games are doing that now and there’s no safe place to be so they can attack you while trying
 to gather resources to defend yourself anyway. There’s multiplayer sure because misery of a terrible game loves company. Finally the fact that the Castle miner game exists already so this new tacked on version with survival mode trying to make a quick extra
 buck. Finally there’s a horrible graphics glitch on my TV that happens while playing this game in the form of a horrible random purple like near the top of the screen that flashes when you press any button, so yeh its a huge annoying glitch and considering
 I already had to update the trial from downloading it all of about 3 dayd ago it looks like there was already another big glitch in the game.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> in 1 day minecraft gets its official release and not long after the 360 version will be out and Notch is apparently already working on a horde mode or the like that will be included in the game so don’t get ripped off by this game that’s
 both rubbish as a zombie horde game by making the zombies hard to kill faster than you, outnumber you and able to spawn right next to you without you knowing, of ad the fact they can kill you in 2 hits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> APR Halloween edition</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well another avatar game woo hoo they have a great reputation for being great, this one kinda does better than many however it’s still not great it’s a very standard game you run along the train grabbing coins and sweets while dodging
 barrels, cages and smashing through crates etc, you have to just survive. The Halloween aspect I believe comes from the themes round the game</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> &nbsp;Well there’s avatar panic and the Halloween edition. I’ve only played the one version and it seemed a bit poor, the fact theres a second version that’s been released nearly the same time suggests this is just a cheap way to double profits
 or try to. Avoid it like the barrels it gets you to jump over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Avatar Punch</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> &nbsp;80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> With the release of punchout on the Wii I was slightly envious of a fun boxing game on the Wii and none on the 360, and by fun I mean fun not super realistic stamina management super tactical, now having seen my Captain Smiley avatar wearing
 giant purple boxing gloves beating other avatars up, then I know I’d found something good. The game has a simple enough idea with enough complexity to be fun, there’s high and low punchers, power punches that take longer, high and low blocking and dodging
 with dodging letting you throw a counter power punch in revenge, there’s dazed and knock outs and recoveries as well as a super bar that fills as you combo and avoid being hit to let you access super punch moves.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A true KO for fans after a certain kind of boxing game well worth the asking price so check this one out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> bloody Mary</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Welcome to what was one of the many Halloween special release games so what does the game bring, well an in game video poorly acted on random loop made by some poor jobbing actress who I’m sure has starred as the female lead in multiple
 of the Asylums recent films. Well with the jumpy video comes a mild spot the difference game which due to the poor shooting and studio work often lead to mysterious shadows on the video which plays in the mirror where items are actually shown so the girl having
 two shadows that move independently sometimes is a bigger damn sign then a small patch of red colouring.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Well if the Mary Worth legend is true then let’s hope the makers of this game are on her hit list to stop them making another cheap and terrible game like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Hell’s house</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well this is less game more way to release a poor independently produced horror film so I’ll treat the two aspects separately for as far as the trial let me play.</p>
<p>Game : Ok there’s no pretending this is a simple rhythm esc game you press the button corresponding to the coloured skull on the screen as it passes through the arch at the top of the screen, you’re health is displayed as tarot cards on the side of the screen.....
 or it would be if I could see it because apparently this game is make for widescreen only TVs due to the 16:9 screen not 4:3 as mine is this however didn’t disrupt the movie.</p>
<p>The Film : Ok the film is hard to judge as it wasn’t long into the film that the end of trial thing came up but it’s ok, I’ve seen and reviewed worse [huge youtube plug] the lead actress is suitable horror stereotype by which I mean hello perky and any bustier
 and that top would not be appropriate even as it is I can see bra line but she seems at least competent with some nice special effects (some of which are out of my league effects wise and better than the asylums)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game says if you fail on certain sections there are death scenes which can be unlocked in a death gallery if you finish on the hardest setting.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> It’s a novel thing to be reviewing what is in essence an FMW game, the question is if this is the best way to release this what is essentially a film. I’d actually love to see an indie film spin off as 80 points to watch an indie film, why
 not..... there are other distribution methods out there such as services like blip tv that will pay right away without needing to meet X amount of total views, there’s also been advances in multipart phone TV series so an Iphone or android app for this might
 have been a better use. As is its quite good but it might be one to get a second player for as then one can watch the film while the other concentrates on playing the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> platform hack</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well it’s another one of these real world turning to mystical world with a few jokes in there too. It’s a good enough platfromer though there no indication the main error of levelling down when you die is actually in the real game, the
 ideas are good, the controls work well from what I’ve see</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> not really much I can say other than it seems worth the 80 point asking price but not much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Invasion</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Filling another genre stereotype here comes invasion as you must take on the mission to infiltrate the enemy base silently without setting the alarm off by shooting every enemy in site with guns, this is a self aware 4<sup>th</sup> wall
 breaking comedy side scroller. The Comedy seems to hit the spot of any nerdy side scroller fan ever with lots of jokes and references, the side scolling action not so much as rather than using 6 way shooting you can shoot forward back and you have to press
 the shoulder buttons to aim diagonally up to each side and both at once to aim up.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> &nbsp;The problem with making a parody game is you have to be careful you don’t end up turning your game into a item for people to ridicule and parody and a game with only two way aiming with the controller and a very awkward method to shoot up
 as its required (and yes Megaman only shoots forward and back except in megaman X but still it works there as you can jump shoot enemies)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Ghost mine Dig for survival</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> If you’ve read this far you’ll have read my zombie craft review, if not go do that now just scroll up.</p>
<p>This game is the same really with only the following chances</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can’t place blocks</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are resources which add to your score and count as lives</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The enemies are red blobs not green squiggles</p>
<p>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You use your avatar to play</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can’t hold down a button to mine you have to sit there hammering the x button to mine making it boring.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 80msp goes a lot further than it used to quality wise, with this in mind playing a very tedious game like this can now be avoided, so do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> who’s the daddy</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Coming from the same producers as Bloody Mary and with quite possibly the same actress in a red wig you’re introduced to a dilemma to find the father of the child conceived by IV fertilisation after a girl who couldn’t have *** (not explained
 why) has decided she wants a kid and convinces a guy to help her. The girl comes on drunk and apparently this is meant to be a hybrid drinking game (not a good idea to do this) you then play a game of guess who while the drunk girl on screen who I somehow
 doubt the no *** claims unless its medical grounds gives you clues, you then pick who you think it is from the 5 varied clues (seriously he is well educated isn’t a clue unless he’s in lab specs or has a diploma behind him) you then guess and find out if you’re
 right, or you would, if the game didn’t decide to then pull a “you’re wrong but unless you buy the game we won’t tell you the right answer” and that’s why I said it’s not a good idea to drink along or in a drunken state you might be tempted to by this rubbish.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A company that’s released 2 games in a month both terrible, I think I might have to double check that “The Asylum” haven’t gone into video game production now......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Sensory Overload</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok you fly a spaceship and use a light to find objects while changing your ship between the 4 D pad colours while avoiding hitting anything, which all sounds so easy... he lied .....this is compounded by the fact the controls have that
 weird acceleration and deceleration mechanic so you push in a direction and unless you push another direction the ship will go and accelerate in that direction.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> it’s a very simplistic concept, yet evil in return. I really can recommend it as it’s another pull your hair out game and not one where you feel you die due to your own mistake you feel the game kills you by getting you to dodge change colour
 and use your light to identify objects at the same time leading to you not realising your drifting to the back of the screen then you touch something and die.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Sins of the Flesh</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Welcome to the reason I hate graphics over gameplay games, this one has pretty shallow gameplay with the left stick firing back beams to repel demons trying to drag you down while the white shoots white beams that repel angels trying to
 drag you up, either way you’re screwed as go up and its implied you will be judged and due to your life be sent down anyway. The story is interesting but the question is if it’s enough to put up with the game to find out more.</p>
<p>The implication is while changing radio stations the main character crashed his car and died and has ended up is this strange forest (oddly this game is a 3<sup>rd</sup> title for the same company as bloody mary), The first strange voice you hear tells you
 you’re alive still but must fight to live, when you answer your phone a second voice informs you that minutes in the forest are hours in reality and the time you’ve already been there has seen you buried and your family mourn for you. You’re also told that
 you the main character has lived a life of sin and lust seducing many women and falsely claiming you love them only to break their hearts so badly the killed themselves........... Let me just state I hate this main character, the main character is a **** if
 this is the truth and oddly the false claims of love sounds very much like my ex...............</p>
<p>[please stand by the review will continue shortly once the writer has been talked down of that 7<sup>th</sup> story ledge over the street below]</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Well if the plot intrigues you then buy it but if like me you found the gameplay to be very stale and annoying then chances are it’s a miss and as that’s 3 strikes and 3 misses Silver Dollar games you’re outta here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Motojump</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> A very impressive art style masks a terrible poor game under it, you repeatedly jump longer distances and have to perform stunts for point, that’s really it, the controls work and are sharp but seriously there no more I can say</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Very poor game which looks good but nothing more, avoid it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> no pain no brain</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Very much taking its cues from Big trouble in little china you play a truck driver in the post apocalyptic wasteland fighting zombies with his bare hands, the games is ok even if the side scrolling melee could do with a bit of variety
 to the combos available and the game does willingly admit its trolling you sometimes though it does tell you how to kill the boss even if the method describes is a poor one as there’s a much better trick you can do.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> meh it manages its asking price but it won’t raise the dead with how good it is, though on the plus side it’s not really a horde survival game, at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Plague</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> You remember how I said earlier on about indie games becoming parodies themselves rather than parodying things, this game isn’t one, it’s actually an amazing 4 player side scolling shooter with 8 directional aiming while moving, multiple
 weapons that make sense, in my short time on the trial I laughed at the at the title screen as the possible folder destinations include adult content, I laughed at the character humour as the characters are always passing comment on one another and throwing
 insults around. Then after the tutorial I got into the games zone where I had to fight Apes wearing ties and other such villains and ran into Maurice the plumber who was stuck in a pipe due to eating too many cauliflowers and growing so much he got stuck.
 This zone even included a snake gun weapon and a star gun, oh and cannibalistic flowers.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Well worth a luck in as it makes and passes the 80 MSP worth level by having working controls and enjoyable game play along with humour, and it fixes a problem in many side scrollers by also having a stand still button so you can make sure
 you get your aim right rather than shooting often while running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Indie game News</span></b></p>
<p>Yeh I’m doing another one of these things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Kinecting to the indie marketplace</span></p>
<p>Well rumours are about that as early as the end of this month Kinect support options will have been added to the XNA creator systems, meaning, we’re getting Kinect games from indie developers this can only have one response *yells Hurray in a really fake
 sarcastic tone* this should be funny watching the endless replace you nipples with pineapples games or similar that were going to get replacing all the “massager” games</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">All the Bads things lived up to its name</span></p>
<p>The Developer of All the Bad Things Tweeted recently he was disappointed by his game, not simply the sales but the game itself saying how he wanted to do a lot with the game and feels he managed none of it with only the flaws showing not the ideas, also
 about how the game development felt too far along to not release what he had made and has vowed his next game will surpass it.</p>
<p>For those who missed a few issues back when I reviewed “All The Bad Things” I had very little to say about it beyond actually not being able to comment because of how big the games seemed but how little was presented in the trial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Help Wanted</span></p>
<p>A bit of info for those budding game writers Free Lance games makers of Trailer Park King are apparently looking for a freelance writer to employ though they aren’t saying if you’re writing for the anticipated sequel or a new game entirely.</p>

<h2>            How do I Activate XP after the 7 day grace period has expired&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<div>A couple of weeks ago my PC (home build with XP Pro OEM) downloaded a load of updates via Windows Update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This weekend was the first time I'd switched it on since, and the XP log-on screen now tells me that XP is not longer Activated.&nbsp; I assume this is probably because one of the updates was for the MB (it forced a re-Activation last
 time I manually downloaded newer MB drivers a couple of years ago).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The problem I've got it that when I click any of the user accounts to log-on, it opens an 'Activating' window and then does nothing.&nbsp; I guess it's trying to connect to the internet, but it fails to have any impact on my wireless
 router (no flashing lights). &nbsp;I tried wiring it into the router but it does exactly the same thing. &nbsp;The 'Activating window will quite happily sit there doing nothing for 24 hrs.&nbsp; There is no information provided on the 'Activating' window, and the only button
 is the close 'x' in the top right corner - clicking this takes me bag to the log-on screen where all I can do is click on a user account with the same result, or click 'shut down'.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>IIRC last time I had to re-Activate it failed when I tried to do it online and I had to do it over the phone - but that doesn't seem to be an option now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>How do I resolve this please?</div>

<br />
<div>Well, definitely follow Noel's suggestions. If your issue is simply a need to register some scripting .dlls, you're probably in much better shape than I thought.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, one can never be too safe when it comes to malicious software. McAfee is normally frowned upon in this forum. There are many things it simply doesn't catch.</div>

    <title>Missing Microsoft Points - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing Microsoft Points</h2>
                    
<p>500 Microsoft Points disappeared from my account. There are a few reasons I keep track of them but I was at 1960 and now I'm at 1460. They were not temporary Microsoft points; I received no notice that any of my Microsoft points were temporary, I've been
 at 1960 for several months since the last deposit from Xbox Rewards, and 500 isn't a multiple of 80 so it seems like a really strange increment for temporary points. Nothing in my download history indicates that anyone purchased anything through my account
 without my knowledge. I am completely unable to account for the 500 point deficit.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to get a refund and possibly an explanation of my missing Microsoft Points?</p>

<p>All points from Xbox Rewards do have an expiration. They have to be used within one year of deposit since they are considered promotional points.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Points from the Rewards program come in different increments, not just 80. If you won any points through various Microsoft/Xbox contests, those may also have a 1-year expiration.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Have you checked your billing account online (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">commerce.microsoft.com</a>) to see what that shows?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you think the missing points may be Rewards points, you can ask the Rewards Support team about them here:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using a child account, there are certain limitations imposed on your Xbox account. This could be the reasons as to why you can't access certain features on the game. To resolve this issue, you need to manage the privacy and online safety settings
 of your child account by using the parent account associated to it. To give you an idea, only the parent account is eligible to manage the privacy and online safety settings of the child account. To get started, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in the parent account on this <em><strong><a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-IN/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>.</li><li>Select the Child account.</li><li>Make the changes that you need on the privacy and online safety settings.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know with the result <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
after performing the suggested solution above.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype for Business activity and status questions</h2>
                    <div>Hi All,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just wondering if anyone can help me. I am a manager in a firm and I use skype for business to communicate with my co workers. I am over a group of 10 people. My problem is I am on the road (i would never use the phone while driving my company even has
 a strict policy on this and personally I would never do it myself as it's very dangerous) a lot or in areas where I need to access Skype for business through my phone as I can't use my laptop ie (on construction sites and not always the same ones for different
 periods of time) is their anyway that when I access the program through the app on my phone I can do so without it showing up as "mobile" under the status to other users like say if one of my team searches for me on the program? I know in the pre 2016 version
 if you accessed the program through your phone you showed up to other people exactly the same way as you did if you were accessing Skype for business through the main program on your laptop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is some of my team are reluctant to contact me via skype for business if they think I am not sitting down at a computer or if I they think I am outside on a live construction site and it's becoming a bit frustrating as it's leading to delays
 in certain things our main point of contact in the company is Skype for business we only really use cell calls, texts etc for clients as opposed to internal communication it's just always the way it has been since I started with my current company 10 years
 ago. I don't want to be getting onto people over it as it's only a minor thing but at the same time it is starting to have a major effect</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also while on your mobile how do you keep your status as available even when not using the phone? Say if I lock my phone and put it in my pocket my status seems to immediately change to away 5mins or offline 5mins etc this also has people not contacting
 me when they see this status so is their any way to fix this and to always appear available or what actions exactly cause you to appear offline or away when using the phone app?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lastly is their any way of seeing what your own status currently is? Like for example facebook have a feature on the website were you can view your own profile as one of your friends so you can see exactly what everyone is seeing when they look at your
 profile?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be much appreciated with this as beyond making video calls, voice calls, sharing screen and messaging I don't know too much about Skype for business but for work it definitely my most preferred method of communication.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<p>That could be drivers&nbsp;although antivirus/antispyware/security programs and other hardware<br />
are also probable causes. Updating the major drivers and BIOS&nbsp;would be the best plan of<br />
attack. If needed also try uninstalling your antivirus/security as a test.<br />

Run the Driver Verifier to see if that determines the cause (good idea to update BIOS and all major<br />
drivers so see the next section for those methods).<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (BIOS and major drivers)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is<br />
preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Though not as likely as drivers there is a chance that memory has a role in the issues.<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Turns out there are a lot of different Bug_Checks 19, 1A, BE, 24, and F4.</p>
<p>Use the methods such as SFC, CheckDisk, Driver Updates, and others in the troubleshooter<br />
referred to in this link as they will help solve or at least narrow down the issues. After those<br />
you can post the information from BlueScreenView and these other utilities so we can offer<br />
more specific advice. Of course checking with a real computer shop or System Maker's<br />
Support would be a good idea however I would try the possible solutions you can first.</p>
<p>Check this thread for information using BlueScreenView, MyEventViewer and other methods<br />
to troubleshoot BlueScreens - top 3 replies (+1 other).<br />

<br />
The CAUSE of all, except 1A, was a Windows component which means something else drove them into fault.<br />
1A CAUSE was WLTUSER.EXE which is part of Windows Live Toolbar and also memory corruption. Check for<br />
any updates to Windows Live Toolbar.<br />
<br />
For all check for updated BIOS, low level chipset drivers, other major device drivers and test memory.<br />
<br />
If a PC remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out any dust bunnies and make sure the vents are clear and<br />
that the fans will run. If a laptop about all that can be done is to reseat the memory and clear the vents.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # Any other values for parameter 1 must be individually examined.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: 00061940, A PDE has been unexpectedly invalidated.</p>
<p>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; <strong>memory_corruption</strong></p>
<p>FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x1a_61940_nt!MiSwapWslEntries+59</p>
<p><strong>ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY (be)</strong> - An attempt was made to write to readonly memory.</p>
<p><strong>NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM (24)</strong></p>
<p>This indicates a problem occurred in <em>ntfs.sys</em> , the driver file that allows the system to read and write to NTFS drives.</p>
Cause
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the NTFS file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to
 disk, thus causing the error.</p>
Resolution
<p><em>To resolve a disk corruption problem:</em> Check Event Viewer for error messages from SCSI and FASTFAT (System Log) or Autochk (Application Log) that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Try disabling any virus scanners,
 backup programs, or disk defragmenter tools that continually monitor the system. You should also run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and resolve any file system structural corruption. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition</em> .</p>

So it looks like your RAM is damaged. Please download memtest86+ [1], burn a new bootable CD (use a CD-RW if possible) from the ISO (download and use ImgBurn [2] to do this), reboot your PC and scan your RAM 4-5hours for errors. If it detects errors, replace
 the faulty RAM. Also run chkdsk to check your HDD.<br />

<p>That pattern of errors indicates a strong likelihood of bad RAM.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try running Windows memory diagnostic or memtest86+.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this netbook is new if this is confirmed it should be covered under warranty.<br />

I look on Event Viewer and I see 5 critical errors, along with several "errors" and "warnings"<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
criticals errors say "kernal-power" event ID 41 task category (63)<br />

I have a lot of Service Control Errors as well (which are the level of "error")<br />

            How long did you run the memtest? At least 4+ hours is required.<br />
<br />
"Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem."<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
Did you run Driver Verifier in the troubleshooter I posted above?<br />
<br />
Since its a new Netbook have you contacted the Seller and System Maker for possible replacement<br />
and/or warranty claim? Even if you were somehow able to solve these severe issus you still would<br />
want it documented "just in case" of further down the road problems.<br />
<br />
Update BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers that you can by visiting the<br />
System Maker's site as well as the other major device makers' sites.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            Do you have a third-party anti-software in your computer?&nbsp; Those have been causing innumerable&nbsp;problems with Windows 8, especially Norton and McAfee.&nbsp; If you do, try uninstalling it and setting up Windows Defender.&nbsp; I use Defender and have never had a
 virus, never had a problem updating, or installing safe software such as Adobe, and have never had ridiculous warnings like 'your firewall is off.'&nbsp; If you are interested, let me know and I will give detailed instructions within 24 hours if you need them.&nbsp;
 Note: Defender cannot run with other anti-virus software in the computer.&nbsp; I read that MS did this so they could not be sued for 'deliberately forcing Norton etc. out of business.'&nbsp;

            I use Defender since I was an MSE user prior to Windows 8.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think it would be a good idea for Defender AND another anti-virus to run.<br />

            Your right.&nbsp; Defender turns itself off when you install another anti-virus software.&nbsp; Maybe you could try installing it in Safe Boot, see this webpage:

            "Skipping the update" is a silly thing because there's no guarantee that this will work for the next cumulative update. I'd rather the problem get solved now.

            I was researching this on the web, and I found that sometimes viruses can cause these problems.&nbsp; Why don't you do a full scan of your computer with Defender and see if it doesn't find something.&nbsp; You could also look in your quarantined files in Defender
 and throw away any you find, restart your computer, and try again.&nbsp; You could also follow this forum and see if anything comes up:

            Turned out to be deeper filesystem corruption that required a reinstall of Windows 8. Oh well. At least the update is installed now.<br />
<br />
And why would anyone willingly infect their computer with McAfee or Symantec products? :P<br />
