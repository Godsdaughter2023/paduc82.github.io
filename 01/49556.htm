<h2>            Cannot connect to iTunes</h2>
                    <p>I know there have been discussions about iTunes connection failures in the past, but none related to Windows 7. My computer (Windows 7 Professional N) has recently failed to connect to iTunes. I have followed all the suggestions from Apple, including uninstalling
 and re-installation of iTunes, checking firewalls and uninstalling and re-installing Norton anti-virus software. I have no LAN or proxy server set-ups. Any ideas, please?</p>

            <p>Lots of questions and suggestions - thanks. I drafted my reply in the form of a report, which I was going to attach to an e-mail, as there's quite a bit of it.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the text, replying to your points in more-or-less the same order;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on iTunes (either from the icon on my desktop, or fom the Start menu), there is usually only a short pause before my iTunes homepage opens. But then the “waiting” spiral spins (I’m sure there’s a proper word for it!) for around 10 minutes. I
 assume this is while it is trying to automatically connect to the iTunes Store. When the cursor finally appears, I can click on most of the menu options and song selections. However, when selecting anything that requires a connection to iTunes (eg. Help, My
 Account, check for updates and – of course - Store) nothing happens. In the case of connecting to Store, the spinner reappears; the words "iTunes Store" appear in the middle of the page, then - after a bout 5 minutes. the progress bar at the top says "accessing
 iTunes Store". It stays this way for hours, uinless you cancel. In all these cases, a look at Task Manager shows that iTunes is not responding. If you then select “end now”, a dialogue box states that Windows will search for a solution and will inform me (which
 it never has).&nbsp; If you select “run diagnostics” from the Help dropdown on the Itunes homepage, it states that, whilst Network Interfaces and Internet Connectivity are verified, The Secure Link To iTunes Store has failed. If you click on Help to the side of
 this message, a black box appears for 2 minutes, then the “iTunes has stopped working” dialogue starts.</p>
<p>I followed the procedures in the links you sent me, both to uninstall and re-install both iTunes and Norton 360. In both cases, I attempted to connect before re-installation.</p>
<p>In Norton, I have also checked that the firewall allowes iTunes. I checked this in Windows too, although it states that “these settings are managed by Norton”.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link to the help from Apple.com. I had come across and tried must of these solutions, but I’ve now tried all of them – still with no change. I seem to recall seeing in my long search a mention of replacing the latest iTunes software with an
 older version. I did try this, but I didn’t try the connectivity before re-installation. I can’t find the link with this suggestion now, but it might be worth trying again. Any ideas where I might have seen it (it actually had a list of older versions to click
 on)?</p>
<p>The iTunes version I currently have is 12.6.0.100. My Windows edition is 7 Professional N (32-bit).</p>
<p>This is the first time I have ever had trouble connecting to iTunes Store. I’m not dead sure when it first started, but I’ve traced my last purchase to 6<sup>th</sup> March this year, so I know it was fine then. I can’t think of anything system-wise that
 can have triggered all this. I’ve certainly made no changes. I’m not sure when the last Apple update was – perhaps there has been one since then.</p>
<p>I’ve left your suggestion about Event Viewer until last. I can’t find any Error messages involving iTunes, but there is a strange pattern involving Bonjour, which I gather is connected to Apple. Every day since 19/7/2016 the viewer shows between 30 and 50
 error events (id 100). Strangely, though, there haven’t been any in the last couple of days, which probably co-incides with my attempts to re-install. In&nbsp; addition to this there have been over 50 errors reported for “application hang” (event id 1000). Of those
 31 have occurred in the past three weeks. Finally, there are just over 100 reported for “Load Perf” (event id either 3011 or 3012). These started – like the Bonjour ones – in July last year. There may well be a simple explanation for these, but I thought I’d
 better pass it on to you as it may&nbsp; be linked to the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My knowledge of computers is pretty limited, but hopefully I've done all I can to provide all you need to see if there any clues, or suggestions for further enquiries and tests. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry to say that I don't really have a solution for you, only guesses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try posting in the Apple forum, but although I've seen other posts describing your problem, they don't usually have a solution:&nbsp;
<a href="https://discussions.apple.com/community/itunes/itunes_for_windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://discussions.apple.com/community/itunes/itunes_for_windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You do have the current version of iTunes, so that isn't likely the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said that you used to be able to access the iTunes store and hadn't made any changes.&nbsp; This is a long shot, but check the following.&nbsp; First, however, if your computer is able to connect to your router by either wifi or Ethernet, connect it using the
 method that you haven't been using.&nbsp; Assuming that made no difference or that you only have one network adapter, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Device Manager (click Start Orb, type Device Manager, press Enter)</li><li>Double-click the entry for your network adapter</li><li>Select the "Driver" tab</li><li>Is the "Rollback driver" button greyed-out or is it active (if it is clickable, don't click on it just yet)?</li><li>Make a note of the Driver Provider, Driver Date, and Driver version</li><li>Go to the web site of your computer's manufacturer, enter your specific model identification (e.g., a Dell Service Tag) and determine the date and version of the network adapter driver on offer.</li><li>If the driver installed on your computer is older than the driver offered by your computer manufacturer, download and install the newer driver.&nbsp; If the driver installed on your computer is newer than the driver offered by the driver offered by your computer
 manufacturer and the answer to question 4 is "Yes," then use the "Rollback driver" button to reinstall the older driver.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Bonjour is concerned, you probably can safely uninstall it.&nbsp; This may or may not have any effect on your connection problem.&nbsp; See these:</p>
<p><a href="http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45765/do-i-really-need-bonjour-on-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/45765/do-i-really-need-bonjour-on-windows</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you don't have problems accessing other Internet sites, the symptom you describe sounds (to me, at least) like a security block between your computer and the iTunes store.&nbsp; You said that you have no LAN or proxy server set-ups; I assume that
 you don't use a VPN, either.&nbsp; If the problem remained even with Norton 360 completely uninstalled, the only other thing that I can think of would be some restriction imposed by your ISP.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe, however, that if this was the case you wouldn't
 have heard about such an issue from general chatter in your country (I assume from your use of Windows 7 Pro N that you're in the UK or Europe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the suggestions in the two articles above focus on problems connecting to the iTunes store from an iOS device and suggest trying from a MAC or PC on the same network.&nbsp; You should try the opposite:&nbsp; assuming that you have a wireless router, can your
 iPhone or iPad access the iTunes store over your Internet connection?&nbsp; If you can, then you can be fairly certain that the problem is NOT your ISP or Internet connection.</p>
<p>
The following is just grasping at straws.&nbsp; It won't hurt and might possibly help.&nbsp; Do this after you uninstall Bonjour (reboot after uninstalling Bonjour).
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Open an Elevated Command Prompt (click Start Orb, type cmd.exe then right-click on the link to cmd.exe and select "Run as administrator")</p>

            Sorry - I meant to send an update. I'm afraid I've tried everything you and the Apple communities have suggested, with no success. I think I'm going to have to bite the bullet and ring Apple Support to talk me through these and any other solutions they
 can offer, in case I'm doing something stupid (which is entirely possible!). As a last resort, I guess I can link my Windows pc and an old Macbook I have, which seems to be able to connect OK. I can then download using the Mac, and it should update my library
 on both devices. Or am I being a bit over-optimistic? I will, of course, let you know if there is a solution as yet unpublished. Thanks for your help and advice, anyway - very clear and sympathetic.

            Sorted! Happy to share this. Having exhausted all the ideas Apple came up with (and a telephone chat), I tried once again the rather lengthy process of installing an older version of iTunes, then having to juggle about with older versions of my library
 before I could get it to work. This came up again because there have, apparently, been lots of people with Windows 7 reporting this same problem recently. Let's hope they will issue an update to fix it soon. I know you suggested this action too, so thanks
 for that. Here are the specific help pages to help to do this;&nbsp;<br />

<h3> seakae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Radio signal coming in through mic input</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I have my controller plugged into my XB1, other people can hear a random news radio station through my wired headset. If I hit mute, it goes away. If I unplug my controller and use it wireless, it goes away. I can't hear the radio signal, unless
 I go listen to a playback of a test call through skype.<br />
<br />
I like using my controller wired, so I can cut down on battery consumption. Ideas on what's causing this or how I can stop it?</p>

                    <p>I composed a document in Wordpad...I saved it, then I started a new one in the same document because I wanted to use the same formatting as the previous one. Well, i screwed up because after typing the second document, I never changed the name of it to 'Save

 but there isn't a version available for me to restore from. </p>

                    I downloaded Fable 3 for free through the promo, and began playing a few days later. I got maybe 30-45 minutes into the game and then hit a glitch/bug. I'm in Brightwall Village. I've already talked to Sabine and then headed to the library. When I got
 there, he acknowledged me and told me to follow him "this way". Problem is, he never moved. I've tried walking around the library and I now cannot interact with *anything* there -- the note on the table, the chest, any doors, etc. I push A and nothing happens,
 even though the game is telling me to push A to interact with it. There are no doors I can open or anywhere else to go. The librarian won't say anything; I've tried moving around him, going into different rooms, trying to interact with him by pushing A, and
 so on, all to no avail. The other thing I've tried is leaving the library and going back in. The librarian acknowledges me again, but still doesn't go anywhere. I've tried googling as well as looking at walkthroughs and couldn't e

<p>This is a really late reply but i thought i would post it anyway. The same bug happened to me just minutes ago, in my case it worked by jumping to the 360 dashboard and starting the game again. if you haven't saved manually then the autosave will have you
 begin right at the entrance of Brightwall Village.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would just like to state for the record that I too have this problem and while I have found a way to pin most items (Word, Outlook, Firefox) back on the task bar by finding the actual executable via file manager and pinning from there,
<strong>Chrome will not stay pinned, </strong>even when pinning from:</p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\Chrome.exe<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Pinning anything from the Start screen does not work. That might be a conflict between "Classic Shell" and Creator, which would be something the Classic Shell would need to fix... but I have heard from others who have this problem and are not running Classic
 Shell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also note that currently changes to "Theme' settings do not stick upon reboot. There are other idiosyncrasies in this version of taskbar I find problematic. But while they are, IMHO bugs, it is more an irritation than anything else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC is also not getting error messages. The SFC /Scannow was clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was installed from Microsoft on a clean fixed disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. 2012: This is also a OEM build, but with a Gigabite system board, 32GB DRAMM, both Intel and NVidia video adapters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 In 2016 I installed Windows 10 on a clean Fixed Disk.</p>
<p>3. Answered in #1</p>
<p>4. I use MS AV only. No other AV is allowed on this PC.</p>
<p>5. No.</p>
<p>6. OS Build 15063.296</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Offered &amp; installed via Windows Update. I didn't ask for it. It just installed one day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed post. It is possible that the issue is due to a software conflict. To help you resolve the issue, we suggest performing a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that might be affecting the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: Please go through the section: <span style="font-weight: bold">
How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span> to boot the PC in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Devlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as you requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Loaded MSCONFIG</p>
<p>2 selected safe boot / minimal</p>
<p>3 once in safe mode via File Manager I selected&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\Chrome.exe</span><strong>.</strong> &nbsp;and with the right mouse button selected Pin to Taskbar.</p>
<p>4. Verified it was pinned.</p>
<p>5. Leaving the PC in safe mode I selected restart.</p>
<p>6. Logged back in safe mode. Chrome was still pinned</p>
<p>7. Ran MSCONFIG and unchecked safe mode</p>
<p>8 Restarted</p>
<p>9. Logged in...&nbsp;Chrome was still pinned</p>
<p>10 used the PC for a while and then...</p>
<p>11 shut down (not restart)</p>
<p>12 turned the PC back on and logged in.</p>
<p><strong>13.&nbsp;Chrome was NOT pinned.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In reading the other individual's portion on this thread I also downloaded&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB4020102 .<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It installed without a problem. Rather than reboot, I shut down and once the PC was off, I restarted it. Once I completed logging in for a while the screen was bland and then a small dialog box appeared
 for a bit saying that Personalized settings was not responding or something like that. The box disappeared and the screens came back up as they normally do. (I found no reference to it in the Event Logs.</span></p>

I have tried to pin Chrome back in but have not had an opportunity to reboot yet again. I will do so later, but I note that the other fellow says it made no difference for him.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Mike, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a bit of hiccup indeed. May I ask if you were able to follow this particular article? Here's the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/15059/windows-8-pin-apps-folders-desktop-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>on how to pin programs though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're not 100% sure if the above link is the one you have previously performed. But if it is, please let us know so we can find a better workaround for you.

<p>
</p><p>This issue is not a show stopper by any means though it is mildly irritating. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of items on my taskbar as I find it easier to load the things I always need from there rather than click on start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under most previous versions of Windows, including earlier versions of Windows 10 right up through 1604, when I loaded a program, I didn't get the same icon loading again and on the far right of my taskbar. Essentially it would layer on top of the original
 icon. I liked that very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, under Creator, the icon that loads the program remains "virgin' and the loaded program with the same icon appears in a different place on the taskbar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So If I have a Word Doc loaded but minimized, AND if I click on the left most "W" icon I get a new blank Word "Window". I have to click on the "W" icon on the far right to get back to my doc. &nbsp;As I have a number of programs all pinned to the taskbar and
 running at the same time, my taskbar is now a mess and pretty confusing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I the only one experiencing this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To further isolate the concern, we suggest that you perform a clean boot to disable non-Microsoft services and check if the issue persists. For
 steps on how to perform a clean boot, click<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a></strong><span><span>.
 After troubleshooting, refer to How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting found in the same article. We also suggest to start the PC in safe mode and update us if there will be any changes. For steps on how to start your
 PC in safe mode in Windows 10, click<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>here</span></span></a></strong><span><span>.</span></span><span>

<p>As you can see, there are now two FireFox icons.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>When I (was forced) upgraded to Creator,, my office products and other browsers were removed from the task bar and I could not get them back via the Start menus. They would disappear after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to locate each executable in C:\Program Files\[program] or&nbsp;C:\Program Files(86)\[program] to get them to stick on the taskbar following reboot. (I still can't get Chrome to stick even though I even tried doing it from a safe mode once!</p>

<h2>            Skype closing when calls incoming</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Samsung S8 signed into Skype and everything looked good.&nbsp; Now however Skype crashes and closes whenever a call is incoming.&nbsp; I've updated my OS and disabled and reenabled Skype but with no joy.&nbsp; I have a Skype number that I pay for so I can't
 just create a new account.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear that and you were getting some strange Skype issue. Can you tell me the exact Skype version that is currently installed on your S8? Also, have you tried to close other running applications and just leave the Skype and test if there will
 be a crashing issue or error message?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Juan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>The version that's currently on my phone and working is 7.37.0.41/534.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The version that kept crashing was 8.13.0.1 calling version 2017.27.01.23.</p>
<p>I tried everything. Closing all apps, clearing data and cache on Skype app but nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I got an incoming call on Skype the app wouldn't even open. Just the error message would pop up saying
</p>
<p>Skype has closed. </p>
<p>Open app again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Report error?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I chose open app again and the caller had waited that long then the call would still be ongoing for me to answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the caller hung up then I'd get 2 missed call notifications. One that gave the caller number and the other that said unknown number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had the Skype app open already and a call came through then I had no issues but I obviously can't keep Skype open all the time in case I get a call so uninstalled it and downloaded the older version. Very strange indeed since the S8 is supposed to be
 top of the line.&nbsp;</p>

            I have answered your questions on the email itself. <br />
<br />
Unless it is absolutely necessary, I rather not go thru the posting on Skydrive, because of the time would take for me to learn it &amp;&nbsp; do it. I inserted the system info as well as the blue screen error message code.<br />
<br />
I am able to operate the pc normally without any problem at all. I have not added any hardware and have run my antisoftware/malware several times, incl Superantispyware d Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool, Spybot ( which I do not have anymore) and Ad Aware anitvirus/malware.
<br />
<br />
<div>
<div>Again, my problem is getting into Safe Mode. When I tried, i got a blue screen.<br />

IN as far as what happens, I tried to get into safe mode, using F8 and it began running, thenit stopped and gave me a blue screen with the following :<br />

I have not installed any new hardware&nbsp; and before it happened I had not installed any software. Since it occurred, I removed the antivirus I had and replaced it with&nbsp; new Ad Aware antivirus/malware.<br />

I appreciate the articles you sent but I have not replaced the motherboard.<br />

            You problem is your computer is infected with malware and the safe mode reg keys have been deleted.
<br />
<br />
Let's try this first. Open regedit and see if the below key is missing. <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot<br />
<br />
If you do not see the above key let us know.<br />
<br />
By the way, are you running raid on your hard drives? <br />
<br />
Edit: Sorry Dave. Didn't see your reply before I replied.<br />
<br />
To the OP. Scanning for rootkits is a great place to begin <i><b>after</b></i> you have determined the above reg key is missing. If that key is not missing the issue is not malware.

                    Yesterday i decided to change the name of one of my picture files. i pressed edit and the edit box came up in the right hand column. I then clicked "change name' of the selected file which i had already highlighted, changed the name and then clicked OK.

==========================================<br />
Not sure where you found the "Change Name" option.<br />
<br />
To rename a photo in Microsoft Office Picture Manager <br />
you just right click the thumbnail and choose Rename <br />
from the menu. The Rename pane opens on the right <br />
of the screen and you enter your new name / OK.<br />
<br />
The Delete option is just above Rename...Is it possible <br />
that you may have deleted the photo? Have a look in <br />
your recycle bin.

    <title>phantom track in windows media player - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidashley  say:</h3>
<h2>            phantom track in windows media player</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with windows media player. Although I have windows 8 I still prefer to use the media player rather than the music app, mainly as being&nbsp; abit sad I use the rating system to help generate playlists&nbsp;. When I sort by rating and highlight the
 unrated tracks I have a phantom track appear. It has no title , no memory size and is listed under unknown album , unknown album and unknown genre. It refuses to be deleted. It doesn't appear anywhere in my music folder under unknown artist. When I right click
 it doesn't give me an option to open file location suggesting it doesn't have one</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that windows media player gets stuck in a loop of trying to retrieve media information for this track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In itself this is a minor irritation as I can still play tracks however&nbsp;occasionally windows media player does freeze / not respond and even if this is nothing to do with trying to access the info for this phantom track I'd still like to get rid of it ,
 even if just to stop the constant "retrieving media information&nbsp;for an unknown album" update at the bottom of the player</p>
<p>
</p><p>an y ideas most welcome&nbsp;</p>

<h3> denny1977  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t schedule a task in windows 8.1 without a password while logged in as an administrator</h2>
                    <p>Before you say it I know it's a security risk to have the only account on the computer to be and admin and not have a password on the account but I don't care.... &nbsp;I was given a hp 2000 laptop by a friend it came with windows 8.1 reinstalled. &nbsp;Ugg, why couldn't
 it come with a real operating system like xp or 7 anyway....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a VHD (Virtual Hard Drive) using control panel\administrative tools\computer management\disk management\...... &nbsp;For some stupid reason it doesn't remount the VHD when the computer is rebooted. &nbsp;So I searched the net for a fix. &nbsp;The only fix I found
 was to create a scheduled task to load/mount the vhd on startup or whenever it's not loaded... &nbsp; I followed the steps exactly to setup the task. &nbsp;When I clicked ok or done or whatever it is to create the task after the settings are set it then errors saying
 "Cannot create a scheduled task without a password". &nbsp;I'm logged in as an administrator I didn't have to have a password to login why do I need one to schedule a task. &nbsp;Does anyone know a work around. &nbsp;I believe there must be one because on my xp machine at
 work I had the same issue and found a work around myself but that was months ago and I don't remember what I did....</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summery in windows 8.1 how do you "schedule a task" when your administrator account doesn't have a password?</p>

<p><span><span>two things you can try for this</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>do a startup repair from either a microsoft vista dvd not a hp etc recovery disk or a specialized startup repair disk that you can make</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>and change the way you get updates to see if an update is the problem</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>the below link has how to download and make a vista startup repair disk which you then boot from</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>here is how to use it for startup repair system restore&nbsp;command prompt etc at the below bleepingcomputers link</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>to boot from the dvd drive at power on&nbsp;you will see at the bottom of the screen a way to enter setup bios or boot order menu</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>it would be F2 or delete etc to enter bios setup or F12 etc&nbsp;for boot menu</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>change boot order there to make dvd drive 1st in boot order</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</strong> - If you select this option, Windows will download updates to your computer, but not install them automatically. If you want to install the updates then you must install them manually.
 You should only select this option if you have a reason for not installing updates automatically. Only advanced users should use this option.</p>
<p><strong>Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them</strong> - If you select this option, you will be alerted when there are new updates available to download and install. You can then choose to download and install the updates
 that you wish. This option should really only be used by people who know exactly what updates they need or those who have limited access to the<strong>Internet</strong></p>

<p>hey Walter the Traveller</p>
<p>ive downloaded the microsoft repair disc like you said, and ran the start up repair in that, however&nbsp;the test&nbsp;no longer mentions a patch being the problem and now when i boot my laptop after running a start up repair it does a system restore which does not
 work or it&nbsp;now says it must do an entire system restore that will wipe everyting off my laptop, the diagnostics report&nbsp;is so unclear about what the problem is.&nbsp;do you know anything else that&nbsp;i can do via command propmt etc...?</p>
<p>btw it may take me sometime to reply to any messages as since my laptop is broke it is difficult to get access to another one</p>

    <title>No mouse or keyboard at Windows 7 Login Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> porscheracer14  say:</h3>
<h2>            No mouse or keyboard at Windows 7 Login Screen</h2>
                    
<p>I'm really stumped on this one, so hopefully I can get some sane advice.&nbsp; I'm actually wrapping up my Windows 7 course tomorrow, but even the instructor and students haven't a clue to fix my problem.&nbsp; My problem is that no input devices work at the login
 screen.&nbsp; USB doesn't work, and PS/2 doesn't work.&nbsp; I did manage to get PS/2 to work for one boot, which I removed all the USB controllers hoping that would reset things.&nbsp; Once I rebooted, my PS/2 mouse and keyboard no longer work at the login screen.&nbsp; I've
 done the "last known good configuration" deal and even tried a restore point.&nbsp; These all work for one boot, and after a reboot I'm back to square one.&nbsp; No new devices, drivers or updates have been applied since this started happening.&nbsp; I installed Windows
 7 Professional x64 about a month ago for class use, but I cannot access support (except here) since I cannot get to a point to grab my Windows ID.</p>
<p>I'd really prefer not doing a complete re-install since it's very tedious and time consuming.&nbsp; Yes, I do have backups and images, but I don't have hours and hours to waste away getting everything back to point that I have built up.&nbsp; I also have plenty of
 class projects that need to be extracted and finished before the week is out and require Windows 7.</p>
<p>I have no idea why it's doing this and it's not just a USB issue, as this is also affecting PS/2.&nbsp; The devices all work fine in Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Ultimate, Windows Server 2008 and Ubuntu 10.10, just not in Windows 7 at the moment.&nbsp; Any
 help would be greatly appreciated, beyond telling me to reformat and re-install.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Oh, if you need to know the affected hardware, it's a Saitek Eclipse keyboard, Logitech G7 mouse, Cicero Windows 98 keyboard and Compaq mouse.&nbsp; The motherboard is a Gigabyte MA-790FXT-UD5P.</p>

<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try uninstalling and re-installing the drivers for your mouse and keyboard and check if it works:</span></p>
<p><span>a.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, clicking<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, clicking<strong><span>System

 password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span><span>‌</span></p>
<p><span>b.</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>In
 the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</span></p>

    <title>Help with an Adobe Flash Player update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with an Adobe Flash Player update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Maybe I have Adobe Flash turned off somewhere? I don't know much but I heard that some malware is using Flash to get around to millions of PCs so even though I run Malwarebytes Pro, I'd also heard to make sure that my Adobe Flash is the latest. But when
 I go to it in Control Panel by searching on Adobe Flash Player, on the Updates tab of the box that pops up it shows two&nbsp;things in grey that might not have been installed and I can't seem to do anything there to let them be installed. I'm sure that someone
 out there knows exactly what I need to do. </p>
<p>Also, the 3 dots for Updates selections aren't clickable and they are just greyed out.</p>
<p>Malwarebytes sent me this in an email which is what got me started trying to update Adobe Flash Player:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Adobe issued an emergency update to its Adobe Flash Player software today after researchers discovered a vulnerability that was being exploited to deliver ransomware (variants of Cerber ransomware). Flash has over one billion users, so odds are
 you are affected by this update. </strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>This is exactly the type of zero-day attack Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit Premium can protect you from. So, nice work! If you're currently running Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Exploit Premium, your computer w<span>...</span><span>ill be safe.
</span></strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong>As a precaution, Malwarebytes suggests that you update your Adobe Flash Player (Shockwave Flash Plugin). In addition, we also recommend you install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Premium if you haven't already. For top security, run both Malwarebytes
 Anti-Malware Premium and Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit Premium, as a layered approach is the best way to keep threats off your computer.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Malwarebytes would hate to see your computer compromised. Here at Malwarebytes, we pledge to keep you protected and informed about the latest issues. Your peace of mind is our number one priority."</strong></p>

Hence, I suggest to run a complete scan using defender also go to adobe website and download the latest flash player and check.<br />

            <p>Well I think that I'm logged in as an Admin. as I'm the only User that's set up on this home computer and it says that I have an Admin. account in Control Panel &gt; Users. But I do have some totally&nbsp;weird issue going on that I've asked about in
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-msedge/winaero-tweaker-mess-why-when-clicking-edge-icon/e0994488-8de3-4270-9f69-f740de4a3d2d">

 very&nbsp;normally as myself with my outlook.com email address and that account's long password.</p>
<p>I don't understand why you've suggested that I do a complete scan with Defender but let me tell you that I've run several of those very recently and I use it full time along with running Malwarebytes Pro alongside Defender with it set to quarantine any PUPs
 (Potentially Unwanted Programs).</p>
<p>I will do as you said and "go to adobe website and download the latest flash player and check it then.". I'll report back after that.<br />

            <p>At the Adobe site that you linked me to, it offers me both of those versions that had shown as 'NOT INSTALLED' in my original Question. I don't know which to pick or why there are two choices. Can you help me or does it even matter?</p>
<p>I have noticed before that sometimes, but not always, when another user posts a video on Facebook and I try to play it, my computer shows an image where the video should be displayed saying that I can't play it without flash. I think that I've even asked
 another Question on this site about that. I'd been under the impression that flash is included inside Windows 10. Maybe I shut it off somewhere when someone advised me to do that since it can be a risky thing?</p>

            <p>Yes, this is my computer that I use 99.9% of the time here at home. It is my sick ACER Aspire ZC-102 desktop that I got new as a Windows 8 and is now Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11. My other two are both XPs and one is in retirement and one is my kid's
 DELL which should also be put down.</p>
<p>From all I can tell, my guess is that this computer reacts to things so slowly sometimes that it might signal the system that I don't have FLASH even though it is apparently embedded in IE-11.</p>
<p>Just for the heck of it, I just went to IE-TOOLS-MANAGE ADD-ONS and I do see that in TOOLBARS AND EXTENSIONS in MICROSOFT WINDOWS THIRD PARTY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION COMPONENTS, Shockwave Flash Object is ENABLED, it that matters.</p>

<p>1. I don't know how to check to see which Adobe Flash Player version I have. Where would I find that?</p>
<p>2. Yes it is the same computer as I've asked those other three things about. I'm sorry if my saying that it is the computer that I use almost all the time didn't answer that. I'd thought that it did but I guess I should have answered more directly.</p>

            Just after I submitted that last Reply, I found your link above that sent me to
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.adobe.com/software/flash/about</a> and on that page it displays that same little box that you did saying that I have
<strong>Adobe Flash Player v21.0.0.213. </strong>I guess that's to be expected since I did a Clean Install of Windows 10 pretty recently that had a date in October 2015 so it had most of the major Microsoft Updates already in it.

            First 2 dumps indicate a problem with your Nvidia driver so fair enough to believe it is the root cause.
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for nvlddmkm.sys
<br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for nvlddmkm.sys
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for win32k.sys
<br />I see the driver dates to 2017:
<br /> Fri Oct 27 08:49:39 2017 (59F35593)
<br />
<br />Completely remove everything of Graphics driver using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.

<br />
<br />You can head to either the card manufacturer or device manufacturer to get the newest driver.
<br />Let us know if you require any assistance.

<p>
</p><p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally merged my Skype with Microsoft Account over Christmas. I was logged out of Skype and then had to recover my Microsoft Account password (since I didn't remember it) to access Skype. I've logged in successfully on a MAC with my new password
 but my contacts have disappeared and I can't see any chats, which is very disruptful (I have business contacts on here).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, with the same login credentials, all my contacts are visible as are the chats with them (hence I how I know I'm not seeing active group chat messages mentioned above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I see my contacts on a MAC. I've tried logging out and back in again. Do I need to sync contacts or something? Any help appreciated, especially from Skype Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>

<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>

<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I use a new HP computer and HP all-in-one printer(Officejet 7410) with Windows 7 operating system.&nbsp; When using the scan feature thru the HP Solution Center, I can do all the functions except Scan to Email.&nbsp; It will allow me to use a HP email program, requiring
 a completely separate address book to be created, but does not list Windows Live Mail as an option.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have used this device with my old computer on Windows XP and it worked fine.&nbsp; I have tried going thru all the scan setup functions and can see no answers.&nbsp;
 Is there a fix for scanning attachments directly into Live Mail?&nbsp; I would guess there are a lot of people like me who upgrade to Windows 7 and have lost functionality.&nbsp; I do a lot of scanning to email and need to find a solution please.</p>

            Hi <span>cardeler,<br />
<br />
The functionality scan to email is only for printers and scanners all in one. If Windows Live Mail is not include on the option. The only option available is to scan and send it manually in Windows Live Mail.
<br />
<br />
Please follow this workaround.<br />
<br />
1. Turn on your scanner.<br />
2. Place your document face down on the scanner glass. Close the lid.<br />
3. Open your scanner/printer software on your computer. Most printer software will give you the option to print, copy or scan. Choose scan. You probably will be asked how you want to scan your document. Choose to scan it to a PDF.<br />
4. Hit the scan button on your computer. Once the scan is complete, you will name and save your PDF. Save the PDF on your desktop.<br />
5. Open your Windows Mail.<br />
6. Click "File" in the main menu. Scroll down and click "New Mail Message."<br />
7. Click "Insert" in the main menu. Scroll down and click "Attach." You also can click the paper-clip icon at the top of the message.<br />
8. Browse for the PDF you named and saved in Step 3. Click the "Attach" button. The PDF will appear in the header of the message.<br />
9. Compose your message and add recipients. Click the "Send" button.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            I am having the same problem. I have a HP Deskjet 3522 Model. I scanned to Windows Live Mail for years on my previous laptop with Vista Operating System. I recently replaced my laptop with an HP with Windows 7 operating system and every time I try to scan
 to an email I am getting an error message telling me to reconfigure my email settings.
<br />
Just what settings do I need for my Windows Live Mail 2011 ? This seems strange since both the printer/scanner and the laptop are both HP.<br />

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t play WWE 13 while signed in, update failed.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I put in my <strong>WWE 13</strong> xbox 360 game disc and at first it worked fine, then I wanted to get some DLC, so I downloaded the "<strong>Fan Axsess</strong>" (or something named like that) DLC, then my game had to be restarted. It prompted me
 for a 5 MB update, I pushed yes, the DLC downloaded but now whenever I try to launch my game it gives me the error :<strong> Update Failed : This game requires an update, but the update couldn't be found</strong>. Also the
<strong>WWE 13</strong> Disc is brand new, so I don't think that's why.</p>
<p>My other games work just fine, but not this specific game.</p>
<p>I have tried numerous things and have not been able to find a solution yet.</p>
<p><br />
Things I have tried</p>
<p>1. Clearing the system cache</p>
<p>2. Clearing the flash drive's cache</p>
<p>3. Reformatting my console</p>
<p>4. Reformatting my xbox 360 flash drive</p>
<p>5. Taking out the flash drive so the update would go to my internal storage instead.</p>
<p>6. Clearing all updates from my xbox and re-updating (with my flash drive and without)</p>

<p>I have no idea what else to try, any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Whoa, what the heck! &nbsp;That sounds pretty annoying. &nbsp;OK, a couple things I can think to try. &nbsp;One would be to clear the cache and restart the console again, then let another couple of games update and see if the WWE update will go through that way. &nbsp;You could
 also try bringing the hard drive into another system and updating it that way and see if it works. &nbsp;Can you give that a try?</p>
