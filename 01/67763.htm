<p>STOP using Iolo System Mechanic and contact Iolo support for a final fix. Using registry cleaners, in this case System Mechanic, is why you lost the entry for Windows installer in the registry.</p>
<p>Do NOT use it.<br />
</p>
<p>This fix works with all Vista versions.</p>
<p>Download and <strong>SAVE to your system</strong> (to the Desktop or a unique folder) the following registry-fix file<br />
<a href="http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/msiserver.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/win-services/vista/msiserver.reg</a></p>
<p>Do a RIGHT-Click on it and select MERGE</p>
<p>Allow each to merge into the registry.</p>
<p>If prompted by UAC User Account Control, allow to proceed.</p>
<p>IF and only if, the Merge option is not available, then do this:</p>
<p>Start REGEDIT.&nbsp; Then select File Import.&nbsp; When prompted for filename, navigate to &amp; select</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>msiserver.reg </strong>and tap Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow it to merge.&nbsp; When done Close Regedit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Logoff and Restart Windows. and then retry Windows Update.</p>

<h2>            Windows Didn&#39;t Load Correctly</h2>
                    <p>I have been having issues with updates.&nbsp; Twice now I have done the Windows 10 in place upgrade (to version 1803) and both times after doing some updates to either driver or Windows updates, I get the black screen with a rolling blue cursor.&nbsp; I have talked
 to Microsoft Support via chat twice and they swear this in place upgrade is a fix, but it isn't.&nbsp; I have a Lenovo H50 series, A10-7800 3.5 Ghz, 12 GB, 2TB, AMD GPU.&nbsp; After turning on and off the computer a few times and finally getting to the options to start
 repairs etc, I get message that it can't be repaired.&nbsp; After a couple of days, if I turn back on then I can finally get back in to my computer as normal.&nbsp; What could possibly be the issue??</p>
<p>

            Hi Tracy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />You can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you want to try to fix it and have enough functionality then first I'd 
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Next go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />
<br />If these all fail then remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

</p><p>I tried to revert back to the previous version of Windows, it won't let me.&nbsp; Not sure when I first upgraded to version 1803, not in the Update History.&nbsp; Tried the Hide Updates Tool, said there is nothing to hide.&nbsp; This started while downloading the latest
 driver version for my PC.&nbsp; I have not done the Recovery yet, trying to avoid reinstalling some programs I have.&nbsp; Any other suggestions (other than throwing the PC out the door!).</p>

    <title>Unable to recover your pc. The system drive is too small. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to recover your pc. The system drive is too small.</h2>
                    <p>After I applied what I believe was the April 2018 Windows 10 update 5 days ago, my computer (hp Pavilion p6210y) has been stuck in a Windows Rollback boot loop. When it did boot up, I would get messages that the desktop file couldn't be found, and various
 unknown hard errors (cftmon.exe, sihost.exe, explorer.exe). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all kinds of recovery/repair/restore methods with no success. sfc /scannow runs to 100%, then says the process can't be completed. chkdsk /r returns an error 50 message. dism returns an error 2 message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a backup image of the hp Pavilion on an external hard drive, so I figured I'd try to recover from a USB flash drive and delete all the files on the hp Pavilion. So, I made the recovery USB on another computer (Dell Precision T3400) because I can't
 make one on the hp Pavilion. Now I keep getting the "Unable to recover your pc. The system drive is too small." message when I try to use that USB to recover the other computer (the busted hp Pavilion).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pavilion has a 640GB hard drive. The Dell has a 140GB C: drive (121GB used) and a 1.67TB D: drive (246MB used).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the recovery USB I made on the Dell too big to use to recover the hp Pavilion? If so, what are my other options?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a hp laptop with a 446GB C: drive (93.1GB used) and a 18.3GB D: recovery drive (16.2GB used). Could I use that to make a recovery USB instead?</p>

            Hey AVarg1,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, what you've experienced is an issue in updating that is caused by Avast or AVG antivirus suites. It's not an easy situation to deal with. Microsoft has acknowledged this and is working on a solution: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-april-2018-update-may-boot-to-a-choose/8ff0d933-8819-4945-9f0c-17ac854400e2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />But in the meantime though, you have a few options.
<br />
<br />Prerequisites for a couple of these options (Media Creation Tool): <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />...You could clean install. Simply get a flash drive of 8 GB minimum in capacity, and use another computer to run the Media Creation Tool (link above), and select "Create installation media (USB flash drive...", then follow the prompts. To boot from the flash drive, hit F12 repeatedly and when you see the menu, select your flash drive. Do not worry about reactivation or anything -- it will activate fine since your hardware had Windows 10 installed on it previously, it holds a digital entitlement, which is a license that is unique to that hardware. If you have any issues with it whatsoever though, let me know. Worst case, you have to call Microsoft or go through their live chat (you have to go through the virtual agent first) to get that sorted. If you fear of losing your data through this process, don't worry. So as long you don't format the hard drive or SSD in your computer, the previous Windows installation including documents, pictures, music, and so on, will all be stored in a C:\Windows.old\Users\
<br />
<br />...You could attempt to perform a repair upgrade (keep everything as it was, if you don't want to perform a clean install). This is not typically advised, so perform at your own risk. Given this goes right, you'll be back to Windows as if it never happened, things will be as you left it before the update. If you have internet on the black desktop Windows, you can simply just go to the other computer and download the Media Creation Tool (link above), then transfer it to a flash drive (the executable itself, don't run it unless you have Internet, in that case you would use the Media Creation Tool to prepare the flash drive). You can then run it by going into Task Manager (CTRL + ALT + DEL or CTRL + SHIFT + ESC), then going into File &gt; Run new task &gt; Browse, go into the flash drive's root directory, then click MediaCreationTool1803.exe, then run that. This might help if you remove Avast or AVG during the upgrade process. When running, select "Upgrade this PC now" in one of the prompts, and wait. If y
<br />
<br />...You could simply wait it out. Yes, I know, it's far from a perfect solution. Microsoft though is trying hard at replicating the issue and to engineer a fix. They'll be sure to let people know,and they've already blocked people that have Avast as to prevent any further damage.
<br />
<br />I hope that at least helps in deciding where you want to go. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, or simply need any assistance for any of these options, I'd be happy to help.

This is what Microsoft has said, I don't have Avast so I haven't experienced this, nor I work for Microsoft, I'm just passing along what they said.

<br />That's quite unfortunate, it could be something related to your SATA controller drivers, be sure that you've installed all drivers from your original manufacturer's website (for instance, if you have Dell, go to Dell's support page) and so on. Specifically look for storage controllers (like SATA controller drivers).

<h2>            I was an idiot and now Notepad won&#39;t open.</h2>
                    I'll be very specific. First off, I'm running Windows XP Home Edition 2002 Version SP3 on an Asus Eee PC. I did something stupid. The other day I downloaded a sketchy program from the internet (http://download.cnet.com/Roulette/3000-18527_4-10386791.html)
 and installed it without scanning it. I used it once while Notepad was open and shortly thereafter uninstalled it. Now Notepad won't open. That is, it will show up in the taskbar but it won't show up on the screen. I'm running an AVG scan right now but am
 curious as to anything which might help me fix the Notepad problem. Any help is much appreciated.

<p>Hi Rosdan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more information regarding your concern. Which device are you pertaining to? Are you talking about the
<strong>Find my device</strong> feature of your Microsoft account? Are you talking about the location settings of your device? If you are using a desktop computer with no Wi-Fi capability, your location will be based on your IP address. Because of that, the
 results can widely vary in accuracy, resulting in an incorrect location for your device. You can set your address as your default location in the Maps app so that Windows, apps, and services can use it when the system could not detect a more exact location
 of your device. To do so, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Maps</strong> app.</li><li>Click on <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7431b6a7-1a63-47ba-88dc-ef981ec4be2f" height="26" width="35" />, then click on

    <title>Personalizing a Screensaver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scorp2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Personalizing a Screensaver</h2>
                    I was curious as to whether or not anyone knows of a program, app, or Windows setting that allows a user to take a standard photo slide-show style screensaver, and add your own photo transition effects?&nbsp; I found the standard 'choose a folder and we'll
 flip through all the photos at a speed you choose' screensaver, but I'd like to, say..&nbsp; add a fade-out effect for the photo transition, or maybe have one shrink and bounce around the screen showing the next until it fills it with after-images and then changes
 to a third.&nbsp;&nbsp; A truly personal and original screensaver, (and preferably done with freeware or inexpensive software as I doubt I missed a Windows option that gives me that much leeway with creativity), that still works with Windows 10 or even better, plugs
 into it's screensaver options menu in the Control Panel.&nbsp; Any advice would be welcome.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>If you have Powerpoint you can create your own slideshow with any amount of transitional effects and use that as your screensaver,&nbsp;or if you don't and you know someone who does you can create one on their PC and upload it to yours. I always wonder why users
 are so bothered about what's on their screensaver as it usually activates when your not there to see it and you return to what you where doing when you come back.</p>

<h2>            Transfer files from Windows XP PC to Windows 8.1 PC, etc., etc....</h2>
                    <p>I want to transfer files from my Windows XP desktop PC to my Windows 8.1 desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up all the files from my XP to a 'Western Digital My Book USB 2.0' external drive, using Norton 360 to perform the backup. 21,000 files, about 40 GB, it took about 2 hours. I can find the files in the external drive, but can't identify the file
 types, and they all have lengthy names of mixed letters and numbers. I've tried installing them in, and restoring them to, the 8.1 PC, don't know if they've transferred, and don't know where or how to look for them. I don't want to use OneDrive, SkyDrive,
 or any other cloud type storage, I want my files to be on my PC and external drive only. I want to access and work with the photos, essays, and lists I had in my old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other procedure I can find is LapLink, which might work. I can connect both PCs to the Internet, but I only have one monitor, can I use LapLink that way? And then I may still have trouble finding the files on the new PC? If I use only the WordPad
 that came with the new PC, would it only save to the cloud, or is there a documents folder in the new PC similar to XP's "My Documents"? I mean, really, my XP is only 200 GB, did everything I wanted it to do, and the 8.1 is 1TB... I just need a PC to do life's
 simple tasks, not to sync my entire life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new PCs calculator is a monstrosity. Heck, I really just want to play FreeCell, and it takes numerous steps to find the game now, it asks me to sign in, it's online, it tries to advertise to me, and it's ugly. In fact everything, from opening IE to closing
 windows to searching my PC, takes extra steps. It's upsetting.</p>

            <p>To address last request first: the old calculator from XP is still there. On your Start screen, type
<strong>calc</strong> and it will appear in the instant search results (it's the one with the "old" style icon, which ironically looks more realistic than the green "modern" icon).. Right-click it to "pin to start" or "pin to taskbar" so you never have to search
 for it again.&nbsp; You can also right-click the old one if you want to uninstall it completely, no reason to have both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't help with FreeCell though, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On to more important things, getting your files over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 certainly does include the same local "My Documents", just as your used to.&nbsp; If you open the File Explorer (from the desktop taskbar), you should immediately see them.&nbsp; Keyboard shortcut to open the File Explorer is Windows+E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restore your files using the Norton 360, you'd have to install Norton 360 on your new computer.&nbsp; And I'm not familiar with the Norton program to really assist there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But honestly, I wouldn't bother.&nbsp; I would just transfer directly and simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug USB hard drive into old computer.</li><li>Open File Explorer (Win+E) and open the USB drive.</li><li>Open another File Explorer window and open your documents folder.</li><li>Drag files to the USB drive.</li><li>Move drive to new computer.</li><li>Drag files to their new homes in the matching documents/pictures/videos/whatever folders you use to organize.</li></ol>
<p>--</p>
<p>PS. I know you don't want a sales pitch, but you might like turning on OneDrive. I store every file I've ever used in there. I have book reports going back to 3rd grade, family photos and more. If my computer blew away in a tornado (not unlikely here), I
 would not lose a single thing. I'd just login to OneDrive again on another computer and all my files would instantly be just like they were yesterday.</p>

<p>They need to have a Premium Server, numerous of course, that runs through every map to date. &nbsp;And an added bonus on these servers would be a random rotation of maps, no more set rotation!</p>

    <title>Question about Xbox One Wireless Controllers that use rechargeable AA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> omnivorous one  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Xbox One Wireless Controllers that use rechargeable AA batteries instead of the Battery Packs.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a question about the Xbox One Wireless controllers when being used with rechargeable AA batteries.</p>
<p>Will the controller recharge the batteries while they are inside the controller if you have a Micro USB cable hooked up or must you use a separate battery charger?</p>
<p>I know it will recharge the Microsoft Battery Packs for the Wireless Controllers and that by putting in the Micro USB cable you turn it into a wired controller. I am not sure how using Rechargeable AA Batteries compares to using one of the Battery Packs
 and I have not heard anything about it recharging rechargeable AA batteries.</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey One. </p>
<p>Great question you have. Sorry to say but it will not charge your rechargeable batteries in the controller. You will continue to use the charger provided by the rechargeable battery unit.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps and reach out if you have any other questions.</p>

    <title>Motherboard Replacement difficulties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brendankod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Motherboard Replacement difficulties</h2>
                    <p>Ok, tried swapping out the motherboard in my system with a newer model, and windows got errors while trying to boot, which reduced after I turned off UEFI, but the system still kept blue screening right after the window logo finished forming.&nbsp;&nbsp;Double checking
 advice I naturally found that I should have first used Sysprep to set windows to a general state.&nbsp; I set up the old motherboard to attempt this on my HD, but Sysprep has brought up the error window "A fatal error occurred while trying to Sysprep the machine."
 multiple times.&nbsp; Checking the Windows rearm count, it's still at 4 so I looked up the error log file and here's what it's got.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2015-02-15 13:58:10, Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0x0f0082] SYSPRP LaunchDll:Failure occurred while executing 'drmv2clt.dll,Sysprep', returned error code -2147024864[gle=0x00000020]<br />
2015-02-15 13:58:10, Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0x0f0070] SYSPRP RunExternalDlls:An error occurred while running registry sysprep DLLs, halting sysprep execution. dwRet = -2147024864[gle=0x00000020]<br />
2015-02-15 13:58:10, Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [0x0f00a8] SYSPRP WinMain:Hit failure while processing sysprep cleanup providers; hr = 0x80070020[gle=0x00000020]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice on what these specific errors mean and how to correct them?&nbsp; I'm hoping to not have to reinstall windows and all of my programs.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Brendan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure what state your system is in now, but I would suggest downloading the Windows recovery tools to a USB stick and attempting to recover your OS - it needs to discover the new hardware and install the correct drivers.:&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We aware, changing the motherboard is a major component change and may invalidate your Windows license key.</p>

            <p><span>These errors suggest that your drivers for your various peripherals aren’t properly installed. Some devices have drivers that are installed according to your motherboard and the device itself which get corrupted if you swap the motherboard with the
 same set of drivers installed on your OS. As suggested above, the recovery tool is the best options here.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Dell Inspiron 7537 Reboot Loop 64&#37; - Windows 10 Reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brandont5300  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Inspiron 7537 Reboot Loop 64&#37; - Windows 10 Reinstall</h2>
                    I wanted to reset my Windows 10 Dell Inspiron 15 7537 to factory settings (not wiping the drive) but I came across many problems. The first was that I had a Logitech mouse USB receiver and Logitech USB headset in the ports which prevented my computer from
 reinstalling Windows 10. I removed it and it was working normally but then I came across another problem. The install was stuck at 64% and rebooting constantly. I looked up a way to fix it and I&nbsp;got a USB flash drive and used it to install Windows off of that
 instead because I believed the install was corrupted. Now I tried to get into the BIOS so I could boot off of the drive but it didn't work. Right now my Dell is stuck on the logo. There's no loading indicators, just the logo. I didn't take my flash drive off
 of the computer because I don't want something with the drive to mess up. I haven't had a working Windows laptop in weeks, please help! Thank you!

                    <p>I've been using Remote Desktop on my Windows 10 system to connect to another Windows 10 system on my home network.&nbsp; Suddenly, it won't see the system two which I want to connect.&nbsp; My husband's Windows 10 system CAN see it.&nbsp; I reset my network settings and
 could see it.&nbsp; After a reboot and Windows 10 doing another update, I can't connect again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect to shared folders on the destination system but can't use Remote Desktop.&nbsp; Rather than reset my network settings again for it to temporarily work, I'm hoping someone has advice beyond the standard set-up/configuration help that's on the Microsoft

    <title>Installation keeps stopping at 6&#37; - CoD Ghosts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cordole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installation keeps stopping at 6&#37; - CoD Ghosts</h2>
                    
<p>Got my Xbox One yesterday and picked up three games to go with it: Ryse, NFS Rivals and CoD Ghosts.Ryse and NFS installed with no issues. However, installing CoD Ghosts is where the problems started happening.
</p>


<p>A solution was posted online, I forgot where on how to remedy the problem.</p>
<p>1) Delete cache</p>
<p>2) remove disc</p>
<p>3) Restart Xbox One</p>
<p>4) Disconnect from the internet</p>
<p>5) Insert game disc and it should install</p>


<p>RESULT: Installation stopped at 6% with error message "Your disc may be dirty or damaged. Try cleaning it, or choose a different disc. (0x87e00064)</p>


<p>I tried following Mister Cerb's steps here: http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/p/1627224/4209336.aspx#4209336 and it did not work as well. Received the same error message as well.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The installation is not slow, my install keeps stopping at 6% or 7% I even tried to restart the install. The disc itself has no scratches or anything like that. What are my options here?</p>


<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

            <p>Sorry to butt in but most likely he's looking to simply have some way to mark photos so that he can later sort by&nbsp;whatever tag(s) he assigns.&nbsp; The priority field would be useful for that as well.&nbsp; I think MS needs to change Photos to allow both of them to
 be set (and ideally in the Viewer as well).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>And if&nbsp;people can assign both&nbsp;a rating and tags it will solve the problem of how to let them create their own albums.&nbsp; Each one would be a query like "WHERE (Tag = "John" OR Tag = "Mary") AND Rating NOT &lt; 5".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since those two fields are already part of the file definition, it seems that MS had something like this in mind from the beginning.&nbsp; I&nbsp;greatly appreciate their effort to automatically create Albums since manual creation is a lot of work, but I think they
 always planned to allow it.&nbsp; They just wanted people to give automatic creation a fair trial since it could save them a great deal of time.&nbsp; But I've read that there have been a lot of requests for manual Albums so I guess this should be a priority for them.</p>

            And if MS wants to get really fancy they should propagate tags that are people's names by using facial recognition.&nbsp; In other words, once I&nbsp;identify a tag as a person's name, that tag can be assigned to all photos where the person appears.

            <p>You can always use Photo Gallery by downloading it from MS, but you can also&nbsp;just use Explorer to tag and rate your photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you do a lot of it, Gallery is best since it lets you flag pictures so you can tag/rate them in groups.&nbsp; You can try to use Explorer to do that by selecting multiple photos, but&nbsp;your selections will disappear if you take certain actions like delete
 a picture in Photos.&nbsp; In Gallery the flags will remain until you go into Home and remove them.&nbsp; The flags are useful for many things - use your imagination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gallery's slideshow function seems better than Photos' so I definitely recommend downloading it.&nbsp; I don't have the link but MS makes it very easy to do.</p>

            I use Photo Gallery on Windows 10 to tag People as well and previously relied on Explorer sorting by People Tag into separate folders to help organize for different players on sports teams... since upgrading to Windows 10, I have found changing the "View"
 to sort by Tag but it is the Description tag... not People. &nbsp;How do I continue to organize photos by People tag and work with that tag in Windows 10?

            <p>Just download Photo Gallery.&nbsp; It's unchanged, easy to do, and works great.&nbsp; It will take MS time to migrate all Gallery features to Photos and some functions will never be done, so plan on using Gallery for some time in combination with Explorer and Photos
 (and even Paint if you want to&nbsp;resize pictures).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds messy but they coordinate fairly well.&nbsp; People who have used Gallery for advanced functions can still do that&nbsp;while using Photos for editing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos is also best for&nbsp; viewing&nbsp;unless you prefer a&nbsp;slideshow, in which case Gallery's is normally better since it has more options and zooms to full screen (although this works badly with low quality photos).&nbsp; But see
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/gallery-wlsettings/photo-gallery-slideshow-full-screen-in-windows-81/87a27d93-d082-4b95-b3ea-f4b3522d2ff6">

            <p>Photo Gallery is downloaded &amp; being used on Windows 10. &nbsp;Photo Gallery offers two types of Tags: People (facial recognition) and Description (user defined). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 File Exporer allowed sorting photo files by either Tag (People or Description) and display virtual file folders for each Tag found. Clicking on these file folders would display all photo files containg that Tag. &nbsp;The question is... did this feature
 not come forward into Windows 10 File Explorer?</p>

    <title>Dark Souls&#58; Prepare to Die Edition not recognising DLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the madman9910  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dark Souls&#58; Prepare to Die Edition not recognising DLC</h2>
                    
<p>Myself and a few friends have all noticed that our physical&nbsp;copies of Dark Souls: Prepare to Die for Xbox 360 does not seem to give us a download for the Artorias of the Abyss DLC, nor does the download of the game we received by verification of the disc
 include the DLC, which it has on disc if playing on Xbox 360. Now I thought perhaps this is an issue with the emulation and there was a solution available through Xbox support. And while the Customer Service Representative was helpful as he could be, he stated
 my troubles were indeed an issue that needed to be solved, but there was nothing he himself could do to help me solve them.</p>
<p>Researching other physical copies of complete games, such as Fallout 3 GOTY Edition, revealed to me that there was no troubles there in recognising the on-disc content and enabling it for consumers. Therefore why is this a problem for Dark Souls: Prepare
 to Die? Seeing as it is essentially the exact same concept; the base game and all DLC content included as a package on the disc.
</p>
<p>What is the solution? Surely there should have at least been a public statement for the announcement of Dark Souls being backwards compatability specifically&nbsp;stating the Prepare to Die edition would not support DLC?&nbsp;Yet all the announcement articles I've
 read state&nbsp;support for the DLC was either not addressed or they did not mention any concerns or issues with supporting the DLC at all?</p>
<p>There either needs to be a fix to address the issue of the emulation not verifying what is on-disc content OR some sort of recompense needs to be issued to those of us who had or bought a copy of the complete edition for the exact reason of having the base
 game and DLC included in the one physical package. </p>

            <p>Heya The Madman9910.</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention, sorry to hear you're having trouble accessing the DLC connected to the physical edition of the disc. While the game disc is inserted in your Xbox One and you visit visit Games &amp; Apps menu, if you press the menu button on Dark Souls and select Manage game, do you see the DLC as Ready to Install?</p>
<p>If you don't see the content there please be sure to check out our Backward Compatibility Troubleshooter and run through all the steps there. Please make sure to fill out the survey near the end so that we can provide the information to the right team.</p>

            Do the unwanted copies have filenames with<br />
the prefix "copy of"?<br />
<br />
Example: Copy of IMG_1455.JPG<br />
<br />
If_yes_maybe the following tutorial I wrote<br />
for XP will offer some ideas:<br />
<br />
Here's how to reproduce the unwanted<br />
copying...<br />
<br />
Hold your Ctrl key and select several files...<br />
<br />
Place your pointer on the selected group<br />
(still holding the ctrl key) and left click / drag<br />
the group even just the slightest bit...now<br />
release the mouse button.<br />
<br />
Oooops...more copies...<br />
<br />
Maybe the following info will help:<br />
<br />
It happens occasionally to most anyone who<br />
is trying to multiple select by holding the Ctrl<br />
or Shift key while left clicking to select the<br />
image files.<br />
<br />
The copies are created when you fail to<br />
completely release the mouse button before<br />
you move the pointer to another file. If a group<br />
of selected files is dragged...even the slightest<br />
bit...releasing the mouse button will produce<br />
copies of all the previously highlighted files.<br />
<br />
It's somewhat easier if you have your Folder<br />
Options set to Single Click...this way you can<br />
select/deselect a file with just a mouse over<br />
and you don't have to click. For multiples you<br />
still have to hold...Ctrl or Shift.<br />
<br />
No click...no drag...no copy...maybe that's<br />
your solution. To adjust for single click...<br />
Open a folder and go to...Tools / Folder<br />
Options / General tab...tick..."Single Click<br />
To Open An Item" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
If you wish to delete all the files in a folder<br />
you could try the following:<br />
<br />
Go to...Edit / Select All...or type...Ctrl / A...<br />
<br />
With all files selected...go to...File / Delete...<br />
or press your Delete key...or...right click the<br />
group and choose "Delete".<br />
<br />
How to search for and delete unwanted "copies"<br />
of your image files.<br />
<br />
Open the folder that the images are saved in and<br />
left click the "Search" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
(If you are viewing the files from within an editing<br />
program and do not know where the folder is...right<br />
click one of the image files and from the menu...<br />
choose...Properties. The path to the folder will be<br />
on the "General" tab at "Location".)<br />
<br />
In the search pane...select..."All files and folders"<br />
<br />
In the "All or part of the file name" field...enter...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Search" button.<br />
<br />
When the search is complete...go to...Edit / Select All...<br />
<br />
Then go to...File / Delete.<br />
<br />
You will see a dialog box asking you if you are sure<br />
you wish to delete the files...click Yes.<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Back" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
Now the remaining files should be your originals.<br />
<br />
If you deleted the wrong files...recover them from<br />
your recycle bin now.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Can I revert back to Windows XP after installing Windows 7 pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>Is there any way to go back?</em></p>
<p>i received a disk with the installer for windows 7 pro from a friend. little did he know that he didnt give me the product code. i installed windows 7 pro on my XP pro computer. it's now asking for the product code. i didnt find it so i asked my friend for

If the computer has the Windows.old folder - Reverting Windows 7 back to a previous Windows system:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/971760</a><br />
<br />
Windows.old on your C: drive - Usually, but not always, after installing Windows 7 you will have a Windows.old folder on your C: drive that contains data from the previous Windows installation. Open Windows Explorer and under "Computer" click on the C: drive
 - if the Windows.old folder is there you should be able to revert back to XP/Vista.<br />
<br />
If it's not there, make sure you can see the Windows.old folder: <br />
1. Click Start, type:&nbsp; hidden <br />
2. Click "Show hidden files and folders" <br />
3. Click to select "Show hidden files and folders" <br />
4. Click OK and look for the folder<br />
(Note: after you are done go back and uncheck "Show hidden files and folders" if you want.)
<br />
<br />
<br />

If you have a restore partition you can use that to reinstall Windows. If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows 7. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start
 the restore﻿ - check your manual if you're not sure how to. If you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process. Reinstalling will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either and Windows came installed on your computer contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try following these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the
<b>Windows Memory Diagnostic tool</b> from Windows Recovery and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</b></a></p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Also run the SFC (System File checker) Scan in Windows Recovery mode.</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Command prompt from Windows Recovery Mode</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>C:</b> and press enter. On
<b>C:\</b> prompt type <b>cd windows\system32\</b> and press enter. </p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<b>sfc /scannow</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Also refer to the KB article provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Windows Vista or Windows 7 no longer starts, and the Startup Repair tool does not fix the problem</b></p>
