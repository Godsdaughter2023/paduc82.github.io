<h2>            Windows Disk Defragment Tool Won&#39;t Defrag My Drives &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Last night I checked my drives on disk defragmenter on windows 10 and when i analysed my C: Drive it said there was 11% fragmented and was recommended for me to defrag the drive. So i went ahead and started the process, after like an hour of waiting it said
 it was complete, but when i checked the drive it said it was still 11% fragmented and needed to be defragged again. So i did it again just incase something went wrong and it said the exact same thing afterwards. At this point i was getting annoyed so i searched
 for a solution and they recommended me to use a downloadable disk defragmenter, i think i went on PCWorld where they recommended me to do so. So i downloaded a disk defragmenter and before using it i had made sure it was a legit and safe program to use. Once
 i found out it was safe and a good one to use i went ahead and started to defrag my drive. After almost 2 hours of waiting it finally finished saying it had finished defragmentation. I went ahead and restarted my computer and checked windows defragment tool
 to see if it had refreshed... When i checked it did refresh BUT apparently the fragments percentage is on 10% now not 11%. I'm really confused as to why it won't properly defrag and why for it to only go down 1% i had to use a different disk defragmenter.
 And as you can see i tried defragging my other drives to see if was a disk issue, but they also wouldn't go down percentage.</p>

            <p>Defragging programs don't all use the same methods/algorithms in determining percentage of fragmentation.&nbsp; For demonstration purposes I just installed Piriform's Defraggler, a popular free defrag utility.&nbsp; It indicates that my system drive is 9% fragmented:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/747b6761-8973-4b44-9977-e8f6c374d8c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/747b6761-8973-4b44-9977-e8f6c374d8c0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I checked the Windows 10 defragger and found a different result:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a67acc00-51bb-4a5b-9cdd-e3ef01ee550e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a67acc00-51bb-4a5b-9cdd-e3ef01ee550e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have no way of knowing which one is correct, or if both of them are, depending on the way that each identifies and quantifies fragmentation.&nbsp;&nbsp; What might come as a surprise is that it doesn't really matter.&nbsp; Defragging is, except in a few types of cases,
 a very overrated way of improving or maintaining system performance.&nbsp; If you stop worrying about it and just let the automatic optimization in Windows proceed, everything will be fine.&nbsp;

            Mine is performing in the same way.&nbsp; Windows defrag won't go below 10%.&nbsp; It seemed to start after an AMD device driver update but that may be coincidence.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, there is no option to download a previous version of 3d Builder. However, what we can suggest, is for you to restore that system to an earlier point in time.
<span>System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers. This may revert your 3d Builder back to the previous version.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To restore your computer to an earlier point in time. </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Search</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.) </li><li>Enter <strong>Control Panel </strong>in the search box, and tap or click<strong> Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Enter <strong>Recovery </strong>in the Control Panel search box, and then tap or click
<strong>Recovery</strong>. </li><li>Tap or click <strong>Open System Restore</strong>, and then follow the instructions.
</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in blue loading screen</h2>
                    <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a pretty serious problem and it's really worrying me.&nbsp; I have an Alienware Mx17 that I recently updated to Windows 10 a couple weeks ago.&nbsp; Everything has been fine with the exception of receiving an error when I tried saving pictures and or documents.&nbsp;
 The error stated that I did not have permission to save to the location (tried saving to folders in my library).&nbsp; Last night&nbsp;I finally decided to do something about it. Following instructions I saw posted here on the community forums, I went about changing
 ownership to the administrator, me.&nbsp; It seemed to be going ok, only receiving errors on a few folders that stated ownership could not be changed.&nbsp; As it was getting late, I decided to head to bed since the process was taking a while.&nbsp; I woke up in the middle
 of the night to this:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If I hit control+alt+del I can restart and shut down, but that's about it. I tried booting into safe mode, but got an incredibly loud beeping that said the rom could not be loaded. I am now in dire need of help. I can't lose what's on my computer. Recently
 I also lost my cellphone so I backed it up on this laptop. Not to mention everything of personal value that's on this thing. Please if anyone could point me in the right direction, I could really use some help!

            <p><span>Hi Joe,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.</span></p>

 to the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the account changing ownership try the below information provided and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to log-in with Microsoft account. If Microsoft account is your administrator account check if you have access changing ownership. If not, log-in to your administrator account and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also follow below method to keep your computer up-to date.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Update the Device Drivers on the Computer for all the devices installed on the computer and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Type “<strong>Updates</strong>” in the search bar and click on “<strong>Check for Updates</strong>” from the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>Now click on “<strong>Check for Updates”</strong> button on the right pane, to receive a fresh list of updates and then install all the updates listed there.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>For any issues while installing Windows Updates, you may also refer to this link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If no driver updates are available via Windows Update, then you may install them for all the devices on the computer from the Computer Manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to the computer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers available for all the devices on the computer and then install them by following the instructions given in the website. And let us know the statues.</span></p>

            It's a laptop, so I don't have any additional peripherals plugged in with the exception of a wireless mouse. I have unplugged that and attempted to start up with the same result. &nbsp;Also, your additional suggestions are of no help because the problem is,
 the computer stays on the above screenshot in a perpetual loop. The login screen never appears and the desktop never loads. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for your attempts, but I think this might be a little more complicated :/

            <p>I am having the same problem. I see that none of the self proclaimed experts were able to you. Maybe they would actually be of some use had they took the time to read your entire issue. Did you ever get this resolved?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated from 8.1 to 10 two days ago using the in place upgrade. Windows ran for a day and yesterday I was stuck on the blue loading screen same as you. System restore has not worked as it continues to fail. Start-up repair is also failing. But today I
 was able to boot into safe-mode. I did find about 30 failed updates. &nbsp;I deleted those and rebooted hoping that Windows was stuck trying to install and configure updates. But I am still stuck in that boot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide an update if you get this resolved.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here's an update as to whats going on. &nbsp;At the suggestion of my boss, I let the computer just sit there at the blue swirling screen. It literally takes almost 20 minutes but eventually the login screen appears. &nbsp;The computer runs decently enough, but I have
 to let it sit there on the blue swirling screen for a ridiculous amount of time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe that this still hasn't gotten answered by someone at Microsoft. HELP!</p>

            <p>I am in the same boat as other users in this post and it is frustrating that no MS knowledgeable tech is offering support here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading from Win 7, I clean installed Win 10 and made my main account the MS account. Had the same issue as others, having apps not being able to save into docs and picture folders. Also followed some instructions on changing ownership. My issue,
 loader stuck at the blue screen. Eventually I get to the login screen but there is no option to put in my login credentials. I can access the connection, accessability and shut down buttons on bottom right.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Booting into the USB that has Win 10 install on it, startup repair option is unable to diagnose problem. I really don't want to reset laptop at this point, so also looking for help and ideas on this. Any insights are much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            It has something to do with you changing the registry. If you can get into your computer after about 20 mins of waiting then try to go back to whatever file or drive you added your account to the security access on and change it back to whatever it was
 before make sure (USER)/Users doesn't have full control. Remove whatever access you gave any account try restarting your computer. Hopefully this fixes it, if not try unplugging you computer while it is starting up in the windows 10 logo screen and restart
 it and unplug it again. Keep doing this until the windows 10 tools boot up and go to troubleshooting and try using the windows repair tools.

            <p>POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had the same problem as OP. My recently bought Win10 Laptop did not let me save anything in my C Drive. I tried changing the ownership/security settings and I ended up getting stuck at the turquoise loading screen. I could hit ctrl+alt+del and I could shut
 the PC off, go to sleep, or restart. <br />
<br />
So I couldn't login. Unlike OP I was willing to start from square one just to get back onto the start menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Things I tried that did NOT work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring previous versions, even ones that were over a month old gave me the same problem</p>
<p>troubleshooting start up issues- windows could not detect anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOLUTION<br />
</p>
<p>I put Windows 10 as a media recovery on a 32gb flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the PC 3 times via the power button and then reinstalled Win10. <br />
<br />
I am now back into my PC, I luckily didn't have anything really on it so this just wasted my time but no serious harm was done.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps someone because I was very frustrated during this four hour period. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I still cannot save files under my C drive.... so here we go again&nbsp;</p>

            Hey IntenseJames,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />Quick question before I help you any further with this... are these both separate devices, or are these volumes on the same drive?
<br />
<br />This difference is very important as to figuring out how to configure it. If you want different drives into one, use a RAID configuration. Extend the volume by deleting the other one, and using that unallocated space to extend.
<br />
<br />Let me know, thanks.

<br />
<br />C: drive has maximum capacity of 117GB so how you can make it to 1TB?
<br />
<br />If you want to merge C: and D: drive, post us screenshot of Disk Management screen.
<br />
<br />Note that C: and D: must be on same physical drive to get merged.

            Hi James, I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />As these are two different drives, I am afraid you cannot add space of D to C.
<br />However, here is my standard set of instructions for gaining space.
<br />
<br />To gain space, follow the steps here:
<br />First of all, eliminate all useless files on C:/ by using Disk Cleanup.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-use-disk-cleanup-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-u...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure you have checked System files option after the first scan.
<br />Also, 
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
<br />
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            IntenseJames,
<br />
<br />These are different drives it seems, meaning you'd have to endeavor on establishing a RAID configuration, which I don't really recommend to consumers.
<br />
<br />I would say take advantage of that extra space on the other drive by installing future applications to that drive.
<br />
<br />If you have Pro, you can use Storage Spaces, more here: <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1001042/software-raid-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1001042/softwar...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if I can be of any more help.

<p>What you can do is to clone your C: drive to your D: drive, Disk 0, and then reformat the Disk 1.</p>

            Hi IntenseJames
<br />
<br />With that drive setup, you cannot add space to your C Drive, you need to move all data to your 1TB D Drive and just keep the 128GB SSD for Windows and Applications . . 
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Move all your User Library folders to D:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, right click your Documents folder and choose Properties
<br />
<br />Select the Location tab
<br />
<br />In the Location box, type D:\Documents then click Apply and Ok
<br />
<br />When that move completes, do the same for Pictures, Videos and Music
<br />
<br />Each time, provide a new folder location, for example, Pictures will go to D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Move the location of all future content downloaded from the Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage - Change where new content is saved:
<br />
<br />Change all options you find there to D
<br />
<br />3.
<br />If you are a Steam Gamer
<br />
<br />Stop all processes associated with Steam
<br />
<br />Move the Steam folder to your D drive manually
<br />
<br />Then open the Steam Control Panel and point that to the new location
<br />
<br />
<br />4.
<br />Please Note: this should ideally be done before you begin installing any software
<br />
<br />For 3rd party applications, some will allow you to choose an installation location, for those, create a new Program files folder on your D drive, then for each application, create a new sub-folder of that folder
<br />
<br />Other 3rd party applications will not allow you to change the installation location, and there is no safe way to move those to your D drive . . .

            Hi Rosemary,
<br />
<br />Are you on a PC or Laptop?
<br />
<br />If you are on a PC, there should be a Menu button on the side of your Monitor.
<br />
<br />Bring up that menu and there should be a Horizontal Position setting that you can adjust

            Even if you maintain a subscription, you may have to purchase credit. The credit would be used to cover the cost of calls outside the coverage of the subscription. If all the calls you make are covered, you will not need credit.

                    <p>I just purchased a Surface Pro 4 and it came with a keyboard. Some of the keys on the keyboard don't work. I have updated it, cleaned the contacts, and restarted it with both one and two fingers, but it still doesn't work. I cannot get through to a human
 being, how do I return this. I have had it for less than a month, warranty is still strong.</p>

            <p>Yes, that's correct Loran.&nbsp; You can use the Window Professional disc and then perform Upgrade. That will just put the new copy of system files to your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you have want the Ultimate version, then you may use the Ultimate disc or the ultimate product key to upgrade.</p>

<h2>            DVD Playback - XBox 360 S - Playback controls &#40;overlay&#41; won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;need help. I'm trying to play rented DVD movie on my XBox 360 S. The movie plays just fine and I&nbsp;can skip the chapters etc. However there is a DVD Controls overlay bar that sits across the bottom of the screen. It won't go away. No matter how many times I&nbsp;select "Back" it instantly re-appers. It stays up for the entire movie. Very annoying that I can't "hide" it, and I can find no settings within the cosole to control it. I&nbsp;have no idea how or where to even configure the settings for the DVD player. Can anyone help me?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Actually I&nbsp;just figured it out and resolved it myself. My son has a kid-sized XBox controller and we have it plugged into the front panel USB. Whenver the XBox console is powered on, that controller is powered on as well. I&nbsp;disconnected the controller from the console and pushed "Back" on our XBox 360 remote control and made the DVD Playback controls overlay disappear!&nbsp; We can watch our DVDs in full screen once again.</p>

<h2>            skype asking me to upgrade to a version of skype supported by win10</h2>
                    <p>But I don't have windows 10. I have Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged into skype and supplied them against my wishes with birthday, then skype quit and said i was logged out because I am using an old version of skype and needed to download the new version. I clicked on that download, and launched the exe file. Hours
 later, after watching a "this won't take long" screen, skype still not installed. On closer inspection, it appears the version required windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how can I update skype without updating windows.</p>

<p>Hello babayard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is to you. I'd be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most compatible version of Skype available for Windows Vista is 7.36. Try to install Skype using this link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-windows/downloading/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>Make sure that <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10980/how-can-i-make-sure-that-skype-is-no-longer-running?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype is no longer running</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, try to change your Internet connection and temporarily disable your Firewall and anti-virus as these may be restricting your access to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Switch from Insider Program to Stable Ring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rahulramesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Switch from Insider Program to Stable Ring</h2>
                    <p>A simple question - Suppose I install Windows 10 Technical preview today. I like to continue as an insider for about 3 months from now. After that period if I wish to opt out of Inside Program and switch back to a normal user with my genuine WIndows 8.1
 product key, will it be possible? Or will I have to reinstall Windows 8.1 and then update again to Windows 10 RTM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short is it possible to change product key inside Windows 10 and change the versions from Insider to normal user?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious to know because I am thinking to become an insider for some time rather than a normal upgrade. Hope some one can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>PS - I contacted Microsoft Customer Care regarding this, but they are not sure about the plausibility of such a thing.</em></p>

In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

            <p>This sounds good, so if I upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Insider Preview, what does that make me after the release of RTM? - Genuine Windows 10 license holder or an Insider trying out windows?</p>
<p>
And what you mean by trial version of RTM that will be available? Will it happen before July 29th as a Release candidate or so? It would be helpful if you can clarify.<br />

            <p>Hello punya b,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you install Windows Live Essential you are presented with a list of applications that can be installed. At the side of each application there is a check box. To install that particular item the check box needs to have a check mark (tick) inside the
 box. If there is no check mark inside the box then the product will not be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Control panel and click on the Program and Features icon. Look down the list of programs and locate the Windows Live Essential. Click (or double click) on this and you will be presented with an Uninstall box. Click on the Remove one or more Windows
 Essentials Programs. Check to see if Photo Gallery and Movie Maker is available. If it isn't then you will need to uninstall all Windows Essential programs and re-install again, making sure that you tick the box for Photo Gallery and Movie Maker.</p>

<p>Hi Bhushanam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do one thing, if you have the installation CD with you try to insert it into Laptop's DVD drive and then goto to windows installation setup. There you can find the repair option to repair it.</p>
<p>Definitely it will work for you. In case if the problem didn't get resolved, try to contact the customer support center of Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech recognition stops working&#47; switches from entering directly into the text to entering into a pop up box</h2>
                    <p>I have two separate questions.&nbsp; First, &nbsp;some times the speech recognition program stops working: the icon is on my screen, and says it is&nbsp;in listening mode, but either displays commands I have not used or shows "What was that? " no matter what I say.&nbsp; I
 have tried shutting down the program and reopening it, and shutting down the computer and reopening.&nbsp; Shutting down the computer usually works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second question is about where that dictated text goes.&nbsp; Some of the time, when I dictate, the words appear directly in the document, and sometimes they appear in a separate popup text box.&nbsp; I have been unable to figure out a pattern, as to why I sometimes
 it works one way or another.&nbsp; The program works better when I'm dictating directly into the document.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to control where the dictated works appear?
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The steps in the link do not work- there is no option to opt in to Cortana.&nbsp;&nbsp; The&nbsp; problem doe snot seem to be that the program can't hear me, but that the program has decided not to write what is said, but instead to jump to random commands or endlessly
 say "What did you say?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text box always shows up in excel, but shows up randomly in Word and other programs.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with length of utterance- the text box shows up more often than not when I am typing progress notes or letters.

<p>Hi Randa, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance your PC updated the system recently? Also, if Cortana is having difficulty hearing what you say, then we suggest doing the following the steps below. The steps are to manually adjust the gain for the voice recognition.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Right click on the speaker icon in the lower right hand corner of your desktop.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Select "Recording Devices".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Select your main input microphone.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Speak into the microphone</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Note the sound level meter.&nbsp; You want the level meter to peak every so often at the top of the bar but still show good bounce during your spoken text.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Ensure the microphone input is still selected and click properties.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click the Levels tab.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>If you have a microphone boost set it in the middle.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Now adjust the microphone gain by moving the slider.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Click “Apply” and verify that the level meter is responding as described in step 5.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll look forward to your response. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 turns off second monitor shortly after booting</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 on a PC with multiple monitors. Both monitors are connected to my nVidia GTX780.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time I boot up on most days, shortly after logging in my second monitor goes to sleep. If I look in Device Manager, my second monitor isn't even displayed.</p>
<p>I have to reboot the computer, and it will then work for the rest of the day.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd hypothesize that Windows is preparing to install an update and upsets my &nbsp;graphics card drivers in the process, because usually during that first reboot it will mention "configuring updates". I have attempted to turn off driver updates in the Windows
 settings, but this has done nothing to solve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating if I start work, then find my monitor turned off and everything shunted to my primary screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on here, and how can I fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

            <p>Thanks Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this doesn't work; I tried to download the latest driver from nVidia's website (358.50) and install it manually - but it would not allow me to install because it wasn't compatible.</p>
<p>I then tried it in Windows 8 compatibility mode, as you suggested, and did a "clean" install of the driver. After the mandatory restart I only had one screen at very low resolution and could not complete the install because "Nvidia Installer cannot continue
 - a system restart is required" no matter how many times I restarted. (still in compatibility mode). Device manager states that the driver had been disabled due to problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to work around this by using nVidia's Geforce Experience software, but this gave me the same error.<br />
</p>
<p>I escaped this by going into Device manager and getting Windows to install the latest driver, which it reports as being 355.60.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to my second screen issues occurring intermittently I can neither confirm nor deny whether this has done anything to help, so I will post again with my findings in a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sara</p>

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the above Windows 8 compatibility mode in install a windows 8 version fudged my drivers - I couldn't make any changes because "a restart is required". I couldn't update or uninstall the drivers because "a restart is required" even after restarting
 multiple times. I guess something was left in the registry? </p>
<p>I ended up downloading a third party tool to remove the driver completely while in safe mode, because it wouldn't let me uninstall it with the nVidia uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I managed to find a Windows 10 x64 driver for the GeForce 780 this time (I'd missed on GeForce.co.uk there is a Windows 10 driver, but the dropdown starts partway down and you need to scroll
<em>up</em> to find it) and installed that one, no compatibility mode required. I've got nVidia's GeForce Experience software too.</p>
<p>...But, yesterday on my first boot of the day, with the new drivers (358.50) I lost my second screen again.</p>
<p>On restarting, I lost my mouse cursor (keyboard was fine) and had to restart again. (Haven't had that happen since I first upgraded. I've got a RAT3 mouse)</p>
<p>Then everything was fine for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In short - I've got the latest drivers, Windows 10 64-bit version from nVidia's website, and I'm still having the problem.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sara.</p>

            <p>I've been having issues similar to this with my Windows 10 Enterprise.&nbsp; Mine will happen multiple times a day however. I'll come in, dock my laptop, boot, and everything is happy. If I lock my laptop though, and am gone for more than a few minutes, both
 of my monitors will not come up. The usual fix is to put my laptop into sleep mode (undock, open the lid, close the lid, redock) and then wake it back up. Every now and then, I actually have to power cycle my monitors for Windows to see the monitors again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All patches have been applied, and I have the most up to date drivers for my monitors and graphics card. It's driving me nuts!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to run Power troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />

b. Click on ‘View All’ on left side and select ‘Power’.<br />
c. Follow the onscreen instructions.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to create new power plan and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

            This has started for me ever since they made the new Fall Update. That Update is broken and now my system doesn't work properly. Fix the damned thing and stop making excuses!!! Everything I have tried doesn't work, so it's a problem with this new update.
