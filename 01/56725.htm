<h2>            multiple computers registered to the same email address.</h2>
                    I have several computers (4 of them) that were part of the upgrade from 7 to 10. However I used my email address for all of them (same email 4 boxes). If i reformat my comps, do I enter the same email address or is it going to deny more than one comp with
 the same MS account?

            <p>Hi Patricia,<br />
<br />
<br />
This issue could be caused due to some incorrect power settings or due to some corrupt or incompatible driver. To resolve the issue, we suggest you try the steps below:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Run the power troubleshooter</strong><br />
<br />
The power troubleshooter can automatically detect and resolve any incorrect power settings. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:<br />
<br />
1. Type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar and click it.<br />
2. Click <strong>System </strong><strong>&amp; Security.</strong><br />
3. Click <strong>Power </strong>and run the <strong>troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong><br />
<br />
If the power troubleshooter doesn’t detect any incorrect settings, then it is possible that the issue is caused by an incompatible or corrupt driver. When the computer goes to sleep mode, Windows sends a request to all hardware parts asking to enter sleep mode.
 But if the driver for a particular hardware part (like a network adapter or graphic card) is corrupt, it might not respond to these requests and may prevent the computer from entering sleep mode. To resolve this, we suggest you run Windows update to make sure
 that you have installed the latest drivers for all the devices. <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If updating all the drivers didn’t resolve the issue, then we suggest you check the Device manager to check if Windows has reported any hardware issues with any of the devices. Refer to these steps to check the device status:<br />
<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Device </strong><strong>manager</strong>.<br />
2. Locate the <strong>Bluetooth </strong><strong>adapter</strong>.<br />
3. Check if there is a yellow exclamation mark or a red cross mark over it.<br />
4. Right click on <strong>device </strong>and select <strong>properties</strong>.<br />
5. In the <strong>General </strong><strong>tab</strong>, check the device status.<br />
<br />
Get back to us with the results for further assistance.<br />

    <title>360 will not recognize proper format&#47;transfered data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sparrow69  say:</h3>
<h2>            360 will not recognize proper format&#47;transfered data</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded from a 360 elite to slim. To transfer my data, I used a Western Digital 320gig portable HD. I formatted the drive and transfered all my data. Before I had a chance to transfer the data to my new slim, I needed to use the hard drive for
 other purposes. I therefore copied all my files to my pc, re-formatted the drive to ntfs and went on my merry way. Now that I am ready to transfer the data to my slim, I cannot. I have reformatted the drive to the appropriate format (via my 360) and transfered
 the files from my pc (back to my portable hd). However, when I plug my usb drive into my 360, it is no longer formatted properly and I am asked to reformat. I would swear that I've done this exact same thing for a buddy of mine and didn't have this issue.
 What am I doing wrong? Should this work? I've tried copying the xbox 360 folder to the drive, as well as just copying the files contained in the folder. When I plug the drive into my 360, I am always asked to format the drive (even though it is properly formatted).
 Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>I think you may be out of luck. You should of just formatted the HD put the xbox files on there and moved it to the new xbox. &nbsp;To stop modders the xbox wont pick up files that weren't put on there by an xbox.

<p>remove the files from the hdd, reformat the hdd to FAT32 and put the files back on it, the 360 can only see that filesystem if used as a Memory Unit</p>

<p>Unfortunately doesn't work. The problem definitely lies with copying the files from my pc to the external disk. I've tried 2 different ext. hd and 2 different xboxs and same problem, I cannot get the 360 to recognize my saved files when I copy them from
 my pc to the xbox formatted usb key/external hard disk. I've formatted the drives to fat 32 through my 360 and also with my pc and still have the same issue.</p>

<p>You can't do this. Those files are hidden for a reason. Moving them renders them inoperable in most cases.</p>
<p>One "fix" that is reported to work is to create a new USB MU, then copy the old DATA002 files onward overtop of the ones created on the new MU.</p>

<h2>            Fresh install of Windows 10, PC wont sleep or switch off screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently did a fresh install of windows 10 on my desktop. Since the fresh install, the computer does not turn the screen off, or go to sleep even though these are enabled in the power settings. Running "powercfg -requests" shows "none" for all results,
 and no hardware has changed since before the fresh install, when sleep worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to trace what is causing it not to sleep and turn off the screen?</p>

            Hi Cocksy 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with Windows 10 issues described above.
<br />
<br />Check your power settings through the power options itnerface.
<br />  
<br />To see your power plans on Windows 10, right-click the battery icon in your system tray and choose “Power Options.” This screen can also be accessed from the Control Panel. Click the “Hardware and Sound” category and then select “Power Options.”
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<p>Hi Frenando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my PC is a desktop, I don't have&nbsp; battery icon in the tray. However, i can obviously access the same menu through the control panel and / or start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I have already checked the sleep and monitor switch off settings and no matter what they are set to (1 minute, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, etc), neither the monitor switches off, nor does the PC go to sleep.</p>

<h2>            ICS&#58; IP ERROR while enabling the internet connection sharing.</h2>
                    Hello All,<br />
<br />
My router "Netgear" gives the gateway IP 192.168.0.1 and my laptop is connected through wireless connection. When I enable internet connection sharing on my wireless connection, windows xp warns me with the below message:<br />
<br />
"When Internet connection sharing is enabled, your LAN adapter will be set to use IP Address 192.168.0.1. Your computer may lose connectivity with other computers on your network. If these other computers have static IP addresses, you should set them to obtain
 their IP addresses automatically.<br />
Are you sure you want to enable Internet Connection Sharing?"<br />
<br />
When I press "Yes" it gives me an error:<br />
<br />
"An error occurred while Internet Connection Sharing was being enabled.<br />
<br />
Internet Connection Sharing cannot be enabled.<br />
A LAN connection is already configured with the IP address that is required for automatic IP addressing.<br />
<br />
My question is, can we configure ICS service to enable it with other than the IP ADDRESS windows is forcing to apply?????<br />

            I'm sorry, but ICS is completely inflexible and doesn't support changing its LAN IP address.<br />
<br />
The settings that you found are for something else: allowing unsolicited connection requests from the Internet to pass through the ICS computer's firewall to a client computer.<br />
<br />
Change the router's LAN IP address.&nbsp; It's easy to do and will solve the problem.

<h2>            Old Xbox live account</h2>
                    
<p>I am guessing someone else has had this problem but I couldn't find the answer. I had a email and I only used it for my Xbox live account I sold my Xbox 360 like 4 years ago and stopped using the email address, im getting a Xbox one soon and I want to use
 my old gamer tag but when I try to sign in it says It looks like someone else might be using your account to help you and only you get back in to this account we need to verify that its yours. The next section is how do you want to receive your security code?
 by text or phone call. I don't have this phone number any more. &nbsp;Any ways I don't care about the email just the gamer tag connected to it. What should I do?</p>
<p>I don't think I could remember my Xbox live password but I saw somewhere that it can be changed so that should not be a problem and I can answer any security questions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot install KB2999226</h2>
                    <p>I've recently gotten a craving to play Runescape again, and it told me I needed this update (KB2999226). It downloads fine, but when installing, the progress bar gets to about 1/3, and then says failed, and then brings me to a screen that says "Some updates
 not installed", and of course KB2999226 is the only one listed. I don't get any help after that or any buttons other than just closing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the System Update and Readiness tool posted by someone with a similar problem, however this also just failed to install after nearly finished. I don't know what to do, I'm not getting a specific error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a huge deal, but any help would be appreciated, thanks!</p>

<p>what kinda batteries did you put in there? have you ever hard reset the controller? what about an update?
</p>
<p>Update one more time following these instructions: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4677/t/1734855.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../1734855.aspx</a></p>
<p>when you do a hard reset remove all batteries and usb cable and hold on the power button on the controller for a minute to drain all residual electricity in the controller, then plug the battery back in, try also brand new AA batteries, I personally prefer
 these batteries <a href="http://goo.gl/TZJme8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://goo.gl/TZJme8</a> for both my Xbox One &nbsp;controller and Scuf One Controller and if all these don't resolve your problem you will need a new controller. See if the one you have is still under
 warranty, if yes you can send it back and get a free replacement.</p>

<h2>            Product key not valid for Microsoft Word 2007 &#126; now what</h2>
                    I purchased a new laptop and Microsoft Office 2007 at the same time about 6 months ago. Everything was working just fine up tell about a week ago when my computer crashed. Now I am reinstalling everything and it seems to work untill I have to enter my
 product key into Microsoft Word. It tells me the product key is incorrect and I should verify and retype. I have done this and had others check to make sure I am entering in the correct key but it still is not working.
<br />
<br />
I am suppose to start classes again tomorrow and I must have Microsoft Word. Does anyone have any advice?

            The Product Key for Office is on the CD case on a sticker that says something like "DO NOT LOSE THIS KEY". The Product Key for Office is not on the sticker on the laptop.<br />
<br />
<span>If you have lost your XP product Key</span> , the best option is to call Microsoft. Call on Microsoft Licensing Fulfillment Center Toll Free Number (800) 248-0655 Monday through Friday, 6:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. Pacific time.<br />

            I know the product key for Microsoft Word is not the key on the bottom of the computer. I ALSO purchased (as it says in the OP) Microsoft Words 2007 (Standard) when I got the laptop. I still have the original product key and discs for my purchased copy
 of Microsoft Word 2007. However, my computer crashed and I need to reinstall evverything including the purchased copy of Microsoft Word 2007 but when I go to enter the product key in I am told it is incorrect please verify and retype.

<br />
<span>The Microsoft Activation Hotline</span> - (888) 571-2048
<br />
<br />
Also, did you do a factory restore of the computer and is there a trial version of Office preinstalled? If yes, then make sure you uninstall the trial version first.

<p>svchost.exe is a generic process that, as the name suggests, hosts services.&nbsp; You'll have to first determine which service is the one that's using the resources and then figure out why.</p>
<p>You can start with the built-in tools.&nbsp; In Task Manager, use the View menu to add a column to display PID.&nbsp; Then open a Command Prompt window and type</p>
<p>tasklist /fi "imagename eq svchost.exe" /svc</p>
<p>and press Enter.&nbsp; This will display information about all of the svchost.exe processes and list which services go with which PID.</p>
<p>Unless you see something pretty unusual in the list of services, however, you'll have to dig deeper.&nbsp; For that, get the free program Process Explorer from Microsoft.&nbsp; Process Explorer is a powerful tool, and using it is beyond what can be put in a simple
 forum answer.&nbsp; Start by reading some of the following:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=using+process+explorer+svchost&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=&amp;fp=36ec6be010d257f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Search 1</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=using+process+explorer+to+identify+services&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=C7YOcN-w7TITYL5HuzASm9qyBBgAAAKoEBU_QARRC&amp;fp=36ec6be010d257f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Search 2</a></p>
<p>You can also try a more brute force approach.&nbsp; Once you figure out the list of services in the instance of svchost.exe that is using the resources, you can stop them one by one [Start &gt; Run &gt; services.msc &gt; OK] until the resource use drops.&nbsp; Be aware, however,
 that randomly stopping processes may cause your computer to behave strangely.&nbsp; Also note that some services are dependent on other services -- you can't stop the top level service without also stopping all of its dependent services.&nbsp; For a great deal information
 on services, see Black Viper's <a href="http://www.blackviper.com/WinXP/servicecfg.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
website</a> and <a href="http://wiki.blackviper.com/wiki/Category:Windows_XP_Services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>LemP, thanks I appreciate your feedback but I must admit I'm still confused. I've downloaded and have running Process Explorer.&nbsp; I can see that PID 1496 is the process that is slowing my computer and keeps growing until it freezes my computer and then I
 have to reboot and the PID number is now changed.&nbsp; But the processes under the new PID are the same as before.&nbsp; The question I have is how do identify&nbsp;which process are used for what and which processes maybe the likely candidate?<br />
There are 29 services that are running under PID 1496.&nbsp; How do identify which may be the culprit and eliminate it?<br />
Do I look and see TrkWks is Distributed Link Tracking Client and close that one and see if that reduces the memory usage?&nbsp; Will it happen instantly?<br />
If I close down a service will it restart each time I reboot my computer?</p>
<p>Any assistance is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I wrote the material below the line of asterisks before I re-read your original post.&nbsp; A very likely cause of your problem is a conflict between Norton and Avira.&nbsp; You should<strong>never</strong> have two anti-virus applications active at the same time,
 and there are those who go so far as to say that you should never have two anti-virus applications installed.&nbsp; Although I think the latter is a bit extreme, some a/v applications -- such as Norton -- are virtually impossible to turn off completely.&nbsp; Moreover,
 several a/v applications -- I know this includes McAfee and I suspect Norton as well -- have "anti-tamper" technology that will prevent you from stopping them using Windows tools like services.msc.</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd remove Norton using the appropriate <a href="http://service1.symantec.com/support/tsgeninfo.nsf/docid/2005033108162039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Norton Removal Tool</a> , although you could optionally remove Avira instead.</p>
<p>After you preferably remove (or at the very least disable from real-time monitoring) one of your a/v applications, reboot and see if your svchost issue remains.&nbsp; If so, read on.</p>
<p>****************************************************************</p>
I'm not expert in the use of Process Explorer or its related tools, including Process Monitor, so I can't give you step-by-step cookbook type instructions. That said, there are a few basic things you should know before you start trying to dig into your problem.
<p>Services should be controlled by running services.msc from the Start &gt; Run box. When you run this, you'll see a list of all of the services available. Selecting a service will give you a very brief description of what it does, and you can also see whether
 it's running or not and what the "startup type" is set to.&nbsp; The startup type determines what happens when your computer is rebooted:&nbsp; "automatic" starts the service automatically; "manual" starts the service if and when the service is required; "disabled"
 prevents the service from starting.</p>
<p>Read Black Viper's website for introductory information.&nbsp; Black Viper's wiki explains what each service does. Be sure to read the section for XP.&nbsp; A similar source of information is The Elder Geek's<a href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/services_guide.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Services
 Guide</a> .</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to go through the list of 29 services and confirm that each of them is, in fact, a genuine Windows service and not malware.&nbsp; Clever malware may run as a service just because it then doesn't appear in the list of processes displayed
 in Task Manager.</p>
<p>Note The Elder Geek's advice: "Changing services settings can be just as dangerous as editing the registry. Have current -<em><strong>tested</strong>
</em>- backups of your system/data and understand how to restore them if something goes terribly wrong."&nbsp; If you have a disk imaging/cloning application such as Acronis True Image, Ghost, or Casper, I strongly suggest that you make an image before you start
 experimenting.</p>
<p>Using Black Viper and The Elder Geek's suggestions, you should be able to (at least temporarily) disable some of the services you have running without causing any drastic effects.&nbsp; I can tell you that on my XP system, the Distributed Link Tracking Client
 service is set to "manual" and is not running.</p>
<p>If you use services.msc to stop a service you should see an immediate effect in Task Manager -- but given that your problem is probably caused by something that is misbehaving, it's not clear what will happen in your situation.</p>

<p>Thanks, lots to digest.&nbsp; It's interesting you suggest removing Norton or at the very least disabling the program.&nbsp; One of my friends despises Norton &amp; McAfee.&nbsp; I've found they are both memory hogs and bog down the computer.</p>
<p>I downloaded the free version of Avira at the suggestion of my friend (he raves about it) and have found it to be very reliable and does not take over my computer's resources.</p>
<p>3 Questions...</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;What is your opinion and/or experience w/ Avira?<br />
2)&nbsp;If I remove Norton, should I upgrade to the premium version of Avira?&nbsp;<br />
3) If I upgrade to premium will the Avira&nbsp;also start noticeably slowing my computer?<br />
4) For testing purposes, How&nbsp;do I go about&nbsp;temporarily disabling each program individually from real-time monitoring&nbsp;so that I can see&nbsp;the effect it has on the memory usage?&nbsp; (Neither program wants to provide you with that information)</p>

<p>I'm sorry ... I thought I had responded to this earlier.</p>
<p>I don't have any experience with Avira, either the free version or the premium version, but others who post in these forums whose opinions I respect do recommend the free version.&nbsp; Personally, I like NOD32 Antivirus 4 from eset, but this is not free.&nbsp; I
 don't think you need the premium version unless you regularly visit sketchy web sites.&nbsp; If you<a href="http://elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Safe_Hex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">practice safe hex</a> and install and periodically scan with free<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malwarebytes
 Anti-malware</a> and free <a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware</a> , you should be fine.</p>
<p>If you right click on the Avira or Norton icon in the system notification area, you should get a menu that should lead to an option to disable real-time scanning. Whether doing so will reduce the application's memory usage, however, is another story.</p>

            Hi, is your system running on the Microsoft basic display driver ?
<br />
<br />If so you need to install the proper Video driver for your system, in order for it to function properly and to have all the other options like changing the refresh rate
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your system?       
        </p>

<p>Dave more then a week since windows update either driver bad stack or fix they made for display now my system have issue i get a flag next to graphic card in device manager some time it tell me the device work properly other time a code 43 some other time
 i get a notice that windows decided to switch me to Microsoft basic display driver i get bsod screen of different color system that reboot by it self some other time i need to reboot it my self. i get monitor message saying that the monitor require a timing
 of 1920x1200 60 hertz. the Microsoft basic display driver(driver date 2006) only give 64 hertz. causing issue. also look at windows 10 display setting you will see no option for hertz setting so they have over look that part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>more then 1 week of work on the desktop to try to find a fix for what ever went wrong with the windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i did clean install 2 time apart from every thing else and some windows update pushed down in this mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>finally able to boot the desktop not in safe mode stopped all windows update the last one for security made it worst i have uninstall that one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>look similar to the kb4079588 that did not stack driver properly for some system. making flag next to device manager usb device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>except this time it affect display driver.</p>

            Well, you have been through a lot . . 
<br />
<br />Yes, KB4079588 was a particularly bad update, do you know the actual graphics device on your system . . .
<br />
<br />What generally works in getting your graphics up and running again is:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager - Accessible by right clicking your Start Button 
<br />Expand the Display Devices section 
<br />Right click your graphics card and choose properties 
<br />On the driver tab, choose 'Roll Back Driver' 
<br />If the Roll back option is grayed out, right click the device and choose Uninstall 
<br />Confirm deletion of the driver files 
<br />
<br />Either way, restart your PC . . .

<p>device is nvidia gtx 660 on a dell xps 8500 special edition. i have upgraded to windows 10 and 5 month later dell decided that they would not update that system to windows 10 saying that if you upgraded it void the dell warranty and support and Microsoft
 is the one taking care of you for warranty and support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have add issue at the anniversary update. spent couple of week with Microsoft support. i finished by fixing the rest my self took around 2 month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now 1 week of trying to fix the desktop again after a windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>trying to find the right fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>found error code in event viewer nvlddmkm minigit dwm.dll dwmcore.dll 32 second delay driver query power state failure cause by low power state for device peripheral.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have run about every fix i could. cmd dism.exe sfc /scannow&nbsp; boot mbr fix i get a 00B2 checkpoint failure sometime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>main issue is the Microsoft basic display driver that is 64 hertz only that get put by windows causing screen timing issue and plug and play connect disconnect communication issue between hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this switch happen because there is a flag in device manager what cause the flag to pop up i have no idea since sometime i get a code 43 some other time a flag and the system say the device is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Microsoft found what error they made in their update and what update to remove for the fix i know that one update cannot be removed i hope that it is not the one making the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you find anything on the subject i await some info to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>to fix the driver i have use ddu to remove the driver and clean the registry made a driver reinstall from NVidia driver391.05 same version number as the windows driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>issue was still happening i have remove the device from device manager and restarted the pc the fix is not working for long. more a temporary fix then a long term permanent fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sfc scannow have some corrupted file in the cbs log i have more then one owner ship on some windows defender some apps mismatching hastag around 10 of them but i have a windows. old after making the clean install. so i don't know if that is the cause. i
 have also a mini dump error showing up on volume 7 this seams related to the windows anniversary bad update and when i made the reinstall it was on the wrong partition. that is why it took couple of week to fix with Microsoft windows support. they even told
 me two time they would get me a level 2 tech and it never as happen. after they asked me to buy a support plan i said it is a Microsoft issue so i should not pay anything. then i finished to fix it up my self since thing did not progress any more in fixing
 issue.</p>

<p>dave what i think is happening is that the error they made affect dwm.exe dwmcore.dll this control many of the display process and software this is the windows apps that crash the most. 357 time it crashed. i have some nvlddmkm error also but a lot less
 of them. nvlddmkm is the graphic card driver that failed to start. that maybe be why i sometime get error 43. since it happen after a windows update and i did not made any change prior to the error happening. i guess it is a windows bug. that cause dwm.exe
 to crash then it think there is error with the graphic card driver making a code 43. then Microsoft basic display driver take over and since it is not proper timing it cause issue signal timing issue in the hardware. causing the system to shut down and restart
 making windows corruption. apart from the time i need to do it my self to try to get back resolution on the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the weird part is that when i can get in the windows os and it does not fail i can spend hours on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i put the system in sleep mode and try to move the mouse or a keyboard key to wake the system up. It will not start up and it&nbsp; make a boot restart then the error come back again. most often i can come back again in the os after doing a safe mode and restarting
 the desktop.&nbsp; if not 9 out of 10 time the same dwm.exe error happen again and Microsoft basic display driver will take over and when this happen the monitor that require proper timing is not able to get the signal since it is pnp it make detection sound then
 eventually the desktop reboot. then you can have around 10 reboot like this so the need to go in safe mode so it stop the Microsoft basic display driver and get to use the graphic card driver again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>still waiting on the next windows update that will fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that correct what ever they did that caused the issue. and since they are working on it to solve the second problem a Microsoft basic display driver that could give the proper timing for monitor would be a great help in fixing those issue. the Microsoft
 basic display driver date back to 2006 we are now in 2018 12 years later and they never notice that monitor do not work with it when a proper timing is require. What good does it do to switch to Microsoft basic display driver if the driver cause more issue?
 hardware communication failures bsod and kernel reboot.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Print Artist crashes when trying to insert photo from file.</h2>
                    <p>I have been creating family Christmas letters for years using the Print Artist software.&nbsp; About 4 years ago I purchased the PA 25 for my letters.&nbsp; It did work on Windows 10 although at times there would be a problem.&nbsp; About a month ago everytime I try to
 insert a picture it just stops working and the project I was working on and the whole program just disappears!</p>
<p>If Microsoft cannot solve this, can anyone tell me an easy software program I can buy that will work with Windows 10?&nbsp; I really need to have a dependable program.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>old microsoft account still asking for password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordyhines  say:</h3>
<h2>            old microsoft account still asking for password</h2>
                    I switched to a new Microsoft account over a year ago. I switched Outlook, Office, Skype, and of course the main Microsoft account. All seem to be using the new account and they all list the new account email. However, I daily get a popup stating there
 is a problem with the Microsoft account. When I click on it it wants to sign me into the old account, and it won't allow me to change the email address to the old one. Also, certain tasks, like downloading a codec or chatting with support, asks me to log into
 the old account.&nbsp; I need to find where this old account is still listed and eliminate it. Any ideas?&nbsp; Thanks.

            Hello JordyHines,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />You need to delete old Microsoft account in registry.
<br />
<br />Create a System Restore point first, then try this:
<br />
<br />Open Registry Editor and go to HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\StoredIdentities.
<br />
<br />Under StoredIdentities registry key, look for registry sub-key for the exact old Microsoft account. Right click on it and select Delete. In the confirmation prompt appeared next, select Yes.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<p>I am able to login to my microsoft.com account with the new account. I have no devices listed in the account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Under this key is listed both my new and old accounts emails as USER inside separate, numbered folders:</p>
<p>\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\ActiveSync\Partners\123456789...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under this key is listed two folders, each named with my new and old account emails:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\UserExtendedProperties\*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>This key has a numbered subfolder that lists the entries AUTHENTICATING AUTHORITY as MicrosoftAccount and IDENTITYNAME that is the old email address.There is a second numbered folder that lists the same keys but with the correct email address.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\IdentityStore\LogonCache\D7F9888F-E3FC-49b0-9EA6-A85B5F392A4F\Name2Sid</p>

<h2>            Tomb Raider&#58; Underworld on Steam fails since Creators update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was playing "Tomb Raider: Underworld" on Steam since a few weeks when the "Creators Update" got installed. &nbsp;Since that moment, starting the game, a message box appears with that name and text:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Erreur Tomb Raider: Underworld<br />
Ce jeu nécessite une carte graphique compatible DirectX9.0c.&nbsp;<br />
Votre carte graphique ou vos pilotes ne sont pas compatible avec l'accélération 3D de DirectX9.0c.<br />
<br />
Which to english translate to:<br />
Error Tomb Raider: Underworld<br />
This game requires a DirectX9.0c compatible graphics card.<br />
Your graphics card or drivers are not compatible with DirectX9.0c 3D acceleration.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled all Steam games and Steam client, reinstalled Steam and that game.<br />
I use DriverBooster to keep my drivers up to date, after a few days, it found an update for my graphic card: AMD Radeon R9 200 Series.<br />
I reinstalled DirectX 9 from the Tomb Raider installation files.<br />
I run the "Check for file" option in steam.<br />
I tried to run the game and the Steam client as an administrator.<br />
<br />
Still the same error appears while Battle.Net and HearStone are working and another old game: King Quest 7 from GOG.com is working too !<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it would help but can we go backward on the Creators Update installation ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help,<br />
Claude<br />

    <title>Display color problem Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victorrochajr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display color problem Windows Vista</h2>
                    Hi, for awhile now I've been looking for an answer to my problem. The problem is that whenever certain programs come up or windows defender displays a security warning to approve. The screen goes black then the message pops up. Once the message has been
 approved or rejected the screen returns to its original state but with a red tinge to it. This problem is solved by restarting my computer but it's not a practical thing to do everytime the screen turns red. I'm wondering if anyone has suggestions to a possible
 solution. I'm running Windows Vista home premium 64bit. I've checked to see that I do not have any programs that control monitor colors and temperatures other than Windows. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

            &nbsp;Hello Victorrochajr,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Community Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions that might help us better assist with your issue.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
1) Does this happen only in certain programs, such as games, videos or does it occur when running all types of programs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Is this something that just started with your computer? If so, what has changed in your environment? Did you install a new program, an update or any new hardware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) If this is something new within a few days you might be able to restore to an earlier point in time with System Restore.</p>
<p>To use System Restore, follow the directions in the following KB article:</p>
<p>KB 936212 - How to repair the operating system and how to restore the operating system configuration to an earlier point in time in Windows Vista</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) If you boot your computer in Safe Mode, do you still have the problem with the screen turning black and then red?
<br />
To start the computer in safe mode, press the F8 key while the computer is starting. You must press the F8 key before the Windows Vista progress indicator appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To determine whether the screen turning red is caused by another program that is running in the background, we recommend that you restart the computer in safe mode and then test again. If your computer
 runs correctly in safe mode, but does not run correctly in normal mode, there likely is a program that is conflicting with your computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) To determine which program is causing a conflict, we recommend that you perform a "clean boot" of the computer. A clean boot is intended to disable as many background services and programs as possible.
 This helps determine which service or program may be causing the problem. <br />

            <p>Hi Eliazbeth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you with your issue, we'll be needing some information. Do you received an error when accessing your files on your hard drive? Are you also log in to the computer as an administrator? Check if D drive is listed in computer management. If its not
 there, you may try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Start </li><li>Click on Control Panel </li><li>Administrative Tools</li><li>Computer Management </li><li>Disk Management</li><li>Hover your mouse over the D drive icon until a text message appears and then copy down the message exact as it reads in the order presented.
</li></ol>
<p>If not, it really isn't being recognized. Go to Start / Control Panel / Device Manager and look for your D drive there.&nbsp; If you find it then double click on it to show more details.&nbsp; Does it say that it's working properly?&nbsp; If it doesn't show up there then
 the system doesn't even have device drivers for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesebel Ova</p>

<h2>            Connecting Computer to Tv with HDMI</h2>
                    I am trying to connect my computer (Dell Precision M 4700) with windows 7 to my Samsung TV with a HDMI cable. Every time i connect the cable to my computer the screen goes blank and it still doesn't show anything on the TV screen either.

            <p>Sometimes, when I first connect a computer to my HDTV via HDMI, it doesn't recognize it initially.&nbsp; In these cases, I will turn off the TV, connect the computer, turn the computer on, then turn on the TV and set it to the correct HDMI input.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you connected other things (like a monitor) via HDMI before?&nbsp; Are there settings on your laptop for routing video to both an internal and external monitor?&nbsp; If so, have you tried toggling it to that mode?</p>

                    I have turned off all power saving functions; even all the obscure ones and I still have a problem. I have modified one file in the Register (fix on web) that did not work either.

            Hi Tony, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Power. This might fix the error.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, I'd recommend completely resetting your Power options to default, which may fix the issue. Here are instructions on how to do this:

<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if you need more support. Thanks!
