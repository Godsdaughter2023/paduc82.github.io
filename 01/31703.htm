<h2>            admin account do not show up in boot menu when starting the computer</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from W7 to W10 using my administrator account.&nbsp; When prompted to create a windows password I chose not to do that.&nbsp; Today when I booted up I was only given the option to boot into a local non-admin. account and can no longer find or see my admin
 account on desktop.&nbsp; How do I get my admin. account reactivated so that opens upon bootup?&nbsp;The already available answers don't really address my situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your assistance.&nbsp; Gordon</p>

<p>Step 1: Enable Build in administration account.<br />
1) Press Windows + X key together on your desktop screen.<br />
2) Click on <strong>Command Prompt (admin</strong>) to open Command Prompt.<br />
3) Type the following command and hit Enter: </p>
<p><em>net user administrator /active: yes (Check for the spaces</em>)</p>
<p>4) Now log off from the current user.</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>
<p>Step 2: Log in to your computer, through Build in<strong> Administrator account</strong>.<br />
1) Press Windows + r and type <strong>netplwiz</strong>, press Enter.<br />
2) Select your existing<strong> user account</strong>.<br />

            <p>Komoupji, thank you very much for prompt response. Yes your answer was very helpful. Using the Windows logo and X got me to command prompt. &nbsp;When I typed in words I kept getting "entered invalid value for the /Active Option" and "more help: type NET Help:msg
 3952". &nbsp;I ignored this and logger out of local account and my admin account appeared. &nbsp;I then logged into admin and all good now. Thank you for getting me back on track&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your username is now <em>Administrator</em> then you are indeed logged into the Built-In Administrator account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Built-In Administrator account suppresses UAC protection so you, or an internet hacker who has got through to your system, can install anything or change anything without any Admin warning being shown onscreen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intended use of the Built-In Administrator account is during automatic system recovery rather than for normal operations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The safest&nbsp;thing to do with&nbsp;the Built-In Administrator account is to use it to create additional password-protected Admin-level local user accounts and then to disable the Built-In Administrator account so that it cannot be corrupted.&nbsp; Admin-level accounts
 created this way give you the ability to get in the system to fix things if, for example, your day-to-day user account suffers from user profile corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, if you were able to run the <span>
<em>Net user administrator /active:yes</em> command then the user account you were logged into at the time must have been an Admin-level account.&nbsp; [Note also that the correct syntax is
</span><span><em>Net user administrator /active:yes</em> -&nbsp;there is no space before yes].&nbsp; You could therefore have created these useful additional
</span>password-protected Admin-level local user accounts without enabling the Built-In Administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Denis</p>

            <p>Denis thank you for your reply. &nbsp;When I boot up I now get two options; 1) admin account or 2) local account. &nbsp;Admin account does not have the name admin. &nbsp;Instead it has my user name. &nbsp; Am I correct in thinking that I have indeed created my own admin account?
 &nbsp;You mentioned disabling the built in Admin account but I don't know how to do that?</p>

            <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand you correctly, when you boot up you have the choice of logging into either of two local accounts that you created yourself and you know that because the account names are the ones you chose [and that you know are an Admin-level user account
 &amp; a Standard-level user account].</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because of the potential for confusion [after the false syntax you were given in the first reply in this thread], I suggest a quick check using
<em>net user</em> commands.&nbsp; You can do this using either of the two local accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Right-click on the Start menu, select Command prompt [Admin].</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>If you are in your Standard user account you will then have to put in&nbsp;your Admin account's name &amp; &nbsp;password.&nbsp;
</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are in your Admin-level account you'll just click on&nbsp; a button.</em></p>
<p>2&nbsp; Enter <em>net user </em>[where I write "enter", I mean type in what I have written in italics then press the Enter/Return key]</p>
<p>3&nbsp; You'll see something like this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6900384-96f5-420c-bb5e-216d46316b56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6900384-96f5-420c-bb5e-216d46316b56" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; I blocked out the seven user accounts that I created on the computer to&nbsp;highlight the ones that Windows created.&nbsp; The important one is the
<em>Administrator</em> account entry.&nbsp; Does that entry exist on your computer?&nbsp; If it does then great and that's really what I would expect as I'm being overly cautious even asking you to check this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; Enter this command&nbsp;<em>net user </em><em>Administrator</em>&nbsp;and look at the results.&nbsp; You might&nbsp;see&nbsp;an entry&nbsp;<em>Account active&nbsp;No
</em>or an entry&nbsp;<em>Account active&nbsp;Yes</em>. &nbsp;If it says <em>Yes</em> then make it inactive [disabled] using the command</p>
<p><em>Net user Administrator /active:no</em></p>
<p>Just while you are there, you'll also see the entry&nbsp;<em>Comment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
</em>This entry can be useful in identifying the <em>Administrator</em> account if it has been renamed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6&nbsp; Enter this for each of your own accounts [but using the correct names]<em>&nbsp;net user&nbsp;Gordon
</em>and <em>net user&nbsp;GordonsAdmin</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are useful bits of information in there that can help you in particular circumstances, for example,</p>
<ul>
<li>If&nbsp;a user account is linked to an MSAccount, its <em>Full name</em> entry will be the full name shown in its online MS account page.&nbsp; So the username Gordon might have a
<em>Full name</em> Gordon Kennedy.</li><li>If&nbsp;a user account is not linked to an MSAccount but a local user account then its
<em>Full name</em> entry will be exactly the same as its user name.&nbsp; So the username Gordon would also have&nbsp;the
<em>Full name</em> Gordon.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>7&nbsp; You can save any of this information using these commands as patterns but substituting your own information:</p>
<p>net user &gt;C:\Users\<em>Gordon</em>\Desktop\NetUser-UserAccountsList.txt</p>
<p>net user Administrator &gt;C:\Users\<em>Gordon</em>\NetUser-UserAccountDetails-Administrator.txt</p>
<p>net user Gordon &gt;C:\Users\<em>Gordon</em>\NetUser-UserAccountDetails-Gordon.txt</p>
<p>net user GordonsAdmin &gt;C:\Users\<em>Gordon</em>\Desktop\NetUser-UserAccountDetails-GordonsAdmin.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>8&nbsp; Let me know if any of the results are of concern.&nbsp; If there is anything wrong then it will probably be easy to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Warning&nbsp; -a sermon follows</span>&nbsp; When this is all resolved, do yourself a favour.&nbsp; In addition to the user accounts you intend to use for day-to-day tasks, create two additional password-protected Admin-level
 local user accounts and write down their passwords somewhere secure.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>If your normal user accounts ever suffer from <em>user profile corruption</em> &amp; becomes unable to log on then you will be able to get into the computer using one of these accounts to rescue the situation.&nbsp;
</li><li><em>User profile corruption</em> will be, for you, an annoyance rather than a catastrophe.&nbsp; If you have several hours to waste, you can search the forum for&nbsp;<em>user profile corruption</em>&nbsp;and will see the plight of those who did not have a spare Admin-level
 account to use in order to sort things out.&nbsp; Complete reinstallation of Windows is the only remedy that we are allowed to recommend in this forum because anything else is tantamount to being password-cracking advice and that is not allowed.</li><li>The causes of&nbsp;<em>user profile corruption</em> are not documented or particularly well understood but are generally thought to include repeatedly shutting off the computer without letting it go through its proper shutting down sequence [disconnecting power,
 catastrophic battery failure, holding down the power button for more than 10 seconds to force it off if the computer has frozen] - this can damage the user profile of the currently logged on user account not any other user accounts.&nbsp;
</li><li>If you have spare Admin accounts that are not used very much they will not have&nbsp;much chance to get corrupted.&nbsp;</li><li>You might see recommendations to create a <em>Password reset disk</em> for each user account.&nbsp; I use to recommend this as well but it achieves no more than writing down the password achieves so there is really no point.&nbsp; I have my account passwords written
 on a strip of paper that rolls up into one of those little dog name tubes and it lives on my keyring.</li></ul>

            <p>Denis, thanks for latest reply. &nbsp;Before I followed those steps I hit control/alt/delete to switch users. &nbsp;I have three accounts set up:</p>
<p>1) Administrator</p>
<p>2) Gordon Standard account</p>
<p>3) Gordon Administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched to each one starting with #1 above, logged into each and then ran command prompt as you instructed.</p>
<p>1) Administrator acct; &nbsp;Prompted for a password but none had been created for this account so left pw field bland and got in; &nbsp;then Command Prompt - ADMIN shows "Yes Active" and the words "Built in account for administering the computer/domain"</p>
<p>2)Standard acct. &nbsp; not prompted for pw got right in; Command Prompt shows Active Yes and labled as standard acct.</p>
<p>3)Gordon Administrator acct: prompted for and input pw I created; then command prompt - ADMIN shows same as #1 &nbsp;Active Yes and "Built In account for admin. computer/domain".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand your instructions, I should go into the first account and disable that one so that it reads Active "No". Leave #2 as is. &nbsp;For last acct. gordon admin I am not clear what to do - disable it or leave it as is. &nbsp;I did not take any actions until
 I am clear. &nbsp;Thanks &nbsp;Gordon</p>

            <p>Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your results show that there is one small problem.&nbsp; It is not a huge concern &amp; will easily be fixed but I think you ought to deal with it now or you might find strange symptoms later on that defy explanation because you have forgotten about this subject.&nbsp;
 I want to take it one step at a time to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that you have somehow managed to copy the Built-In Admin [called, as you know,
<em>Administrator</em>] and that copy is called <em>Gordon Administrator</em>.&nbsp; I have no idea how you did this but it must have happened during that confusing set of error messages you got when that original syntax had a space in it.&nbsp; The Built-In Admin bypasses
 some aspects of security [that can be reset easily but I have never had to test it properly] but, in Windows 10, it also has undocumented limitations that I only know one of [because I identified it during some experiments].&nbsp; So please would you log in to&nbsp;<em>Gordon
 Administrator</em> and do these tests as they will tell me which properties of the Built-In Admin account have been inherited.</p>

<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Create a new Admin account using the Command prompmt</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.1&nbsp; Open an elevated Command prompt - Right-click on the Start menu, select Command prompt [Admin].</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.2&nbsp; You should normally get an Admin challenge at this point - tell me whether or not you do.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.3&nbsp; Decide on the name you want to use for a new, additional Admin-level user account.&nbsp; You are allowed to use spaces in user names but it is safest not to because spaces then require "" to be used in some commands and unpredictable things can happen if
 you forget them.&nbsp; I'll call this new account <em>TechAdmin</em> and give it a password 12345 [if you use passwords without any spaces &amp; without any funny digits such as the | or ¦ characters, you can set the password you really want straightaway or you can
 just go back in to Control panel later to set the password&nbsp;to something sensible instead].&nbsp; Remember to write the password down or save it in a text file to copy later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.4&nbsp; To create the new account, enter this command <em>net user TechAdmin 12345 /add</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2.5&nbsp; </em>Check its properties just as you did earlier on&nbsp;to make sure it does not have that same copied property by entering this command -
</p>
<p><em>net user TechAdmin&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.6&nbsp; Does it have the <em>Comment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
</em>???&nbsp; I do hope not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.7&nbsp; If it is okay then make it an Admin-level account to get he whole job done by entering this command
</p>
<p><em>net localgroup Administrators TechAdmin&nbsp; </em><em>/add</em></p>
<p>2.8&nbsp; If this was all okay then you might as well create the other new Admin now as well.&nbsp; I'll call it
<em>FinalAdmin</em> and give it a 12345 password again but you can use whatever you like as long as you avoid spaces or those awkward digits.&nbsp; Remember to write the password down or save it in a text file to copy later.</p>
<p><em>net user </em><em>FinalAdmin</em><em> 12345 /add</em></p>
<p><em>net localgroup Administrators </em><em>FinalAdmin</em>&nbsp; <em>/add</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; I suggest that you regard <em>TechAdmin</em> as the account to use if you have to log on as an Admin to sort out problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.1&nbsp; You can use either <em>TechAdmin</em> or&nbsp;<em>FinalAdmin</em> to authorise installations etc in the future.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3.2&nbsp; You will probably never have to log in to&nbsp;<em>FinalAdmin</em> as it is there just as a last resort.&nbsp; If you never log on to it then&nbsp;it will not have a folder within C:\Users\...&nbsp; - that is not&nbsp;a problem.&nbsp; I have never had to log into my
<em>FinalAdmin </em>either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; When you tell me how you got on, I will probably advise you to </p>
<p>4.1&nbsp; copy any files you want from C:\Users\<em>Gordon Administrator</em> </p>
<p>4.2&nbsp; test a particular account limitation I expect to see with <em>Gordon Administrator</em></p>
<p>4.3&nbsp; disable both the proper <em>Administrator</em> and the <em>Gordon Administrator</em>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>But that's just tidying up&nbsp;as the real work will have been done.</p>

            <p>Denis, here is the latest. &nbsp;I followed your instructions to find out the UAC setting (I looked at all three accounts - gordon Admin, Admin and gordon local.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding gordon Admin, I was not challenged for pw and security setting is default.</p>
<p>Regarding Admin, not challenged and security default setting</p>
<p>Regarding gordon local acct., I was given the admin challenge and prompted for a pw. &nbsp;However &nbsp;this acct. has no password so I simply hit enter and security setting is "high" for this acct.

<p>
</p><p>Step 2: tried to create new admin acct. using command &nbsp;prompt (admin). &nbsp;I was challenged with this phrase "do you want to allow this app to make changes .." but not prompted for a pw.</p>
<p>I followed your instructions to create a new admin account using net user (new acct name) and pw.</p>
<p>Got message "could not find that user account and advised to go to helpdsk menu".</p>
<p>Ignored that and input the next phrase "net localgroup Administrators (new acct. name), pw /add and again got message "could not find user account go to helpdsk"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stopped at that point as nothing seemed to be going according to plan. &nbsp;Not sure what to do at this point. &nbsp;Thanks for continuing to work with me. &nbsp;Gordon&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry.&nbsp; There were errors in my last post - paras 2.4 &amp; 2.7.&nbsp; I have corrected them now.&nbsp; The command to create a new account was incomplete and would have had no effect [so it will have done no harm, fortunately].&nbsp; The commands should have been</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>net user TechAdmin 12345 /add</em></p>
<p><em>net localgroup Administrators TechAdmin&nbsp; </em><em>/add</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>net user </em><em>FinalAdmin</em><em> 12345 /add</em></p>
<p><em>net localgroup Administrators </em><em>FinalAdmin</em>&nbsp; <em>/add</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go ahead with section 2, creating the new accounts.&nbsp; Judging by the responses you have had, I think you have the choice of doing them the way I suggested or doing them through Settings, Accounts [i.e. the normal way].</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the checks of UAC on the new accounts.&nbsp; There is something seriously wrong with your existing ones, see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>About "<em>Regarding gordon Admin, I was not challenged for pw and security setting is default.</em>"&nbsp; Since UAC was on, you should have had a challenge.&nbsp; If you were logged in to Gordon Admin at the time the challenge would just have required you to click
 on the button rather than enter an Admin account name &amp; password first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About "<em>Regarding gordon local acct., I was given the admin challenge and prompted for a pw. &nbsp;However &nbsp;this acct. has no password so I simply hit enter and security setting is "high" for this acct.
</em>"&nbsp; The password required is not that of the Gordon local acct, it is the username &amp; password of&nbsp;an Admin account authorising you to see this setting.&nbsp; The system should not have let you through without them.&nbsp; You cannot get through this box by pressing
 Enter.&nbsp; This means there is a serious problem with your account settings.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>About "Regarding Admin, not challenged and security default setting"&nbsp; The normal setting for UAC on the account called
<em>Administrator</em> is Off.&nbsp; It is possible to change it manually.&nbsp; As soon as I have finished some current tasks, I will re-test my own
<em>Administrator</em> account to see if things have, for some reason, changed.&nbsp; But they have been as they are for 7 years and there have been no announcements about what would be a radical departure from the previous security setup.&nbsp; I'll be back within an
 hour.</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes when i launch Firefox or Internet Explorer</h2>
                    
<p>Most of the time it freezes, sometimes I get lucky and it won't freeze.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 7 64-bit.&nbsp; Computer runs fine if I don't launch Firefox or IE.&nbsp; I can use it for hours with no problems.&nbsp; But the second I launch FF or IE the computer freezes.&nbsp;
 FF &amp; IE runs fine in safe mode with network enabled.&nbsp;</p>
Maybe its got to do with my wireless drivers conflicting with another driver? My wireless card is a Airlink 101 300N wireless PCI adapter.&nbsp; The drivers was automatically downloaded through windows update, I tried to download it from the manufacturers website
 but windows says its not digitally signed drivers and i don't want to use F8 to bypass it all the time.<br />

5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart<br />
7. Log back into your account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try to determine which background program is causing the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To find the process or program at cause follow the steps starting at
<strong>enable half of the Services items</strong>, from the following article:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Refer this link for more information:</span></strong></span></p>

            <p>I’ve found the answer. At Least for Sony VAIO under Windows 7. In order to get the TCP/IP V4 settings to stay either at obtain DNS Server automatically or at new fixed IP addresses you need to edit the profile. To do this you need to do the following:<br />
1) Start Vaio Control Centre from the all programs menu.<br />
2) Select Network Connections<br />
3) Select Vaio Smart Network.<br />
4) Click on advanced<br />
5) Click on Settings (quickly before the Window disappears)<br />
6) Click on Profile Settings<br />
7) Select the profile you are using<br />
8) Click Edit<br />
9) Select IP and DNS<br />
10) Select Obtain DNS Server Automatically or specify OpenDNS addresses.<br />
11) Click Finsh<br />
and thats it.</p>

            <p>Had exactly the same problem on my 640, reporting that the charge was at a low rate. All the documentation is about assuming that you are using a non original charger, I was. It also took several minutes to even acknowledge it was being charged by the beep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the last update cleared the problem, goes into charge almost immediately and I no longer get the "wrong charger" message</p>

            <p>Hello Pauline,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have issues with the random black screen in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I would like to know some more information, to help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meanwhile, please follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For the issues of black screen in Windows:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>I would suggest you to boot to safe mode and access the internet, check if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Refer to the link below to boot to safe mode.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong><span>If you the issue doesn't occur in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot because, p</span><span>utting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are
 causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.
</span><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><em>Note: </em></span></strong><span><em>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting</em><strong><em>.</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>If that doesn't help then, try to follow the suggestions mentioned in the link below and see if that helps.</p>

            Hello, to find the default wallpapers and themes found within Windows 10, go into this directory:
<br />C:\Windows\Web
<br />You will be able to copy these files and play around with them!
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

            Hi  thunderfoot7
<br />
<br />If that theme is coming down as a ThemePack file, you should find that file in this folder:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\Resources\Themes
<br />
<br />Make a copy of that Themepack file in a new folder on your Desktop
<br />
<br />On the View ribbon in Windows File Explorer, temporarily turn on 'File Name Extensions
<br />
<br />Change the file extension on that copy of the ThemePack file to zip
<br />
<br />Then you can right click that file, choose 'Extract All' to extract all the image files from that theme       
        </p>

<p>Thanks for solution, but do not have permission to change ext.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have downloaded Themes to Personalization file in Settings. But can not open them from there.</p>

<br />Did you make a copy of that Themepack file in a new folder on your Desktop, before trying to change the file extension ?

<br />Please provide a link to that theme and I will check that out for you . ..

            Does the theme show up in the Settings :: Personalization :: Themes page?&nbsp; If so it's already extracted and installed and you can skip doing anything with the themepack.&nbsp; Just go to the location I mentioned.

    <title>console lag and account inaccessibility &#43; reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> originalchaser  say:</h3>
<h2>            console lag and account inaccessibility &#43; reset</h2>
                    
<p>For the last two day my Xbox 360 console has been lagging heavily, the lag has lasted anywhere from 30 seconds to 15 minutes. The lag happens when I am playing alone and offline. After several dozen spikes of lag (approx 15) my Xbox suddenly stops reading
 any and all games. ("This game can not be played, please try later or download again") after two to three repeated attempts on about four of my digital download games my profile is booted offline and taken back to the email and password screen, after imputing
 the necessary data I get the error code 80151015. I repeat this has happened to me two days in a row and both times it is is immediately after I watch the movie I stream rented. Look in the accounts for the SD stream of Justice League: War. After this issue
 popped up my unit has become extremely slow at everything, gt sign in now takes 15- 20 minutes instead of the normal seconds.</p>


<p>I have cleared my system cache, and was in the process of deleting and redownloading my digital games when my profile was booted tonight.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>this could mean a few things.</p>
<p>1. Your profile does have some sort of corruption. Delete the profile (profile only) and restart the console and redownload your profile to try and fix it. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete</a></p>
<p>2. Your hard drive is having data issues. Please check if there are any corrupted/incomplete files in the storage. Go to settings - system - storage - select storage device - and check all folders. If there are any corrupt/incomplete files please delete them.</p>
<p>3. Hard drive is failing, backup all items you don't want to loose like save games etc and try to reformat the hard drive. This may work, but no guarantees. If that does not help then you might have to replace the hard drive. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Let us know the results</p>

            <p>You could try to use a usb memory stick.</p>
<p>Move your profile to the usb device and copy the save game you want to use as well.</p>
<p>Then remove the hard drive and try to see what happens when you use the data on the usb drive.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Be sure to use a usb device that meets requirements (Will be shown when configuring)</p>
<p>This way you can determine if it is the hard drive (or something on the hard drive) that is causing the lag.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>But basically most issues were solved, so that is good news</p>

<p><span>Hi singsonn,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This would happen if the G drive is marked as active on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you change the active partition to C drive then you will be able to make system image excluding the G drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now you will need to mark C drive as active partition using disk management.</span></span></p>

 the C drive, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Mark Partition as Active</strong>, and then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Restart the computer once you have mark C drive as active and check if you face any boot issues.</span></span></p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Do you remember the kb number of the update that you install?<br />
2. What type of updates are these? Are these Security or optional updates?</div>
<div><br />
Please check whether you face the same issue while logging in the safe mode. It is a possibility that one of the non-Microsoft application or a driver is causing this issue. Let us boot into the safe mode and check. If you are able to boot successfully in safe
 mode we can perform a clean boot to find the root cause.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step A.</strong><br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows&nbsp;Vista Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows&nbsp;Vista Safe Mode.<br />
e. When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Windows&nbsp;Vista will enter Safe mode.<br />
f. Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Step B.</strong><br />
If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause.<br />
Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

I am also having the exact same issue.&nbsp; No sound when using the HDMI output connected to my plasma panel.&nbsp; This&nbsp;was working prior to upgrading to Win8.&nbsp; Sound is working on the laptop, I'm not seeing any issue with the sound drivers and the audio output is
 working on the headphone jacks so just an issue with HDMI audio output?

            Let me see if I understand this. &nbsp;6 months ago Microsoft got a complaint that it's new operating system doesn't allow the sound to go through on HDMI and all they can think of to say is "turn up the volume on your TV and call me in the morning." &nbsp;They
 keep getting the same complaint and they still haven't answered the question. &nbsp;Listen up. &nbsp;I know you must be frustrated getting so many complaints on your new operating system. &nbsp;This is not our fault. &nbsp;It's your fault. &nbsp;Answer the man's question.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Please do so in plain English. &nbsp;Refer to settings that actually exist in menus that actually exist. Please do not refer people to pathways and buttons that should exist, or that you wish existed, or that might exist at some future date. &nbsp;If your fix suggests
 going to "control panel / sound / HDMI</div>
<div>then "control panel / sound / HDMI should actually show up when somebody goes down the path, without any useless searching or intermediate steps., and&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;without referring the asker to yet another thread. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are those instructions clear enough? &nbsp;Good. &nbsp;Please make your own instructions equally clear. &nbsp;You are months late in responding to this thread. &nbsp;</div>

<p>I am running into the same issue on win 10, it all started after an update I received last night. The TV in question says "not plugged in" under audio playback, even though I am clearly using it to view this message I am typing out. my computer was trying
 to play the audio threw a realtek digital output (I saw the green sound indicator bars)&nbsp;when it should be trying to play it threw HDMI. so I disabled all the devices other than the tv (which btw I made sure the drivers for everything were up-to-date) and I
 still have no audio. I ran a problem diagnostics and the problem it ran into was "the device is disabled" I enabled all devices and saw the green sound bars under realtek again. I then ran another diagnostics and it still says "device disabled" not "device
 unplugged". </p>
<p>
</p><p>yes ive tried other hdmi ports/cords</p>
<p>my tv is turned up, so is my computer</p>
<p>my drivers are all updated</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>

<h3> jam1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Show Desktop&#34; tab makes &#34;Windows Startup&#34; sound</h2>
                    Seemingly, randomly, when I click the "show desktop" tab at the right hand side of the notification area, I get the "windows startup" sound.&nbsp; I *think* I can get rid of this by disabling sounds and unchecking the "play windows startup sound" in the sound
 settings of the control panel.&nbsp; However, is there any way to keep the windows startup sound when windows is starting, but disabling that sound when clicking the show desktop tab?<br />
<br />
Also, and perhaps related to the above question, is there a box in the sound settings for show desktop?&nbsp; (I don't see one.)&nbsp; And, is there a way to change the windows startup sound?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            I tried to do what Savan suggested to resolve my issue, but the new accounts have the same issue.&nbsp; Given that it has happened on two different computers with two different manufacturers and two different flavors of Win 7, I have to believe it is an issue
 with part of the core of Win 7, probably the .dll file referenced in the blog mentioned in the post immediately above.<br />
<br />
My workaround is to disable all sounds, since I do not want a sound when I click the show desktop tab, I'm unwilling to do the extensive hacking that is apparently required to address the issue, and Microsoft does not provide users with the ability to independently
 or separately change the sound options for show desktop -- seems to be an all or nothing proposition; if you want sounds for other options, you have to put up with the show desktop sound; if you don't want the show desktop sound, you have to disable all sounds
 (at least in my experience on these two different mfrs' computers running two different versions of Win 7).

<h2>            How to have Windows 10 on a metered connection to automatically swtich to unlimited wireless connection when it is in range</h2>
                    <p>Here is my scenario. I use my phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot for Internet access for my laptop when I am outside. On my laptop that is running Windows 10, I set the connection to the hotspot as metered connection. When I get home, Windows 10 doesn't automatically
 switch to my home Wi-Fi.&nbsp;As a result, Internet access still sticks to&nbsp;the hotspot. Is there a way to have Windows 10 to automatically switch to any unmetered Wi-Fi when it is in range?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Chen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will&nbsp;provide the assistance required to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your query, I understand that want to automatically switch from your hotspot to your wireless connection when the connection is in range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the scenario, then I would like to inform that it is not possible, the only way is to disconnect the hotspot from the computer which will enable the wifi connection to connect automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps</p>

            <p>I am an Engineer in the Wifi team.&nbsp; Windows 10 does have the ability to do this.&nbsp; When you are connected to your metered hotspot Right click on your wifi icon in the system tray.&nbsp; Select Open Network and Sharing Center.&nbsp; On the right side of the dialog box
 is&nbsp;link&nbsp;named&nbsp;Connections: Wi-Fi(YourNetworkName).&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; It should bring up a dialog box called Wifi-Status.&nbsp; From there click&nbsp;the Wireless Properties button.&nbsp; In this there is a check-box named "Look for other wirelss networks while connect to
 this network.&nbsp; Select that check box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should allow windows to find a better connection if one is available and switch to it.&nbsp; I know its not the easiest checkbox to find.&nbsp; If this does not solve your problem then please reply on this thread.&nbsp; Hope it helps!</p>

<p><span><span>It's a driver error, and the one that is causing it needs to be either disabled or updated to a Vista-compatible one. When
 did the problem start for you? Likely this will be a clue as to which driver&nbsp;it is. If you<br />
recently updated a driver via&nbsp;Windows Update, then go to Safe mode and use the driver rollback feature.&nbsp; There is more on dealing with driver problems listed below including a possible way to identify the driver causing the problem - I've put that section in
 bold and you may want to start there and if that doesn't work, then go back to the beginning (but if you know when this started, do try the System Restore first)..&nbsp; We should check other options only&nbsp;if these don't resolve the problem.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bluescreen errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other options and explanations of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>Can
 you boot into Safe Mode with networking?<span>&nbsp; </span>Skip any steps here or above that require you to be able to boot normally if you can’t stay or get booted (and the same for safe mode if that’s the case there as well).<span>&nbsp;</span>Post
 back when you’ve done whatever you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section. This may identify the device or driver causing the problem.&nbsp;<span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to
 start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp;
 Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from
 Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</strong></span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</strong></span></span></a><span><span><strong>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </strong></span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</strong></span></span></a><span><span><strong>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</strong></span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</strong></span></span></a><span><span><strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible
 (assuming that is the cause): </strong></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</strong></span></span></a><span><span><strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Unfortunately this was not help. I still can't find a driver that works for Windows 10 for my HP Photo Smart 7350 printer. On the HP site, they state their is no driver or solution for Windows 10 for the Photo Smart 7350. Very frustrating. Hoping someone
 can provide help.</p>
<p>

            Hi Lord.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does it show up in Settings &gt; System &gt; Clipboard as shown in this tutorial on the new features?  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/whats-new-settings-app-windows-10-october-2018-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/whats-new-settin...</a>
<br />
<br />If not have you expedited Updates because there's a bunch of patches to fix all the problems.  
<br />
<br />I would file feedback in the Feedback Hub so they're aware.  They won't see it here.
<br />
<br />If it's not present by the time they release the new media to Media Creation Tool, install it and run it over the install as a Repair Install.    
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            XP recognizes but does not give access to USB flash drives. Says that they need formatting.</h2>
                    Recently, my Windows XP SP3 started to not open the usb flash drives I connect to my computer. Windows assigns a letter and describes the drive just as "Removable drive" although it has a particular name. Then, when I click on it to open, a pop-up message
 says that the disk is not formatted and asks me if I want ot format it. The problem is not of the USB flash drive, since I tried two different drives with the same result. Also,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when I connect the same flash drives to a different XP SP3 machines, they work fine</span>.<br />
<br />
What I've tried with <span style="font-weight: bold">no result:</span><br />
1. Connecting the USB drive to a different USB port.<br />
2. Connecting the drive. Then uninstalling the&nbsp; "USB storage device" from Device Manager, removing the drive, rebooting and then reconnecting the drive. The drive is then recognised as new and the drivers are installed again.<br />
<br />
History: <br />
1. I have used my flash drive with Windows 7 Home Premium and scanned it for problems, after windows 7 prompted me to do so, without any problems reported.<br />
2. I have run "chkdsk /F" on the flash drive at my XP computer. Chkdsk recognizes the drive with its name and reports problems with the file system.<br />
3. A while ago I installed a patch for the exFAT file system (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=19364), but had no problems with my FAT32 flash drive until revently.<br />
<br />
Notice: I'm using the greek version of Windows XP, so some terms may not be exactly tranlated in English<br />

            I followed the procedure suggested by Meghmala Support Engineer: I copied the contents of my flash drive to another XP computer and then tried to format it on mine.
 From the file system options I chose FAT32, but Windows could not complete the format. The same happened when I chose FAT. It only worked with exFAT (this option was there beacuse I installed the relevant patch). Then, of course, the drive was not readable
 by the other XP computer, which does not have the patch! So, I formatted the drive again with FAT32 on the other XP computer.<br />
<br />
It seems that, after installing the patch for exFAT, my computer is unable to read usb flash drives or format them in FAT32 or FAT, although this didn't happen immediately! How can I get rid of the patch? Hopefully, that way the problem will be restored.<br />

<div>I had the same problem and found your post. &nbsp;After more troubleshooting I found a I had a rootkit that had invaded my MBR.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I downloaded the rootkit remover, GMER, and it cleaned it up. &nbsp;Its worth a shot. &nbsp;I have seen quite a few new threads about this. &nbsp;It could just be a new malware running about.</div>

Dear Microsoft Software Engineer:&nbsp; <br />
<p><br />
1.0.1 -- Microsoft released versions, year 2008, of exFAT file system ( pending Microsoft patent 016,440 ) for software operator system 64-bit Windows 5-2002XP ( Microsoft /&nbsp; OEM ); and separate versions each for 32-bit Windows 5-2002XP SP2 /&nbsp; SP3 ( Microsoft
 /&nbsp; OEM ), 64-bit Windows 5-Server 2003 ( Microsoft ), 32-bit Windows 5-Server 2003 ( Microsoft ), and finally for IA-64 Itanium edition of Windows 5-Server 2003 SP1 /&nbsp; SP2 ( Microsoft ).&nbsp; Editions of exFAT file system for 64-bit and 32-bit Windows 5-2002XP/2003/Server
 2003 lack support for Transaction-safe exFAT ( Microsoft patent 7613738 ) which is a backup file allocation table
<br />
( FAT ), and of allocation bitmap included with Windows 6-Vista /&nbsp; Server 2008 ( Microsoft ).&nbsp; ExFAT
<br />
( Microsoft ) is also part of extended Secure Digital ( SDHX ) standard for Secure Digital storage hardware devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<br />
[ Technology ] Institute; December 1, 2009.</p>
<p><br />
1.1 -- Author and PROGRAMMER is running a copy of Windows XP Professional SP3+ <br />
( Microsoft not OEM ) on a Think Pad X40 2382-HCU ( IBM ) ultraportable computer system; with a 32 GB Secure Digital ( A-Data ) flash solid state memory card.&nbsp; PROGRMMER formatted this 32 GB Secure Digital ( A-Data ) flash solid state memory card exFAT
<br />
( Microsoft ) file system, during year 2009 or 2010, for backing data on ultraportable computer system up.&nbsp; PROGRAMMER did not assign "read only" attribute to 32 GBS Secure Digital
<br />
( A-Data ) volume.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.2 -- A few days ago in past, PROGRAMMER ran Windows XP Professional SP3+ <br />
( Microsoft ) &lt; My Computer &lt; 32 GB A-DATA &lt; Shortcut MENU &lt; Removable Disk DIALOGUE FRAME &lt; Tools PANE &lt; "Error Checking" program for exFAT file system on 32 GB Secure Digital ( A-Data ) flash memory card; but, after all five phases were run, Windows XP Professional
 SP3+ ( Microsoft ) reported volume to be "read only."&nbsp; More recently while running "Search" for files and FOLDERs Windows XP Professional SP3+ ( Microsoft ) began to report instead "The device is not formatted.&nbsp; Do you want to format it now ?"&nbsp; Logging out
 and powering off seemed to be restoring exFAT ( Microsoft ) file system with interruption, but seemingly without loss of data on drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.3 -- Finally PROGRAMMER began copying data on 32 GB Secure Digital ( A-Data ) flash solid state memory card to other disks and cards; pre-requisite to re-formatting instead with NTFS.&nbsp; Windows XP Professional SP3+ ( Microsoft ), and Path Too Long Utility
 ( ABTO ) each reported these copy backups to have been successful.&nbsp; True -- this was not a verified backup with a third-part backup software program.&nbsp; Regrettably, while digital files loose in directories ( not in FOLDERS ) are intact; digital files in named
 FOLDERS were not copied leaving only empty named FOLDERs -- which is a catastrophic or series loss of data of which any serious PROGRAMMER always makes every effort to avoid ( since PROGRAMMER was in a rush and re-formatted 32 GB Secure Digital flash memory
 card ( A-Data )).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.0.2 -- There is in long run no reason to eschew reliance on NTFS ( Microsoft ) file system instead for exFAT ( Microsoft ) file system; all or many even most releases of UNIX and LiNUX can both write and read NTFS file system, but not exFAT file system.
</p>
<p>2.1 -- PROGRAMMER in not denying that, with release date of exFAT for Windows 5-2002XP /&nbsp; Server 2003 ( Microsoft ), Microsoft did mention greater unreliablility of exFAT ( Microsoft ) for inter alia Windows 5-XP SP2 /&nbsp; SP3 ( Microsoft ) than NTFS, or forTransaction-safe
 exFAT <br />
( Microsoft ) which nonetheless only rarely results with failure of exFAT ( Microsoft ) file system.&nbsp; Impute that consequence of a known but undocumented defect and failure of exFAT
<br />
( Microsoft ) file system for inter alia Windows 5-XP Professional SP3+ ( Microsoft ) is that Microsoft decided to make exFAT ( Microsoft ) Transaction-safe for Windows 6-Vista /&nbsp; Server 2008 ( Microsoft ); but not to warn exisiting customers of earlier editions
 of Windows that exFAT ( Microsoft ) without transactional support in fact actually is unreliable; while circumstance is imputed by Shullich, published during month of December, 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.2 -- For those curious PROGRAMMER may also relate that many business organizations offering public access 32-bit Windows 5-2002XP/2003/Server 2003 ( Microsoft ), are refusing or failing to include exFAT file system for customers whom rent time on public
 access computer systems running referenced edition of software operator system Windows by Microsoft; no true explanation for omission unless those insider information technologists whom install and maintain software on those public access terminals know that
 exFAT is not reliable without transactive support.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.4 -- Individually this PROGRAMMER decided today -- never in future to install released version of exFAT file system for Windows XP SP3 ( Microsoft /&nbsp; OEM ) which is not Transaction-safe exFAT on any new install of Windows XP Professional SP3+ ( Microsoft
 /&nbsp; OEM ) -- no matter how many backups are available, that is not even on RAID-capable storge systems.&nbsp; One inexplicable failure of exFATfile system for Windows 5-XP Professional
<br />
( Microsoft not OEM ) did occur with loss of data in addition to experience related independently three months earlier by G.&nbsp; Katsillis with same version of exFAT file system for Windows XP
<br />
( Microsoft /&nbsp; OEM ).&nbsp; Another possibly relevant complaint could be:&nbsp; </p>

2.1 -- Regrettably this PROGRAMMER will not be, since April 13, 2009, paying Microsoft for Extended Hotfix Technical Support contract whereby a technical support case will immediately be opened to result with hotfix, and transactional exFAT for 64-bit and 32-bit
 Windows XP 5-2002XP /Server 2003 <br />

<h2>            amd display driver crash in Windows 10 version 1607</h2>
                    I am facing this problem from the first version of windows 10. Initially, the error was: "amd Display driver stopped responding and has recovered". I searched solutions at
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-error-display-driver-has-stopped/8f4302b9-4710-4fb3-aad3-6eb8edd2c479">
existing threads in Microsoft Community</a> about this issue. The solutions they provided didn't work for me. There are lots of threads about it at where different type of solutions have been suggested. I tried with many methods such as:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Update amd driver &amp; all other drivers<br />
&nbsp;- Used old amd drivers &nbsp;(some latest versioned amd drivers generate this issue continuously where some old version generate this less quickly than some latest versions).<br />
&nbsp;- Update Intel Drivers<br />
&nbsp;- Uninstall display drivers and let windows to choose automatically the stable drivers.<br />
&nbsp;- <a href="https://community.amd.com/thread/180166" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TDR fix</a><br />
<br />
Unfortunately, none of those worked for me. After updating to windows anniversary update, that error message (amd Display driver stopped...) never shows but the issue still exists! It fully freezes at the time of performing different tasks i.e. browsing, watching
 video, playing game etc. Sometimes, freezing has been solved automatically after 1-2 seconds. But, sometime it's not fixed automatically so that I have to force shut down by pressing the power button of the PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now, I have found some threads at where people tell that they are facing this freezing issue only after updating to Windows Anniversary Update.
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4vufpo/windows_10_fully_freezes_after_anniversary_update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
One of those threads can be found at here</a>.<br />
<br />
But, I have faced this since I used old version of Windows 10 at my brand new PC. My Configuration:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/282614d5-9637-4fd1-ac73-a6006f03312b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/282614d5-9637-4fd1-ac73-a6006f03312b" /></a><br />
<br />
<br />
I am very frustrated with this issue now. Is Microsoft concerned about this issue at all?&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One and Alienware X51 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One and Alienware X51</h2>
                    
<p>Was looking through a Gameinformer and noticed on the back page an advertisment&nbsp; for the Alienware X51. This thing looks similar to the Xbox One, and looks like it does just about the same that the Xbox One will do, but faster, and better maybe. Funny thing
 about it is, you can upgrade it I believe, unlike the Xbox One.&nbsp;So between the 2 why wouldn't people choose this over the Xbox One, which&nbsp;will probably have some hefty fees attached to it (Gold subscription price)?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new Geforce GTX 780 was just announced and it also fits in this form factor. Alot of effort is being put forward to make PC's in a console size format. X51 is not alone. There are a few other boxes simular and with modular design that can be upgraded.
 Wait until Valve releases the STEAMBOX in 2014. That should be smoking PC in a BOX. Also for people that don't game on PC you don't know what your missing with STEAM. You can now use STEAM wireslessly with a controller using a console style interface. They
 really have put alot of effort into maturing STEAM into a PC platform that allows console gamers to jump right in. More power, more features, and better prices. All with no monthly fees and a massive community of support WITH mods.</p>

 cases.[quote]Also for people that don't game on PC you don't know what your missing with STEAM.[/quote]I game on my PC via a TV using a controller. Here is what people are "missing"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows Update</p>
<p>- Driver updates for new game titles</p>
<p>- Steam contemplating its navel while doing updates and appearing to have "locked up"</p>
<p>- Origin, because not everything is available on Steam and EA's gonna keep it that way</p>
<p>- Requiring a keyboard/touchpad to adjust things</p>
<p>- Requiring a keyboard/touchpad to launch Ubisoft titles because Steam Big Picture mode cannot seamlessly launch Far Cry 3 and other Ubisoft titles, despite those titles having full controller support.</p>
<p>- Requiring logins for Steam, Origin, Ubisoft, and other game delivery platforms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gaming PCs hooked to TVs are still gaming PCs. Big Picture Mode is not an end-all, be-all solution.[quote]More power, more features,[/quote]And quite a bit more complexity with an underlying UI that requires a keyboard and mouse.[quote]and better prices[/quote]Launch
 titles I can usually get for $5 to $15 off if I shop around for pre-orders from Green Man Gaming and other sources, but not always, so the price argument for launch titles goes right out the window there. As there are no "used" licenses on Steam and no way
 to "return" a dud like Aliens: Colonial Marines, it means you're taking a bigger risk by buying on Steam. If you want to be patient and wait for sales, well, console games go on sale, too..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, if you all want to join the gaming master race and switch to Steam, I'm sure publishers and MS won't have a problem with it (MS makes Windows, remember?). To date, it hasn't happened.</p>

<p>I also noticed, and forgot to add, that the controller pictured with it looks just like a 360 controller. Yes all the benifits of console gamming and PC gamming in one. There is not really a loose situation with these, or anything that is upgradable. And
 I know a lot of peolple miss out on great user generated mods for good games because mods are not allowed here. &nbsp;These will sell better than Xbox One I bet.

<p>No I didn't suggest people buy a 650 US dollar video card ( Why not go for the TITAN :) I just mentioned they are being built to fit the small form factors for the smaller chasis like the X51 and other console inspired PC boxes like STEAMBOX. Nvidia also
 has their kepler chips in value form now for 99US and 150US which will basically run any PC game on high settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah consoles are still easier to use thats what makes them great but STEAM has helped the PC alot by making game updates etc very easy. Now if only STEAM would allow me to selectively install DLC I would be very happy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets not forget STEAM is also multiplatform. It cators to Linux, MAC, and Windows so pick your poison and enjoy it. For me being able to buy a game on STEAM and have multiple licenses for Linux and Windows is just gravy. Please lets not talk about EA. I
 just went through the entire SimCity debacle complete with chargebacks and the whole nine yards. :)</p>

<p>GTX Titan's lowest price on ebay (buy it now) is $950</p>
<p>GTX 690's lowest price on ebay (buy it now) is $800</p>
<p>I guess if you care about quieter... but if you care about money and/or performance it is no contest.</p>

<p>[quote user="Griffey"]Waste of money. Titan is ridiculously overpriced when the GTX 690 murders it in all new games for $100 less.[/quote]I already had GTX 680 SLI. GTX 690 is a dual GPU solution with only 2GB of VRAM per GPU. At 2560x1600, it's not an ideal
 card. Maxed out, Crysis 3 consumes 3.4GB of VRAM per GPU. Unfortunately, maxed out Crysis 3 drags a bit with just two Titans, as does Metro 2033, hence the third card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know where you buy your video cards, but in the USA the GTX 690 is $999. The Titan's base price is the same (assuming you can find one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I'm not buying something off eBay from a fly-by-night seller, thank you very much.</p>

    <title>How do I fix the &#34;Audio Service is not running&#34; error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I fix the &#34;Audio Service is not running&#34; error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got a somewhat older HP Pavilion Elite desktop computer, which I have Windows 8.1 Pro installed on. This morning when I tried to log into it, it refused to respond to anything at all. The mouse did nothing; pressing any key on the keyboard resulted
 in nothing. Finally I decided the only thing left to me was to do a hard shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it came back up I was able to log in, but all is not right with this machine. The speaker icon in the system tray in desktop mode has a red "X" on it. Passing my mouse over it I get the error message, "The Audio Service is not running". I searched online
 for how to resolve this problem (apparently it happens quite frequently) and the first few responses was to either reinstall the audio drivers or go to the manufacturer's website download them and install them. Not knowing what the manufacturer is I got into
 Device Manager to see what it says. Device Manager is convinced that everything is fine; the drivers are working perfectly. But I'm seeing the error in the system tray. But Device Manager is convinced that everything is fine; the drivers are working perfectly.

<p>
</p><p>And on and on and on and on it goes. I cannot deal with this schizophrenic behavior that Windows is giving me. What makes it a lot worse is I cannot afford to replace anything at this time. So how do I fix this problem? BTW, the manufacturer is Realtech.</p>

<h2>            Keeps shutting down during sleep mode</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've been having this problem with my Lenovo Ideapad Z580 for quite awhile now. Many times when my laptop goes into sleep mode (both when I walk away with the lid open and when I shut the lid) it will either shut down
<i>or</i> it won't respond to pressing the power button and I have to force a shutdown.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Patrick

            <p>Thanks for getting back to me. I’ve located the minidump files and put them in a folder on my desktop. However, I’m unable to zip them. Every time I try to compress them, I get the following error message: “file not found or no read permission.”
