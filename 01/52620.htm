<h2>            Pro 4 not working with Microsoft Surface Dock</h2>
                    <p>I Observed that since the April update my Pro 4 stopped working with the Microsoft Dock. the power just keeps going off. I would have to revert to using the surface power cable. i have tried all the troubleshooting information i can find online but to no
 avail. i was hoping that the anniversary update would take care of it but it is still the same thing. has anyone experienced same and how did you solve it.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

    <title>Groove Music Player Error&#58; 0xc00d36b4 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Groove Music Player Error&#58; 0xc00d36b4</h2>
                    <p>Evening everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and I've run into a problem with both Windows Media Player (WMP). and the Groove Music App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I can open the Groove Music app, and Windows Media Player. Both Groove and WMP detect the music files stored on my PC, they even display the album art, but cannot play the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WMP displays a small red 'x' next to the track and immediately skips to the next, which again, it cannot play and so it repeats itself to the end of all tracks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Groove does a similar thing, but instead of a 'x', there is an '!' in a circle next to the track. When I click this, Groove displays an error message, and I quote: "Can't play. Choose something else to play. This item is in a format we don't support." It
 also displays the error number 00xc00d36b4 (00xc00d36b4). I have no idea why the code is displayed twice in the message, outside and within a set of brackets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The music files mostly use the extension&nbsp;.mp3 with some exceptions, but upon checking the list of supported file types of the Groove Music app, all of my music files, I know for a fact are of the supported types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the files to an external HDD prior to the upgrade and tried playing the files from there with the same result. Oddly enough, I inserted an audio CD and that played through WMP without any problems, but when I tried to rip the files from CD to PC,
 they wouldn't play, again I saw the same result with the files as I described above. Would not play in WMP or Groove, but would play in Amazon and VLC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, and this is quite puzzling, all music files play in VLC media player and the Amazon Music Player. These files are not corrupt as I have played them on my laptop (which has not yet been upgraded to Windows 10) as well as my phone (Samsung Galaxy
 S4 running Android Jellybean).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the sfc.exe but nothing happens when I run it. There isn't even a process for it appearing in the Task Manager. I have tried removing and reading the folders for Groove to play music from without any luck and I have tried a reboot several
 times today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had primarily used WMP because it had an equalizer built in with some presets I thoroughly enjoyed using when listening to my music, and I also found the native support for FLAC in Windows 10&nbsp;attractive (I do have some FLAC files, but again same problem
 as the others).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it will help but my system specs are as follows:</p>
<p>- AMD Phenom II x6 1075T Processor 3GHz</p>
<p>- 16 GB Corsair Vengeance Ram Modules (x4 4GB)</p>
<p>- Asus RoG Crosshair IV Formula Motherboard</p>
<p>- Sapphire AMD Radeon R9 390x Tri-X 4GB GPU (currently running latest Direct X and latest stable GPU drivers from AMD).</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Professional, x64bit OS</p>
<p>- Avast Internet Security 2015 with Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searia</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply, but unfortunately none of the steps have been successful. Windows Media Player and Groove still remain unable to play anything, but Amazon Music Player and VLC can. I have tried disabling the firewall temporarily whilst I ran the
 programs just in case there was a conflict there, but again, the result is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also appears to be no way to uninstall and then reinstall the Groove Music app. Are there any settings within Windows 10&nbsp;that are required to be enabled for these programs to function properly and fully?</p>
<p>

            Having just upgraded, I've had the same problem. I resolved it by reinstalling Nero 8, which was already installed in the old Windows 7, but wouldn't work under Windows 10 until I reinstalled. Nero includes mp3 software, and I can only conclude that the
 Media Player and Groove codecs were confused by this until I reinstalled the Nero codecs. Whether this applies to all CD/DVD writing software or not I don't know, but it's worth a shot. Both Media Player and Groove now work properly, and the codecs show up
 in the menu 'Help - About Windows Media Player - Technical Support Information'. Hope this helps.

            <p>Hi Peterjrob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Nero codec pack you mentioned, is that the one available from:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>http://www.nero.com/enu/company/about-nero/nero-aac-codec.php</p>
<p>
</p><p>and also, was that after a reinstallation of Win10, or just a reinstallation of the codec pack?</p>

            <p>Hi Searia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I reinstalled the complete Nero 8 suite, which includes mp3 codecs. The suite is available at</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/downloads/previous-versions/download-nero8-free-update.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.nero.com/enu/downloads/previous-versions/download-nero8-free-update.php</span></a></span></p>
<p>You would need a key to install this, but I think the software that installs the codecs &nbsp;is Nero WaveEditor, available at
</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.nero.com/redir.php?id=10768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.nero.com/redir.php?id=10768</span></a></span></p>
<p>I had not reinstalled Windows 10, but had run sfc /scannow from an elevated command prompt, in order to check for errors in the Windows 10 files. I had to run that twice. However, the error was only corrected after reinstalling Nero 8.</p>
<p>I think the codec is</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ACM</td>
<td>Fraunhofer IIS MPEG Layer-3 Codec (decode only)</td>
<td>0055</td>
<td>l3codeca.acm</td>
<td>1.9.0.401</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>but I'm no expert on mp3.</p>
<p>Did you upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 or was it a new install. I believe that if you had mp3 codecs installed in Win 7, and upgraded, Windows 10 gets a bit confused about the codecs.</p>

 the problem is associate with speaker configuration not the file itself.</p>

            <p>Has this issue been solved? &nbsp;I have the same issues. &nbsp;When I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10, all of the sudden, Windows Media Player would not play any of my music, just the same red X problem mentioned above. &nbsp;I have been reluctantly using Groove, which
 is not nearly as functional as Windows Media Player. &nbsp;Groove was working for me until today. &nbsp;I used Windows Media Player to rip a CD. &nbsp;I was able to play the CD audio while it was ripping. As soon as it was done, i went to Groove to make sure it showed up
 in my library there, and it does, but I cannot play it from file in Groove, I am getting the error code&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">00xc00d36b4 (00xc00d36b4) on all my music. &nbsp; Not only can I not play these new files
 (have tried both WMA and FLAC) in Groove, but now Groove will not play ANY of my music, with the same error code! &nbsp;And Windows Media Player will not play the newly ripped music from file either. &nbsp;Red X.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is not a good situation. &nbsp;I have no way to play music. &nbsp;Tomorrow is New Years Eve.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            This version microsoft genuine advantage no longer supported&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On trying to download a package from microsoft.com there is a validation challenge, no problem, seen these before, download, run, copy the code.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A couple of days ago this stopped working. On executing genuinecheck.exe I get an immediate message box stating</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"This version of the Windows Genuine Advantage validation tool is no longer supported. Please download the newest version and ensure your system clock is accurate"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been through everything several times, tried everything, no change, so now I wonder whether the tool is expired and MS need to update it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>XP Pro fully patched.</p>
<p>Date and time, definitely very close. Checked several times and agrees with radioclock here. Timezone and region normal.</p>
<p>Windows update is working, sends messages and can download and apply.</p>
<p>Two different ways MS tools say this is a genuine install. (which it is)</p>
<p>Infections? Very unlikely.</p>
<p>Recent system change? Nope, did a restore from backup.</p>
<p>Disk check, sfc, etc. nothing.</p>
<p>Computer is operating entirely normally.</p>
<p>genuinecheck version 1.9.0042.0 &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Challenge occurs several places, same result.</p>
<p>Example is here http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=7217</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>An observation: from not working to working might have been June 2012 to July 2012, can't remember clearly enough.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Beneath all this I am trying to get IMAPI2 actually working. One of the cases where it doesn't install properly. Related? &nbsp;No idea.</p>

 is an implication. Could even be a region problem, I'm not in the US. Update is date sensitive but that has no problem right now, proving nothing significant wrong with the date. A few minutes is good enough so it won't be the leap second which was added on
 the 1st.<br />

            Did you ever get a sensible and intelligent answer for this? I am trying to download Windows Mobile Device Center, which requires validation, the tool downloads and gives the same error you have. I am using Windows 7 64 bit, clearly Microsoft has stuffed
 the tool with some update, my system is also fully patched. It appears Microsoft can no longer manage their own resources. Technical support seems to be "read the standard response" without even reading ththe reported fault.

            Using IE9, this validation downloads "GenuineCheck.exe" and runs this, nothing to do with browser. File is dated 2008. Manually downloading and running file gives same error. So outdated file from Microsoft server

<h2>            Can not update Windows 10 due to the disk space</h2>
                    My PC has a 60GB C drive. After upgraded from window 7 to window 10 couple&nbsp;years ago, the disk space is close to full.&nbsp;Now it only have 5 GB free space after&nbsp;removing the pagefile to different drive.&nbsp;I cannot run the&nbsp;most recent windows 10 update since
 it needs 8 GB free space. I only have the Windows 10 and MS Office installed on C drive. I checked the C drive, the Windows folder itself takes about 40 GB. What can I do on this? Besides, My other disk is 500 GB. Is there a way to transfer the OS from C to
 this large disk?

            Hi HuaWang_902, to make your system more efficient and give it enough space to last years, a clean install of Windows 10 would be your best option . . .
<br />
<br />You can backup your files onto your 500GB hard drive . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<p>but the username folder is empty, and there is a lock icon on the username folder.&nbsp; If I unlock the folder and do the restore again&nbsp; I get the "file already exists" dialog for all the files that I'm trying to restore so I just say to overwrite them but at

            Since you get the message that the file already exists the folder cannot be empty. It's just that you cannot see its contents. You may need to seize ownership of it - see here:<br />

<p>I tried what you suggested but got the same result.&nbsp; However I've found that the problem folder is AppData.&nbsp; I can navigate to the username folder, but it looks empty.&nbsp; If I add "\AppData\" to the path I can get to the AppData folder and see everything underneath
 it.&nbsp; Very strange.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of black bars on old PC games when trying to play at game at a low resolution&#63;</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: justify">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; When I try to play a game like "<em>Red Faction</em>" or like "<em>Project Snowblind</em>" at "<em>800-600</em>" resolution I get black bars on both sides of my screen and the game is centered. It's playable YES, but it's annoying to have such distracting
 bars on each side of your game. I followed the guides and videos. They were no help at all. I saw that there is a screen scaler or something along the lines of that says "<em>Scale Full Screen</em>", and I don't seem to have that option at all in my display
 settings at all. If anyone can tell me how or what to do to fix this it would be greatly appreciated. I have a 2013 HP laptop with AMD A4-5000, 4GB Ram, 2.5 GHZ, with about 480GB of storage (5000 GB.) Even the slightest clue on what to do would help.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Yes I have gone there many times, but I can't make it&nbsp; scale to "Scale Full Screen" for games, also these games are old so they run in 32bit not 64bit and when playing they don't stretch like they should.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Thanks for some options, the games I'm trying to run are like from 2005 and back so the highest resolution they go is about 1080 and they still have black bars on the side, also I thought most games from 2008 to now where 64 bit. If it is possible you could
 leave a link to an AMD driver fix or something if possible it would be a big hep. I have tried to AMD radeon driver before and it had fixed my problem, but with that problem solved a new one arose my laptop started lagging like hard. You could move the mouse
 and itnot move for like about 5 seconds then it would jump to the other side of the screen. I have reset my laptop to factory settings to see if that helped , but it hadn't.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Create bootable USB for Win 10 install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Create bootable USB for Win 10 install</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I downloaded the Win10 ISO and used the "Win 7 create DVD" program to create a bootable USB. I put the USB stick in my Win 8.0, UEFI laptop and it doesn't recognise the USB stick as being bootable. I have disabled secure boot in the BIOS (OK, UEFI). That
 makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some research and it seems that the USB must be in FAT32 format but the create DVD program formats the stick as NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I create a bootable&nbsp;Win10 USB stick in FAT32 format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best program in my opinion for creating bootable USB sticks is a program called Rufus and it can be found via the following link
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a> it will do exactly what you are after because it will allow the creation of a bootable drive in the most common formats.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>James</p>

            I would just format the stick in FAT32 then use diskpart to mark it as active, then extract the contents of the iso to the stick.

<p>I also had trouble making a bootable usb, however, this weird method works. If you're running windows 8/8.1 (or any other operating system that can create recovery media) follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start -----&gt; Search for "Create a recovery drive" --------&gt; Create the recovery drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now comes the weird part:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete all the contents of the usb you created, but don't format it. Now, paste all the contents of the iso into the usb. No third-party software needed (unless your version of windows doesn't support native iso file viewing, in which case, download 7-zip).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know how this works (it worked for me). Maybe by creating recovery media, windows properly makes the disk bootable, then you can paste the files you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, don't copy your pc's entire recovery partition to your usb, that will take way too long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Thanks all. I did this on my W7 desktop but further reading taught me that W8 can open an ISO. Right click and it's "mount" iirc. So I copied the ISO to my W8.0 laptop and that part works at least. So I'll give Rufus a go as it gets so many thumbs up.&nbsp;Failing
 that, I'll try Ruler's black magic method (thanks R!).&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>All I did to use a usb stick</p>
<p>1) downloaded the iso </p>
<p>2)extracted the contents of the iso to the usb stick</p>
<p>3) rebooted my machine then pressed F12 to get boot menu then selected usb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not need any programs other than WinRAR to extract the iso</p>

            <p>Virtual beer tokens all round! Thanks all. Rufus did the trick but only after it (he?)&nbsp;had engaged me in an arm wrestling competition. It kept unchanging settings as I moved on to another, no doubt to maintain consistency with what I was selecting elsewhere
 but it took me a while to realise. Even then it took me a while, trying different options to get the result I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is having the same problem, you have to set the partition scheme box to MBR for UEFI, the second option. Otherwise the format keeps going back to NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even now the label is something that Rufus chose, not something I selected, but I can live with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all and good luck with Win10.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Device Manager shows non-functioning drivers</h2>
                    <p>I asked my local Microsoft Store to exchange my Surface Pro 4 with i7 because even after the recent firmware update my device was still having issues in which the fans would run full speed even when the device was sleeping. The store was very helpful and
 exchanged my unit. They asked if I would let them install some updates for the device before I left the store and to encourage me to let them do so, they offered a gift card. After the Surface Pro 4 went through the initial set-up stages, they installed some
 files from a thumb drive. The associate said these were important firmware files and drivers. They also said I would need to let Windows Update install other files when I got the device home. Their installation was very short and I was happy to let them install
 this firmware in exchange for a generous gift card. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The new Surface Pro 4 has worked well for me so far. I haven't seen a recurrence of the fan running as it did on my first device. Today, I curiously checked the Device Manager for no particular reason and was surprised to see, under Firmware, that several
 Surface categories are shown and that two: Embedded Controller Firmware and Management Engine are listed as disabled. On the screenshot you can see what I'm talking about and I opened one of the two items so you can see that it reports the device did not start.
 These items both report that the best driver is already installed, yet they are not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be no functional problems caused by this, I am just curious about it and wonder if this is the result of the software that was installed at the store. Anyone got any ideas?</p>

    <title>ELAN touchpad not working correctly after Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ELAN touchpad not working correctly after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I have a brand new Asus X550ZA notebook. Windows 8 was pre-installed and I upgraded to Windows 10 shortly after I got this computer. Since the upgrade my ELAN touchpad has been acting up. At first I saw others with a similar problem that fn+f9
 fixed but this was not my case. My touchpad is commonly disabled in the ELAN interface and while enabling lets me move the mouse, I'm not able to tap or click or scroll pages. Any help is much appreciated as I cannot always bring a usb mouse with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

<h2>            Bllue creen error&#58; SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</h2>
                    <p>Long story short, this has happened before. Stuck in a loop of getting this error, then saying "Diagnosing your PC", leading me to "Automatic Repair - Your PC did not start correctly". Asked to restart or go to advanced options. Restart gets me right back
 to this screen after a bit, so I go to advanced options. I tried a System Restore Point from yesterday, but get error 0x800700b7. I have no other system restore points for some reason. Yesterday, I got this blue screen again, and I fixed it by doing a System
 Restore Point. I did end up getting an error, but I somehow got to the desktop. I've even got this issue a month ago, and I had a friend fix it. He thinks there's a problem with the graphics card drivers or something. At this point, I'm lost and out of options.
 I have a decent knowledge of computers, but I don't know what's wrong. Just tried low-resolution and safety mode with networking, and no luck. Ideas welcome, I'd try anything before I have to reset my computer. By the way, I have an ASUS G46VW laptop, with
 an Intel Core i5 and a Nvidia GeForce GTX 660M - 2 GB.</p>

            <p>Hello, and thank you for your reply. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. I cannot access the desktop.</p>
<p>2. I did install an antivirus program called Kaspersky.</p>
<p>3. Besides installing Kaspersky after fixing my blue screen previously, the only other thing that changed was that when I restarted my computer, it said "Update and Restart" instead of just "Restart".</p>

            <p>Thank you for your efforts to fix my computer. Unfortunately, after trying the steps you instructed, we were led to another error screen. In the end, we just ended up resetting my computer to factory new, which solved the problem. There were not any files
 that were worth going through the effort to recover. Once again, thanks for your efforts, I appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>To "clone" xp is fairly simple,xp has the software installed by default.Simply</p>
<p>install a slave hd,place it before current to the MB,set plastic jumper pins as</p>
<p>needed on same IDE cable.Once in xp,format the new HD,use default settings,</p>
<p>once thru,go to run,type:&nbsp;&nbsp; XCOPY C:\*.* D:\ /c/h/e/k/r</p>
<p>Agree to all in the DOS window.Once thru,youre finished,the new HD is ready</p>
<p>for service.Also, D: being the letter for new HD,if asigned diffrent,then use it instead.</p>
<p>You can read more of XCOPY at:</p>

            <p>Has Marcium Reflect ever worked before or is this a new installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you using any other third party backup program before installing Marcium Reflect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you should be asking your question in the Marcium Reflect forums since that is where their experts hang out, and there are lots of knowledge base (KB) articles on their site about VSS error and what to do about them although I did not find one about
 yours, but a Google search returns many possibilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maricum Reflect has a tool (program) you can download called <strong>VSSfix </strong>
that will reset all your VSS parameters, reregister necessary DLLs, etc. and that is useful if there is a failure after uninstalling or installing over the top of another third party program (like Acronis) or if your VSS was already afflicted in the first place.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>VSS has "providers" and "writers" and If your VSS settings are somehow afflicted (missing one, one too many, etc.), the VSSfix program will&nbsp; "reset" all your VSS stuff to values that make sense.&nbsp; If your VSS is already broken then running VSSfix won't hurt
 anything, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start here and you can find VSS fix to download in the first KB article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://kb.macrium.com/KnowledgebaseCategory50.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.macrium.com/KnowledgebaseCategory50.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Their support forums are here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.macrium.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If/when you find the solution be a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>mensch</em></a> and come back and tell us what the solution is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that somehow putting another HDD in your system and all that stuff might let you clone your drive but that idea does nothing to fix the problem or relieve your system of VSS errors that you should not be getting.&nbsp; That idea (sort of ) fixes the symptom
 of the problem which is you can't clone your HDD and should not count as a "solution".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a difference between fixing the problem and fixing the symptom of a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is your Marium Reflect and/or VSS is broken.&nbsp; If you were to somehow clone your drive with xcopy your Marcium Reflect and/or VSS will
<em>still </em>be broken.</p>

            <p>XCOPY is no good for cloning XP. My advice is don't even consider it as an alternative to decent cloning software - XCOPY just doesn't work as a means of cloning. Google it or search this forum and I am sure that you will find many people telling you the

<p>
</p><p>If you really want to, by all means use XCOPY to do a backup, in which case you don't need to copy anything other than data but even then, IMO&nbsp;there are better backup solutions than XCOPY.</p>

</p><p>Hi, in the sticks.. Thanks for replying. &nbsp;I used a program called XXCLone which does an incredible job. But I noticed 2 minor issues with it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I bootup the cloned hard drive, instead of going straight to the desktop, I get an 'O/S Option Menu' giving an option as to which O/S to bootup to. This list shows a list of lines showing XP and its variants, which are just lines, not actual O/S's.&nbsp;I
 don't know the purpose behind this list 'O/S Options Menu' since I only cloned one O/S, which is XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When I tried to uninstall a program, it couldn't find the uninstall file for it. This was weird. But I was able to uninstall other programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let mw know what you think.. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Did you just abandon the Marcium Reflect option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is an "O/S Option Menu"?</p>
<p>What is&nbsp; "a list of lines showing XP and its variants"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we can't see what you are seeing you might see if you can better describe what you are seeing (like some actual words on the screen) so we don't have to imagine what you are seeing - for example perhaps something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b87d16ee-1780-47a4-8a6d-c8fccd8e1258" height="403" width="536" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not what you see, what do you see and since it sounds like you choose one of the "variants" your system works (since you can get to uninstall something) which variant is it that you choose?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to uninstall a program, do you see a message that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Couldn't find the uninstall file for it"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you see some other message, exactly what does it say?</p>
<p><br />
When most programs install, they create a section in the registry about that program that tells XP what to do (execute some uninstallation routine/program) if you choose to uninstall the program from Add/Remove programs.&nbsp; If that section of the registry is
 missing/afflicted, depending on the error message you can usually figure out what the problem is and fix it or install the program some other way.</p>

            <p>Hi, I fixed the issue. Is deleted the extra "O/S Variants" in the boot file. I left the primary O/S as the only O/S to boot to. It's very strange that this program (XXClone) created this Options Menu at boot showing a list of O/S's, which aren't O/S's at
 all. They're just a list of useless lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, maybe you can still help. I'd like to fix error event ID: 8193 (VSS) and error event ID: 4609 (EventSystem). Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

            <p>Since you still have not described what "O/S Variants" means and if are still using XXClone, you may want read their documentation or perform a Google search on something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>xxclone &nbsp; boot.ini</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>And you will find many articles about the way XXClone creates/modifies the boot.ini file such as this one from their own documentation and WWW site that demonstrates some "afflicted" boot.ini files and how to fix them:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.xxclone.com/ixcman54.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xxclone.com/ixcman54.htm</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need help straightening out your boot.ini file, you need to copy and paste the contents of it here so somebody can see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then (if you need help with Events Viewer messages) and don't feel like doing your own research about them and want us to do the legwork for you, you should learn how to post events from the Event View log so we don't have to imagine what they say or you
 can just see if you can figure them out yourself by using popular search engines - like Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps your VSS is still complaining because your VSS providers and writers are still afflicted and you did not say if you ran the VSSfix from Marcium Reflect or if you have used VSSadmin to view and reset your VSS settings but here is a MS article that
 might get you pointed in the right direction:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Regarding your Event Viewer messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a method to post the specific information about individual events.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc </strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System logs.<br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If you enable the logging for them the
 logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.
<br />
Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.
<br />
<br />
Some 'errors' with red Xs are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting as some Services may not start the first time until other things are running.&nbsp; Try to find just the events at the date and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details to the Windows clipboard and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text
 back here for analysis.&nbsp; Remove any personal information from your information after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:<br />

To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered), then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the events that are happening when you have
 your issue.<br />
<br />
You can look up events using Google or on the following World Wide Web site and get some ideas.&nbsp; This is where folks have events they see and then post up their questions, ideas and solutions:<br />

            <p>HI, ElderK. It's good to hear from you. The following are 2 system errors and 2 application errors. Just to let you know, the event viewer says that DCOM and DHCP services are not started. But they are started and are on automatic. I don't understand why
 it says they're not started when they actually are. Anyway, here are my errors:</p>

            <p>I made some efforts to break my VSS Service on purpose with Registry edits, changing, deleteing and other things but could not recreate those messages.&nbsp; My VSS would start just fine (for some reason).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I download the 32-bit VSSfix from Marcium and ran it and it put the VSS Service Registry back to the defaults but it also reregisters a bunch of DLLs too and my VSS seemed fine and at least ntbackup still works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When do you see these VSS errors - when you stop/star the VSS Service manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go through all the DLLs and unregister them one by one to see if it might be one of them that is the problem but I don't get feel like doing all that and that might not be the problem anyway.&nbsp; I have some other things to do this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why don't you get into regedit, export out your current VSS settings to a safe place, then download and run the 32-bit VSSfix from Marcium, reboot and see what that does for you.&nbsp; That will set things back to the XP defaults.&nbsp; I don't know how that will
 effect your Marcium or if you are still using that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If things get worse, you can import your original settings and work on it some more.</p>

<h2>            Quicken 2005 in Windows 8</h2>
                    Is there any way to install and run my Quicken 2005 in my new Windows 8 machine.&nbsp; I have software from 2000 that is happy on the new machine, but the Quicken 2005 doesn't seem to install/load/run.&nbsp; I realize how old it is and I may upgrade or go to GNUCASH,
 but life would be better in the short run if I could use my old Quicken on the new machine for a while.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately Quicken 2005 was not designed to work with Windows 8. Intuit, Inc stopped<br />
all support in April 2008 for the 2005 version of Quicken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the original installation media, you can installing the program in compatibility<br />
mode. If this does not work, you would have to get a newer version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow these steps to install the software in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>a)Right click the driver and click "Properties" and then click the "Compatibility" tab.<br />
b)Check the box "Run this program in compatibility mode for” and select the operating system<br />
the software was originally designed for.<br />
c) Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use this for reference</p>

            Yes there is. Just navigate to the setup.exe file on your disk and double click on it. It installed just like you would expect. Apparently the autorun feature does not work with Win8. This also worked with an old calendar program. I have a new Dell Inspiron
 15R laptop.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Be sure you DO NOT have Airplane Mode ON.<br />
<br />
Make&nbsp;sure your WiFi is not off - many systems have physical switches&nbsp;or hotkeys&nbsp;that will turn WiFi off. Though you may have a hardware&nbsp;problem with&nbsp;the WiFi device. If you can't&nbsp;get the WiFi device to work you can use an external USB device which is not expensive.

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version -
<strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong> <strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong>
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Then you need to work with the system/motherboard maker's support, RealTek support, or a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service).
<br />
<br />
As I said you can disable the on-board WiFi in the BIOS or Device Manager (if needed) and use a add-on USB WiFi device.<br />
<br />
You can't fix hardware with software.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>it is important to know if tw Wi-Fi adapter is showing and if it has a yellow triangle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not showing, you might check the view for showing hidden devices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not there at all, then the system is not recognizing it during boot.&nbsp; As was mentioned, make sure no mechanical or keyboard switches have it turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the bios to make sure it is enabled.&nbsp; Something you might try while in the bios is to disable the Wi-Fi and then reboot a couple of times, then reset it to enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't know about the device manager, right click the start button and go up the menu and select it there.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like it might be a hardware issue. If so and if needed you can disable the WiFi in the BIOS and/or Device Manager then use a USB add-on WiFi device which&nbsp;is not expensive.<br />
<br />
Try doing a Repair Installation which allows you to keep the programs and data though redundant backups are always a good idea. (Be prepared to install the latest driver again just in case).<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker &#40;Available Audio Devices not showing&#41;</h2>
                    So I've been having troubles with windows movie maker. I use it to record bass covers with my Tascam US-322 Audio Interface, and the built in HD Webcam in my laptop. It had been working fine for a while and then suddenly stopped working, I tried repairing
 movie maker, didn't work, I tried switching movie maker to run in compatibility mode for windows 8, it didn't work. I even went and wiped my whole hard drive and re-installed windows, and that worked for a short while, and then it stopped working. My audio
 interface has the correct drivers, and I've been able to select it as an available audio device, but now that movie maker is not working right again, I've discovered that I can no longer select my audio interface anymore, but it will let my webcam be selected.
 I've also got my audio interface set as the default audio device for playback and recording, since I use it for my headphones, and I've tried enabling the other playback devices, and the stereo mix etc, but it doesn't do anythi

<h2>            Hp Pavilion 10 TS Notebook Pc &#61; Touch screen not responding&#47;not hidden on DEVMNGR&#47;Not installed After upgraded to W10</h2>
                    <p>Hi to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually my first time asking help from MS site and community. Before I proceed asking, I would like to say that all TS I have seen on this website new or old, I already tried them all but non helped me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to ask if anyone here can help me install the HID Compliant Touch screen driver for Hp Pavilion 10 Ts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a chat with Hp Tech Support and spent an hour just to be said to go to center. I even asked if he can send me the direct link for TS driver but he did not give me anything,.. I feel like I shouldnt have bought this HP notebook..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone here can help me out, Pls I really need help on fixing this touchscreen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>TS I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Devmngr, checked hidden option to show all, no HID compliant TS on HID drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checked BUS driver and found nothing also. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the solution 4, 5 6, and nothing worked. &nbsp;(https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/hardware-and-drivers/troubleshoot-the-surface-touchscreen?os=windows-10#Solution5W10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other device not showing any Touchscreen driver too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried the Hardware tool, Tried checking updates on windows but no more updates showing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All drivers are installed EXCEPT the TS or HID Compliant Touch Screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its been 3 days now and I am still fixing the same issue. &nbsp;I can no longer go back to W8.1 since I did a clean install after upgrade.. &nbsp;I even forgot to backup my W8.1 Product key.. I bought the unit HP with preinstalled OS which is W8.1 and the salesman
 did not give me the box or OS used for my PC. So i was wondering if maybe he just gave me a generic or non authentic PK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is working fine except the TS that I am complaining about.. Please HELP!...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attached File for proof.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hi Krishnan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the link you posted,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1 = Done</p>
<p>Step 2 = Windows says no more update for now</p>
<p>Step 3 = Not applicable to me since I am on W10. The Tablet settings is not present. I tried to pull it out but I end up on the tablet mode on settings but on that settings there is now way to calibrate or configure the TS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 4 = &nbsp;only shows (HDD, Memory and exit)</p>
<p>Step 5 = It's not present on HID, I posted a screen shot on the OP above</p>
<p>Step 6 = No restore point since I just did a clean install of W10</p>
<p>Step 7 = I no longer have the backups :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there anyway you can send or post the link of the Driver it self?.. Pls??? Im losing hope on this HP notebook.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>wendi_wolf,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest method to accomplish this task is to drag and drop the files the from source location to the destination location.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug your MP3 player \SanDisk,
<strong>copy </strong>the files (music\ document) from the destination location and
<strong>paste </strong>them into the drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some MP3 player comes with software; you can use the software to copy the songs from the computer to an MP3 player. You may want to refer the documentation that came
 along with it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this helps</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 not recognized as genuine after reinstallation on Parallels - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lj2585  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 not recognized as genuine after reinstallation on Parallels Desktop virtual machine</h2>
                    Hi All -&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am a Mac user who runs Windows 7 on my virtual machine (Parallels Desktop). &nbsp;I have done this for years, even upgrading to Windows 7 after using XP for a long time. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I had a problem with the Parallels Desktop upgrade that could only be fixed by removing and reinstalling the Parallels Virtual Machine. &nbsp;This, of course, required me to reinstall all of the programs (including Windows 7). &nbsp;Since I bought my Windows
 7 &nbsp;and Office 2010 at Staples (yes...no on-line or eBay copy here), I know that my copies are genuine and I've used Winows 7 for years prior to this reinstall. &nbsp;I still have the original case, along with the discs and the sticker with the product key. &nbsp;I used
 that key when I did the re-install and everything worked perfectly...up until today, when I turned on the virtual machine and it asked for me to enter the product key, saying something (I'm sorry I didn't write that down) about expiration. &nbsp;I re-entered my
 key, Windows 7 came up, but it says that "This copy of Windows is not genuine" and I am getting "You may be a victim of software counterfeiting" messages. &nbsp;Again...I purchased it full price at Staples, so I'm sure that isn't the case,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for your help. &nbsp;</div>

    <title>Hashtag at the top of the Win10 Start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> electrojim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hashtag at the top of the Win10 Start menu</h2>
                    <p>This computer is running Win10 Ver. 1607, Build 14393.1480.&nbsp; At the top of the Start menu, there's a little hashtag that looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bae522e9-3a9c-46c8-8ddf-186dd260b39d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bae522e9-3a9c-46c8-8ddf-186dd260b39d" /></a></p>
<p>...and when you click it, you get the alphabet like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e077e8cd-4f83-442f-afcb-dfad643a0969" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e077e8cd-4f83-442f-afcb-dfad643a0969" /></a></p>
<p>...which I find very useful for finding a program quickly, rather than scrolling through a long list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another computer running the same version of Win10, and it does not have that hashtag, nor does a friend's Win10 machine.&nbsp; My question is, how do you turn this on and off, and is it possible to default to that alphabet view, or write a script that
 would bring it up whenever you click Start?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The hashtag in the start menu is provided by Windows if you have a software installed that starts with a number. If there is no software that starts with a number, it will not be available. You can also click the letters that are available and it will also
 prompt you the alphabetical list in the start menu.<br />
<br />

<p><span>I have a xbox live on a distinguished road. I tried to play the game and asked me to update. after having consented or found a nasty surprise: all the progress reset. objectives that had
 remained unlocked but the game I have to start from level 1!! I tried to put it another game and after the upgrade I have deleted half progress this time! I have to redo half the game! I tried with a third game and I lost everything again. help me as soon
 as possible because I'm not using more for fear that I will erase the other save other games! is there a way to retrieve the data? by lv 49 back to level 1 was not good news ... help me ...</span></p>
<p>Sounds like the local profile is out of date or corrupted, and when an app or routine asks for data from it, it causes the involuntary disconnection. I'd start by clearing the system cache (it's just temporary files plus game updates,
 automatically reloaded) by:</p>
<p>1) Please do Settings | System Settings | Storage</p>
<p>2) Move over any hard drive or memory unit (not the Cloud) &amp; press (Y) on your controller &amp; pick Clear System Cache.</p>
<p>3) When asked to confirm storage device maintenance, choose Yes.</p>
<p>* Re-download *</p>
<p>4) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button</p>
<p>5) Select Download Profile (and if you don't see it, press the blue X button to make sure you're not signed in) and proceed with Profile Download.</p>
<p>6) Enter the Microsoft Account addresse for your Xbox LIVE gamertag when asked.</p>
<p>7) Enter the password for the Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>7A) If your account is an Xbox LIVE child account, the parent’s Windows Live ID &amp; password is required as well to download your profile.</p>
<p>8) Pick the storage device for your profile (choose Hard Drive if you have one, or Memory Unit if you don't have a Hard Drive).</p>
