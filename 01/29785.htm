            Hi Ashutosh,<br />
<br />
To troubleshoot issues with <strong>Cortana</strong>, you may refer to the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Language packs will be automatically installed on your computer as Windows Update. Make sure that your computer is connected to a stable internet connection. Metered connection will cause conflict in installing Windows Update.<br />
<br />
If the language pack is not being offered via Windows Update, then it's possible that the issue is with the broken components of Windows Update. You may also run the Windows Update troubleshooter by clicking this
<strong><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you may reset Windows Update components by following the steps provided on this

    <title>Windows 10 Battery refuses to charge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanleycerwinski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Battery refuses to charge</h2>
                    <p>After weeks of being frustrated by Windows 10 Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery - I'm nearly at my wits end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I was the top dog at eToys.com and would hire someone to FIX this issue. There's thousands of discussions out there about this topic, many under various brand names. I've an ASUS laptop that worked fine, in Windows 8.1; but has gone bonkers when
 Windows 10 did a driver update for ACPI, under batteries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked into the details and tried Bios change to stop the battery saving, uninstalled and reinstalled the driver (more than 100 times); and have gone into advance settings - all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the ACPI driver is uninstalled and reinstalled, for about 10 seconds, the battery charges (usually 3rd or 4th loop of the moving power meter indicator) - then it retrofits back to "plugged, charing" - but does not take a charge (meter stops).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon detailed review of the properties, etc., - I see the driver has an antiquated &nbsp;2006 dating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only I could find Matthew from eToys, he was a puritan that always found simple solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone provide a proper FIX of this most daunting vex?</p>

            Hello Stanley,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry for the inconvenience caused with Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since you have made changes to BIOS to check if the laptop charges, you may reset the bios to default settings and let’s try the below methods to check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>BIOS Disclaimer: </strong><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Method 1: Run the Power troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press Windows + X key. <br />
2.&nbsp;Select Control panel.<br />
3.&nbsp;In the search box, type Troubleshooter and then click Troubleshooting.<br />
4.&nbsp;Under System and Security, <br />
5.&nbsp;Click on Power and Click on Next button.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2: If the issue still persists, Try power cycling the laptop and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;Turn off the computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;Take out the power cord and the battery.<br />
3.&nbsp;Hold the power button for like 10 seconds to release the charge.<br />
4.&nbsp;Plug the battery and power cord back in.<br />
5.&nbsp;Turn the computer on.<br />
6.&nbsp;It should be able to charge now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would recommend you to check for latest Windows Updates. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates. If you have any pending updates remaining to install, kindly install them and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Program not working</h2>
                    I was playing Minecraft earlier this morning(6/21/2016) and suddenly, my computer decided restart while I was in the process of downloading a mod-pack from the At launcher. When I logged back on, Minecraft, Technic launcher, and the At launcher would not
 open, I tried restarting my computer, I tried fully turning it off and turning it back on, I tried repeatedly deleting and re-downloading the mod-pack launchers and Minecraft itself. But, no matter what I do, the programs will not run. I tried trouble shooting
 it on my computer, and that did nothing. The programs just will not, for some reason, run. I have absolutely no idea what is going wrong. Does anyone know what is happening?

<p>Hi Crazyissues,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
<strong>A)&nbsp;Disabling Data Execution Prevention (DEP)<br />
</strong><br />
Data Execution Prevention is a security feature that can be a bit of a pain at times. Often things will simply appear not to run at all; hopefully you will notice a bubble from the taskbar letting you know that DEP is the cause. If Vista sees that a process
 is being spawned that "could" be unwanted, DEP shuts it down. This is especially common in some application installations: if a Windows Installer setup (MSI) calls an executable in Vista, DEP could very well put a stop to it. If you are trying to run an installation
 or other executable being stopped by DEP, it could save you some trouble so turn it off while you attempt to give it another shot.<br />
<strong>i.</strong>&nbsp;Run a command prompt as administrator. From the start menu, select "All Programs", then "Accessories" and right-click on the "Command Prompt" shortcut and choose "Run as Administrator". From here you can use the following command to disable
 Data Execution Prevention (DEP) with the following command:<br />
<br />
<strong>bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>ii.</strong>&nbsp;Keeping your command prompt open, run Zone Alarm.<br />
<strong>iii.</strong>&nbsp; Then, to turn it back on again, do the same and run the following:</p>
<p><strong>bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOn</strong></p>
<p>Check the link “Data Execution Prevention: frequently asked questions” <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Data-Execution-Prevention-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Data-Execution-Prevention-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p><strong>B)&nbsp;Run the Program as a Administrator:<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>i.</strong>&nbsp;Right click on the executable file for Zone Alarm<br />
<strong>ii.</strong>&nbsp;Select “Run as Administrator”<br />
<strong>iii.</strong>&nbsp;Follow the wizard to install the software<br />

Hey guys,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
I seem to be struggling lately with my computer and its lag and the odd sound cutting out. I tried googling the problem but didn't really find anything that could help me much. This started happening few days back (perhaps after the update) but the momentary
 solution to it was to change NDU start from 2 to 4. It went smooth after that, no problem for like 5 days.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Again, I notice the sound cutting out. At first, I thought Chrome didn't start up properly but the sound cutting off happens in the whole system. I checked Firefox, the same issue, so at this point, I have no idea why is this happening and it's slowly frustrating
 me because I can't find any answers on the internet to this cause.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since this is a prebuilt computer (Acer Predator G3-605 to be specific) it has wifi included, which I use with the router being in the living room. It appears that updating the graphic card version from 358 to 362.00 (not 364.51 because that one is currently
 unstable) and updating the wifi driver has an effect on it as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound works fluently for now, as well as the lag is gone, but now I can sit back and see if it returns back.</p>

<h2>            Windows10 won&#39;t reactivate after motherboard swap</h2>

            Hi Ian
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Do you know if that corporate system had a Windows 7 retail or OEM licence?
<br />
<br />If that was retail, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

            Hi Ian1933
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            This is a valid Retail license. For problems in activation, you should reach out to Microsoft Support for activation help. This is a live agent support not a bot support. They can work with you on this to resolve activation issues.

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code that you state would relate to an invalid product key being used/entered for the device/OS being used.</p>
<p>Refer to the info at the link below concerning the activation error that you are receiving:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do note that upgrading the motherboard (as opposed to a direct/same model replacement MB)&nbsp;<span>effectively renders it as a new (different) device and a new license may need to be purchased for the edition of Windows 10 desired.</span></p>

<p>Thanks all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted MS on Vijay's link. seems the free upgrade from 7 to 10 entitlement only lasts as long as the machine:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>On your case, you need to get a retail version of Windows 10. Because we cannot reactivate your Windows. When you upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 using free upgrade. Your PC have Digital Entitlement. Means, all hardware inside your PC are activated.
 Once your change your motherboard, CPU, HDD or SSD. It will reactivate itself</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I put the old System Board back in, and Windows10 is activated as before.&nbsp; (MS Office license asked for confirmation, but this worked OK).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be the last person I know sill on a pentium, but hey. "If it ain't broke... break it".</p>

<h2>            Printing with Windows 10, have to save first</h2>
                    Another user had this same question and the answer was to copy to Wordpad....... &nbsp;I just want to select Print, select the pages, etc like I did before Windows 10. &nbsp;I suspect there is a setting somewhere that brings up the SAVE rather than the PRINT but
 I don't have a clue where.

</p><div>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I did run the Hardware Troubleshooter.&nbsp; Thank you for the excellent directions how to get to it.&nbsp; It did seem to detect something.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by Application, but the issue seems to happen when I want to print an attachment from an email.&nbsp; I use Gmail and Google Chrome browser. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally, I am not an early adopter.&nbsp; In the case of <strong>Windows10</strong>,&nbsp;I was forced into it when someone installed it on my computer without my approval.&nbsp; He is the only person that I know of that has said anything good about&nbsp;Windows10.&nbsp; From
 this I conclude that Windows10 may be an improvement from a systems standpoint but&nbsp;for the common user, it is<strong> less
</strong>user friendly.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that I can uninstall Windows10.&nbsp; But I'm not confident that I won't encounter other issues. And I don't know where it will take me back to. &nbsp; I was forced into Windows8 and hated it until someone gave me a short program (I
 think he called it Classic Shell) that brought back the Start Button.&nbsp; He also showed me how to turn off the "Charms" that would move in from the right side of the screen.&nbsp; I don't want to go back to the original Windows8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I knew I could go back to
 exactly what I had before Windows10 was installed, I would.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hopeful that&nbsp;Microsoft will have mercy on us and will create an Update to Windows10 that makes it more user friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding <strong>MS Edge</strong>.&nbsp; At your request, I have tried it.&nbsp; I did so after running the Hardware Troubleshooter.&nbsp; It does seem to print without having to save the document.&nbsp; But now I am unable to turn off printing in color.&nbsp; I usually print in&nbsp;black
 ink only.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not eager to convert from Chrome to Edge.&nbsp; Besides being used to it, I have all my favorites set up in Chrome.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know of only
<strong>one</strong> person that even knows what Edge is.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need assistance figuring out how to use new software if it is not intuitive.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unless forced, I will probably revert back to Chrome.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate your response to my question.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            I received an email asking if my question had been answered. &nbsp;If not, it requested a reply. &nbsp;It's basically the same information as my last Reply. &nbsp;I tried Edge and prefer Chrome. &nbsp;I'm used to Chrome and have my favorites saved. &nbsp;Additionally, I can't
 print black and white in Edge. &nbsp;My problem remains, using Chrome, I have to save things before printing them. &nbsp; I'm not a fan of Windows 10. &nbsp;It is not user friendly. &nbsp;

<p>That would be amazing.&nbsp; It comes down to EA making that happen. Because of all the legal issues with the NCAA games I'm not sure if they would ever make that happen.&nbsp; I enjoyed the NCAA games more than Madden when they were released.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ran the system file checker and it didn't find anything bad. Can you think of something else i can do to correct this.</p>

            <p><br />
Apparently the paging file may not exist. After boot up I get the message:</p>
<p>"Windows created a temorary paging file on your computer becasue of a problem that occurred with your paging file configuratiion when you started your computer. The total paging file size for all disk drives may be somewhat larger than the size you specified."</p>
<p>I followed your instructions as follows:</p>
<p>You may set paging size from 500 to 1000 and check if the issue persists follow the steps below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, click Advanced system settings.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced tab, under Performance, click Settings.<br />
(at this point is tells me the paging file is -0- Megabites)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Advanced tab, and then, under Virtual memory, click Change.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click custom size and Set the initial size 500 to maximum size to 1000 and then click on “set” and click on OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer to apply the changes and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>after following this proceedure it still says "Total paging file size for all drives:" sometimes this is blank and sometimes it is 0.</p>
<p>After doing this several times without any positive results, I ran the System File Checker tool to check for missing or corrupted files following the steps in the article found at:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>thinking it might make a difference which directory I ran this from I ran it 3 times from:<br />
C:\Windows\System32\sfc/scannow<br />
c:\Windows\sfc/scannow<br />
c:\&gt;sfc/scannow</p>
<p>each time i would get the following messages:<br />
Beginning system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>The scan log ends with:<br />
Reparing 0 components<br />
Repair Complete</p>
<p><br />
Another thing i might need to mention, after I make the changes by selecting Custom size then enter 500 for initial and 1000 max and the 500-1000 sizes are in the file size column and I click ok, a message appears "The changes you have made require you restart
 .... I click on ok and it goes back to the Performance Options which says "Total paging file size for all drives: (BLANK). It seems to have had no apparent change but I restart anyway with no positive results.</p>
<p>I am still getting the message advising me there is a problem that occurred with the paging file.</p>
<p><br />
Please help if you can.<br />
Thanks, Bob</p>

            Where are you putting the pagefile? You need a pagefile in the same partition as Windows, usuially C, even if it is only a nominal size with the main pagefile elsewhere.

            Your question made me feel really stupid. I assumed the system would create the file and put it where it should be. I did a complete search of my computer, all files and folders including hidden files and there was no pagefile. Not knowing how to fix this
 I created an empty file and renamed it pagefile.sys and put it in the OS root directory, went through the proceedure of changing the size etc and restarting. Now the file I just put there is no longer there. I&nbsp;guessed at how to create the file and where to
 put it but for some reason the system deleted the file. Any suggestions as to what i need to do?<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1:</span></b><span><br />
To find out which version of Windows Installer you have installed on your computer, follow these steps::</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click on 'Start'</span></p>
<p><span>2. Then click 'Run'</span></p>
<p><span>3 .In the box type " msiexec " then click OK.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. Then another box will come up and at the top of the box the first line should read which version of Windows Installer you have installed on your PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>5. It should look something like this " Windows ® Installer. V 4.5.6001.22159 "<br />
<br />

            The only repair tool for a NTFS file system is chkdsk.&nbsp; If it hangs and cannot repair the disk, then the only practical alternative is to back up as much data as you can access on your disk, then re-install Windows with a complete re-format of the hard
 drive (i.e. do not choose the "quick" format option).<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business user showing not available for Voice.</h2>
                    
<p>I set up a new user in our active directory and he has synced into our Office 365. &nbsp;I have assigned him the E3 office license as well as the Cloud PBX license. &nbsp;He shows up as a user on my Skype for Business dashboard but he dose not show up as a voice user
 so i cant assign him a number. &nbsp;editing his Skype for Business account under the voice tab it says "This Skype for Business online feature either isn't set up for your organization, or it isn't available at your location". &nbsp;His location is set for the United
 States and this seems to be the only user who is having this issue. Any ideas on what might be causing this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>Besides the Cloud PBX license, we also need to assign a voice calling license to this user. Please navigate to Office 365 portal and re-assign all of the relevant licenses to check the result.</p>
<p>Additionally, it may take up to 24 hours after you have assigned a Skype for Business PSTN Conferencing license in the Office 365 admin center for this user to set up the&nbsp;Skype for Business online feature.</p>
<p>Another factor is that this user may not sync correctly from AD. So I suggest you delete this account from Office 365, then sync it again to check the result.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please upload a screenshot about this error message and license details for further troubleshooting.&nbsp;To upload screenshots, select Use rich formatting, and then click insert /Edit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Toby</p>

<p>Thanks Toby, I got it to work by reassigning the licenses again and he pulled up this time. &nbsp;Also i noticed that the search feature for the Voice Users is case sensitive which was throwing me off. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The update server is locked up! I'm glade I didn't trouble shoot the W7 32 bit sys. The manual install of KB3035583, KB2952664, KB3021917 did not do any good on W7 64 sys. &lt;/Waiting it out&gt;</p>

            <p>Merry Christmas Gerry</p>
<p>I ran through a lot of trouble shooting with the 64 bit OS with no positive results in update not upgrade. Even to the possibility of a virus. As the 32 bit OS has not seen or even been booted and the same exact thing "no updates just keeps searching no
 error". Long wait is good for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks for the offer.</p>

            Upgraded W7 32 bit to X, fixed the update issue. W7 64 bit had to shut down WU. Silly thing is still trying to auto update. So I went into C:/$Windows~WS and launched setup. Skipped the update and declined End user agreement.

<p>The processor (i7) or whats is known as the CPU is not the problem, its motherboard, if you can get a replacement motherboard that's identical to the one its replacing, you should be able to continue using the same Windows license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its an upgrade version of Windows, that means its a retail license, which also means, you had a qualifying previous version license to use the upgrade.</p>

<p>Open a command prompt (run as Administrator) and at the promt enter:&nbsp;&nbsp; slmgr&nbsp;&nbsp; -rearm</p>
<p>Now you have an additional 30 day in which to activate Windows. If it is a full version just activate by phone as previously posted. The Windows 7 box should clearly indentify if you only have an "Upgrade" version (the word "Upgrade" front upper right corner).</p>

<p>1. Correct - you have the&nbsp;identical setup as mine&nbsp;BUT in German.</p>
<p>2. Correct&nbsp; - on my system the "get started" is currently grey. It was black and I started it and after one screen decided I did not want to go ahead, so cancelled it.</p>
<p>3. Cannot fix it with the Windows Insider Program Settings as it take me to the second image. As I said (between the images);<br />

</p><p>As far as I can see, the error message is not causing any 'known about' problems, except I have lost the start menu item for "Bash on Ubuntu on Windows (Beta)" with the pretty icon. However I am loathe to let the error remain as the system obviously is not
 happy about it and who knows what knock on effect might be later on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to summarize, I cannot follow the instructions given to me by Windows, and even if I wanted to (I don't) I am not able to&nbsp;join&nbsp;the Insider program; even to help clear the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that the error message must be created by some test of some sort within the windows code.</p>
<p>If we knew what caused it then a potential solution might be forthcoming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody else seen this red error message?</p>

<p>I pressed the Get Started, read all the warnings about "Your world could blow up" on the following screen and decided not to register. That does NOT seem an unreasonable thing to do, does it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that going through that scenario has left my PC with an error message seems odd. I suspect that if the right person read this, they would say something simple along the lines of ...."Oh yes you've triggered such and such, edit the registry and delete
 or change a key and everything will be fine.</p>
<p>Interesting that I have not seen any other reference to this error message anywhere on the web ... perhaps I am the only one in the world that has got it!</p>

            oookay that's exactly what i have done... without any consequences, crazy! but nothing is impossible. After a&nbsp;short search inquiry to the web i found this link http://www.chip.de/news/Achtung-Windows-Insider_98110952.html but of course it's on german and
 a little bit older. The site tells that there are only two ways to get away from win desktop insider program. The Moment when the insider build is exactly the same as the final build&nbsp;&amp; the other way should be after reinstalling the normal final version. Other
 sources tell that there is definitive a way to leave.... but it would make no sense to deliver german screenshots here... i recommend to google or to bing ;o) in your language. Maybe you can reach something using the "give us your feddback about this page"-link
 from your second screen shot or if you contact the microsoft support directly... if no other has an idea here. If you are prepared for, the shortest way may be a clean install. i think i can not really help you- sorry,

<p>I expect that&nbsp;somebody knows about that error message. I just need them to read this and tell me how to fix it.</p>
<p>I am very reluctant to do a clean install, as I have never done one and I suspect that it will not go well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You are correct in that I have NOT run a clean install of Win 10, and currently no intention.</p>

    <title>Some Complaints and Critique of Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> werewolfmon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Some Complaints and Critique of Skype</h2>
                    <p>Sorry that this will not be particularly detailed as I wish to sum things up as quickly as possible. I have been a user of skype for years now and I have seen the quality of the application lower over the years (although this is my opinion so if you disagree
 that's fine). I had only recently merged microsoft with my skype account, which I find a displeasing thing to do to begin with, so sorry if some of these are no longer there as they were before. Otherwise the first thing that happens to come to mind is the
 removal of contacts, which has been a rather ineffective process at times. I go to the contact, hit the remove contact, only to have them reappear moments later in my 'pending contact requests' despite the fact the person had not issued another contact request.
 The only way to remove this is to annoyingly, scroll back to the very beginning from the first time I added the contact and click 'no' on the original contact request which is a waste of time. My older contacts, whom have been around long before the update
 I'm not even capable of doing this for, since when I scroll back the chat history cuts off at a certain point (which is rather displeasing as well) which leads me to resorting to the 'block' feature, which I prefer not to have to impose. Rather, it would be
 better that when I hit 'remove contact' that would relatively be it. In case it was a mistake, the conversation with that person could still remain in my 'recent history' but should not appear as a contact nor in my pending contact list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, chat history. While chat history being removed beyond a certain point is inconvenient and annoying it is understandable that this is likely to occur with the constant, updating of the application. On the other hand, when scrolling back through
 chat history I notice that certain dates and months are enclosed, it will read something along the lines of 'May 24th-April 30th' or such when I can see the chat history before those dates and after those dates just fine. I find it rather inconvenient when
 searching back through chat history to begin with only to come across this bracket, in which often the information I'm looking for is hidden within those dates which are collapsed and need to be clicked on in order to be accessed. If there is an option to
 turn this off, or fiddle with the settings to disable this feature, or more effectively enable or disable it it so that it puts every month in brackets or not at all, instead of what it appears to be doing by putting certain dates in hidden brackets at random,
 that would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly is the android application, which updated perhaps less than a week ago. I feel as if this update has not been effective to adding to the application but rather rendering it worse than before and I have yet to find a particular aspect of it pleasing
 or helpful over the other as of this moment. The first issue I had with the update, is that it took me a ridicolous amount of time just to figure out where the 'sign out' option was. As it was not behind a menu screen I could easily bring up by hitting a menu
 or, easily visible in the application. One instead has to click on their profile icon from the main screen, then hit the gear wheel for settings, and scroll all the way down to the very bottom to find 'sign out' at last. This process seems to be an immense
 design flaw, as one does not know intuitively nor would immediately assume to take this course of action to sign out. In the previous version, one only had to hit the menu option and 'sign out' would appear on the side with ease instead of having to scroll
 through three different screens to find it at all. Secondly for the adroid application is the managing of contacts and conversations to talk to people. There is a major flaw, in that I can not immediately tell who is offline and who is not. There is no longer
 a 'green' indicator next to the name to say whether the person is online, offline, busy, or away. This leads to me, as the user being inconvenienced in having to check if a person is online by going through dozens of contacts individually, clicking on the
 contacts and then waiting a moment for the words 'is active now' above the conversation, which is rather inconvenient to have to do this for every contact if I wanted to know who was online and who was not and it's rather frustrating. Lastly, although this
 isn't a complaint it feels skype, the phone application specifically is aiming towards being a social media program or website (not naming names, but plenty can probably come to mind) over that of being a communication application to converse with others,
 instead of necessarily focusing on trends, or video posts, etc.. While I figure this could be good for some (I exclude myself in this case since I view skype more as a communication platform than a social media platform), if it doesn't interfere with the design
 of trying to communicate, message others, use chat histories, and remove contacts when necessary, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anywho, that's what has been bothering me for a while now in a more effective manner. I wished to get it off my chest and promised others I would do so. Thank you for going through this, and thanks for keeping the application around and functioning in the
 first place.</p>

<p><span>Hello
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e856dde3-6007-477c-a303-8f0c7dcaf6aa" title="Werewolfmon">Werewolfmon</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, we would like to thank you for you feedback. We appreciate the time and your perspective in regards to our new updates that includes new features and design for
 Skype. Here at Microsoft Skype, we welcome and truly value any feedback from our users since this will definitely help us, as we continuously aim to bring innovative technology, improve our products and services where we can empower more people to connect
 in more ways and enhance their lives. Rest assured that your feedback is highly noted and collated as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now, for your issue in
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34672/how-do-i-manage-my-contacts-in-skype-for-windows-10?q=managing+contacts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>removing Skype contacts</span></span></a>, by default it is correct that when you remove someone on your list, you’ll always appear offline to each other but the contact will still be listed
 on your contact list or recent tab. You will then need to <strong>Right-click</strong> the contact name to see the options:
<strong>Add to contacts or Block this Person. </strong>You no longer need to scroll back to the original request sent to you by the contact in your chat history.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Related to this, or the chat history and as part of the new update where
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12381/what-does-it-mean-that-skype-is-moving-from-peer-to-peer-to-the-cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>Skype transitioned to peer-to-peer
<span>architecture<span> to cloud
<span>infrastructure</span></span></span></span></span></a>. Chat history that are beyond 30 days are compiled into your account and application and there is no option to have this removed or turned off. But more importantly, this
 is to ensure that Skype features and your chat are available when you want them even if you access it using a different device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Lastly, for the
<strong>Android update </strong>and as stated above that we are continuously collating feedback from our Skype users, the
<strong>presence status </strong>has been reintroduced back in Skype. A <strong>green dot
</strong>on your Skype contacts profile photo will now show if they are <strong>online</strong>, if there’s none, then the contact is unavailable or not online. For the interface and as I understand that you had inconvenience in logging out, this will remain
 as is at the moment, but be sure to always be updated since this may be included for future versions.
</span></p>

<p>Wherewoldmon: I hear ya. I've been a l-o-n-g PAID skype user and the curve balls they are throwing at us is just to troublesome. I just posted the following to the Discussion forum:</p>
<p>=====</p>
Just installed Skype 11.19.820.0 - Excuse my french but this is a POS software.<br />
1. Doesn't interface with my Plantronics USB headset even though I have selected the Plantronics USB headset in the settings. The call starts through my speakers then switches over to the headset - sometimes.<br />
2. When I enter a search item in the search box I get multiple listings with multiple chances of having to click "Show More". I just want my address book searched and all the hits shown to me so I can scroll down and pick the one I want. I don't want the software
 to guess which one I want and not show the rest without me having to click "Show More".<br />
3. When I click to call someone I want to be able to make ONE CLICK to bring up the key pad, not two. I have to click TWICE to bring up the keypad and then I can't use the numeric keypad on the keyboard. I have to use the MOUSE to click #'s. Try to enter a
 bunch of #'s with the mouse instead of the key pad.<br />
4. I'm a PAID Skype user with a hard Skype #. I DO NOT want to see another question from SKYPE about the quality of the call when I finish a call. I just want to the call to END so I can get on with the next call. I have written about your query on call quality
 before in the Skype Community. I guess you never read it yet.<br />
5. Suggestion: Don't try to be cute or smart in your program, just make it easy to use.<br />
<p>=====</p>
<p>I find they are just trying to be to cute in their programming and not practical for everyday users. Makes me wonder if the programmers actually use the software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's exactly it, there's no &nbsp;obvious concern for practical use. &nbsp; It seems like development teams with little user interface experience hack together whatever fascinates somebody, and then sew it in place like
 an extra head on Frankenstein.</p>

</p><p>I've been reading through some of these posts and it seems like the Windows 10 version is BETA software and they are encouraging users to provide detailed feedback so they can fix the bugs and fix the "features". This sounds typical of Microsoft software
 (except for win 10 - that is good - so far).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who the heck is ruining the Skype train? Nobody that knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it bugs me to constantly be nagged to upgrade to the win 10 version. Did it today and after problems and a screwed up interface I went back to the old version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, who the neck is ruining the Skype developers?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yep. Skype is no longer fit for purpose and how I agree with the sentiment that Microsoft buys it the screws it. I have now moved all business to a VOIP provider (Sipgate) and Skype frustrations are pushing my entire business towards Apple.</p>
<p>The simplest things-</p>
<p>It does not play a sound when someone calls and yes, I have checked the settings:</p>
<p>It does not change status when you are away from your PC.</p>
<p>I suppose it is just part of the corrupting 24/7 connected plague.</p>
<p>So long Microsoft another loyal user packs his bags. And I have been with you longer than Windows.</p>

<p>All, Microsoft too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ref Skype...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a long time paid user of Skype. I have been using the 7.40.... version of Skype for a LONG time and it functions for me and works. About 3 months ago I got tired of the constant upgrade requests by Skype and bit-the-bullet and upgraded to the new Windows
 10 version. I tried to use it for about a week and finally said no more and switched back to ver 7.4.... version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now having to put up with the CONSTANT upgrade prompts with no way of turning them off or if there is a way, I have to jump through hoops to stop the CONSTANT nagging. I just don't get Microsoft and the programmers who think this is a wise step to CONSTANTLY
 NAG their customers to upgrade to an INFERIOR version of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I read a lot that says to provide feedback so that the powers-to-be can improve the product. Well, I'm not here to work for you and tell you what is screwed up in your software just like your not here to tell me how to improve my work habits and business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get with the program Microsoft/Skype and support your customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STOP THE NAGGING TO UPGRADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
