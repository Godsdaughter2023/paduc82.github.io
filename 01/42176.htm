                    <p>Hello,</p>

<br />Turn on the option 'Use Small Taskbar icons'
<br />
<br />Close the Settings App
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar and uncheck 'Lock the Taskbar' if it is checked
<br />
<br />Click and drag the top of the Taskbar downwards until it only has one row of icons
<br />
<br />Then right click your taskbar and check 'Lock the Taskbar'

            Hi Mortyjas, 
<br />
<br />Do you mean you need to change a file you are entering into that software to 96 DPI, if so what type of file is that?
<br />
<br />Do you mean you want to change your screen DPI to 96?

<br />The following steps will allow you to change the DPI settings of your computer:
<br />
<br />Right click on a blank space on your desktop.
<br />In the drop-down menu, click Customize.
<br />At the bottom left of the screen, click on Display.
<br />From there, you can choose from among the programmed options provided. Click Apply, after making your choice. The changes
<br />&nbsp;IT WILL TAKE EFFECT AFTER THE COMPUTER IS RE-ENTERED
<br />
<br />If the programmed options are not to your liking, you can click on Set custom text size (DPI), located on the left side of the screen
<br />
<br />In the Custom DPI Settings window, you can click on the percentage adjustment drop-down menu and select the PPP configuration you want.
<br />
<br />Once you have chosen the DPI configuration, click OK and then Apply. Changes will be made when you restart the computer.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps you

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 -

            Hi  TunaPT, you need to get into Command Prompt to fix this error, all the other options in the Recovery Environment will fail . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />See if you can get there from the Windows Recovery Environment
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />bootrec /FixMbr
<br />bootrec /FixBoot
<br />bootrec /ScanOs
<br />bootrec /RebuildBcd
<br />Then reboot your System to see if Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If you cannot get into Command Prompt from the Recovery Environment, you will need to use the Windows 10 Installation Media to get there, by booting from that and choosing 'Repair this Computer', then when the repair fails go to Troubleshoot - Command Prompt and run those commands . ..

<br />The object name is not found.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.

            Hi TunaPT
<br />
<br />In that case, as explained above you will need Windows Installation Media to get into the Recovery Environment, if you do not have that, you will need to create that on a working PC . . .
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then boot your PC form that rive and choose 'Repair this PC'

<h2>            Bliss Wallpaper Windows XP</h2>
                    I have a question about the default wallpaper for Windows XP called 'Bliss'. I've included the image below.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this the same default wallpaper regardless of where the computers are sold around the world or does it change? For example, in the Middle East or Africa do users still see this lush green field and blue sky with fluffy clouds? If so, I wonder what they
 make of it...&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Sardar.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where did you obtain Education version which uses Volume licensing activation only use by businesses an organizations like schools which have their own servers to manage activation.  This is where you should get the media to reinstall, although most of these have IT help desks that use imaging to reinstall their customized image.  So the Education like Enterprise media is not available through retail channels or the Media Creation Tool.  
<br />
<br />Can you consult your IT desk on how to proceed?  
<br />

    <title>Parental Control Problems on Admin Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ks.gal.86  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parental Control Problems on Admin Account</h2>
                    A few months ago I set up a new account on my computer for work only.&nbsp; I set up parental controls on the new account, and only the work account.&nbsp; I have ended up not needing my computer for work so turned parental controls off.&nbsp; Now, I am unable to download
 games without it asking for a password.&nbsp; I don't remember what password I had used since I didn't end up needing it and none that I have tried have worked.&nbsp; So
<span style="font-style: italic">how do I, as the administrator, turn off this feature</span>?&nbsp; I have accessed the parental controls and done everything I have seen/read that was recommended, but it wont allow me to change settings on my own admin account without
 setting up a second admin account.&nbsp; So how do I remove this feature from the admin, as the admin?&nbsp; It won't accept any account beside the admin and even then, it wont take my password.<br />
<br />
I've been working at this for a few weeks now and tried everything I can think of.&nbsp; Today I have spent most of the day trying to get this thing to work.
<br />
<br />
More details on what happens -<br />
- I go to download a game from the net while logged into my admin account<br />
- Everything works until the final stage when it usually asks for general permision from my antivirus<br />
- A pop up appears that reads: You may not have the necessary permissions to use all the features of the program you are about to run.&nbsp; You may run this program as a different user or continue to run the program as the current user.<br />
- Click current user and it closes, download failing.<br />
- Enter a password for the administrator and it says I have an invalid password or user name.<br />
- Enter my user name and password and it closes, download failing.<br />
<br />
Can someone please help with this?&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hello KS.Gal.86,<br />
<br />
Is the problem only with the Work account that you had created that had Parental Controls enabled? You can only set up Parental controls on a standard account and not an administrator account.
</p>
<p>If so, then create a new account that doesn't have parental controls enabled. <br />
<br />
Is the problem that you&nbsp;are having that you can't download programs as an Administrator?<br />
What is the exact error message you are getting when you download a program?<br />
<br />
It may not have anything to do with Parental controls. <br />
<br />
Please reply back with more details and information. <br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<h2>            Your security info change is still pending</h2>
                    My young daughter changed my security settings. My alternative email has been disabled, it was my father's email address. So I don't know what to do. They said we'll send a code to my father's email, but that email is disabled. So I can't receive the code
 either. Please help. Thank you.

            <p>&nbsp;We were away from the States for 2 months from April 6 and returned on June 6.
</p>
<p>My wife turned her PC on June 7, the Office Outlook 2010 without warning repeatedly asking for sign in password everyday until June 11 and I suggested my wife to sign in through IE, that is the time She found out the account has been frozen.&nbsp;This is moronic.
 Why? While in Canada, we used PC laptop, iPad and Android phones for Microsoft email&nbsp;and I believed for that reason, Microsoft think my wife email account&nbsp;might be compromised because of location change. We have no issue with Google Gmail, ATT.net emails,
 apple iCloud emails nor Yahoo or AOL when we returned to the States only Microsoft. Therefore, why would Microsoft&nbsp;froze the account? After verification, my wife still having problem of getting mails&nbsp;with&nbsp;Office Outlook error message saying server&nbsp;connection
 was disconnected?&nbsp;Signing in through IE,&nbsp;after successfully signed into account, one is confronted with&nbsp;default page that&nbsp;your security&nbsp;setting info&nbsp;change&nbsp;is pending as part of the verification process. This sounds like Microsoft needs 30 days to verify an
 email account?&nbsp; Account had been verified Microsoft 3-4 days ago. Do you guys know what you are doing?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no such problem running Windows 10 with Outlook 2016 after non usage for 2 months. Is it&nbsp; Windows 7 issue or is&nbsp;your security system not up to par with Google 7 ATT? All my wife Gmail and ATT emails are working fine after 2 months of non-usage in
 the States and 2 months of usage in Canada. Hello Microsoft can there be improvement on this front?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I requested to have my security info changed in April 2014 because I was going to delete the email account that was listed as an "alternate email".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft said that it would be changed in May 2014. As of October 2016 it is still not fixed. I contacted Microsoft Support, not once, not twice, but three times, and each time they said it was fixed and now I had the new email account listed as the alternate
 email. This wasn't true, and I still have the old email listed. Microsoft will not let me say I did not request this change, and they won't let me cancel the request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have had this account for 8 years and I really do not want to get a new one.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t seem configure speakers to 5.1 on Windows 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong><span>I can't seem to change config my speakers from stereo to 5.1, so I can't get games or videos to playback 5.1 surround.<br />
<br />
I'm using Gigabyte H55M D2H motherboard which has build in optical out and using </span>
<span>ALC888b audio codec</span><span> which supports 8-Channel HD Audio. My speakers are
<span>ALC888b audio codec</span><span> which supports 8-Channel HD Audio. My speakers are
</span><span>Logitech Z-5500</span><span> and OS </span><span>Windows 7 Home premium 64bit</span><span>. I have downloaded the latest driver and using Realtek HD Audio manager.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Those speakers have a screen showing what it detects, so when it detects digital signal such as DTS or Dolby, it will show and playback surround, if not, you can change settings to stereo and other modes. &nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>I have
 tested the speakers by going to </span><span>control panel</span><span> &gt; </span>
<span>sound</span><span> &gt; </span><span>properties</span><span> "Realtek digital output" &gt;
<span>sound</span><span> &gt; </span><span>properties</span><span> "Realtek digital output" &gt;
</span><span>supported format</span><span> &gt; clicked one of the encoded format then test. It's all fine, can see that the speakers detected digital out, and can hear sound from all speakers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
When I go to</span><span> advanced</span><span> tab, it seems that under default format I can only see
</span><span>2 channels</span><span>.<br />
<br />
I have searched around the web, I supposed to click </span><span><strong>configure</strong></span><span> under the
</span><span><strong>playback tab</strong></span><span> and set 5.1 there, but on mine it's
</span><span><strong>greyed out</strong></span><span> (This is for </span><strong><span>D</span><span>igital Output</span></strong><span>). However, I can configure the other two settings one is from&nbsp;</span><span><strong>HDMI</strong></span><span> obviously
 not able to output 5.1, and </span><span><strong>Speakers</strong></span><span>, although it can be configured to 5.1, using "normal" wires can only output Stereo, including center.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Further investigation (no luck):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I know that World of Warcraft can output Dolby digital 5.1, so I tested it (no surround only stereo) and read the sound log: "Using Control Panel Speaker Mode STEREO". &nbsp;I remembered that here supposed to say DIGITAL or 5.1. But still STEREO.
 So I need to configure it in control panel.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Please help, really want to get 5.1 working. :(<br />
Thank you<br />

<h2>            OneDrive data theft</h2>
                    <div>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious if others feel that OneDrive is a form of digital piracy.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I unsynced from OneDrive because&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. I use dropbox.&nbsp; I have no interest in OneDrive but is on by default.</div>
<div>2. OneDrive storage is insufficient, so having it on&nbsp; is an irritation unless you pay for more storage.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Unsyncing OneDrive resulted in local files on the machine hard drive being removed, recoverable only by turning OneDrive back on.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not how any respectable cloud storage service works.&nbsp; Unsync with dropbox and you are still left with a local copy
 of all files.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So OneDrive essentially vacuums your files, with the presumed intent to make money of off payments for more storage, with a penalty for disengaging forcing you to back up your files by hand somewhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You are not an idiot or cretin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a cretin - and folks here will tell you that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see anything much there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has it ever worked to your satisfaction before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has your system suffered a power failure, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, have you used the power button to shutdown?&nbsp; These thing can cause corruption in the NT File System (NTFS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have IObit, SUPERAntiSpyware and AVG installed.&nbsp; Protection is good, but too much protection can cause problems.&nbsp; I like IObit and SAS fine, but hate AVG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to look at the files.&nbsp; If your stuff will not defrag, you might have to call IObit, Chrome, SAS or AVG and ask them why.&nbsp; These are not XP files.&nbsp; They have nothing to do with XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the files are XP Restore Points.&nbsp; If they are corrupted and will not clean up, you may have to whack them all and start over with them.&nbsp; This is a common problem and not a big deal.&nbsp; Sometimes it is good to get a fresh start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would run a chkdsk with error correction on your hard drive, then see how things work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The chkdsk can take a long time - perhaps hours.&nbsp; It depends on the size of your drive, the amount of files on it it and what chkdsk finds to do.&nbsp; You may have to run it more than once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The XP defragmenter is a slimmed down version of the popular tool from Condusiv Technologies called "Diskeeper".&nbsp; It does a pretty good job most of the time, but there are some other tools (many of them free) that folks like better.<br />
<br />
There are many free third party defragmenters you can download from the Internet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some folks like the other tools better than the built in XP defragmenter, although you can see from the report above, the XP defragmenter is certainly capable of a result of
 zero fragmented files but sometimes you have to run it many times or do some unnatural things to get to that point.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples (in no particular order) of popular third party tools that you can investigate and you can do some Google searches for others:<br />
<br />
Some people like the Piriform suite of products and their Defraggler application which you can get here:<br />

            <p>You could just keep choosing to defrag the drive again until the report comes out with nothing left fragmented.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;That's what I do. But how I do it is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Right click on 'My Computer" icon on desk top. Click on 'Advance' tab. Click 'Settings' button in 'Performance'. Click 'Advance' tab. Click 'Change' button at the bottom under Virtual Memory. Tick 'No&nbsp;paging file and then "set" button. You will be prompted
 that you will need to restart computer to get changes to take effect. "OK" -"OK"-"Apply"-"OK" Then "OK" when prompted to restart.</p>
<p>Once computer is restarted:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Open 'My Computer'. Right click on C: drive. and properties.&nbsp; Select "Disk Cleanup" "OK' and check everything in window and click "OK".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now select the "Tools" tab. Click "Defragment" button. Now run defrag. When Finish window shows&nbsp; view report. If there is anything in the lower window go back and defrag again. Keep doing so until lower window in report is clear. Some files like AV program
 logs may be protected by mother program&nbsp;from defragmentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Once the system is complete then&nbsp; repeat the steps to get to "Virtual Memory" and tick "System Managed Size" and "SET" button. You will be prompted to reboot again. This time it will boot with no garbage&nbsp;data in Virtual memory. And everything will be truly
 defragged.</p>

<p>&nbsp;If this is the question then Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When doing a defrag in XP you will have 2 charts&nbsp; before and after defrag charts. If there is any 'Green" lines in the charts that is Virtual Memory/page files. And they are unmovable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also when defragging it is best to not be doing anything else with the computer while it is in defrag.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Would it make sense to run defrag in "Safe Mode with Command Prompt"?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL &#42;BSOD&#42;</h2>
                    I built my computer and have been using it just fine for the past 2 weeks or so, and all of a sudden I got a blue screen with IRQL NOT EQUAL OR LESS up on the top. I was then prompted to restart my computer and now I cant boot up my computer. My computer
 starts up for about 10 seconds after I choose a Regular Start Up. Windows only gives me that option and the option to Repair whatever it is that's not allowing for my computer to Boot up. Both end up with my computer restarting. I tried MemOK on my motherboard
 to see if that's the problem, but it seems that my RAM is working just fine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
( I don't know what information is needed so somethings maybe irrelevant.)<br />

Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />

            Hi Geek3h 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, there is currently no way to change the Desktop icon colors, all those 'Tricks' you will find on the Internet, used to work with older versions of Windows 10, but no longer work
<br />
<br />Microsoft are including more and more personalization features in the Feature updates, so hopefully this may be one of the changes coming in the Feature update due out in a couple of weeks, because there are a lot of users need this feature . . .

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Not Installing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why can't I download Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Beta on my new Windows 10 updated laptop? I looked up a tutorial, and the part I got stuck on is where you have to click the button with the +$9.99. I already have the game redeemed in my Mojang account,
 but it requires me to put in a Paypal or credit card, which I don't have. Can anyone please help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just figured out that I was logged in hotmail on the Store, but it's on my Microsoft account that has a different email. If this is why it's not working, how do I log out/add another account to the store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I found out that Microsoft and Windows are totally different things...whoops. Still need the question(s) answered please! How do I get the Windows Store to detect that I have it redeemed on my Microsoft? How do I log out of my hotmail when the email
 address for the confirmation prompt doesn't let me?</p>

            <p>Downloading Minecraft Windows 10 Edition Beta should be simple. First go to <a href="http://mojang.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mojang.com</a>&nbsp;and then log in to your Mojang Account. If you do not have a Mojang account, you can
<strong>migrate</strong> it from your Minecraft account. Once you log in it should bring you to your account page listing all Mojang games that you own. You should then see a&nbsp;<strong>redeem</strong> button; click it. Once you get the code from Microsoft's website,
 it should automatically go the the <strong>Store</strong> app on Windows 10 and unlock the game for you. If it does not automatically unlock it for you, go to the&nbsp;<strong>Store</strong> app and click on your profile picture, it shouldn't be that hard to spot.
 You should then see a "redeem" button; click that and paste it the code you got into the text box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change accounts on the Store, I believe that you will have to go into the settings app and sign out of your account there.</p>

<h2>            Program only opens and runs using troubleshooter&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So the program was working fine, and then I updated to the most recent Windows 10 update. Now it opens for a second and then immediately closes. If I use the troubleshooter, it will recommend using the windows 8 compatibly and then I hit test program and
 it opens the program just fine. I hit save compatibility settings and verify in the settings that it is using the windows 8 compatibly but the same thing happens, it'll open for a second then close unless I open it within the troubleshooter. Any advice would
 be much appreciated. Oh the program is: Accesstuner race for tuning vehicle ECUs</p>

<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A third party app or software might be interfering with the program. To isolate the issue, kindly start your PC in safe mode from the sign-in screen.
<span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When you get to the sign-in screen, hold the <strong>Shift </strong>key down while you select the<strong> Power
</strong>icon &gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>After your PC restarts to the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart</strong>.</li><li>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select <strong>5</strong> or
<strong>F5 </strong>for <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you were able to launch the app without any glitch, that means that a third party software or program might have caused the issue. To resolve it, we recommend that you perform a clean boot. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. To perform a clean, kindly follow the steps provided in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

I recenetly made an xbox live account and xbox live gave me the gamertag Wrinkymaple202 as a random choice. I currently just added a 12 month live card to the account and left my xbox running to run intown to get groceries and i came back and my neighbor
 changed my name to [Mod Removed] as a free character name change thinking its funny. I just went to get on and my name was changed to Slowjoey4678959 by im guessing a report causing this. i was never contacted through email or a message in game to notarize
 the action. I just got off a chat session with a xbox live agent and they said to contact youns to see if you would be kind enough to give me a name change due to the circumstances of my situation. I dont have the money to keep throwing out to change my gamertag
 and time cards on top of everything else and i dont wanna play with the gametag chosen from ur automated generator. If you would be kind enough to allow me to have a free name change of some sort it would be Greatly Appreciat

<p>Hello there&nbsp;<strong>SlowJoey4678959, &nbsp;</strong>I`ve got to agree with&nbsp;these guys&nbsp;on this one. You would not be able to choose your new tag&nbsp;<strong>without paying, &nbsp;</strong>There's Always this Alternative.</p>
<p>You can always earn<strong>&nbsp;credits&nbsp;</strong>on&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Live Rewards&nbsp;</strong>to purchase your&nbsp;<strong>new Gamer-Tag</strong>,&nbsp;When you've racked up at least 5,000 Rewards Credits or more, whether on Xbox One or Xbox 360, they'll be converted into your
 country's local currency and&nbsp;<strong>deposited into your Microsoft account</strong>. Then it's off to the Xbox stores, where you can use your money to pick up your favorite Xbox One and Xbox 360 games, Avatar props and more, But in your case a new Gamer-Tag.
 ^_^</p>
<p><strong>You can get started with</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Live Rewards by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/live/rewards?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clicking here</a>,

<h2>            Turn off cursor pointer for touch use</h2>
                    
<p>I am looking in Windows for an option to turn off the visual cursor pointers when using a touchscreen. I have noticed that most&nbsp;touch drivers from companies like Elo include an option to turn off the "mouse pointer" from the control panel. But, I can't find
 this option with the latest integrated touchscreens in Tablet PCs (that use&nbsp;native Windows control panel options only).</p>

<p><span><span>This feature is not part of Vista.&nbsp; If available, it will come with the drivers, firmware, and/or software for the touchpad and/or mouse.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>@Lorien - One</p>
<p>I don't need a manufacturer driver or update. I am looking for the native Windows functionality.</p>
<p>I am looking for the option in a Windows standard control panel item or with some registry trick, not from the manufacturer drivers. Several manufacturers (example Wacom) do not expose their own control panel and use native Windows functionality.</p>
<p>My assumption is that Elo and others access some internal Windows function to turn off the visible "mouse pointer". For Win7 and Vista touch, typically this would be from an HID Digitizer device with Touch collection but could also be an HID Mouse.</p>
<p>Any hints on where to look for native Windows function (not manufacturer driver-based) to turn off mouse and touch-digitizer pointers?</p>

<p>@ Mouneshwar R</p>
<p>This option does not cause the mouse pointer or&nbsp;cursor pointer to disappear entirely. It is used to turn on of off the special touch cursors.</p>
<p>I would like a solution that simply causes the typical small arrow or diamond pointer to not appear for click and drag during touch or during both touch (and mouse) actions. I understand all of the options for activating the touch pointer or not, to activate
 the rings or not, etc. These are in the standard control panels.</p>
<p>What I can't figure out how to do from the system is to make sure that nothing appears. For example, consider a situation where one wants to have a kiosk without a pointer cursor, just put your finger on icons ("invisible" select click). Or where you expose
 a version of the desktop and you don't want the arrow or touch cursor showing up so people might notice small inaccuracies in the touch calibration.</p>

<p><span>Hi TheGreek20,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows doesnât have an option to hide the mouse pointer completely. The mouse pointer does exist and its by design.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me give you an instance why the pointer cannot be hidden completely.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Hovering your mouse pointer</span></strong><span>: Position the pointer to a
 specific object without clicking any mouse buttons and without moving for at least a second. Hover isn't supported by most touch technologies, so users with such touchscreens can't perform any tasks that require hovering. Lot of windows application does use
 hovering feature. This might be one of the reason that the developers at Microsoft did not include the feature of hiding the pointer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, there are some third party software that can hide pointers completely.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>Third Party Disclaimer: Note: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
 from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>

            You can turn off the touch pointer (which results in normal mouse pointer behaviour):<br />
<br />
http://superuser.com/questions/66502/disable-press-animation-on-vista-windows7-touch-pc<br />
<br />
Then on an application level you can set the (mouse) cursor type to none:<br />
<br />
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.frameworkelement.cursor.aspx<br />
<br />
or you can set the theme to have only transparent cursors (so technically the cursor is still there, but it has no visible effect).<br />

            <p>Unfortunately I have the exact same problem and it was impossible for me to solve it.</p>
<p>I already tried all of the solutions in this <a href="http://viziblr.com/news/2010/11/2/guide-to-disabling-pen-ring-animations-dynamic-feedback-on-w.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, but the best I acheived was to get rid of the circles that animate around a touch point. This is not enough for me.</p>
<p>What I want to acheive is to get rid of the diamond cursor that appears once&nbsp;I touch the screen. More specifically, what really messes up my software is this effect of fading out of the diamond cursor, once the touch has stopped. While fading out, the cursor
 is still affecting the area below, making the software think that the screen is still being touched. On a real-time image manipulation application that I am using this tottaly messes with performance.</p>
<p>Is there at least some variable in the registry that enables me to set this fading out animation of the cursor to near zero??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you</p>

1. Turn the touch pointer on<br />

    <title>Code redeem problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Code redeem problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i am having problem with my xbox 360 gears of war collection for xbox one redeem codes. When i am trying to redeem codes using my xbox one s for those games i am getting message, Something happened at our end. waiting might help. redeeming other codes works. gears of war collection codes wear included in gears of war 4 which i got together with a bundle which i bought from official microsoft website. I have contacted before community ambassador and did check up on my xbox one s and there was nothing wrong with it, as well code were checked and it was confirmed that they haven't been redeemed. Later i was told that it is ongoing problem from inside of company and usually it takes to solve problems in 3-5 hours. But its been already few weeks. I did try as well to redeem codes directly using website that didnt work as well. I am hoping to wait for response from support staff.</p>

            <p>Hey there Justasgud,</p><p><br /></p><p>We're curious as well and will need a bit more information to dig into this further. Can you please confirm which country are you physically located in on our <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Officially Supported Xbox Live Countries and Regions</a> list and which country/region do you have your account set to on <a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com</a>? </p><p><br /></p>
<p>To clarify, if you're not connecting from a region on this list, or there is a mismatch between your account and region you're connecting from.&nbsp;You could be in a country or region that's not officially supported and it&nbsp;could mean that some features may not work properly, including code redemption.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks!</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Thanks for the information, generally this type of error happens if the account region is not matching the region you're connecting from. Xbox 360 games are region locked where as Xbox One games are not. This is likely why you were able to redeem the Forza Horizon 3 code without an issue. Let's get you to contact our chat/phone teams for a closer look.

    <title>Project to second screen has stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Project to second screen has stopped working</h2>
                    Hi guys. I'm having some trouble with my Lenovo z70-80 laptop. After the latest windows 10 update projecting to my TV via hdmi has stopped working. Before the update I used to be able to turn my laptop on and it would auto project to my TV. After the update
 I had to start selecting project and then the second screen only option from the side menu. Now however it's stopped working all together. It was fine this morning. I went out to do a bit of shopping, turning my laptop off to save electricity, came back, turned
 my laptop on and clicked on project. Except now when I click on project and choose the second screen only option it does nothing. I've not done anything to it it's just stopped working. I've tried updating the on-board Intel graphics drivers, different HDMI
 cable, different HDMI port and restarted a bunch of times but nothing has worked. Any help would be great. Thanks all.

            <p>Thank you for the reply. I honestly think it's the Hdmi port on my laptop as I've tried everything. Even using the hdmi in on my Xbox One doesn't pick up a signal from my laptop. So by the process of elimination I think the hdmi port has become faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you for your time in replying.&nbsp;</p>
