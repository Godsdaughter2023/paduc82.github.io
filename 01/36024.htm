            <p>Microsoft <em>requires </em>Toshiba to provide a way for you to install Windows again. If the computer didn't come with a set of discs (or if you never made your own set of Recovery discs), there will be a hidden Recovery partition you would use to do the
 Reset (i.e., clean install). See the <strong>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</strong> section on this page =&gt;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: Make sure you backup your personal data beforehand (e.g., contents of My Documents, My Pictures, My Music, etc., folders; Internet Explorer bookmarks; Mail Client data; etc.) then select the
<strong>erase data thoroughly</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need any further assistance, you can begin your own, new thread in this forum &amp; ask for guidance =&gt;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the procedure is&nbsp;outside of your technical "comfort zone" - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the computer to a local, reputable and
<em>independent</em> (i.e., not a "BigBoxStore" or the Geek Squad!) computer repair shop &amp; let them do the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: The computer should NOT be connected to the internet <em>or any local networks</em> (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All of your personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not
 already compromised.</strong></p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox one downloading issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so i am having some issues when it comes to downloading and updating games.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>Every time i try to download or update any games it takes very long time, no matter what size.</p><p>So the problem is that when i am downloading a game it starts downloading at about anything from 1-60 mbps for about one second, then it stops downloading. It doesn't pause or anything it is just downloading at 0mbps. Then after a while it starts downloading at any speed for about 3-4 seconds, then it stops again for a while and so on. This problem has been going on for a long time, but i didn't think much of it before i compared it with my friends xbox. An example: Just yesterday i was trying to update fortnite on my xbox, after waiting for about 3 hours, it only had downloaded about 10% (around 1 gig). And i've tested my internet speed on the xbox and it comes out around 102 mbps uploading speed and 70 mbps downloading speed, so my intrernet is not the problem.</p><p>I have factory rest

<p>
</p><p><span>BIOS is already in AHCI. I suppose if my motherboard is incompatible with windows 10, I am lucky that it functions at all, the trouble with buying superior quality technology is that it outlives its time.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I have since updated to windows 2018 October and have been running for almost 24 hours without loosing the disks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I noticed after the update install that the two disks that disappear (always together) appeared twice in the
<span>&nbsp;</span>nav panel, <span>&nbsp;</span>once under “this pc” and once under “portable devices”. I fixed this problem after the initial install by removing the FSB2C77 registry key in DelegateFolders. This made me wonder if this fix could have
 been the cause of the intermittent disappearances.</span></p>

<p>as you can see disks 0,1,3,4 and 5 are not saturated as the previous suggests.</p>

 and hear that audio play fine but as I do it keeps also making the ping sound. What can I do to make the pinging stop? I tried the mute&nbsp;button but that mutes everything</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify"><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Forum.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p><span><span>As per your description I understand that you are facing issues with your computer making some unusual sounds when you are working on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you few steps to diagnose where the sound is coming from. But before that there is no device plugged in to the USB connection.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Step 1: Try <strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To know more about safe mode, follow the article
</span></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Step 2: <strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 To know more, follow the article </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean boot</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After performing clean boot we should be able to conclude that why is the sound coming from the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please install any pending Windows updates on the pc to check if that helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks and Regards<br />

<p>first do not bump old threads second, they do not ban consoles for nothing you or the previous owner of it had to do something bad enough to warrant the dreaded console ban. &nbsp;the only thing you can do is take it up with the seller if you bought used or buy
 a new one if it was bought by you.</p>

            Hi leytonviner 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with .
<br />
<br />When we purchase Windows operating system, we purchase them through different types of licenses. These Windows License impose restrictions, terms and rights which are based on Microsoft Software License Terms. The most popular license terms are  Retail (FPP (Full Packaged Product)), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), and Volume Licensing.
<br />
<br />Retail license - yes. You can move it to a different computer as long as it's only installed on one computer at a time (and if it's a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista license). The previous Windows 7 installation on the old computer must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time. 
<br /> 
<br />OEM license - no. OEM licenses, including Windows preinstalled on a computer before purchase, are tied to the first computer they are installed on and can not be transferred to a different computer. To install Windows on a different computer you will need to buy another copy. 
<br />
<br />Volume Licensing: Volume License Keys are issued by companies for use on client computers of its own organization. Volume License Keys and Volume Product keys are not-for-resale keys and they cannot be transferred if computer changes ownership. Volume License find applications in government and educational institutions. The prices for volume licensing varying depending on the type, quantity and applicable subscription-term. A volume license key (VLK) can also indicate the product key used while installing software licensed in bulk. It allows a single product key to be used for multiple installations. For example, the Windows Enterprise edition is activated with a volume license key.
<br />
<br />To determine what kind of license you have here is a link that will show you how.

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi,
<br />digital license is valid only for unchanged hardware.
<br /> How did you get Windows 10? 
<br />If it was preinstalled you have no rights to use it on another computer.

            Hi Leyton,
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . ..

<p>It's pretty much up to the games developers/publishers if they want to make it available for digital download.</p>

<h2>            My right click doesn&#39;t show the pop-up menu on the desktop.</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my windows to windows 10; the right click isn't working on the desktop or my computer, whenever I click on it, it shows the throbber icon for a &nbsp;while and it doesn't show the pop up menu at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wouldn't even let me personalize my desktop or create a new folder, but the pop up menu comes up every time i click on a folder.&nbsp;<br />
I'll be grateful to whoever replies. </p>

            <p><span>Hi Ben,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are using multiple pointing devices on this computer, then this could be a conflicting issue among these devices. I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue. Please answer
 these questions for a better understanding:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the make and model of your computer and the mouse device?</span></p>
<p><span>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have multiple pointing devices connected to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you using a Touch Screen monitor with this desktop computer?</span></p>
<br />
<p><span>If you are using multiple pointing devices (Mouse or Touchpad) on this computer, then I would suggest you to connect just one of them at a time and then check if that issue persists. If you
 are using the Touch Screen monitor, then I would suggest you to disconnect it and check if this issue persists with a normal monitor.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn’t work, then check if the issue persists in clean boot. To perform a clean boot, you may please follow these instructions:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a Clean Boot and find out which application/service is causing this issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts and to determine what is causing the problem. To perform a clean boot, please refer to the section “<strong><span>How to perform a clean boot</span></strong>”
 and follow the instructions for “<strong><span>Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</span></strong>” from this link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may please note that performing a clean boot does not fix the actual issue. It just helps us in identifying the root cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “<strong><span>Windows
 8.1 and Windows 8</span></strong>” given in the section “<strong><span>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</span></strong>” from the same given link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important: After you have finished troubleshooting, refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” for “Windows 8 and Windows 8.1”,
 to reset the computer to start as usual from the above link.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to find the root cause of this issue by performing a clean boot, then this could be an issue with the mouse driver installed on the computer. You may try updating the mouse
 driver from its manufacturer’s website and let’s know the details. If you need any further assistance with this, please feel free to get back to us and we’ll be glad to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with the results.</span></p>

    <title>Disabling USB HID selective suspending - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickcr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling USB HID selective suspending</h2>
                    <p>My USB mouse (Microsoft WheelMouse Optical 1.1A) enters a low power idle state after a few seconds despite me having disabled USB selective suspend from the power plan settings and setting EnableSelectiveSuspend to 0 in the registry of the root hub device
 parameters.</p>
<p>I have already gone through input.inf, msmouse.inf and usbport.inf in the DriverStore's FileRepository to look for potential driver-sided suspend or idle settings, but only found AddReg values concerning the EnableSelectiveSuspend key and changing those
 to disabled didn't help. I could not locate HcDisableSelectiveSuspend, DeviceIdleEnabled, DefaultIdleState, UserSetDeviceIdleEnabled in the infs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the mouse internally is set to enter idle and request the bus to power down accordingly. Is there any way to forcefully disable suspending of the mouse? Is taking USB power policy ownership necessary to overrule the device's specifications?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>My BD/CD/DVD drive isn't working because Windows cannot load the driver software. I have had the computer since november and I hadn't had any problems since mid february. I have already tried unistalling the driver and then reinstalling which did nothing.
 I have tried deleting the upper and lower filters which also didn't work, and I have tried resetting the BIOS settings which was once again unsuccesful. The only thing that did work was rolling back my system to a previous update point in which case it did
 work, but the next day it was not working. I would rollback my system again but because of the limited space(300mb) of update rollback points I can't go far enough back again to a point before this problem. This has been incredibly frustrating and completely
 windows fault because of the automatic updates it installs. A solution would be much appreciated.<br />

            <p>Apparently, if you have an older video card, that might be reason why iTunes setup is failing. Try the following download to see if it works:</p>
<p>https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/itunes12/031-69284-20160802-7E7B2D20-552B-11E6-B2B9-696CECD541CE/iTunes64Setup.exe
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, try the latest executable:</p>
<p>https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1814?viewlocale=en_GB&amp;locale=en_GB </p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember to right click setup, then click Run as administrator.</p>

    <title>Surface keyboard issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alf-eng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface keyboard issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had a couple of type-cover keyboard issues since the original Surface and am wondering why they've never been addressed? &nbsp;I currently own/use a Surface Pro 3 and had really hoped the problems would've gone away. &nbsp;I'm hoping someone from Microsoft will
 at least see this and put a feature/bug fix request in for the development team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First is double-tap/drag. &nbsp;I started a thread about it when Surface Pro 2 came out and it's one of the most replied threads on this website. &nbsp;This extremely common, basic, STANDARD functionality doesn't exist for type-cover keyboards and there's never been
 a good reason given for the lack of it. &nbsp;You customers who want real productivity out of these devices want to tap-tap-drag windows, icons, etc. &nbsp;It was there for Surface RT and for touch-covers, just not the Surface Pro line and type-covers. &nbsp;This seems completely
 arbitrary and completely/easily fixable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, I use a type-cover 2 with my Surface Pro 3 and during the first two days of use the tap-tap-drag feature ACTUALLY WORKED! &nbsp;I was shocked, surprised, and elated. &nbsp;But then some forced auto-updated occurred and on the third day the functionality
 was gone. &nbsp;That tells me this is the behavior Microsoft wants and they are doing it ON PURPOSE. &nbsp;So just level with us -- why?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second issue is with function-lock. &nbsp;I'm so glad it's there, but as I said I use the Surface as a real computer which means I spend the VAST majority of my time TYPING TEXT with it -- Visual Studio, Word, Excel, Mail, and Photoshop the most. &nbsp;Each of
 these apps has a lot of hot keys which I use regularly to speed up my productivity. &nbsp;The lack of ability to PERMANENTLY enable function lock greatly hampers that productivity. &nbsp;Is there any way we can get a setting somewhere to permanently reverse the lockedness
 of the fn button? &nbsp;Apple has this on all their keyboards, so I know it's possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and hopefully you can pass these requests on to the development team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>ALF</p>

            <p>Hi Alf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the time you have taken to reach out to the Microsoft Community with your concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to point out that if you’re using an app that uses function keys a lot, you can temporarily lock the top row of keys so the in function keys stick. You can do this by&nbsp;holding down the<strong> Fn key
</strong>and pressing the <strong>Caps key</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(48, 46, 47, 1)">Additionally, I am including&nbsp;two support articles that provide more information about the Fn keys and the touchpad gestures.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks, but that information doesn't really answer the questions I asked. &nbsp;In fact, it appears you may not have actually read my original post -- where I mentioned the fn key + caps feature. &nbsp;My problem with that feature is it's insufficient. &nbsp;I want to
 be able to permanently have that functionality, like I can have on my Macbook Air.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft is positioning Surface 3 Pro as a replacement for the MB Air, and specifically as a laptop replacement, they should minimally provide the same level of functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reference to someone else complaining about the same missing tap-tap-drag feature is also unhelpful. &nbsp;I started a thread over a year ago about the same problem on Surface Pro 2. &nbsp;I don't have the link anymore, but that never received a satisfactory
 answer either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again this is a case of Microsoft not meeting MINIMAL functional requirements when positioning Surface Pro 3 as a laptop replacement and Macbook Air replacement. &nbsp;These missing features will prevent sales of Surface Pro 3 and guarantee its failure as the
 Pro 1 and 2 failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is easy. &nbsp;Not sure why nobody there at Microsoft is listening or doing anything about it. &nbsp;Worse, they seem to be actively discouraging people buying their products.</p>

<h2>            Critical Error - Your Start menu isn&#39;t working.</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am having this issue:</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Critical Error</p>
<p>Your Start menu isn't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Start menu is completely non-responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the issue I did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st) I signed out, as that was the only option given to you by the error message. It did not help; I didn't even receive a message prompting any indication that the system TRIED to even resolve the issue. So like a gullible user I clicked on Start and the
 same error message came up and so I signed out again.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Then, AFTER SOME GOOGLE-ING I DID THE FOLLOWING:</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd) I made use of this person's advice [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrTD-Wxaqi8 ]. I tried re-registering the Start menu. It did not work. please take note that I did not make a new account as the YouTuber did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd) I went through this thread [ https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start-winpc/critical-error-your-start-menu-isnt-working-well/7fb70405-a8b2-419a-9ad0-6b9a0a557b63 ] and in it there are two options presented:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Make a new account, make it an admin, and then log in with it and click on the Start menu to see if that resolved the issue, OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - Download the Start menu troubleshooter and let it run it's diagnostics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lone behold, neither of those options worked. For what it's worth I checked apply automatic fixes in the troubleshooter. The only message I'm getting is: "Required applications are not installed correctly"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh wow thanks troubleshooter for indicating so vaguely, I really need vague directions right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I absolutely, desperately need assistance on this issue. This PC is my only current form of income and I can't afford a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please someone help me, with clear, concrete, and resolute solutions.</p>
