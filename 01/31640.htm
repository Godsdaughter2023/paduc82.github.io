    <title>photo file numbering - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kay_444  say:</h3>
<h2>            photo file numbering</h2>
                    <p>Even though my Canon camera has continuous numbering,&nbsp;each time &nbsp;I upload my photos&nbsp;to the computer, They are numbered starting at 1,2,3 etc. So every folder has the same photo numbers. I can not find a place in computer to change this to continuous numbering.
 I have windows 7. </p>
<p>It has always imported the photos using continuous numbering until recently. I can't figure out what happened or how to change it.</p>

            First you should AlbumArt files from the music folder. Then open Windows Media Player (WMP), click "Organize" -&gt; "Options" and uncheck "Retrieve additional information from the internet".

<p>I think he means to delete the album art from EACH folder, problem with that is I've got over 5k folders under my MyMusic folder, and a lot of the album art isn't in the album's folder.</p>
<p>If, while in the library, you click the "View Options" tab, which is right next to "Search" right above the library field. Click the same button when in an individual album or artist and that will just give details.</p>
<p>Is that what you had in mind? Hope it helps&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there!</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for posting. Are the batteries firmly placed in?&nbsp;I'm afraid that drop could have possibly damaged something in that area of the controller where the battery could be slightly off. With the details already provided,&nbsp;the best advice we can&nbsp;give is to have the controller replaced through our <a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>. We do not recommend opening the controller up as that would void the warranty on it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope that helps!</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Bluetooth Mouse freezes periodically&#65279;.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Bluetooth mouse freezes periodically</p>
<p>I bought a new bluetooth mouse, precisely the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse, but it does not work properly.</p>
<p>In fact, it periodically freezes. I found out that the problem it should be the power management system, so in the Device Manager I disabled the ability to turn off the bluetooth adapter to save energy. But still the mouse keeps to freeze. Any solution?</p>

            <p><strong>UnInstall Bluetooth drivers and re-install Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 7 or Windows 8.0 in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried all suggestions and troubleshooting steps including disabling power saving options, doing a factory reset and clean install of Windows 8.0 / 8.1 but I continued to have problems with Microsoft Bluetooth mice (w/o USB dongles) randomly disconnecting.
 The ONLY solution that worked for me was un-installing existing Bluetooth drivers from Control Panel as well as Device Manager and re-installing Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 7 or Windows 8.0 in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode".
<strong>The key </strong><strong>here is installing Bluetooth drivers in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode" by right-clicking the Bluetooth EXE file &gt; Properties &amp; selecting "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode". Avoid Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 8.1</strong>.
 Luckily, my touchscreen laptop manufacturer (Acer) had both Windows 7 &amp; Window 8.0 Atheros Bluetooth drivers for my model on their support website. Additional side-benefits I noticed after doing this:</p>

<li>All three models of built-in Bluetooth Microsoft mice (Microsoft Scuplt Touch, Sculpt Comfort &amp; Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000) started working perfectly without any sudden disconnects or freezing;</li><li>The overall mouse operations also became lot smoother and predictable;</li><li>Windows Power Management started working perfectly with the laptop going into sleep / standby nicely and waking up instantly without any lockups or WiFi issues</li><li>CPU / Fan noise is much quieter-- it seems the Bluetooth drivers installed as I suggest are more "in harmony" with the rest of the system.</li><li>Everything including the Bluetooth mouse is working great for almost a week since I made these changes. I promptly updated my complete system image backup with the new setup.</li></ol>

<p>Original title: Bluetooth mouse freezes periodically</p>
<p>I bought a new bluetooth mouse, precisely the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse, but it does not work properly.</p>
<p>In fact, it periodically freezes. I found out that the problem it should be the power management system, so in the Device Manager I disabled the ability to turn off the bluetooth adapter to save energy. But still the mouse keeps to freeze. Any solution?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just bought this same mouse for a brand new Dell with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It freezes and I have to go out to the login screen and back in .. and it comes to life for about another 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse has been laggy and not as smooth as the toggle version.&nbsp; MicroSoft must have a Windows 8.1 driver that works flawlessly -- this seem so odd to me -- the reason I got off Logitech (which always worked well) was because I assume capability would
 be perfect.</p>

            <p>SP2 Win 8.1, patched up to date (one hopes - but you can never really tell, can you?) Bluetooth "Sculpt Comfort Mouse"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It never stops with MS hardware does it? Continual problems. Since buying an SP2 (curse the day) and a "Comfort sculpt mouse" (what sort of "comfort" are MS referring to here? Like the comfort of a toothache?) I have an almost daily battle - since last December
 - with something malfunctioning. All together more than all &nbsp;the problems associated with every computer and OS I've owned for 30+ years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ****ing mouse. Yes, it freezes periodically, unpredictably, and for varying periods of time - including permanently. Sometimes a reboot's required and sometimes even that doesn't work: like today.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Rediscovering" it is haphazard. Sometimes it isn't found at all. Sometimes it is identified as a "Bluetooth headset", something that I don't even own. Then occasionally after first removing the device it finally gets found and reinstalled. Useless cr@p.
 How MS with all their resources allow this sort of incompetence to persist is beyond me. But it's not remotely surprising.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As for the suggestions seen on this thread that one should go back to factory defaults and reinstall from scratch TO FIX A BL00DY MALFUNCTIONING MOUSE!!!!! - that's called adding insult to injury. It's a popular "fix" however. This is called
<em>hit and hope</em>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Total, continual, infuriating incompetence. I'll never, ever, buy of recommend Microsoft hardware ever again. As for a solution to the above, what is it?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dumb mouse or I must be a dumb tech guy. I want to call a tech to fix my mouse lol.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me 6 months to stop my surface pro 3&nbsp;from waking up in my backpack.&nbsp;I go to the Microsoft store and they offer to replace it which&nbsp;I know will not fix the glitch because every computer has the same issues.&nbsp;I needed to install Hyper-V service that
 I don't want on my computer to put hibernate because sleep on Surface Pro 3 is still failing.&nbsp; Microsoft turned off hibernate for their instant-go or lets say keeps on going sleep technology.&nbsp; They are trying to make a PC sleep properly for 10 years and still
 failing.&nbsp; I never had a computer that doesn't wake up for some reason or another.&nbsp; Tasks scheduled to wake up computer, allow this device to wake up is just a mess.&nbsp; Fix the power management issue and make an option "don't allow any damn device to wake my
 stupid computer". the sleep mode didn't work I had to settle for Hibernate&nbsp;Unfortunately I develop for Microsoft platforms and am stuck with an endless hell. The surface pro 3 is so nice but each one had some stupid issue that makes me want to throw it like
 a Frisbee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW to solve sleep issues and power management issues is a nightmare that requires hours of figuring out which processes are scheduled in task scheduler. or what device is doing what.</p>

            <p>Well I'm now using it on my (accursed) SP2 running Win 10. Same problem as on 8.1 but slightly less frequent. Of course the bl00dy SP2 now exhibits some odd instability under W10. What else did I expect?</p>
<p>All of which is connected, I believe, to the wireless hardware/firmware in this lump. Currently it often thinks that there's no internet connection - reloading the browser page sorts this first time - usually. There's other stuff too but MS didn't care about
 these problems even when the SP2 was newly released; by now they couldn't give a monkey's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never again ANY Microsoft hardware!</p>

            <p>Credits are deposited by the following 15th or 30th of the month after you have at least 5,000 pending. So if you get to 5,000 between the 1st and 15th, they are deposited at the end of the month. If you get to 5,000 between the 15th and 30th, they are deposited by the 15th of the next month. So if you only got there 3 days ago, they'll be deposited in June. .</p>

            <p>I've had 10,000+ since the beginning of May and now I have 16,000+ and it still hasn't been credited to my account. And now Microsoft support tells me because I got suspended from Microsoft rewards, which was a year ago, for having 3 accounts and I will now be suspended from xbox live rewards which I've a part of since close to its beginning and haven't broke any of there rules. I didn't think was a crime because unfortunately I didn't read the terms and conditions and I thought having multiple accounts would benefit both of us, they'd get more accounts on bing searching, which is the only reason they do it and thats to reel you in to use bing and not google or anny other search engine. I've still been getting my rewards from xbox live rewards but now I'll lose it when they merge and I doh't know if I'll get my remaining 16,000+ credits deposited that I've earned before the merger, which is stupid and f-ed up because I'm getting punished on my xbox live rewards for something that had nothing to

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p>Video adapter problems are the most common cause of this issue. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
1. W<span>hich antivirus application are you using?</span>
<p>2. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<b><br />

    <title>Windows media player won&#39;t recognize DVDs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mateomarley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows media player won&#39;t recognize DVDs</h2>
                    My media player can read and play CDs an CD-ROMs, but when I insert a DVD, nothing happens. Furthermore, I recently installed AnyDVD and CloneDVD2 software to burn DVDs, and would like to know if this new software is causing the problem. When I insert
 a DVD, the AnyDVD does not scan it and the Windows Media Player will not play it (or recognize it in the DVD drive). And When I try to clone it using CloneDVD2, the dialog box says "unable to read video files" and "the device is not ready." I've been reviewing
 the literature about decoders and drivers, but it"s all greek to me.&nbsp;My PC apparently already has the necessary software installed to perform these tasks (ie. decoders and drvers), as I have checked for these programs&gt; Please help.<br />

    <title>Any word from Microsoft on the HORRIBLE wallpaper compression issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc-andre kelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any word from Microsoft on the HORRIBLE wallpaper compression issues in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I realize this sort of discussion/question has come up here a couple of times and on many different help forums; but I can't help but create a new one. This is really something annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />
==<br />
<strong><u>MICROSOFT! Will you PLEASE hear out your faithful customers and get RID of the compression issues plaguing our modern desktops!?</u></strong><br />
==</p>
<p><br />
<br />
I realize Microsoft is maybe trying to streamline it's OS to work on many platforms (Desktops, Tablets, Phones, etc..) and the effort is greatly appreciate as it saves a lot of time on some things. Since Windows 7,&nbsp;I really LOVE the
<u>feature of having the Wallpapers change every so many seconds/minutes</u>. BEST feature ever in my opinion. I can actually use my monitor as part of an artistic showcase, looks clean and modern.<br />
<br />
While I could maybe see the compression becoming an advantage on low-power platforms, many of us use normal desktop computers that can handle JPEG's WITHOUT compression.<br />
<br />
I mean, Windows XP could properly display the same image and not compress it; yet our PC's have only gotten more powerful and quicker at multi-tasking since Windows XP. Our monitors have also gone up in quality and sharpness.&nbsp;Why should we have to make do with
 cheap quality compressed images???<br />
<br />
I regularly convert my photography to the proper size to be displayed on my monitor, and it is EXTREMELY irritating to see the quality degrade THAT badly.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
An example of the terrible&nbsp;compression Windows 8 imposes on wallpapers:<br />
<br />
(a 100% crop from the same 1920x1080 picture&nbsp;to show the compression artifacts)<br />
On the Left: the picture set as a wallpaper<br />
On the Right: the same picture viewed at 100% in Picture Viewer or any other picture software<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05377f97-13ff-41fe-9119-38d1110af3e6" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time; and every effort into fixing this is appreciated. I do not want to come through as "blasting" or "flaming" Microsoft here, just voicing an honest opinion many have been having and many are hoping gets resolved.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Now that we're clear that there's no word from Microsoft here and there probably will not be because that's not really how things function,&nbsp;you and I at the least can have a polite and friendly conversation about the subject without regards to anything more

</p>
<p>What pixel format are you using?&nbsp; Generally the desktop uses 24bpp RGB, and should add color correction if available as specified.&nbsp; Without a sample image to examine it's hard to speak to this.&nbsp; You mention that you're using the same resolution for your
 wallpaper as is set for your monitor, which is a good plan.&nbsp; What PPI are you using?</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate your interest in the matter.<br />
<br />
I have a little trouble explaining things clearly, and I will appreciate your patience. I also want polite and friendly conversations, my apologies if my topic came off aggressive in any way. I can lack tact, but I do not do it on purpose.
<br />
<br />
Ok, so to get to your questions:<br />
<br />
<u>What pixel format are you using?</u><br />
<br />
My DSLR camera captures images in 24bit format. I take my photos in RAW formats and sometimes RAW+ (A RAW + a JPEG Highest Quality). These photos are 14.6 Megapixels in size (4672x3104).
<br />
<br />
Using Silkypix (Photography development software) or Photoshop CS3, I crop my pictures to a 16:9 ratio, then I downsize my pictures to a 1920x1080 resolution. They are very sharp and nice.<br />
<br />
I have spoken to a graphic designer friend, and have checked to make sure the pictures are all RGB and 24 bit. They all are by default, and I have never changed it. I have also tried changing my color profiles, etc.. put everything back to normal (default settings
 as they were good).<br />
<br />
Here is an example of a picture I have Processed:<br />
<a href="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/12225164825_bb17e12911_o_d.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2880/12225164825_bb17e12911_o_d.jpg</a><br />
<br />
As you'll notice, viewed at a 100% zoom level (in Microsoft Picture Viewer or any other viewer) the quality is pretty fine, the lines are sharp and the colors nice. But then try setting it as a wallpaper.<br />
<br />
I believe you know what I am talking about anyways. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p><u>&nbsp;What PPI are you using?<br />
</u><br />
What puzzles me is that the PPI doesn't seem to change much either. I have used all these different PPI's: 72, 96, 150, 300, 600.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have even saved the picture as a 16bitt TIFF which is supposedly the largest possible format, and loses no information or any quality as editing is done on the photo. Even with a 53MB Tiff file set as a desktop background, the pictures lose their sharpness
 and the edges get 'blurred' out with artifacts.<br />
<br />
I have also done the test&nbsp;with&nbsp;different computers and devices; ranging from my Windows 8 Phone, an Ipad, and these PC's:&nbsp;2x Windows XP SP3, 3x&nbsp;Windows 7 x64&nbsp;and my Windows 8.1 Pro x64.<br />
<br />
The result was that (with THE same picture I have provided you the link with - 1920x1080) with Windows XP and the Ipad, my picture set as a wallpaper would lose no quality, sharpness, colors, etc.. The Windows 7 PC's, my Windows Phone 8 and Windows 8 PC all
 suffered from the loss of quality when the picture was set as a Wallpaper.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
If&nbsp;I set 1 picture as a wallpaper for a long time; I would def keep the suggested "fix". But the problem is I set my computer as a showcase, and I can have a whole lot of pictures in random rotation. I often add and change them as well. I've been developing
 my photos in JPEG's for years as that's the easier format to provide to users online, or e-mail to contacts.<br />
<br />
And now, to make sure that the issue isn't related to the WAY I process my photos (which it isn't because I would notice it in the Picture Viewer), you can take ANY picture from the&nbsp;web (that is originally the same native resolution as your monitor), set it
 as a desktop; and notice the loss of quality around the edges, 'artifacting', etc..<br />
<br />
Again, I do not want to come across as rude or insulting, it is not my intent. But I do not really know why the latest evolutions of Windows need to provide compression to images set as backgrounds.
<u>Is it because having many images in rotation is too intense on the system?</u> Or
<u>is it to make sure the OS runs stable on ALL platforms, including the ones that are much weaker in performance?<br />
<br />
</u>I mean, the point of Microsoft's recent activities <strong>seems</strong> to be about simplifying things for the end-user; but having to 'hack' the system to simply provide a compression-free background picture seems a little harsh on the user, it is my
 opinion. Please do not view this as an "attack" haha ;)<br />
<br />
But I must also say that I have found out that by using PNG's, Windows does NOT compress the picture, and it appears perfect as a background. But the issue with that is imply a matter of time, I have thousands of pictures I would have to re-develop into PNG's,
 and simply developing photos is a long process, can take about 25 minutes or more for 1 picture alone. ..and now that all my pictures have always been processed into JPEG's since I've used Windows XP... *sigh*<br />
<br />
..and the fact that the same picture, a 600KB JPEG is about a 7MB PNG.. having thousands of those.. well yeah.<br />
<br />
I just figured newer OS's would have even more polish than older ones, as hardware and technology evolves. I have been enjoying Windows 8.1 a lot, everything is really polish, sleek and fluid, just like on my W8 phone. Everyone has also been commenting positive
 stuff when they see it and see how the OS works.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I appreciate your interest in the matter, I realize the answer is probably as simple as: "well use PNG's" but I also believe you see why having the compression of wallpapers removed&nbsp;would be recommended as well. I mean, at the moment,&nbsp;any 1920x1080
 wallpaper is uglier than the actual picture.<br />

<p>Just to verify, when you open up your original image and the TranscodedWallpaper image directly in Your Favorite App(TM) (I used Paint.NET here), you're seeing a regression in quality?&nbsp; I don't see that on my system.&nbsp; I'd be interested in you clarifying

            <blockquote>
<p>Just to step back one minor bit: there is no deliberate extra compression nor downgrading going on here.&nbsp; The system does need to import/re-export the file, but that's when that is done as much fidelity is kept as possible.&nbsp; If you are seeing quality decrease,
 that's interesting and at face value probably is not intentional.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
It feels rather deliberate from the OS, as&nbsp;the transcoded file size&nbsp;would lead to believe otherwise; it is reduced to approximately a 1/3 of the image being used. That's over 500 KB - 1 MB of lost image data! And that is also regardless of the file type; JPEG,
 TIFF, PNG are all affected likewise. Actually the bigger the file, the more the loss.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My images are already properly compressed as to limit the loss of quality and stay as small as possible. The original&nbsp;image file before being developed, is approximately 14-16&nbsp;MB in size, once I've worked it all up, I can get s 1920x1080&nbsp;as small as 600
 KB -&nbsp;1.5 MB in&nbsp;JPEG format&nbsp;with no visual loss of quality (any more and you would start seeing it). So that same image being compressed to a third of it's size&nbsp;is really drastic!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A lot of sharpness is lost, smudging appears around the edges and especially&nbsp;where colors clash. In this case, I am using a red car hood as my example, simply because it is clearly visible. It is less visible in more neutral colors, like grey, black, etc..
 but nonetheless the issue is pretty much visible on ANY picture set as a background image.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this issue affects ONLY the&nbsp;background wallpapers&nbsp;and the lock screen picture. When images are viewed ANYWHERE ELSE; Windows picture viewer, Photoshop, Lightroom, Paint, etc.. at 100% zoom level, they all look fabulous - the way they are supposed
 to.<br />

            <p>Ooookay.&nbsp; Part of my confusion here stems from this being a fairly "old" change that dates back to ~2008 or so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes, the current final answer here is to use PNGs if you want this to be seamless.&nbsp; That PNG path was explicitly added in Windows 8 for this exact purpose.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The exact code path you're going through does run through a probably needless-for-your-exact-usage quality shift during import.&nbsp; That code path deliberately skips that step for PNG files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'll flag this for review in the future.&nbsp; There may be some further optimization here to make power users such as yourself happier while still being attentive to the performance needs of the desktop.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thanks for bringing this up.</p>

Even if it's a "hack", it would be nice to have the option of disabling JPEG compression for desktop wallpapers (not for a single picture, but for all the wallpapers that are in sequence/rotation).

            I too wonder why MS decided to compress wallpapers in Windows 8. It wasn't like this in Windows 7. I have been using Windows 8 since it was RTM and this really bother me. Every time when I thought an update was going to fix it, I have been disappointed.<br />

<p>They can, but the import (and re-imports where needed)&nbsp;needs to be done at near-instantaneous real-time on all systems, not just high-end PCs or PCs not doing anything else.&nbsp; It's a tricky spot in the code.&nbsp; I'm aware of it.&nbsp; The current design is well-justified
 given the precise implementation/limitations. I unfortunately cannot say, "well my friend Marc-Andre is right: let's simply unbound this" without breaking a lot of things that need to not be broken.&nbsp; There may be a better path we can build here (I can say
 "my friend Marc-Andre brings up an excellent point"), but the current behavior is well-justified and any future changes would absolutely need to bear in mind the same need for instant speed imports.&nbsp; It's a complicated and interesting area. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can avoid this behavior by using PNGs. :)</p>

            <p>I don't understand?? Why is import working on Win7 but not Win8? I don't believe that importing
<strong>JPEGs</strong> are that heavy to the system, but not PNGs. It's just an image. A pre-compressed one. This sounds like an excuse to me.<br />

<p>I have a Plex Media Server on my PC which hosts Movies and TV shows, I access the over my network with the Xbox One Media Player app (not the Plex app).</p>
<p>Movies are on drive d: and TV Shows are on drive e:</p>
<p>This has worked flawlessly for the last year when yesterday it movies stopped working. TV shows still work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can still run the movies just fine from the PC but when I to Xbox One Media Player app &gt; Plex Media Server &gt; Video &gt; Movies &gt; All movies; I get the error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"No access to this location. Before you can play items in this location, you must first have permission to access it"</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>TV shows work as normal, only movies are effected.</p>

<p>Movies work just fine when playing them on the PC itself.</p>

<p>Currently running NXOE, but it was working fine a few days ago.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

                    Hi, i posted a similar question, but perhaps you are not saved. ... I propose again a surface rt bought on ebay, the previous owner has set a bitlocker key by mistake and there is no way to recover it because he does not remember any access data ... the
 data on the surface does not affect me in any way . I'd want is you can take it to factory conditions. all recovery attempts, even with recovery usb properly created and started always gives me the same problem "impossible to complete the rispritino". I also
 started from cmd diskpart command and tried to delete partitions and format the disk but with no success. is there any other way that I have not tried? Sorry for my English but i have used a google translate... any advice can be helpful ... thanks to all

<br />
<br />You probably need to install the latest available audio drivers and then reset up Cortana (Mic). Cortana Settings - Start - Settings - Cortana - Mic.
<br />
<br />Fix common sound problems &lt;-- check this
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/f...</a> 
<br />
<br />No sound in Windows - Use the troubleshooters - Start - Settings - Update and Security - Troubleshoot --&gt; "Playing Audio" &amp; "Hardware &amp; Devices"&amp; "Recording Audio".
<br />
<br /> ----
<br />
<br />Check to see if you have the latest available driver. Download and install the latest driver. If you have the latest driver re-install the same one.
<br />
<br />How to manually install drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker, as fallbacks, and the Device Maker's for which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Sound - write down he make and complete model of your sound adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Display Adapters, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check in Device Manager to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<p>The problem is not related to sound issues. The problem is solely with Cortana. Still I have taken your recommendations to heart and followed through with them. However, there has been no change. Cortana will respond in text, but will not talk.</p>

<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)

<p>Hi Yousef,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Screen shake can be caused by hardware issues. What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far? Have you tried to do a 2-button shutdown? If not, you might want to perform the steps suggested by Hawkie KB on this

<br />
Until you can determine what the "real" problem is with your hardware, you can disable the pop up message by making a registry adjustment.<br />
<br />
Before making registry changes, backup your registry with this popular free and easy to use tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
regedit<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the registry editor and navigate to the following key:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows<br />
<br />
On the right hand pane, check the value of the ErrorMode parameter.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If the ErrorMode parameter is set to 0, double click ErrorMode and change the value to 2 (2 = disabled).<br />
<br />
Click OK to save the changes, then click File, Exit to close the registry editor.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and check things now.<br />
<br />
Setting the ErrorMode parameter to 2 stops the pop up message but will still log any hard errors to the Event Viewer log.<br />

            Thanks guys - I had moved this machine to my son's bedroom and a few bits of extra software he needed had been downloaded.<br />
<br />
I did a system restore to a few days ago and it got rid of the problem. I'll have to monitor what software he downloads a bit more carefully.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway folks!<br />

<p>Is there anyway to reduce the size of this folder without using cleanupmgr, any vista tools ect as this has all been tried by us on countless occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Network Adapter not working after installing new GPU</h2>
                    <p>I changed my GPU yesterday and then I reinstalled my Windows. I noticed I didn't have any connection even with the cable plugged. I used my phone for tethering and got the drivers, believing just that the drivers were not installed. Nothing changed. I chose
 to reinstall my windows again, but nothing changed. In Device manager my network adapter is not visible. I tried showing hidden devices, but nothing changed. I tried going into BIOS to turn in on manually but it was already enabled. I changed the cable but
 nothing changed. The green lights do not show up as they used to. I use a newer motherboard with an integrated adapter. What can I do to get myself internet through cable again?</p>

<h2>            Printer prints in color even when I select B&#38;W</h2>
                    Through the Windows printer dialogue that appears whenever I want to print something, I make sure that the color chosen is "Black and white". But the pages still come out in color anyway.

<p>Hi Killian,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the possible reasons why the printer is printing in color even though it was set to black and white is due to an incorrect printer configuration.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your printer?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any recent changes before you encountered this issue?</span></li><li><span>What is the build and version of Windows are you using? To check the version of your Windows, type
<strong>winver </strong>in the <strong>Search</strong> box and send us a screenshot of the information window.</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to resolve your concern?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to your response.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<ul>
<li>It's an HP Officejet J3600 (the age of this printer may in and of itself be the problem)</li><li>No hardware changes, and no major software changes besides regular Windows updates</li><li>Version 1703 (Build 15063.483)</li><li>Nothing past the "Run the Troubleshooter" in the Printers &amp; Scanners page of the CP<br />
</li></ul>
<p>However, on that last point, I clicked on the name of my printer on that control panel page, then clicked Manage. Under the Printing Preferences window accessed from the following page, I saw that the color settings was set to color. I set it to grayscale,
 and now it prints in B&amp;W like I want it to. However, this just means that Windows' own printer settings are superseding whatever settings I choose in the print dialogues in Chrome or Adobe or whatever else. So I have to go&nbsp;<em>back</em> to that settings page
 and switch it back to color if I want color, instead of being able to do it conveniently from a program's native print dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, the issue is at least mostly-resolved.<br />

<h2>            windows 8 apps store not working</h2>
                    I cannot connect to the window 8 app store. I get a error message of server down or connection lost. I just bought my new laptop, it is fresh out of the box. The custom install apps work but they all need to be updated, which I can't do because the app
 store isn't working. I have tried going threw internet explore @ Microsoft.com and still can't get to the store.

<br />
<br />Always Allowed: Replacing a Motherboard Because It’s Broken
<br />Never Allowed: Moving a Preinstalled License to a New PC
<br />Always Allowed: Moving a “Full Version” or “Retail” License to a New PC
<br />Maybe Allowed: Moving an “OEM” or “System Builder” License to a New PC
<br />Never Allowed: Moving a Windows 10 Upgrade “Digital Entitlement” to a New PC

<h2>            App Store and PC Settings not opening on Windows 8</h2>
                    <div>Hi All,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've just bought an HP Envy machine with pre-installed Windows 8 and my app store and PC Settings wouldn't open. I've tried almost every method explained online but nothing seems to be working. The App Store and the PC Settings window opens up for a second
 and then vanishes, and I'm left at the Start Menu!!! I've noticed quite a few people had this trouble but still there wasn't any certain fix for it and it was more like a hit-and-try thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These are the things that I've tried so far:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. App troubleshooter for Windows</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. SFC scan</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. wereset.exe</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. Updating all the softwares (specifically graphics)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. Updating the windows and anti-virus (I'm using a trial version of Norton Security that came with the PC with a 60 days subscription)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6. System restore to a previous level&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>7. Undo the changes to registry that I did to fix another problem</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>8. Did a "Clean Boot", i.e. deactivated all the start-up and task manager items before booting up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you have any different method, most preferable a certain fix, please do comment!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to refresh the computer and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what will happen when you refresh your PC:</p>
<p><br />
· Your files and personalization settings won't change.</p>
<p>· Your PC settings will be changed back to their defaults. </p>
<p>· Apps from Windows Store will be kept. </p>
<p>· Apps you installed from discs or websites will be removed.</p>
<p>· A list of removed apps will be saved on your desktop.</p>
