    <title>Recommended Microphones that work well with Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recommended Microphones that work well with Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I understand using Hey Cortana works only as great as the microphone you are using.&nbsp; Microsoft is recommending a "good" microphone.</p>
<p>Can anyone recommend some good quality desktop microphones that are working well with Cortana</p>
<p>and the "hey Cortana" feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>If your regular microphone works with Cortana when you press the mic button, then it should also work with Hey Cortana, there is no special microphone for Hey Cortana, just make sure that your mic is in a good clear not noisy area, and that you have gone
 through the voice training, and you should be good. </p>

<p>This may be the case Janet but my Windows 10 install and my old system and brand new both using the same webcam definitely don't like something about it.&nbsp; It seems to work ok... ISH (like Cortana a lot for what and when my mike does work with it).. but all
 the little probs I DO have I keep wondering if it's the mike because Windows literally tells me the microphone I am trying to use was not designed for use with Cortana and the function may suffer because of that... :/<br />
<br />
Any ideas like a list of supported microphones or anything? (btw the brand new system is literally fresh out of the box and upgraded from Windows 8.1 last night 9/15/2015).</p>

<p>Been playing and really like the game.&nbsp; (Really dislike the "new" forum) Anyway, after the begining scene when it starts where I'm on a truck, it immediately stops with a red screen saying objective failed.&nbsp; I mean like one second after I start.&nbsp; I think
 it's glitched but can't seem to get around it.</p>
<p>Anyone help?</p>

<p>Sounds as though it is glitched for you. &nbsp;You can try installing the game to your hard drive, and/or clearing your hard drive cache. &nbsp;Would also be worth it to perhaps try to join a game with someone in the same spot, or a previous area and see if you can
 get through it there. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Computer wont connect to internet&#63;</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried looking through the forums to solve my issue, but I can't seem to find anything with my exact issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a custom built computer, it's an older computer, about 4 or 5 years old now. &nbsp;It has Windows XP.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have never had any issues with this computer till now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I used a company called BBTELL as an internet provider for a couple years, I connected my computer to the internet via ethernet cable with no issues. &nbsp; I recently just moved and now have ComCast as my internet provider. &nbsp;I'm currently using their router/modem
 hybrids. &nbsp;I connected my computer via ethernet to the modem just like I normally do and it's getting no internet, even the modem says there's nothing connected to it. &nbsp; Just to make sure it wasn't the modem or ethernet, I bought a new ethernet cable, plugged
 it up and nothing. &nbsp; I took my laptop, plugged it directly to the ethernet cable on the same port and it had internet. The light on the back of the modem lit up as well detecting a connection. &nbsp;I did call my ISP and they don't know what to do to help me, I
 even called Microsoft and they refuse to help me since I have windows XP. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So basically the modem works just fine, nothing wrong with it. &nbsp;My laptop can connect via ethernet to it and have internet, but my desktop computer can't seem to connect to it. &nbsp; My desktop does not have the option for wifi.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what I've tried is uninstalling the TCP/IP and reinstalling it. &nbsp;Didn't work.&nbsp;<br />
Tried using the cmd prompts to refresh the IP and that didn't work. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I keep getting error when I try and refresh the IP, stating that the media is disconnected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I'm at a loss at what to do now. &nbsp;If anyone has any ideas on what I should do, it would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>This sure sounds like your Ethernet adapter has died.&nbsp; Or perhaps, if the adapter is not integrated into your motherboard, the card loosened and is no longer connecting properly to the motherboard.&nbsp; Or the female RJ-45 connector on your adapter has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the Ethernet adapter present in Device Manager with no error indication?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try looking in the BIOS configuration to see if somehow the Ethernet adapter has been disabled.</p>

</p><p>Although some manufacturers of network interface cards do have diagnostic routines available, it's probably easier to just swap in a new NIC.&nbsp; You can buy one for less than $30 (some a lot less):&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect Surface to wifi</h2>
                    <p>Hi tbere,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own a Microsoft Windows Surface RT. &nbsp;I am unable to connect to any wifi on it. &nbsp;The message "Limited availability" keeps showing. &nbsp;There is no issue with my wifi as I can connect my phone to the network. &nbsp;The "limited" message appears for every wifi network
 that I try to connect my Surface to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Cathal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Limited availability may appear if you have incorrect time and date. Check and, if needed, correct your date and time settings on your Surface. Here’s how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Start Windows logo, and select Settings &gt; Time &amp; language.<br />
Step 2: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make sure the info is correct or make changes as necessary.<br />
Step 3: &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Try to connect to your Wi-Fi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can’t connect to internet, click <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15287/windows-why-can-not-get-connected" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and follow the steps listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update, and let us know if you encounter any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Display Adapter</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a wireless display adapter from Best Buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They assured me when I bought this, that I could use it to send my screen from any compatible device running windows 8.1 or better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was not the case it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told after I called them back, that the computer I was using, Windows 8.1 pro, had to have a wireless network adapter. &nbsp;I had a belkin that I used for my laptop sitting in a drawer, I plugged it in, have great wireless access, but still when I go to
 the charm bar and click on devices&gt;project, there is no way to add a wireless item there. &nbsp;The only thing that is available is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC SCREEN ONLY</p>
<p>DUPLICATE</p>
<p>EXTEND</p>
<p>SECOND SCREEN ONLY</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how does this work or does it? &nbsp;What am I missing?</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Settings won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Installed Win 10. Did lots and lots of steps to set up all the details ... unfortunately nothing is at it seems ... thought i set up several programs/apps only to "find" error messages ... these were only "found" when I went "exploring" by trying clicking
 on different icons/links ... so now nothing is linked/synced as it appeared they would be (ie phone photos not synced to pc)<br />
Cortana was set up, so I thought ... some places it says it's set up, others say not so! Tells me to turn on LOCATION in SETTINGS. However SETTINGS doesn't work AT ALL. Click on it ... something flashes and then NOTHING. Need help getting SETTINGS to open up
 so I can try to get apps/programs synced and working. Thanks.</p>

    <title>How To Do a Clean Install of Windows 10 Without Downloading Twice&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ho3n3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Do a Clean Install of Windows 10 Without Downloading Twice&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1. I want to download the ISO, format my PC and install Windows 10 on a clean SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently I have to download Windows 10 via Windows Update, activate it on my PC, and then it gets activated online and it registers my hardware, and only then can I do a clean install, apparently. People have told me that this is the only way. But this
 sounds ridiculous, so I'm asking here to get a correct answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have 2mb/s (200kB/s) internet at the best of times, that's when it's not shaped, so it will take hours to just update, and then I have to also download an ISO to make a USB flash drive in order to do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What about capped users? Downloading the same thing twice isn't something that is high on such a user's priority list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeping in mind that Microsoft obviously must have thought about eventualities like the above as you're a relatively bright bunch, I come here to ask: how do I do a clean install of Windows 10, after formatting my Windows 8.1 PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            one download. Download the media creation tool, have it make a bootable usb or dvd. You then start setup from within windows. This will upgrade windows to win 10. Then after you are sure it is activated you can do a clean install by booting from the usb
 stick or the dvd.<br />

    <title>Windows Photos Export Video Error&#58; 0x887a0005 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> futurelights  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Photos Export Video Error&#58; 0x887a0005</h2>
                    I created a video using Windows 10 Photo App. While using it, it was really slow and glitched a ton. For example, I could only play the video 3/4 of the way before it would stop and go into an infinite loop of waiting. I'd then have to restart the photo
 app and skip a couple of seconds to continue watching it. It was not that my PC could not handle it, but something else. When I finally was able to finish it, I tried exporting it but got an error (0x887a0005). I've read just about every answer on this site.
 I've tried looking for Windows Essential Program (Which I think is for the old Movie Maker, but it had the same error message so I still tried it) under Programs and Features to reset. I've tried install and running the Windows App Store troubleshooter which
 sadly did not fix the issue. Is there anything else I can try?

            Hi FL.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm sorry you're experiencing this on something as involved as a video project.  I've seen several similar posts recently.  Here are a couple of good guides in case they can help:
<br /><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-edit-videos-using-the-free-microsoft-windows-10-photos-app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-edi...</a>
<br /><a href="https://turbofuture.com/graphic-design-video/Free-Windows-10-Video-Editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://turbofuture.com/graphic-design-video/Fr...</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd recommend is to try out some of the other free video editors or movie makers so you have alternatives and aren't forced to rely on one new and possibly less stable app:
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-video-editing-software-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/best-video-editi...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-windows-movie-maker-alternative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />To try to fix Photos app Reset and Repair Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try re-registering the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  There are improvements in Photos app in Version 1903 so I would do this without hesitation.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Also:<br />
Reboot to Safe Mode:<br />
During the inital boot (after you first power up the computer) repeatedly press the F8 key multiple times (after the startup logo and before Windows 7 starts loading).&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be at least 2 user accounts listed on the Safe Mode screen, one will be the account name you created plus a second user account named 'Administrator' which is the defualt/built-in Administrator account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally the 'Administrator' account has no password (blank). Try to logon using the built in 'Administrator' account.</p>
<p>Now click 'Start/Control Panel/User Accounts' and&nbsp;create&nbsp;a new account and&nbsp;password.&nbsp;<br />
Finally reboot and logon using your new&nbsp;account name.</p>

You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup.<br />

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

            Hi Eugene.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a .pdf conversion "printer" which will save files in .pdf format built into the printers list in Windows 10.  
<br />
<br />No matter what format the file is in, it will save the file as .pdf format.
<br />
<br />See more here:  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/print-to-pdf-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/print-to-pdf-in-win...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Microsoft Windows 7 FreeCell Solitaire no longer keeps accurate tally - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macdent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Windows 7 FreeCell Solitaire no longer keeps accurate tally of won&#47;lost games</h2>
                    <p>I have been playing FreeCell for a long time, building up a high percentage of wins over losses.&nbsp; Recently that percentage has started to drop for an unknown reason.&nbsp; I recently reset my score tally to zero, played one game and won and had a percentage of
 100%.&nbsp; The next day, I played a second game, won, and my percentage dropped to 66%.&nbsp; It had tallied 3 games played.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a stupid quirk to be irritated by a game tally, but this didn't happen before.&nbsp; All I can attribute it to is a saved game that I cannot get rid of.&nbsp; Each time I start FreeCell, I get the screen that asks if I want to continue a previously saved game.&nbsp;
 It is a game that I lost some time ago, but I cannot delete it.&nbsp; I think that, each time I start, when I select "No" to not continue that saved game, it counts as a loss.&nbsp; But I can't find a way to delete that game!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for this world-shattering problem?</p>

<p><span>Let’s put the computer in clean boot state and check if any third-party program is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you

            <p>Depends on what you have installed on your PC program wise.</p>

                    <p>I have a brand new laptop running Windows 10.&nbsp; I went to download Skype from Skype.&nbsp; When I tried to install it, I got an error message, telling me that for the "best skype experience" I needed to download/install from the Windows store.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I'll play
 Microsoft's silly game.&nbsp; I went to the store.&nbsp; Downloaded from there.&nbsp; GOT THE SAME ERROR MESSAGE.&nbsp; I went back to the store yet again.&nbsp; This time Microsoft refused to download anything, telling me I "already downed Skype."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot not fathom how this adds up to the "best skype experience."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, of course,&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft support is its usual hopeless self.&nbsp; I've been on hold for Chat for what feels like forever.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Luis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with console being stolen. You can log into the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account website</a>. Once logged in go to&nbsp; recent activity. If they have turned the console on at another location it will show here, the IP will also show. Unfortunately, support will not be able to provide this information due to they are unable to see it.
 If they never turn the console on, there will not be an IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Microsoft store wont even attempt to install apps.... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc dekker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft store wont even attempt to install apps....</h2>
                    I've been dealing with the oh so fun Microsoft store for a couple days now. This is actually my second issue in less the a year, be it the first was my fault. When Forza apex came out my store wouldn't even open for me, long story short, because I have
 changed the default install location, this broke my windows store. Runing though all the repair steps, I got the windows store to open but the downloads would not start, so I had to do a clean install. Which fixed it and the update gave the option to install
 apps to other drives. So no more issues, Or was it.....<br />
<br />
<br />
And yet again, I try to install forza 7 demo this time and nothing works again. I almost never ever touch the Microsoft store, so I didn't know what I could have done this time. So I went though the motions again. Also searching for the latest info for the
 current store bulid on top of my pervious knowledge.<br />
<br />
I have done everything I could find and from WSReset to reinstalling the store and app with files from online and on the iso, to DSM and chkdsk and nothing seemed to work. So I ended up doing an repair install. This fixed my Microsoft store not opening and
 but none of the apps would download. So I repeated a bunch of the steps and and reinstalling the store and base apps with power shell again made the apps begin to download and update ACCEPT FORZA! So I tired on my sisters win 10 same build and everything and
 it works fine. So then I tired some other apps. I figured out that anything that brings up the pop up dialog to install to a different drive will not download. But the anything that would automatically select to download to my C drive (OS) downloaded and worked.
 So I thought I could give fiddler a try and download the package and manually install it. When I download the apps that will automatically start, I can see the HTTPS links in fiddler, but whenever I have to choose the install location, it seems like the store
 wont connect and download, fiddler just shows the Session was aborted by the client, fiddler or the server error.<br />
<br />
So to me it seems like it could be one of two things, either Microsoft store doesn't know where to install the app data and it doesn't even try to create anything or it is somehow not connecting to the servers after option to choose install location.<br />
<br />
I have seen this issue pop up at least a few times in most forum posts or question sites while searching in google, it just never the original posters problem. If you have this problem please mark this useful so we can all resolve this!! I can provide any information
 as necessary, as I haven't been very specific, but I've been through countless steps with some success at partially repairing the store.

            Well I figured out what my issue was!!!<br />
<br />
I guess when I had installed all the default app with powershell the xbox app did not get installed properly.<br />
I had a hunch it was something related to the xbox services due to these app being the biggest culprit.&nbsp; Even though the xbox app ran perfectly fine on my computer as it had seemed. I have found a green square close the bottom of the screen with the only info
 of Microsoft Corporation in light grey. Clicking on the app gave the Move/Uninstall options and clicking advanced gave no valid information (0 byte storage) and rest did nothing. I was able to uninstall it and what do you know... No more xbox app. I reinstalled
 the xbox app from the store, and restarted my computer.<br />
<br />
Everything now works as intended!!! All it was was the xbox app!!!<br />
I take it and xbox game portion of the windows app was corrupted and couldn't could to the xbox servers. (What I was seeing in fiddler)

    <title>Auto-Scrolling on Mouse and Keyboard Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle926  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-Scrolling on Mouse and Keyboard Center</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a question in regards to the Mouse and Keyboard Center that downloaded over Intellipoint automatically. I use AutoCAD on a regular basis, and when Intellipoint was installed I had my mouse wheel button set to Auto-Scroll (the function where
 you click in the mouse wheel and it allows&nbsp;you to scroll by moving the mouse)&nbsp;by default. When I updated to the&nbsp;Mouse and Keyboard Center, this feature was changed, and it does not appear to be in the list of functions that I can select for any mouse button.
 Is there a way to enable Auto-scroll without uninstalling the Mouse and Keyboard Center and reinstalling Intellitype?</p>

            Hello Roberle6,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;To make a long answer short, yes you can. &nbsp;However, keep these things in mind.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you are downloading Windows 7 to your XP machine. &nbsp;It will be much faster to download to a system drive rather than a USB. &nbsp;Once the file is downloaded to a system drive you can burn to DVD or copy to USB. &nbsp;If you are wanting to burn Windows 7 to
 a DVD, it would be best to make a ".iso" of the files. &nbsp;For more information on how to create a .iso just perform a web search for "how to create an iso". &nbsp;You will find numerous free tools that can do this function for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let us know if this did or didn't answer your question completely.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>
