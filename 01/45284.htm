<h2>            Recording Skype to Phone call does not give me option to Record Call - how do I record calls&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I see the instructions for Recording Call online, but it isn't what I see when I call with Scype. There's supposed to be the "+" sign, More Options, and the only option is Hold Call. Nothing else. No Record Call option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So. How do I get the Record Call option to show up. Windows 8.1. Desktop. Latest Skype. Paid US$10.00 credit (160 minutes?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype customer support is non-existence, isn't it? Totally relies on the community. :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 automatic update - In the name of GOD, please stop automatic update feature</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell 3000 series laptop which i used only for browsing and some document writing. it came with windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>this stupid automatic update in windows 10 makes my laptop very slow during update and that irritates my to my death. I do not want these fancy thing that windows is trying to update, i am a home user and just use laptop for browsing etc. Here are some factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Why do you release update so often. in Feb 2019 itself - there are 5 updates. why do you need to release so often, can you not release once a month or quarter...</p>
<p>2) update runs in back-end and it fails if laptop is re-started and then it starts over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) makes laptop super slow, hangs typing, scrolling etc. so irritating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get suffer at least&nbsp; 4-5 times for few hours every month for this useless, pathetic, stupid update that i do not need for anything. I searched internet for hours and days to find out a way to stop automatic update but could not get any credible way so
 i am left with either getting irritated now and then or get rid of windows and move to mac.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My humble request to microsoft to give control to end user to decide when to update at least for few times and for home users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further on this - I left my laptop on overnight after kick starting the update process and disabled any sleep options - but update would not finish. There was a feb update that failed atleast 10+ times on my laptop. Then i had to use the update troubleshooter
 to find the issue and fix it. Database of update was corrupted. It happens quite often - update keeps failing all the times. I never have my laptop upto date after i purchased 5-6 months ago. i am so frustrated.
</p>
<p>Microsoft - why do I need to invest so much of my time in fixing your problem - if you have any moral and ethics left in you as a company please do something about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foe example this KB4489868 update has failed 7 times in march 2019. I have run troubleshooter once but no luck this time.&nbsp; Similarly there was an update in feb that failed many time as i have noted in my previous laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft team - please do something abt it. I have been using windows since 2001 and never been so irritated. Can you give me licensed version of Windows 7 that is far more stable.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Mic Boost for USB microphones</h2>
                    How do you enable microphone boost for USB microphones?<br />
all microphones that go in the 3.5mm plug have microphone boost option but my USB microphone doesn't get the microphone boost option.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway for my to boost my USB mic?

            I have a Creative Tactic 3D Sigma headset. which attaches via USB. it comes with own driver, no mic boost in Creative software
<div><br />
First, those instructions does not seem like it's for windows 7, I've seen those exact instructions everywhere</div>
<div><br />
Second, what you said up there is pretty much the basic, most obvious way to look for mic boost. It's not there. it's empty. I've tried. There is a volume slider for 0-100 but it does not have the 0-30 boost that can be found when i plug into a 3.5mm plug.&nbsp;</div>

yes...those instructions are for most including your operating system, sound settings and options haven't changed much over the years.<br />
Now, does you sound card have it's own software? Not driver, but software.<br />
When you plug in the mic do you see any response from the meter in settings?<br />

 I cannot print to this printer.&nbsp; I can use my lexmark printer for all other applications OK.&nbsp; My printers are shared from my desktop whch has an XP Professional operating system on it over my home network.&nbsp; Does anyone know anthing about this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi again&nbsp;Kiran,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that I have resolved my issues with&nbsp;my Lexmark X7675 Printer.&nbsp; I ended up activitaing the wireless network&nbsp;feature on the lexmark X7675 printer.&nbsp;Then, from the Lexmark web site, I downloaded and installed the&nbsp;driver program
 for the Windows 7 64-bit operating&nbsp;system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The driver installation program gave me the option to use the the printer over my wireless network, so I chose that.&nbsp; I am pleased to report that the printer works great now and I can print directly from the Photo
 Viewer in Windows 7 as well as all of my other programs to the Lexmark X7675.</p>
<p>I still don't know why it didn't work as a shared printer from another platform, however I am pleased with the way it works on the wireless network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for all of your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p><br />
"Ideapad" sounds like a laptop or tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably has a chip rather than a card in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also is likely to have a feature called switchable graphics, meaning that you need 3 things to get working:&nbsp; the low video chip; the high video chip and the software
 used to switch between the two, typically ATI's Catalyst Control Center--now also known as AMD's Vision Engine Control Center but probably modified by Lenovo.&nbsp;&nbsp; A problem is that although Intel may supply a driver for its chip and AMD a driver for its chip,&nbsp;you
 probably need to get something from Lenovo which is compatible with your machine and also compatible with W8.</p>

<p>Don't really know what you are trying to imply, but I think you were the same guy who told me to go play Cod4 "Since I liked the Knifing System so much".</p>
<p>So no...im not going to go play the sims which isn't even a game known for it's scenery. We were simply discussing what we think the map will look like. So if you don't don't care about that than you can go play an early wire-frame beta of all of the maps.
 How about that?</p>

            Hi BobPolen
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />There are two Skypes which you can install. There is no harm in reinstalling as I am unable to understand which Skype you want.
<br />
<br />1. Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Install Skype for Desktop. 
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    <p>On Windows 10 Pro I am getting Event ID 454, "SRUJet: Database recovery/restore failed with unexpected error -509" and Event ID 916 "The beta feature EseDiskFlushConsistency is enabled in ESENT due to the beta site mode settings 0x800000." logged to the

<p>
</p><p>If I shut off the Diagnostic Policy Service, these errors stop. When I turn DPS back on, I will see one of each of those errors immediately and then after some time (sometimes a few minutes, sometimes near an hour), I will see multiple per second (as shown
 in the picture above).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I've checked in C:\Windows\System32\SRU and see a few log files, but no SRUDB.dat (which seems to be the DB indicated by SRUJet). Some other posts have suggested deleting this file and let DPS rebuild it - but I cannot even find it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried manually putting SRUDB.dat in that folder, but the same errors happen (actually, starting DPS deletes the file I put there).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc /scannow which completes with no errors.&nbsp;<br />
I have also run DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth (and /ScanHealth and /RestoreHealth) - all no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,  Aggregate
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

    <title>Xbox One keeps disconnecting from Xbox Live with everything I use. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sillyboy21w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One keeps disconnecting from Xbox Live with everything I use. Netflix, Online Multiplayer, YouTube, and etc.</h2>
                    
<p>I have never had any issues with my Xbox 360. This Xbox One is starting to become more of a hassle than it is worth. I have tried everything. I have tried power cycling, default settings, resetting modem and xbox, port forwarding, plugging into the wall
 directly instead of surge protector, UPnP enabling, changing wireless channel on modem, enabling DMZ, and the list goes on. Nothing seems to work. I can get about 5-10 minutes of viewing on YouTube or NetFlix before it disconnects. When I play online multiplayer
 on CoD: Advanced Warfare it will say it is having troubles with the servers or something. I will press the home button and it shows I'm connected, but then 5-10 seconds later it disconnects. Is my Xbox One faulty or what can fix this issue because I'm honestly
 sick and tired of it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I am having the same issues. My Xbox One keeps disconnecting from the wifi every 1-5 minutes and it's non stop. I have a 91-97% signal strength and still get disconnected every 1-5 minutes</p>
<p>I have tried portforwarding. Power cycling. Disconnecting and reconnecting to wifi. Nothing.
</p>
<p>I even called my ISP and it isn't an issue on their side because everything else works perfectly fine.
</p>
<p>Would really love to know what in the hell is going on with my Xbox one and I'm sure the dozens of other people would love to know.</p>

<p>Please try to check your latency as well as your packet loss by going to Settings&gt;Network&gt;Detailed Network Statistics. It would be a problem if your latency will go over 100ms. If so, please do contact your ISP if there is a latency issue in your area.</p>

<p>Same problem here. Regarding the packet loss, how come I never had this problem before? It started after the latest console update for xbox one. When I try the ping test, the most packet loss I get is 2 packets which adds up to 0%, but when I check my xbox
 one it says the loss is 100%. WTF?? Does anyone have any solution? Thanks</p>

<p>I've been having similar problems for the last few weeks. &nbsp;I've tried all the same troubleshooting tips as previously discussed with little success. &nbsp;I was beginning to think I was having a hardware failure, but I'm now leaning towards a software bug that
 may have been introduced with the latest OS update.</p>

<p>I have checked for packet loss and it has always been 0% except I do remember one time a long time ago I had like 2% packet loss. I already spoke with my ISP and Xbox and neither know anything.. go figure. One always blames the other and no one takes responsibility
 for it. Thinking maybe my Xbox is faulty? But I don't know how to test that without sending it in.</p>

<p>This may qualify as necroposting, but I'm having identical issues. Couldn't connect to Xbox Live, but had good wireless internet connection &amp; Xbone's own utility said I was connected for multiplayer; in addition, checking the official site confirmed that
 basic functionality was up. So I rebooted the console, and hey, there's Xbox Live! Sort of. Somehow, despite being able to navigate the store and every other *** aspect of Live, I wasn't sufficiently connected to it for Destiny. Power cycle the modem &amp; router,
 reboot the console again, and voila--connected. At least, for awhile; after about 45 minutes, I lost connection to Destiny. &nbsp;Shortly after that, no Xbox Live--again. What the actual hell is going on here? What is this, PSN?</p>

<h3> osubuckeyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Party Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>So just wondering if anyone else is having this issue and may have a fix: Last week i was unable to start a party, join a party, or invite or join friends in games. I was not banned for anything. I called microsoft 4 times over 5 days and i still haven't
 found an answer to fix the issue. So my internet still has worked fine, i can play games on live alone with no lag or any issues but still can't inv people to my game or start/join party. At the end of the first two days of calling i was told both times it
 was because xbox core systems are down. So the final time i called i was finally told that my error was coming because i'm using a hotspot, the same hotspot i have used flawlessly for months and months on live. I believed he was using it as an excuse for not
 finding a solution because as soon as i mentioned the hotspot he used it as the reason for the problem and the issue could be caused by nothing else according to him. Now after this 30 min convo i am told i can go get my xbox repaired for like 200$ or i can
 go buy a new xbox. These were apparently my only options even though he had just claimed it was because of my hotspot. Hopefully you can see why i thought that was an absurd answer, it was apparently my error by using a hotspot even though like i mentioned
 i had been using this with zero issues for months and according to the support people one day my xbox decides it can no longer run on a hotspot, but can still play alone online without any problems or lag. And at the same time the only solution would be to
 pay for repairs or buy a new system. I tried resetting to factory new, clearing the mac address, they even had me click some button under blue ray and dvd 3 times, i unplugged and hard reset, but still cant even start a party with just me in it. Also i cannot
 switch back to wifi as the area i am in i do not have access. Just wanted to see what people thought, if anyone else has had this happen, and if xbox supports answer made sense or if it was as ridiculous as it sounded to me. Hoping i wont have to get a new
 system because if i do it will most likely not be an xbox and i really don't want to go that route as i am a long time user and big fan &nbsp;</p>

            what's your nat type? if it's strict that could cause some problems.maybe try this: go to settings, then network and click go offline,&nbsp;turn off your console, unplug all cables (including kinect if available) and unplug the power cable from the power outlet
 or wall socket, wait 3 minutes and then power it on again.

            Yes it is strict unfortunately, i will definitely give that a try when i get home, i have tried those steps before but not unplugging the adapter from the wall and other cords, i have just tried to unplug for a min or 2 but will try what you mentioned.
 But yes unfortunately it is a strict nat type, but my only issue with him saying that was the cause was that i have always had that nat type and used the same hotspot with the same nat type for months that i am using now and it just randomly one day stopped
 working and completely shut down my ability to party chat or invite people in game which i thought was strange. Thanks for the reply though i will give that a try later today

<p>Hello, OSUBuckeyes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about your experience with Support so far. </p>
<p>Seems like you have done a bunch of troubleshooting so far, and that previously posted step is a good way for you to try&nbsp;and fix&nbsp;that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is that the NAT type is very important, and though you may have had that for a good while, it being strict can indeed cause problems with joining parties . On the site, it states how for the fastest and most reliable access to the internet through
 the Xbox comes when it is connected with a Open NAT type. </p>
<p>Now, we do have some troubleshooting steps here on our page "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I can't hear my friends online, or I can't join or host a multiplayer game with my Xbox
 One</a>" that can help change that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The penultimate steps ask for you to try Port Forwarding as well as some manipulating of &nbsp;of your internet signal through it's settings. We have a bunch of information on various modem and router types, but a hotspot is not recommended which is probably
 why he told you to try another network. If you can't access those settings, then you'd have to contact your internet provider and see if they can.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd give the steps I posted a try and if you could, let us know how that works with the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, i will try all the steps listed from this forum and hopefully figure out what the issue is. The reason i switched from wifi to hotspot is the wifi i am provided is embarrassingly slow, to give you an idea of certain speeds my hotspot
 usually averages 10-30mb/s for downloads and such, my wifi used to do 500kb/s before i switched. So even if i can connect to the wifi instead, the quality of play is so low its almost unplayable. Im hoping i can find a way to continue to use the hot spot as
 the speeds aren't even comparable. Again thanks for the advice tho, i will try your steps later today.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just wanted to let everyone know that my xbox is actually up and running with no more issues. I actually ended my last convo with microsoft being told i need to pay 200 to get it repaired or go buy a new one, i was obviously very displeased with this answer
 from them and their customer service was as bad as it gets over the 3 days i called them. So if anyone is having this issue this is how i fixed it: after getting off the phone with them i unplugged everything and used my ps4 for a week, then one day after
 the week or so i went on to see if i could play a game i bought hoping i could play solo and when i turned it on i could start and accept the party just fine and play with friends again. Keep in mind microsoft had told me to go buy a new console so don't trust
 their guidance as it is basically useless. Ive been using it without any problem for about a week now and hopefully it won't happen again. Unfortunately i wish i had better advice then just unplug everything for a week but thats what worked for me so figured
 i would try to help out my fellow xbox players suffering from the same problem without any help from microsoft. Also a side note, i was told my xbox being played on hotspot was 100% the problem and i am still using that hotspot to this day so microsoft support
 is useless and tried to get me to buy a new console for no reason and blamed me for the issue claiming it was my error using a hotspot that worked perfect for months before this issue and has been working perfect after the issue as well. Good luck to anyone
 with this problem and thanks to anyone sending replies trying to help</p>

<p>You should have gotten an email with an order number, that will keep you updated until your order actually ships, and when it does ship you will receive the confirmation email from MS stating it has shipped and they will give you a tracking number which
 you can enter at fedex.com, ups.com, or usps.com or whatever your shipping agents are in your country of origin are to keep track of your package.</p>

            <p>Hey there v LosSantos!<br /><br />You will probably be charged and receive the confirmation email when the item itself ships. However, you can use the same contact number that you used to order the item if you'd like to confirm that your order was properly placed.<br /><br />I hope this helps. =)</p>

<h2>            Security</h2>
                    <p>The security Nazis have made the process so difficult that a standard computer user has extreme difficulty using the programs available to them.&nbsp; Each process needs a different and very complex password.&nbsp; Each app seems to need a different user name (that
 one is already taken).&nbsp; The programmers are pleasing each other, much as if they are playing some kind of a sport against each other, and have forgotten that what they develop is for the public--not for the "code writing community."&nbsp; It is time for the managers
 to understand that just like with the politicians, we are tired of people telling us we have to live a certain way, or perform in a certain way, or think in a certain way.&nbsp; It is time for you to respond to us and give us programs that we can access and use
 easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows can not find file</h2>
                    <p>I keep getting the message that windows can not find</p>
<p>c:\users\deborah\appdata\local\geniusbox\client.exe</p>
<p>and I am told to make sure that I typed the name correctly.</p>
<p>I do not recall what I was doing when this started to pop up. </p>
<p>I could be watching Netflix, looking at photo's, not be on the internet, be on the internet.</p>
<p>I have searched for this file in order to re-store it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what do I or what can I do to either get this file restored or get it to not pop anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not recently done anything strange. in the past i have downloaded some things from the internet however, have really never had any problems. if my anti virus tell me the program is not safe I tell it to make my computer safe and I do not download
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have windows 7 as my operating system on an hp pavilion g7</p>
<p>
</p><p>im afraid that something not good will happen to my computer if I do not figure out at way to fix this.</p>

            <p>A quick search on Google would have provided you with the answer. It appears to be Adware. I still do not understand why you say you cannot find it, c:\users\deborah\appdata\local\geniusbox\client.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also find it by opening programs and feature&gt;Uninstall a program&gt;click on it and then on uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: if it is not in programs and features then it has not been installed and you can safely delete it. However there may be some leftovers including the popup. You will need to search for the popup to delete it.

</p><p>It got on your computer because you downloaded it. When you download free software do not use the quick recommended download button, use the custom download button and deselect add-ons if you do not want them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have many times went to my uninstall a program area and have exactly what i want and need as far as programs nothing strange sitting there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have look all over and I can not find any where that the genius box is sitting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did go out and do the msconfig thank you for that as there was a bunch of **** starting up that I did not know was doing so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am still continually getting this box that pops us stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows can not find; c:\users\deborah\appdata\local\geniusbox\client.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sure would like to find a way to make it stop. I am always open to trying something new.</p>

            Try this but be careful not to delete the wrong file. Click on computer&gt; C Drive and in the little search box at the top right hand corner type Deborah or appdata or geniusbox. right click on any that you find and click on 'open folder location' the file
 will be highlighted. be careful&nbsp;to make sure&nbsp;the file is not part of some other program.&nbsp; What these programs do is hide the popup so that even when&nbsp;you uninstall the program the popup still exists.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to open Control panel? Do you get any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Since
 when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the system, like installed any application?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This is caused by a .cpl file, usually control panel applet from a third party program like display applet, sound applet. I would suggest
 you to locate third party applets in system 32 and remove it from the system.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start menu and click on Computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Windows and then click on System32 folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 for any third party .cpl files present and delete it from the system and check whether the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to open control panel in safe mode and check whether the issue persists. Follow the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer and keep tapping F8 till you reach the boot menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Safe mode from the boot menu and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 control panel and check whether the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persists in safe mode then, I would suggest you to do a clean boot and check. Follow step 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To perform a clean boot follow steps mentioned in the link given below.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Follow step 7 to boot the computer in normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to do a SFC scan. System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows XP system files are where they should be as they were by default and not corrupted,
 changed, or damaged. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and&nbsp;select Run as Administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>You
 should see the following on-screen message:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>§<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Beginning
 the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>§<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Beginning
 verification phase of system scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Verification

<p>Meaning it looks like the older style elites now instead of the shiny look.</p>

<p>yes they phased out the glossy finish in the 250 gig models any new 250 gig models will be the same satin black as the 4 gig models but I do not know if it will have the chrome trim or not.</p>

<p>Just for this I am taking the system back to the store tomorrow. And no it does not have the chrome trim. I will not own a system that looks dull while the Kinect sensor over shines it. Stupid stupid move. I just don't understand why Microsoft wont leave
 these systems alone. I was going to get into Kinect experience but I will not own the newer systems now cause the sensor still looks glossy.

    <title>Problem with data transfer kit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dusty prawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with data transfer kit</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I've just got a new Slim Xbox 360 for Christmas after my old one got the red lights and i'm trying to transfer the old save games from the old 20GB detachable hard drive to the new console. I've bought a data transfer kit (official new black one) and followed
 the instructions but i am unable to get the pop-up thing to pop up.</p>
<p>The new console has the latest&nbsp; update and everything. I've done a fair bit of googling trying to find out the problem but not having much luck. What reason would there be for it not popping up with the transfer content message?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                </div>

<p>Firstly and this may sound silly but does your new console have a hard drive or is it the 4GB S model.</p>

<p>All I can suggest is that you check that the transfer cable is connected securely where it connects to the hard drive, sometimes it can seem that it is connected but they can be a little stiff. Hook it all up and power the console on, if it still doesn't
 work sometimes changing usb ports works, if you're still having no luck you may just have a faulty transfer cable.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help ThingOnAString.</p>
<p>The problem was the order of attaching each end of the cable. Despite the instructions saying to plug the cable into the hard drive first then the console, the inverse is true. I got it to work by powering on the console, plugging the USB end of the cable
 into the console, then plugging the other end into the old hard drive. Hope this solves it for anyone else having the same problem too.</p>
<p>onyx62is, i'm fairly sure it is compatible. The reason i was wanting to use the cable instead of a USB is that my old Xbox red-lighted and it wouldn't turn on.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact problem; except, I have had no success with either method of operation regarding the data transfer cable.</p>
<p>Eariler today I purchased a brand-new Xbox 360 250gb console and an official data transfer cable. I updated my console via a wired internet connection and attempted several times to facilitate the "popping up" of the USB transfer cable process with no luck.
</p>
<p>Do I have to retrieve my Xbox LIVE Gold Account prior to initiating the transfer process? I skipped that option on console start-up.</p>
<p>Maybe I thrashed the copper prongs inside my original 20gb HDD when I attempted to correctly pry it off my original Xbox 360 console?</p>
<p>HELP!</p>

<p>It wouldn't hurt to recover your account. Please let us know if that works for you as it seems a few people are having problems just lately with the data transfer and it's always good to have as many solutions as possible, thanks.</p>

<p>The purchase of the data transfer cable was a complete and utter waste of my hard-earned money. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to initiate the cable transfer process, I finally tried the "Cloud storage" feature. I managed to collect all my saved games
 and multiplayer profiles on my new console. Although it took a few more repetitive steps than before to exchange/copy/delete information from my old 20gb HDD to my new 250gb HDD, it turns out I don't even need the cable kit! BestBuy employees stated that I
 could not return the opened item; however, according to their return policy on the back of my receipt, I should be able to return it as the item looks brand-new (I am very surgical when opening boxes). I'll be talking to BestBuy supervisors very soon.</p>
<p>What a scam!</p>

    <title>Cannot gain permission to files&#40;downloaded to my HDD from someone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pezzaahh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot gain permission to files&#40;downloaded to my HDD from someone else PC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Due to having awful internet connection where i live, i had my brother download Forza horizon 4 to my HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After plugging my HDD into my own PC i do not have access to use or do anything with the files. I have gone into the folders and changed ownership and adjusted the permissions which from what i can see all confirm that i should now be able to move, copy
 and open them. But... I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To download 64gb would literally take weeks.... so how can i get around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pez</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Takeown and ICALS tried in cmd and everything came back success. but still can not move or access the files</p>

            Hi Brenda
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail, are you getting that error when setting a password, is the notice saying you have too few characters in your Password
<br />
<br />If possible, please provide a screenshot of that error, it is a really unusual error to be getting, if you are getting that when setting up a PIN . . .       
        </p>

<p>A dictionary attack is a method for stealing a password. The attacker enters every word in a standard dictionary - and common variations of the same - until it hits on your password. That's why one of the rules for choosing a good password is: don't let
 it be a word that can be found in a dictionary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't see this happening, so you wouldn't know that you were the victim of a dictionary attack, unless the attacker for some reason decided to make that information public.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would only know that your account was attacked in some way, e.g., no money in the bank, your identity was stolen, spam email being sent in your name, etc. It doesn't have anything to do with adding an email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about letting us know ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to add an email account to&nbsp;<em>what</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the <em>it</em> that won't let you add your email account?</p>
