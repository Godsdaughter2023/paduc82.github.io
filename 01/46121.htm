<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop icons rearranging</h2>
                    <p>I am having some trouble with icons rearranging on my Windows 10 desktop. I like to have "This PC" top left, and my user folder underneath it (just the layout I've been used to for years) but whenever I restart or otherwise refresh explorer, it flips them
 so that my user folder is top left with "This PC" underneath.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some common "solutions" I've come across have not resulted in anything useful, so I've listed them below so you know what to avoid telling me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. "Auto Arrange" is turned off</p>
<p>2. "Perform a clean install". This IS a clean install, it is a brand new Surface Book. Also, for what it's worth, "perform a clean install" is never a solution, it's a last resort. Nobody ever wants to do a clean install of their system.</p>
<p>3. "Eset Antivirus" was a piece of software somehow linked to desktop problems, but this software is not installed on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the reply. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Well, seeing as I only got the machine recently - technically yes, but it's been happening since day 1.</p>
<p>2. No, it's just me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried making a new account, and set that profile up similar to mine (This PC top left, user folder under it). With 2 accounts on the machine, both profiles behaved themselves. I tried restarting, logging in and out etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then removed the second account, and the abnormal behaviour returned to my main profile.</p>

    <title>Norton Security Scan keeps on installing itself - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Norton Security Scan keeps on installing itself</h2>
                    Today, on my wife's computer (Vista Home Premium), I discovered <strong>Norton Security Scan</strong> . Neither my wife nor I have knowingly downloaded or installed this. We don't use Norton (Symantec) at all.<br />
<br />
I uninstalled it. When I rebooted, after a couple of minutes, it installed itself again. This has happened every time I've uninstalled and rebooted.<br />
<br />
After some investigation, I discovered that there is a "Run Once" entry:<br />
nssstub.exe<br />
<br />
I discovered nssstub.exe in the directory<br />
C:\Windows\System32\Adobe\Shockwave11<br />
<br />
I suspect that this must have come in through the latest Adobe updates, although for all I know this is a virus pretending to be a bona fide security program.<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm not even sure that nssstub.exe is the program at fault, although it looks like it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how I can cleanly get rid of this Norton Security Scan program that keeps on installing itself?<br />
<br />
TIA

            Oh wow, I found the answer!<br />
<br />
It's a genuine unwanted program from Norton, so at least we know it's not a virus (even though it acts like one).<br />
<br />
Apparently the only way to get rid of it is through registry editing. Here's the answer (see response number 3):<br />

</p><p>Hey there Storji95,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the error. Usually this error pertains to either a service issue or a network issue on the console. The services are working as of this post, so let's check a few things to narrow this down. Does the issue persist when using both wired or wireless network connections on the console? Which country are you located in on the Officially supported regions <a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>Run a Detailed Network Statistics test on the Xbox 360 console and please provide the following information.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How to run the test.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <b>Guide</b> button on your controller, go to <b>Settings</b>, and then select
<b>System Settings</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Network Settings</b>. </li><li>Select the name of your wired or wireless network (if applicable). </li><li>Select <b>Network Statistics</b>.</li></ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please provide this information/results</p>
<ul>
<li>Download Speed </li><li>Upload Speed </li><li>Latency </li><li>Packet Loss % </li><li>Wireless Strength (if applicable) </li><li>Modem Manufacturer </li><li>Router Manufacturer (if being used) as well as the model number</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>That information will help us determine the next best steps. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            The Best Team Ever&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Well last night marked the final group play in ME3 for my team. I may not have mentioned this but my team and I are a social group of friends that play games directed towards 4 players. We have taken apart games like Duke Nukem, Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress
 2, Resident Evil 5 and 6, Dead Rising 2 and DR2 Off the record, Saints Row 2&nbsp; 3 and Dead Island. The two player games were completed by my first mate and I. It is time for my team to move on. I will still play until I get everything in multiplayer and there
 are still a few story play throughs that I would like to complete. Our final night brought back some great memories. We started as two of us against bronze and we couldnt even beat round three. So we called our guys in and worked our way through Bronze, silver,
 then Gold, and finally was able to beat Platinum every time. Quite an experience to say the least. Our sights are now set on the new Dead Island 2 that comes out Tuesday. To mark our final night we tried to do some impossible feats to prove our superiority
 as a team in ME3. Last night we beat Platinum Collectors on Condor, Vancouver, Ghost, and Giant. Giant was done as our final map as we have had some great times there. As far as I know we created the Giant strat and made it popular as a Platinum map. The other
 three maps we had never tried on Platinum let alone Platinum Collectors.We have beat every Platinum map except Rio and London during our time. We never tried them. We went 4-0 on the maps last night. If your team wants a nice challenge then try this if you
 dare. As it is a mark set by the best of the best team. After one year, many many weekend challenges, to many credits spent, and a wonderful time........The BAD Connection bids you farewell.</p>
<p>PS: Hit BAD up. A couple of us will still be playing during the week to help me finish up what I have left to do.

<p>Thank you both. Plat Collectors are tough but you kinda get used to them. Last night when I picked the maps even my dudes were like your crazy BAD. We are gonna get owned. I knew we could do it and they all requested to be challenged for our last night.
 I am still down until I get everything in the game. I doubt its ever been done. Maybe one or two people. Then I will retire from ME3 multiplayer and collect my N7 retirement &nbsp;checks. LOL</p>

<p>A few days ago (as I was bored) I did a U/U/U search with my Drell Assasin Infiltrator and found myself on Firebase Rio/Collectors/Platinum as the party just started. 11 Waves of shouts, swearing, cursing and overall screaming at the Collector's resounding
 through my headset. We got the win and no, no hiding in the infamous 'Box of Shame' either... though I admit, I did tend to stay in that general vicinity with my recon mines (Had a Talon Engineer there as well... Cain Trip Mines + Recon Mines set for max damage...
 heh heh heh).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Having said that, I know what the Collector's are like on Platinum, and anyone who goes against them on that difficulty has got my respect. Sorry that your team disbanded, but I can understand the call to move on to other things. Respect to you and your

<p>It was truly a pleasure to meet you "BAD 2020" &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I hope that you and your friends have fun with Dead Island: Riptide &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I was thinking of getting it (Dead Island: Riptide), but then I decided not to anymore because there is a very good chance that I
 will be re-playing Mass Effect 1 to 3 with a male Shepard who will be romancing Tali. &nbsp;Smackdown vs Raw 2010 also has my interest as I want to seriously play a Mickie James and a Melina Perez career mode because this is the one aspect of the game that I didn't
 really play a lot of. &nbsp;The little that I played of it (the career mode with Mickie James and Melina Perez) were under time constraints from other games that I wanted to play, I will be taking it slowly this time around and enjoy it &nbsp;:)

<p>Hello "BAD 2020" &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I am absolutely loving Dead Space 3 and I have been a lot less Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer. &nbsp;Currently, I am playing only to keep my Galactic Readiness at 100% and then I go back to Dead Space 3 (as opposed to before when I would just
 play 5 to six matches per sessions of ME3 MP). &nbsp;Thus, I will be unable to join you in your closing hours of your Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer sessions, I hope that you understand the reason why (because I am playing Dead Space 3 now). &nbsp;I wish you and your friends
 the best in your future endeavors and have fun with Dead Island: Riptide &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Have a nice day or afternoon or night "The BAD Connection" &nbsp;:)</p>

    <title>NO BOOTABLE DEVICE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucynguyen  say:</h3>
<h2>            NO BOOTABLE DEVICE</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 3 months ago, I accidentally dropped my windows 10 laptop onto the ground. Afterwards its screen was broken and I had it repaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, since I brought it back home, it has not been processing very well. I always have to wait for it for about 5-15 mins to respond whenever I start a program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, last night, everything went wrong. When I was working on Chrome, my laptop suddenly stopped working. The screen turned into black for a long time so I impatiently shut it down by pressing on the power button. When I started it again, there
 was only "NO BOOTABLE DEVICE" on the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was freaking out so I restarted by pushing on power button again. This time, it said "Preparing for... impairment?" (I can't figure it out now), and later it posed two options: "Trouble shooting" or "Turn off the PC". I didn't know what to do so I chose
 to shut it down. Now I'm very scared and I really need your help. I'm a student and I don't have much knowledge of technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you all!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Lucy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It may be hard drive failure since the most common result of dropping a laptop is it breaks the hard drive.  
<br />
<br />Go into UEFI/BIOS setup to see if the hard drive is detected under Storage devices, usually listed by its brand and model or serial.  If not it needs to be reseated from underneath to try to get it to register.  If not it needs to be replaced.  
<br />
<br />If the drive is detected then Test the hard drive with diagnostics:
<br /><a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />  Best is to use the manufacturer's own if there is one, otherwise use Seatools bootable long test: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />If the drive has failed I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise everything possible is here for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Microsoft offered a different update between online and offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aprinto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft offered a different update between online and offline windows security update&#63;</h2>
                    I had installed Windows 7 Ultimate x64 in Okt 2009 (FPP retail pre-order) and always use an automatic online update for microsoft software. Until now, microsoft is only offer me to install only ± 10 windows security updates.<br />
<br />
And few days ago, my friend show to me a new windows 7 x64 build 6.1.<strong>7600.20576</strong> (KB975363) that can be download manually (offline) and he need hundreds of windows updates file to update from windows 7 first release (build 16385?) to build 20576.<br />
<br />
Based on this info, I checked my computer at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\NT\CurrentVersion - BuildLabEx registry and show me that my windows was still build
<strong>7600.16385</strong> .amd64fre.win7_<strong>rtm</strong> .090713-1255.<br />
<br />
My question is :<br />
1. Is there a different between offline updates and automatic online updates from microsoft?<br />
2. Why microsoft&nbsp; offer me only 10 security updates from Okt 2009 until now while other can install hundreds, so he can have new build of windows (20576) and why my windows version is still 16385?<br />
3. Do I need to install all update like my friend did, --&nbsp; in other say -- do I need to updates windows build 20576?<br />
<br />
4. What does it mean : rtm? In my opinion, rtm is last version <strong>BEFORE</strong> release to market, maybe it also called
<strong>release candidate </strong>version?<br />
<br />

    <title>Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 Key issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert zwarun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 Key issue</h2>
                    Greetings. I recently purchased a&nbsp;Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 (yesterday, as a matter of fact) and already, I noticed an issue. It's with the QWERTY keys.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To be specific, whenever I strike a certain key, it types that letter (or symbol), but it also displays another letter or symbol with it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have identified the problem keys:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Pressing <b>I or O </b>would display<b> IO</b>.</div>
<div><b>] </b>and<b> \ (or } </b>and<b> |)&nbsp;</b>shows<b> ]\ </b>(<b>or }|</b>).</div>
<div><b>= or 5</b> shows <b>=5</b>.</div>
<div><b>9 or 0</b> shows <b>90</b>.</div>
<div><b>D or F</b> shows <b>DF</b>.</div>
<div><b>m or , (M or &lt;)</b> shows <b>m, (M&lt;)</b>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you can seem, it makes for some very unintentional error-filled typing. Could this be the result of a driver error somehow?</div>
                </div>

<p>Answer to #2 is that you have to play music from the dashboard. You can try leaving it playing while you load the game, after the music is started, but that doesn't always work.</p>

<p>Hi Mika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error Code: 0xA00F4271 (0x80070491) is an error code received when the Camera app in Windows 10 does not work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To identify the cause of the error code, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made on the system prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you tried accessing the camera using a different program? (Ex. Skype)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest running the Windows app troubleshooter to automatically find and fix any error that could be causing this issue. You may run the troubleshooter from this

<p>Hello Mika276,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That error generally indicates a camera driver issue. I recognize that you said your camera works with skype. Are you using Skype desktop or the modern Skype app? You can tell it's the desktop app if it has a menu titled "Skype"
 at the to left corner of the app, the modern version doesn't have this menu. Does your machine have two cameras attached? Possibly a front and rear camera? If so, it could be that the Windows Camera app is attempting to start the camera with a driver issue
 and Skype is ignoring that troublesome camera. Take a look at this troubleshooting article and see if it helps to correct your issue:</p>

<h2>            Elan driver makes difficulties in streaming</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new laptop and from day one my streamings like Netflix, Amazon Prime or even Youtube goes out of sync. I realized the cause is the Elan driver. If I uninstall it and go with the simple ps2 compatible, the streaming goes all right. But the windows
 realizes I do not have the correct driver, fixes it and after restart the same fight starts over. I cannot block installing the failed driver, I cannot install another version because the windows thinks it's the best driver available. What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance :)</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that you installed the wrong driver for your touchpad resulting for your streaming services to be out of sync. In this case, we suggest that you contact the laptop manufacturer to get the correct driver for your laptop's touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks! First I changed the ELAN driver than everything else, but the problem is the same. But I noticed something else as well. If I start the laptop, streams are in sync but after a few standby the problem occurs again. Nothing in the event viewer, tried
 Chrome, Firefox and Edge, the problem stays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more idea? :)</p>

<p>Hi Melchizedek (wow, nice name :)),</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have build 16299.192, my laptop is a Medion Erazer P7643. Except experimenting with some drivers to solve the issue, I haven't made any changes, I just bought it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't turn off my driver update, maybe the solution comes that way :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and regards</p>

<p>Hi Tattmandoo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your first question based on my test, the Resource/Shared mailbox is searchable in the directory, but the calendar events cannot be showed in your own Skype for Business calendar If you are a member of the Shared mailbox or you have permissions to
 the Resource mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About your issue, please kindly check this following article, Skype for Business requires Exchange credential (the credential to log in Outlook) to integrate with Exchange service or Outlook to get information about free/busy status, calendar events and
 so on. So please make sure enter the credential you used to log in Outlook when it prompts. And if the issue persists, walk through the steps in the article and check if the issue persists.
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2298541/you-re-repeatedly-prompted-for-exchange-credentials-after-you-sign-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2298541/you-re-repeatedly-prompted-for-exchange-credentials-after-you-sign-in</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you may delete the sign in cached info and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p>1. Delete the Skype for Business sign in information. Click the status and select Sign out – Delete my sign in information.</p>
<p>2. Clear all the Skype for Business cache files. Open the Run bar in your computer and run %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\, select Office – 15.0 or 16.0 – Lync, then delete all the sip files and all the files in Tracing folder, don’t delete the tracing folder
 itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, I need gather more information to narrow down the possible cause of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Do others in your organization also have the same issue?</li><li>Where is your Skype for Business deployed? On cloud or on premise?</li><li>How long have you been encountering the issue?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<h3> amanae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to disable .Net Framework 3.5.1 Win7 64bit</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I encountered problems with a program because of missing or faulty .Net Framework installations.</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled the versions of 4.0 and 4.5 successfully but the problem persisted, leaving me with the only option of 3.5 being faulty.<br />
I then proceeded to try disabling it in the windows features without success, the bar would reach 100% and then tell me that "An error has occurred. Not all of the features were successfully changed".<br />
Thus I tried to find an alternate way of disabling it and used DISM, which as far as I understand it basically does the same. This too failed but at the very least provided me with a log file. The only problem is that I'm unable to actually determine what went
 wrong in the log. About 30 minutes of abusing google the only results I got were things related to the technical preview of Win7 (I'm going to include the DISM log below.)</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that AIDA64 extreme wasn't able to report that .Net Framework 3.5 is installed at all, at least the tech support of the program I was trying told me that this is most definitely not the way things should be.</p>
<p>So I very desperately turn to you all.</p>

            <p>It's about the launcher of a game, World of Tanks to be exact, a bit over a year ago and everything was fine. I've never encountered problems with .Net Framework before or right now at all. The only two things which aren't working is that one specific game
 launcher and.. well the (un)installer itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did both of your suggestions now and both got the same-ish response.<br />
/Although I ran the repair tool a few days ago but forgot about it apparently, anyway it send a report to Microsoft.)<br />
<br />
MS repair tool was unable to solve the issue.<br />
And the system file checker found damaged data but couldn't repair "some" of them.<br />
<br />
Tried going through the logs except of the CBS and windowsupdate (because they're.. a tad overwhelming) now and couldn't find something of help either although that might be just because I'm inexperienced in those things.<br />
<br />
Should I upload the CBS, windowsupdate, FixDotNet and NetFxSetupEvents logs?<br />
The regdump of fixdotnet and the decompression log do not seem all too important.</p>

<p>honestly i don't think they refund purchases unless there is an issue with the game, other than just not liking it. &nbsp;no one in the forums can do that for you either way. &nbsp;you would have to contact support by phone or live chat. &nbsp;also they generally only
 offer a refund once per account, just so you know. &nbsp;if you have never received a refund for anything before, you may want to save it for a potential problem down the line.</p>

</p><p><strong>Windowsapp</strong> folder has strict permissions before you can do anything in this folder. Did you update or upgrade your computer? If you upgraded, some old apps from the previous operating system will be transferred to another folder. Can you

<h2>            Scorpio Edition Replacements</h2>
                    <p>Obviously the hardware failures on the One X are widespread. While it's great that any one with a standard One X can get a replacement, I feel the those&nbsp;with a Scorpio Edition should not be punished for Microsoft's failure.</p><p><br /></p><p>What is the point of having a special edition if it doesn't work and can't be replaced? Please don't punish loyal fans in the future.</p>

            <p>received mine, sent it for repairs 1 hour after connecting it. over 2 weeks later ... the power cord and HDMI are just sitting there with no console in sight. Who knows if I will get the Scorpio, standard, or anything at any point now. Really quite pathetic. Anyone looking to buy the new X Box X right now ... dont ... wait ... faulty as well... wait for the damaged ones to be updated by something that works</p>

They've all been cleared. Support keep giving me different stories as to what it is.&nbsp; All started when I couldn't access the Microsoft Store last week.. power cycle and cache clearing didn't&nbsp;work.&nbsp; Finally got access again after a hard reset.&nbsp; That caused an entirely new issue.. I can't download any of my previously digitally purchased games or apps. They're all just sitting there in the 'Ready to Install' section and won't move to Queue or install.&nbsp; If im lucky&nbsp;something may suddenly drop into queue and download that i clicked install on&nbsp;3 or 4 days prior.. Like Destiny 2 did last night after asking it to install Monday evening.&nbsp; I've got 1 support agent telling me it a latency issue with the store that's affected S and X models since 10th November with no time fr

<h2>            Skype Number can&#39;t make calls to numbers starting with 0 in Japan</h2>
                    <p>I'm in Japan using a skype number with the +81 country code. Whenever I try to make a call that starts with a 0 (which is very common in Japan) skype removes the 0 from the call line and then gives me a "this call cannot be completed as dialed" message.
 This is extremely frustrating as it means I can't call almost any government or bank-related number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using my PC to make the call, same issue. </p>
<p>The calls work fine from a regular Japanese landline, so I know I'm entering the number correctly.</p>

<p>Alright I think I've figured it out,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever reason, Japanese toll free lines (lines starting with 0) don't work for international calls. Even though I have a skype number for Japan, it may still be registered as a non-local number because the number starts with 505, which is uncommon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to put it short, skype numbers in Japan don't seem to work with ANY number that starts with 0.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to call a toll free number, try to find the company's international number and call it from Skype. Or just call whatever number you can at the company and ask for a transfer to a non 0 number (this is what I had to do for my bank...).</p>

    <title>Strange Networking.. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strange Networking..</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so first of all I want to say that I don't really know where to put this post, so if you have a better place let me know..</p>

<p>My networking situation is fairly odd.. I have my phone wifi tethered to my computer and then I have a network bridge setup with my computer and Xbox One to be able to get onto live. I have to do it this way because Xbox One's do not recognize ad-hoc networks..
 which is what my phone broadcasts.</p>
<p>All of this is fine, but every once in a while something strange happens.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I will get a notification on my phone that a new device has connected called "Xbox-SystemOS" which just happens to be my Xbox..</p>
<p>This connection will have a mac address of&nbsp; <strong>"00 1b 77 95 9c 56"</strong> and an ip address of
<strong>"192.168.2.104"</strong></p>
<p>My Xbox's mac address is not <strong>"00 1b 77 95 9c 56"</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, that is the mac address of my laptop, which is named "User-PC" ... But my laptop is connected to my phone with an ip address of
<strong>"192.168.2.105"</strong></p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what is happening?</p>

<p>I pay no attention to the IP address. </p>
<p>My household's telecommunication company Telecom NZ says it as one thing but some websites and other sources say it's another. My household would have to pay extra just to have a static IP address. I wouldn't post my IP address publicly due to security/privacy
 reasons people may try to use it to try and locate where you live. Do you live in the US? Xbox 1 uses 300,000 Xbox Live servers run by Microsoft. And they're good at protecting your privacy and security. That's all I can tell. Try contacting Xbox Support.</p>

<p>1) The IP addresses OP posted are private class (non-routable) IPs, so there are no privacy or security concerns &nbsp;with posting those. &nbsp;I would not post the full MAC address, but it is not a major issue either.</p>
<p>2) Your phone is likely seeing the Xbox hostname because your Xbox is connected to it through the PC, which is acting as a bridge. &nbsp;It is showing your PC's MAC address with your Xbox hostname due to the way the bridging is being done (it is not a transparent
 bridge).</p>
<p>IOW, normal and expected with your setup, which BTW is not ideal for gaming as I'm sure you know.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I understand what you mean. </p>
<p>Have you checked on your phone or Xbox to see if the hotel has a WiFi network you can connect to?</p>
<p>You can sometimes tether your phones network data to a WiFi hotspot and connect that way, but it can use a LOT of mobile data, and if you don't have unlimited data etc, then you may get charged by your network - so I would not recommend this.

<p>the answer is simple Microsoft does not want you to use the alt mac address been an issue since Feb of 2014 since that fated update came out it broke the online gaming aspect of the alt mac address. the reuse time and time again to fix this bug and lock

<p>Destiny requires all the Xbox ports to be open and a stable connection to play, since hotels won't allow you to portforward your console and most likely do not have UPnP enabled you won't be able to play online.</p>
