            Hi Salvatore, 
<br />
<br />I’m seeing more and more issues pop up with WIndows Media Player lately. 
<br />
<br />Are you willing to try another player? <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a> - I love VLC, download and see if it’ll play your videos. 
<br />
<br />If you rather not go that route, we can certainly troubleshoot WMP!
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Hi Salvatore, the HEVC (H265) video format is relatively new and is not really supported in Windows 10, for some unknown reason Microsoft removed support in the Fall Creators Update and put it up on the Microsoft Store . . .
<br />
<br />You can get the codec from this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/hevc-video-extension/9n4wgh0z6vhq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/hevc-vi...</a>

            Hello SalvatoreDel, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.

<br />US: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/hevc-video-extension/9n4wgh0z6vhq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/hevc-vi...</a>

<br />Or search for HEVC Video Extensions from Device Manufacturer in the Microsoft store on your PC.

            Thanks. I have that app for the codec on computer as is turns out. However I use Photoshop Elements to organize my photos and videos and used to be able to play videos from that program. Now cannot after one of the recent windows updates. The file is there
 in the PE organizer vut clicking on it to play results in sound only. Any ideas?

            What version of photoshop elements do you have? If it’s an old version it might no longer be compatible.
<br />
<br />Does the file play when using VLC: <a href="https://www.videolan.org/index.en-GB.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/index.en-GB.html</a>

    <title>Split screen when using mail program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Split screen when using mail program</h2>
                    <p>I can't understand the rationale for the answers or lack of answers. It seems one person asks a question and everyone else who asks the same question is deemed to have found the question 'helpful'. But we aren't getting an answer. The one about dragging
 the handles solves the problem for that instant but it reappears the next time you try and open something from e-mail. Please don't list my response as helpful. Maybe 'frustrated' would be a better description</p>

            I did try to reply but it wouldn't connect. My query was the same as many others had asked before. When I open a window from Yahoo mail it opens it in split screen. I noticed several other people had queried this and each time a request for help came up
 it was marked as being 'helpful'. I am using windows 10. No doubt this request will be tagged as helpful? Why?

<p>with regard to posts being marked as helpful, this is done by other users (like you or me), you can see the helpful button at the bottom of each post in the thread, it may be that there are a lot of accidental clicks or users mistaking it for a me too button
 (like at the bottom of the post that starts the thread).</p>
<p>either way it is not marked as helpful by Microsoft or the forum moderators but by other users.</p>
<p>a post with a lot of 'helpful' marks will be duplicated as the most helpful, at the top of the thread, other than that it does not mean a lot.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Battery details popup don&#39;t show estimated battery life</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Version 1703 (15063.332)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reinstalling Windows 10 Anniversary Edition provided by Dell and moving on to Creators Update I found the battery indicator to stop showing remaining time in the popup.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1436f6c3-421b-49f3-b874-c31e184624d3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1436f6c3-421b-49f3-b874-c31e184624d3" /></a></p>
<p>The time is still displayed in Power section of control panel and when hovering over the battery indicator, it's just the pop up that does not show this information, also it never shows the "Calculating..." label.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8180b2-af93-4f97-ada4-4301d3db5358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a8180b2-af93-4f97-ada4-4301d3db5358" /></a></p>
<p>However, if laptop is plugged in, the remaining time to charge is displayed on the right hand side.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9e82cf7-8794-4844-a4ce-60fd0f37fc15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9e82cf7-8794-4844-a4ce-60fd0f37fc15" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installing all available updates and drivers from Windows Update.</li><li>Running "Power" troubleshooting (which fixed the "Display brightness is set too high" "issue", uhm...)</li><li>Running SFC, found no issues.</li><li>Turning "Power" notification icon off/on.</li><li>Resetting regional settings (as per&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-10-battery-time-remaining-always/b26d237f-b2a5-46af-a077-6464c77d1f15?msgid=bfeed8e3-9ca0-462d-b8fb-2b732f5562ca">this thread
 about "Calculating..." message.</a></li></ul>
<p>I could not find a similar report anywhere else, so I am pretty sure it's something local to my machine, but I can't really figure out where to start. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>I would agree that this must be some sort of bug. We would suggest that you use the Feedback Hub so you can reach Microsoft engineers and developers to let them know about this. It will be the best and quickest way. Please check this link about the
<p>
</p><p>We would also advise that you let the vendor/manufacturer of your device about this, since the Remaining Battery Time is linked to the PCs BIOS settings.
<br />
<br />
Should there be anything else, please keep us informed. <br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye on this thread. <br />

<h2>            Problems installing windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have been having some trouble upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Envy laptop which had Windows 8 on it. I upgraded that to Windows 8.1 today and now trying again to upgrade from 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the 64 bit Windows Media Creation Tool from the Microsoft website and it downloads fine goes to 100% then says that it is 'creating windows 10 media' goes to 100% then the box disappears and nothing happens from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting my laptop and hoping that something would pop up when my computer starts up again but nothing and I have tried downloading it twice now with no luck.</p>

            <p>I have had the same problem as the original question, but I do not understand this reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an activated copy of Windows 8.</p>
<p>I upgraded to 8.1.</p>
<p>I went online and clicked get Windows 10 on the microsoft website</p>
<p>I downloaded the small file.</p>
<p>I clicked Download Tool (64-bit version).</p>
<p>A box popped up and I selected upgrade this PC.</p>
<p>It said progress and the percentage went up to 100 a couple of times.</p>
<p>Then the box just disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this 3 times and restarted my computer after the second time.</p>

<h2>            Windows Surface Pro 3 and 4 are hopeless</h2>
                    <p>I had the Surface Pro 3 and on an almost day to day basis the computer would keep having new and strange problems such as:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>can't connect to the network</li><li>can't connect to the server</li><li>can't connect to the printer from Outlook only</li><li>can't load Microsoft office apps</li><li>can't turn the computer on (brand new computer)</li><li>programs that were working all of the sudden stop working</li><li>etc.</li><li>etc.</li></ul>
<p>This went on for 2 months having the IT guy out numerous times fixing the problems only for new ones to eventuate and old ones to re-appear</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dropped that computer and then a year later the Surface Pro 4 came out so I thought surely Microsoft have fixed all these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amazingly the same strange behaviour kept on eventuating on the brand new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea of Surface Pro is what lured me in but the functioning of the machine makes it unusable in an office environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never again will I waste my money and time on a Microsoft computer :(</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype number can only be used to receive calls from mobile/landline numbers, this is the sole use of Skype number. There is no option/feature for Skype to receive any SMS, you will need to receive them on your device through your local network provider.

<p>Já comprei Braid, e agora na Live Brasil comprei o Limbo e Shadow Complex!</p>
<p>Mas agora, estou falando de jogos Multiplayer! Ou seja, quero jogo pra jogar com o pessoal na LIVE!</p>
<p>Estou pensando se vale a pena comprar Lost Planet 2, pois vi que podem jogar 4 jogadores ao mesmo tempo! O preço é ótimo, mas será que tem gente sempre jogando ele na Live??</p>

<p>Como o xRatoLokox falou o call of duty black ops é mto legal, mas eu prefiro um de velho oeste chamado red dead redemption é mto loco, tanto pra jogar multiplayer como single, vale a pena comprar, e mesmo no multplayer ele não trava nem da lag, jogo com
 conexão de 1mg e funciona legal. outro bacana é o pes 2011 mas cansa um pouco pq é todo mundo só joga com o barcelona, outro jogo mto bom é o mortal kombat 9 mas on-line ele trava bastante independente da conexão...</p>
<p>então fica minha dica para jogos on-line :</p>
<p>Call of Duty - Black Ops</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption</p>

<p>Ultimamente estou jogando call of duty - black ops, o que acho o melhor. </p>
<p>Não gostei muito do Live do Call of duty - modern warfare - acho um pouco lento para que as pessoas acessem e crie um grupo para jogar.</p>
<p>Ainda não consegui jogar o Forza 2, via Live. Alguém pode me explicar?</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes, you may receive and answer calls using your Skype Number, however no phone numbers can be saved as a contact with the new
 Skype for iOS. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What you can do is to save the numbers under your native phone book. Then go back to your account, unsync first and synced back
 again your native contacts from your native phone book with Skype. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have further questions, kindly reply to this thread.
</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD with various errors.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys so I have bought a NVME M2 Samsung SSD and it was sometimes giving me headaches because it would disappear and I would have to turn off the PC in order to make it reappear. Sometimes I would get a DPC Watchdog Violation error when trying install
 the driver provided by Samsung. This happened on my main PC the one we discuss here and also on an Intel NUC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since yesterday I removed the SSD and put it in my NUC to try and fix it there but now my main PC is giving me some errors. First it was a Memory_Management, I ran the Memory Test from Windows and it said the memory might have problems but I also used the
 method here:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983 with driver verifier and it crashed immediately but without giving a clear error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a zip file with the DMP files, my specs as txt, xml and .speccy depending on which is faster for you and the msinfo32 file. I hope it should be enough.
</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!AnadNY_qzV9qgvRUGa4bpXF8VPe_JQ</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also created a SrtTrail.txt but it keeps saying G:\Windows while my Windows is installed on C:</p>

<p>1. If Memtest86 says there is at least 1 error in the memory, you need to replace the Memory stick. If you have multiple Sticks, try running the test with One Stick at a time. The one which shows errors in red means the Stick is faulty.</p>
<p>2. BugCheck C4 i.e. Driver Verifier blames Virtual Box Driver was trying to corrupt the system, so uninstalling Virtualbox and reinstalling it might fix your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I feel here, 1 supersedes 2 so defective memory might be the reason why Vbox Driver was trying to corrupt the system.</p>
<p>Edit: Some might disagree, but you can try uninstalling the Virtualbox and watch out for the BSODs occurrence.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply! The one that said there was an error was Microsoft's Memory Diagnostic tool. I let Memtest86 to run overnight and in close to 10 hours didn't find anything.</p>

<h2>            Buying digital version of game from Xbox Marketplace on NTSC Xbox 360 console</h2>
                    I live in Europe but I have USA version of xbox 360 console (NTSC). I wonder whether game bought and downloaded from xbox marketplace by my european microsoft account will work on my console. I'd like to buy Read Dead Redemption but I'm afraid it won't
 be working due to these region locks, like in physical DVD games because European PAL games won't run on my console (there's one exception because I borrowed RDR PAL edition from my friend and it somehow was working on my NTSC console but only this one game)

            The game should work fine on your ntsc console. Just to confirm though, you could ask
<a href="http://www.rockstargames.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
rockstar games</a> if it will work just to be sure.

    <title>Microsoft&#58; Are you reading this&#63; You should be ashamed. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benjamin mcmillan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#58; Are you reading this&#63; You should be ashamed.</h2>
                    <div><br />
I'm a programmer (10+ years experience, 4 non-continuous years with the MS stack, the other 6+ on *nix platforms) and overall tech enthusiast. Been using computers since before Win 3.1. As a software developer, I know about development life cycles, QA process,
 and the like, even for hardware.&nbsp;I knew that the Surface Book would have some issues with it being a first generation device, but also knew that it shared a lot of technology with the 4th generation Surface Pro, so it's not purely 1st generation. And I trusted
 that Microsoft, now under a new and exciting CEO, learned from their embarassing failures with the Surfaces before 3, as well as X-Box. Surface 3 was great, and Surface 4 should be close to Apple-level perfection (yes, I know Apple isn't perfect - it's a relative
 baseline for the industry). I also knew that updates would be released immediately after and in the weeks following the launch date, because I know how hard getting engineering to meet arbitrary deadlines from the marketing department is. I know Microsoft
 engineers personally, and they're very smart people. And I trusted that Microsoft's [mis-]management was being corrected.</div>
<div><br />
I'm also a patient person, very patient. I have given Microsoft the benefit of the doubt through my patience, and through my spending countless hours installing updates, restoring from backups, re-installing Windows. That's just the way Microsoft does things
 - when in doubt, reboot. I have also contributed some to online forums to hopefully help others and have evangelized Microsoft and the Surface Book in real life.
</div>
<div><br />
I'm now being punished for my believing in and being patient with the Microsoft brand.</div>
<div><br />
For the first few weeks, I experienced issues. The same issues everyone else was reporting on Microsoft Answers forums, and 3rd party forums. Good, I thought, I wasn't the only one. Must be software issues, I thought. Like I said before, this was absolutely
 expected on my part. I get it. I empathize with the engineers who should be working in shifts, using the Surface Book or Pro 4, to finish what they couldn't complete before the hardware was flashed at the factory. And updates came. And they seemed to resolve
 some major issues. Not all of them, but I could see progress was being made.</div>
<div><br />
Thus, I spent a few days after each update and fix to test whether it worked. Since some problems were nondeterministic, unrepeatable bugs, I knew it was just a matter of time and arbitrary input (in the QA sense). I still had issues.</div>
<div><br />
Finally, an apology came from Microsoft in late 2015. Hold on, they said. We're about to release some major updates in 2016 to fix power handling, among other problems. Great!!</div>
<div>Updates came, and helped some. But in early 2016 everyone was talking about how Windows Update was corrupting important system files, among many many other issues. I started having lots of issues. Random, unrepeatable.</div>
<div><br />
- Chrome chrases constantly, even after a re-install of everything, and their developers are stumped as to why.</div>
<div>- The keyboard base would disconnect losing typing and mouse touchpad capabilities until I reboot or disconnect then reattach the clipboard (see below).</div>
<div>- The clipboard would refuse to disconnect, or do so one side at a time (but not enough to actually allow release).</div>
<div>- Pressing the start menu or windows keyboard button produces a critical error that asks to sign out to fix. Nothing but restoring from backup or re-installing fixed it. But when I did, it came back just days later.</div>
<div>- Sometimes the display would be completely blank, or somehow corrupt. The right-side action sidebar would be transparent, or the same with the start menu, or the start menu would be missing the buttons for Power, Apps, Settings, and more.
</div>
<div>- Sometimes would wake up from sleep or hibernate, but not 100% always. Not even 90%.</div>
<div>- Pings from the terminal to a domain name or IP would work, but nothing could actually connect to the internet - not any browser, not the Dropbox or OneDrive services.
</div>
<div>- Windows Hello would work well for a day, then not work at all till re-install.</div>
<div><br />
And these are in addition to the battery barely lasting 7 hours, not 12 as promised (yes, I know you can only get the advertised battery life by not actually using the machine, ha). I also have put up with issues that seem to be more the fault of Windows 10
 on any laptop, like scaling for high resolution displays, especially when one display is different resolution and scaling % than the other. Sometimes apps will be blurry, or the entire screen will be of garbage DPI until I reboot.</div>
<div>
<p>Some of these issues and more are plainly documented on the Microsoft-hosted Answers forums by many other SB owners.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Fast forward to today. After spending 12 hours 2 days ago re-installing Windows and all of my applications, and getting them setup to be productive, issues that prevent any productivity cropped up again. I knew that others were able to get exchanges at the
 MS store, so that's where I went today.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Even though the issues were reproduceable at the store and even though I had the supplemental support/replacement plan Microsoft took my hard-earned money for, I was met with options that I found unacceptable. The first option was to have them re-install
 Windows in the store. I'm not going to take that BS fix that I know is not much more than the "did try rebooting?" delay tactic of Microsoft. Or, I could let them place a $2700 hold on my credit card and then wait 2-3 days (they say guaranteed, but I know
 others have waited longer) for the replacement in the mail. I did not have a credit card in hand that has $2700 available, and even if I did, it would mean I couldn't really buy anything until that hold was voided - I assume if/when they receive the old laptop.
 Or I could send the laptop in and wait a week or more to receive it or another one back, thus losing more than $2k of income because I didn't have a laptop to work on.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After speaking to the manager and being frank, they said I could use my "Complete" warranty plan to pay $49 and receive a brand new laptop in the store. But doing so would fulfill that warranty, thus voiding it. I weighed my options. I decided to employ
 a strategy of minimizing risk and minimizing productivity loss. I chose this option so that I could hopefully get on with my work that is now piling up. I was angry and frustrated with the fact that I had to choose the lesser of evils, but my work needs to
 get done, so to home I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft: I understand if you cannot apologize explicitly, but you can at least admit implicitly that this is indeed COMPLETELY YOUR FAULT -- not mine -- by&nbsp;giving me a new machine without questions. That is the level of service that any company
 like yours should embrace proudly, through war or peace.</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I get home, turn it on, and go through the setup. During the 4 hours of setup, updates, reboots, I was met with: blank screens that did not convey any sort of resolution - had to hold down the power button 30 seconds to resolve; blank screens with a single
 "hourglass" cursor in the middle that lasted for 20 minutes until I forced reboot, again; a BIOS error message that said that it couldn't boot the OS; and finally, once all updats were applied, detection of corrupt system files according to sfc.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Microsoft: Is that the experience you want your customers to have? You should be ashamed and embarrassed.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now in possession of a laptop that, really, can only be sold to another poor chum, at a discount, or I continue my conversations with legal counsel. Then I'll buy an Apple product, because although I absolutely loathe Apple's philosophy on engineering,
 at least they can deliver on their promises. Microsoft cannot say that -- they do promise, but they don't deliver. And heck, I'm ignoring the seedy **** Microsoft pulled decades ago, because I believe they have changed. Again, my faith in the Microsoft brand
 has failed me. </p>

            <p>Well said. This is essentially exactly what I've been thinking (minus the experience with support -- I haven't bothered, and I didn't buy MS Complete).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While my problems with my own Surface Book (bought on launch day in the USA at a local Microsoft Store) are not nearly as bad as yours, they are bad, and they make the machine equally useless when compared with how it was advertised/presented. I wish I felt
 like a class action lawsuit would get anywhere, but I don't (I'm certainly not a lawyer, but I just don't see how any of us could win anything). I've just been ready to swallow it all as one very tough, expensive lesson learned (and right now I'm very glad
 to have only bought the i5/dGPU model and spent just shy of $2,000 USD rather than the top end model for nearly $3k).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding selling the SB to some other poor soul at a discount ... I can't bring myself to do it at all. I'm just really, really glad that I still have my old Surface Pro 3 and that I have not upgraded it to Windows 10 just yet.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<div><br />
I'm a programmer (10+ years experience, 4 non-continuous years with the MS stack, the other 6+ on *nix platforms) and overall tech enthusiast. Been using computers since before Win 3.1. As a software developer, I know about development life cycles, QA process,
 and the like, even for hardware.&nbsp;I knew that the Surface Book would have some issues with it being a first generation device, but also knew that it shared a lot of technology with the 4th generation Surface Pro, so it's not purely 1st generation. And I trusted
 that Microsoft, now under a new and exciting CEO, learned from their embarassing failures with the Surfaces before 3, as well as X-Box. Surface 3 was great, and Surface 4 should be close to Apple-level perfection (yes, I know Apple isn't perfect - it's a relative
 baseline for the industry). I also knew that updates would be released immediately after and in the weeks following the launch date, because I know how hard getting engineering to meet arbitrary deadlines from the marketing department is. I know Microsoft
 engineers personally, and they're very smart people. And I trusted that Microsoft's [mis-]management was being corrected.</div>
<div><br />
I'm also a patient person, very patient. I have given Microsoft the benefit of the doubt through my patience, and through my spending countless hours installing updates, restoring from backups, re-installing Windows. That's just the way Microsoft does things
 - when in doubt, reboot. I have also contributed some to online forums to hopefully help others and have evangelized Microsoft and the Surface Book in real life.
<div><br />
I'm now being punished for my believing in and being patient with the Microsoft brand.</div>
<div><br />
For the first few weeks, I experienced issues. The same issues everyone else was reporting on Microsoft Answers forums, and 3rd party forums. Good, I thought, I wasn't the only one. Must be software issues, I thought. Like I said before, this was absolutely
 expected on my part. I get it. I empathize with the engineers who should be working in shifts, using the Surface Book or Pro 4, to finish what they couldn't complete before the hardware was flashed at the factory. And updates came. And they seemed to resolve
 some major issues. Not all of them, but I could see progress was being made.</div>
<div><br />
Thus, I spent a few days after each update and fix to test whether it worked. Since some problems were nondeterministic, unrepeatable bugs, I knew it was just a matter of time and arbitrary input (in the QA sense). I still had issues.</div>
<div><br />
Finally, an apology came from Microsoft in late 2015. Hold on, they said. We're about to release some major updates in 2016 to fix power handling, among other problems. Great!!</div>
<div>Updates came, and helped some. But in early 2016 everyone was talking about how Windows Update was corrupting important system files, among many many other issues. I started having lots of issues. Random, unrepeatable.</div>
<div><br />
- Chrome chrases constantly, even after a re-install of everything, and their developers are stumped as to why.</div>
<div>- The keyboard base would disconnect losing typing and mouse touchpad capabilities until I reboot or disconnect then reattach the clipboard (see below).</div>
<div>- The clipboard would refuse to disconnect, or do so one side at a time (but not enough to actually allow release).</div>
<div>- Pressing the start menu or windows keyboard button produces a critical error that asks to sign out to fix. Nothing but restoring from backup or re-installing fixed it. But when I did, it came back just days later.</div>
<div>- Sometimes the display would be completely blank, or somehow corrupt. The right-side action sidebar would be transparent, or the same with the start menu, or the start menu would be missing the buttons for Power, Apps, Settings, and more.
<div>- Sometimes would wake up from sleep or hibernate, but not 100% always. Not even 90%.</div>
<div>- Pings from the terminal to a domain name or IP would work, but nothing could actually connect to the internet - not any browser, not the Dropbox or OneDrive services.
<div>- Windows Hello would work well for a day, then not work at all till re-install.</div>
<div><br />
And these are in addition to the battery barely lasting 7 hours, not 12 as promised (yes, I know you can only get the advertised battery life by not actually using the machine, ha). I also have put up with issues that seem to be more the fault of Windows 10
 on any laptop, like scaling for high resolution displays, especially when one display is different resolution and scaling % than the other. Sometimes apps will be blurry, or the entire screen will be of garbage DPI until I reboot.</div>
<div>
<p>Some of these issues and more are plainly documented on the Microsoft-hosted Answers forums by many other SB owners.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Fast forward to today. After spending 12 hours 2 days ago re-installing Windows and all of my applications, and getting them setup to be productive, issues that prevent any productivity cropped up again. I knew that others were able to get exchanges at the
 MS store, so that's where I went today.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Even though the issues were reproduceable at the store and even though I had the supplemental support/replacement plan Microsoft took my hard-earned money for, I was met with options that I found unacceptable. The first option was to have them re-install
 Windows in the store. I'm not going to take that BS fix that I know is not much more than the "did try rebooting?" delay tactic of Microsoft. Or, I could let them place a $2700 hold on my credit card and then wait 2-3 days (they say guaranteed, but I know
 others have waited longer) for the replacement in the mail. I did not have a credit card in hand that has $2700 available, and even if I did, it would mean I couldn't really buy anything until that hold was voided - I assume if/when they receive the old laptop.
 Or I could send the laptop in and wait a week or more to receive it or another one back, thus losing more than $2k of income because I didn't have a laptop to work on.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>After speaking to the manager and being frank, they said I could use my "Complete" warranty plan to pay $49 and receive a brand new laptop in the store. But doing so would fulfill that warranty, thus voiding it. I weighed my options. I decided to employ
 a strategy of minimizing risk and minimizing productivity loss. I chose this option so that I could hopefully get on with my work that is now piling up. I was angry and frustrated with the fact that I had to choose the lesser of evils, but my work needs to
 get done, so to home I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft: I understand if you cannot apologize explicitly, but you can at least admit implicitly that this is indeed COMPLETELY YOUR FAULT -- not mine -- by&nbsp;giving me a new machine without questions. That is the level of service that any company
 like yours should embrace proudly, through war or peace.</strong></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I get home, turn it on, and go through the setup. During the 4 hours of setup, updates, reboots, I was met with: blank screens that did not convey any sort of resolution - had to hold down the power button 30 seconds to resolve; blank screens with a single
 "hourglass" cursor in the middle that lasted for 20 minutes until I forced reboot, again; a BIOS error message that said that it couldn't boot the OS; and finally, once all updats were applied, detection of corrupt system files according to sfc.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Microsoft: Is that the experience you want your customers to have? You should be ashamed and embarrassed.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now in possession of a laptop that, really, can only be sold to another poor chum, at a discount, or I continue my conversations with legal counsel. Then I'll buy an Apple product, because although I absolutely loathe Apple's philosophy on engineering,
 at least they can deliver on their promises. Microsoft cannot say that -- they do promise, but they don't deliver. And heck, I'm ignoring the seedy **** Microsoft pulled decades ago, because I believe they have changed. Again, my faith in the Microsoft brand
 has failed me. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every single issue you listed I have experienced with the exception of Chrome crashing (using 64 bit and since an update last month hasn't happened, although now I worry).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I come on here and vent, but somehow, while they have posted "we are listening" about 2 months ago, NOTHING, and I mean ZERO has changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can actually argue that some issues were solves while others were added.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I pains me because I actually am starting to believe that there's a group of interns that are troubleshooting this in their spare time, while MS works on something else.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said before, 30-40 employees would have switched if my experience was great or even good (I am responsible for all sales enablement tools and training), but obviously, that's not happening (this is where Apple benefits from MS's poor handing of all
 of this). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to see someone who has been dedicated to MS as you have is venting as well.&nbsp;

            <p>It's sad that there aren't more of us complaining very, very loudly and everywhere (not just here). I don't know about you guys, but I grow tired of the amazing reviews the Surface Book has received around the web. Every single one of them feels like a gigantic
 slap in my face when they glaze over some of the nagging problems and praise MS for "fixing" the sleep problem. I want to scream about everything else that's wrong (in addition to sleep not being totally fixed), but it's pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have been a dedicated MS fan/user for many, many years (from Windows 3.1 all the way to present). I build machines, but I've also owned many Surface models (Pro 2, Pro 3, RT, and Surface 2 prior to this) -- every single one of them was better than
 the Surface Book. Every laptop I've ever owned in my lifetime was better than the Surface Book is at present. That is an awful thing to have to say, but it is true.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to swallow that MS frankly just doesn't care about us, but that's how it appears. I'm sad, because it also means that I'm not likely to buy another Surface device (possibly for many years), and I thought they were some of the best machines on the
 market until the Surface Book destroyed that. I used to recommend Surfaces to family &amp; friends, but no more. It looks like I'll be recommending other brands from now on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope MS is listening ... they have lost some loyal customers over this debacle by not only refusing to own up to it, but also because they have yet to live up to their promises. Until my Surface Book works as advertised, I'll be here complaining regularly.
 It's the only thing I can do.</p>

            <p>It's official.&nbsp; Received iPad Pro 12 inch with pencil. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I read how this SB was so much more powerful and took the iPad Pro for a spin.&nbsp; Let's see:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Office 2016?&nbsp; Check</p>
<p>2. Microsoft OneDrive Compatible? Check</p>
<p>3. Fast start up?&nbsp; Double Check</p>
<p>4. All apps needed for Productivity?&nbsp; Check</p>
<p>5. Snap Screen Compatibility?&nbsp; Check</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to figure out why my SB would be so much more powerful? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on the record saying I prefer Windows.&nbsp; I WANT windows.&nbsp; But I have to work.&nbsp; I need to have a pen.&nbsp; I need to ensure I can boot up fast, perform PPT's, and get work DONE without multiple restarts and resets.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, so good the last week.&nbsp; Haven't had a single issue with the NEW Pro.&nbsp; Funny...Apple makes a new device and I haven't had a screen freeze up on me yet, let alone multiple restarts, yellowing of my screen, screen flickering, etc?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm getting the same 8 hours on this with heavy use that I get on the supposed SB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT an Apple Fan boy at all BTW.&nbsp; I wanted to get away from Apple.&nbsp; MS drove me back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selling my SB on Ebay and I will let people know the issues, hoping my $2500 machine will get me $1000</p>

            <p>Well, to be fair, Apple didn't port OSX to the iPad and iOS should be expected to be rock solid after several years of iterations. I get that Windows 10 is a special beast, running on desktop PCs as well as mobile devices and the Xbox One, these were non-trivial
 changes to the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself lucky to have an SB that is fairly stable. I do have some problems (Hello Windows camera when plugged in while hibernating, SB not powering down and getting hot inside its bag and a few more), but I can work around most of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is completely unacceptable though, is that <strong>Microsoft is out of touch with its customer base</strong>. Every other year some actual Microsoft employee crops up, telling us they were aware of the issues and working hard on a fix - only to disappear
 right after for what feels like a year or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime we have to make do with these so-called supporters on this forum, most of which keep singing the same mantra 'we're so sorry to hear that you have issues. install the latest updates, try a reset' (funnily it's the same advice for any device,
 SB, Band 2,... you name it)&nbsp;. Dudes, we're not dumb, we have done that many times over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get the impression these forums are just a place to vent - in order to prevent the customer from posting somewhere else where other people might see what a mess these products really are. Maybe I'm being paranoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have been in the market for a 950XL, but have given up on that idea because Windows Mobile 10 appears to be just as bad, if not worse. And because I know that if there should be trouble (and I'm positive there would be) I'd be left to my own devices
 (pun not intended) as always with anything Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is something that hasn't changed since Nadella took over. Hope springs eternal.</p>

<p>Hi, there is no Xbox One version of GTA 4, only the backward compatible version, which is a 360 version of the game anyway. Make sure you're logged in, and goto multiplayer on the game, and invite him the usual way, he should then get the invite for him
 to accept. If you meant GTA 5, then no you cannot play with someone who has the Xbox 360 version of the game.</p>

<h3> valentinatrifonova  say:</h3>
<h2>            U2Message external exception C06D007E</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I need help opening a program called U2Message. A month ago I had no problem opening it. Now, no matter how and where I install the program it gives me the following error: External Exception C06D007E. After that the program opens and it freezes and not
 responding. When I close the program it gives me: Access violation on address 77DBC7B in module "combase.dll". Read of address 0100000F. This is only for this program. I do not have problem with other program I install.
</p>
<p>The system is :</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro x64 OS Build 10240</p>
<p>Intel Core i5</p>
<p>RAM 8GB</p>
<p>All drivers are up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need this program for my mobile printer it use it. The database is in the SD card.</p>
<p>A friend of my have a computer and I installed the program there and it opens at first glance. Its running Windows 7 though.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions...&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for the suggestion, but it did not help. I just did a clean boot, after that started the program in admin mode and it gave me the same error, but with other message: Access violation at 73D58FD1 in module "msado15.dll". Read of address 8B55FF8B.
 I guess the problem is elsewhere.

            <p>For everyone who could face such a problem,</p>
<p>I found a temporary solution by installing virtual OS and there is no problem working with the printer and the program. I guess that one of the many updates in Win10 caused the problem to occur. The question is what exactly?</p>

<p>Just to update &nbsp;the situation:</p>
<p>Still cannot run the &nbsp;program normally. It gives me error: External Exception C06D007E with admin rights when I start the program on Windows 10. But now it doesn't give any clues what's wrong. There is no message when I force to close the program.&nbsp;</p>
