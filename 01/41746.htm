            This problem sporadically appears; not really sure if the problem is in my internet connection or with Cortana because it works sometimes and suddenly when i ask some other question it says something like "The internet and I are not talking right now".

            <p>Hello, I was having this same issue except my interests did not work, i am on a standard user account, not admin. If this is the case then please try these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ask your administrator to log in and change your account to an Admin account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Log out of their account</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Log into your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Check if cortana works. If so, great</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If the admin is fine with you staying as an admin account then your done, if not, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have the admin log into their account</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Switch you back to a standard user</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Log out of Admin account and log into your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. She should still be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know why this works, or why you should even have to do it in the first place, but I hope this helps! :)</p>

            Nothing I do helps. It hasn't resolved itself for 147 days, and signing out of my account, switching to a local one, and signing back in does not help. I can't figure out why its doing this and i really miss cortana. Please Help! It's definitely not internet
 related btw. Does it have to do with the fact that my wifi is stuck on a bridge with the ethernet? Whenever I try to "remove from bridge" Windows says "An unexpected error occurred when disconnecting from bridge.". PLEASE HELP!

            I am getting the same problem using Cortana and it happened as soon as cumulative updates were installed on my system by Microsoft Update. &nbsp;When I ask Cortana and questions, it is unable to interpret my voice and replies,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"The

<p>I did without Cortana here in UK for several months because this problem was so frustrating. I have just reset the laptop and thought I'd see if Cortana was any better....it wasn't.

                    I have an Acer XC-605 with 6gb RAM, 1TB HDD, and Intel i3 4160&nbsp;running Windows 10 and I always get high memory usage by ntoskrnl.exe Its memory will even increase whenever programs/apps are open. When its in idle, the disk will spike up to 100%. I tried
 Disk defrag, cleanup and I even run a memory checker using CMD. I have no other problems or viruses what so ever with this computer other than this issue. Any help?

            I ran the System File Checker and there was nothing wrong so I did the Clean Boot and the problem was still there. My Win 10 is already fully updated. So am assuming that I might have to disable some Microsoft Services or something else.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the same problem. my computer was extremely slow, could barely click anything.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the latest windows update which was : (KB3124263)</p>
<p>After reboot it worked without any problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing curious to me is that my RAM exploded to 99% literally 14 days after the update was installed.</p>
<p>It worked fine after the update was installed at first.</p>
<p>That makes me very suspicious.</p>
<p>Can the windows support answer to this maybe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
Carl

<h2>            Administrator Blocking Software Download</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new computer from Best Buy and I am the only user (i.e. the only Administrator).&nbsp; I want to download new software but I keep getting messages from Windows telling me that User Account Control (i.e. some other Administrator) is blocking me
 from downloading.&nbsp; I need to get this fixed.</p>

To add to all the excellent advice...</p>
<p>You could - if you already have an unused retail license for Windows XP - download and utilize VirtualBox to make your own virtual Windows XP machine which would, in reality, be able to do more than the XP Mode would in some ways.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To add a bit to the excellent tips from TrekDozer and Andre :<br />
<br />
<strong>(XP mode requires Professional, Ultimate, or Enterprise.)</strong>
<p>Get all the benefits of Windows 7 and continue to leverage your investments in older business and<br />
productivity programs that require a PC running Windows XP. Note: Windows XP Mode requires a<br />
download.<br />

            Hi ClaudioBailly,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Voicemail uses the language which is set up in your Skype client. Click 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Language &gt; Check whether this is set to Portuguese or not.
<br />Also note all devices used by you having Skype, this language needs to be set up to Portuguese.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h3> youngladyof74  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I transfer everything from my old Acer Windows Vista to my new Dell Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, being an old girl my knowledge of computers is very limited but my Acer Aspire 5315 Vista basic has had it's day and I intend to get a new Dell with Windows 7. &nbsp;I have been reading so much on the forums, but mostly old correspondence which I hope
 has now been updated to new technology as everything seems to be either extinct or very complicated. &nbsp;I was hoping it was a simple matter of using a 2-sided USB cable and clicking a button and transferring everything from one to the other.....so naïve. &nbsp;I
 have read that the Windows Easy Transfer system is extinct also with angry people saying Microsoft should not have it on the help section if it doesn't work. &nbsp;Ooooh, so confusing!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please give me an updated i.e. 2015 reply and hopefully a solution to my dilemma?</p>

            <p>I tested Windows 8 before it was released on a Windows Vista unit.&nbsp; The interface is different.&nbsp; It is not the usual Windows Desktop but there is a Windows Desktop included with Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Metro Desktop reminds one of a Windows Phone.&nbsp; You tap a tile to browse or play a game, etc...&nbsp;&nbsp; Many are averse to such changes and if you listen, you'll find many were disgusted with the demise of Windows 98 but readily (years later) accepted Windows 7
 and on it goes.&nbsp; Some of those disgruntled users are now praising Windows 8.1.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I don't find Windows 8.1 that hard to navigate.&nbsp; It does take some getting used to and if I were going to get another computer I would definitely choose to get the current Windows OS.&nbsp; LifeCycle has a lot to do with it.&nbsp; I figure I have 8 good
 years with a&nbsp;WIndows 8.1 unit as opposed to 5 years with a Windows 7 unit.</p>

</p><p>If you'd like, you might post a Discussion Thread regarding the subject to see the various opinions on Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Personally, I like my Windows 8.1 desktop and laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A relative of mine had Windows XP and is overjoyed with Windows 8.1.&nbsp;

            <p>Many thanks again for your advice and patience in looking up all those links for me!!! &nbsp;Looks like I have a lot of reading to do but, as you say, the 8.1 should be an improvement on the 8.0 and hopefully I will be able to learn all the changes as I have
 had this, my very first laptop/computer, for about 7 years and was wondering why it was suddenly behaving so badly, thought it would last me forever!!!! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, thanks again, and a Happy New Year to you. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello, a couple of days ago, after the latest update, my fingerprint sign in stopped working, I tried to reactivate it but without luck. I have already updated my available drivers, downloaded and installed the driver from Lenovo's webpage and nothing seems
 to work. There is a message saying that Windows Hello isn't available for my device, but it was before the update. I have windows pro 64-bit, Intel Core i5-4300M CPU@ 2.60GHz. Thank you.<br />

<h2>            Skype wiped all of my account data</h2>
                    <p>I have a Skype phone number that I pay for every month, for the last 8 YEARS. Today I received an email notification that my payment didn't work, which was odd given that I specifically remember updating my account and payment details just 6 months ago.
 I log into my Skype account and notice and ALL information has been wiped. No billing address, no saved credit card information, no record that I have a Skype number, no record that I had set up auto-recharge, no purchase history. 8 years of data - GONE. How
 do I even know if my paid Skype number is working?</p>
<p>

</p><p>When you sign in to the Skype website but your profile information is not appearing correctly, it can be because you're signed in to a different account. As a suggestion, please sign out of Skype, then sign back in using your correct Skye Name, email or
 phone number depending on what you used when yu created your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you were able to access your account, please follow the steps on this support article to update the payment method for your Skype Number:

            Hi there,
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes it was a corrupted file and could not be copied using a different computer.The clean boot method did not work either.Instead, I edited the video using 'convert/save' feature available in VLC media player by skipping part of the file from
 46th % to 56th %.That saved my video,though by losing a bit of it but still better than losing the whole of it.In the process I learned about clean boot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Marcia,
<div><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You have mentioned that you have deleted the mail app and now the calendar and people apps have disappeared and you would like to install them back. We’ll help you with this issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The mail, Calendar, Messenger and People come as a group. So if you uninstall even one of these apps, all the three apps will be uninstalled. But you need not worry, you can install them back from store app. Refer these steps:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Go to the store app in start screen and press <strong>Windows key +C<br />
</strong>b) Click on<strong> search </strong>and type “<strong>mail</strong>” and press enter<br />
c) In the search results, locate the app “<strong>Mail, Calender, people and Messaging</strong>” under productivity category and install it.<br />
d) Once installed, go to start screen, right click on the Mail app and click on “<strong>Unpin from start</strong>” to hide just that particular app.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. If you have any other queries related to Windows, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.<br />

    <title>My Surface book 2 keeps changing brightness by itself. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Surface book 2 keeps changing brightness by itself.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am using a 15-inch Surface Book 2. It's 256gb and 16gb ram. It has Nvidia gtx 1060 graphics card and Intel UHD graphics 620.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned my computer on today and realized that the brightness wasn't set to 100%. I tried using the keyboard brightness key and taskbar notification page to change the brightness. Neither of them worked. The only way is to go to settings and slide the brightness
 bar but as soon as I turn off settings the screen dims itself very slowly making it unrealizable. But it gets obvious as soon as you enter settings page again.</p>
<p>My battery setting is set to best performance, I disabled auto brightness and battery saver. This happened after using night light feature yesterday night. I also tried to reboot the computer twice by pressing the power button for about 10 seconds until
 I see the windows logo again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot pin Microsoft Solitaire Collection to start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruceinemmaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot pin Microsoft Solitaire Collection to start menu</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer. It came with Windows 10 installed. Until a few days ago, Microsoft Solitaire Collection was pinned to the Start Menu. It no longer appears there. Searched for discussions of the problem and found previous descriptions of exactly the
 same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those suggestions works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In settings-&gt;apps, I reset Microsoft Solitaire Collection and restarted. No change.</p>
<p>2. I changed my windows logon to my microsoft account, and restarted.</p>
<p>3. Opened Microsoft Store from the start menu. I was already logged in with my m-soft account. I searched for Microsoft Solitaire Collection.&nbsp; It now indicates it's XBox Live (no idea why), says "This product is installed," and the "Pin to Start" option
 is grayed out. When I click play, it's now "Premium Edition" with an Xbox button. "Downloads and Updates" has Microsoft Solitaire Collection modified today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to pin the app to the start menu, to have it as it was when I bought Windows 10 on this machine, rather than the multi-step process of going through the store, etc., etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can that be done?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. I checked settings to ensure I have the latest build, and status is up to date.<br />
</p>
<p>B. I tried the 3 steps in the linked thread (see below) - did not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Step 1. Microsoft Solitaire Collection appears in setting-&gt;apps. Clicked Reset. Cache sized changed. Does not appear in apps list, or pinned to start.</p>
<p>Step 2. Uninstall - reinstall. Did that twice 1) selected "Pin to Start" after the Store install when the option appeared. App didn't appear in apps or pinned to start. 2) uninstalled, reinstalled from Store. Did not select "Pin to Start" after the Store
 install.&nbsp;App didn't appear in apps or pinned to start.</p>
<p>Step 3. Performed the steps using Powershell as admin, entering the commands using cut-and-paste from the thread article.&nbsp;App didn't appear in apps or pinned to start.</p>
<p>- Checked system recovery - Restore option not available.</p>
<p>- Did not Reset Windows.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update, Bruce. Since you've already done a significant amount of troubleshooting, I suggest that you do an In-place upgrade next. This process overwrites your current Windows OS with a new one and can resolve many issues while retaining
 your personal files. Follow <strong>PaulSey</strong>'s instructions on this <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">thread</a></strong> on how you can do this.</p>

    <title>Completely clean install of windows 10, abosolutly nothing works right - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scou11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Completely clean install of windows 10, abosolutly nothing works right</h2>
                    <p>I just installed windows 10 fresh on a empty computer (no previous versions of windows, brand new harddrive) and keep having issues. First none of my programs would stay open, they acted like they were going to open then would instantly close (Skyrim is
 the one I messed with the most, but this happened with multiple programs). I found some possible fixes, but when I tried to implemented those my start menu stopped working (as well as a few other things, like the ability to create a new user and such). I dug
 around for a while looking for a solution to that, all the suggested ones didn't work (everyone and there mother suggested using "<span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}"
 but that wouldn't do anything for me, in fact it may have been what broke it in the first place).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span>Eventually I stumbled upon&nbsp;something talking about update KB3036140 and how it was supposed to fix the start menu issue. I checked and my copy did not have that update, but when I hit "check for updates" I was told my computer
 was up to date. I tried downloading the update manually, but when I run the file I downloaded I get the error 0x800b0101 "A required certificate is not within its validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed
 file." I also looked around and it appears I am missing multiple other updates as well.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)"><span>So finally I went ahead and did a system repair, clearing out all my installed files and letting windows 10 reinstall. So now I just launched it, start menu works but Edge won't open, have to do everything in IE (don't want
 to install Firefox or anything third party until I can be sure that the install is stable). And it still won't download
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">KB3036140&nbsp; or other updates (if it's supposed to, as of right now I don't even know).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">My last option I guess is completely wipe the drive and install from scratch, but I literally installed windows less then 2 days ago, so I don't know how much that will help (and I don't want to get locked out due to product key
 being used twice). Anyone have any idea of where I should go from here? If it's in the top 10 search results I've probably already attempted it, but I guess it wouldn't hurt to mention it again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">This is the most frustrated I have ever been with a Microsoft OS at this point (yes, more then Vista or even ME). I hear Windows 10 is great, I would love to try it out.</span></p>

            Have you tried dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth in admin command prompt? I would try and reinstall windows 10 after you have done a memory test and drive check using memtest86 or the bios. Usually if you have a lot of issues like that the RAM
 is bad or the motherboard or hardware doesn't have compatible chipset drivers

            I did try that too, doesn't seem to be fixing anything (basically everything is telling me there is no problem to fix). I've done some component checks but I haven't done a memtest86 check yet, so I guess I'll try that then do a full fresh install. But
 I'm still mostly concerned by the fact that I might not be getting all the updates, unless my copy of 10 came with some updates by default but doesn't list those updates anywhere.

            <p>You could have gotten updates installed in cumulative updates. I think you can see all updates by typing sysinfo in a command prompt or system info in Cortana. I'll have to get back to you on that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the last update you have shown? You can also go to the kb page for the update number you listed and download the standalone version manually. If you have the ability update it tell you or fail to install with a error code that says it is installed
 or not needed Bing.com for that kb</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Controllers</h2>
                    I'm experiencing problems with every Xbox One controller i have. I had two controllers originally that both started playing up at around the same time about 6 months ago so i bought a new controller a few days ago and it's not working properly either,
 I'm experiencing glitchy problems on a number of different games with my controllers and not sure what's going on and if it's a console issue as it doesn't seem to matter what controller i use none of them are working properly?

            So for example I play Fifa and on that my players flick the ball over their head when I'm not asking them to all the time, on Gta when driving my camera angle will change for no apparent reason and even on my Xbox home screen when trying to click on something
 sometimes it will go right past the thing I'm trying to click on even if i only press the analog stick to go down once it will go right past it. The controller I bought a few days ago is even worse when playing Fifa as my players just stop still when controlling
 the ball and my sprint button isn't even working properly and that's on a brand new controller so not sure what's going on to be honest.

            Maybe there's a controller update available? Settings, accessories and then see. It's worth a shot.

<p>They do it on purpose, someone in the xbox team decided this would be a great way to get more money, make it as hard as humanly possible to cancel your subscription. They know people get so fustrated with the phone in support that they would rather just
 waste another month of charges then try to turn off their renewal.</p>

<p>Thats strange cause I just checked mine and I can turn it off, I'm not saying you cant it just may be a glitch. Might help to add a couple of years ago my auto renewal was on and I didnt know and I bought a renewal card at Gamestop but microsoft auto renewed
 before I was able to enter the pin off of the xbox live card. So I called and explained everything and not only did they put the money back in my account but they also gave me a choice of freebies to choose from so I scored a new controller. For the most part
 their customer service is very good...that is if you get an operator that you can understand anything they are saying.</p>

<p>[quote user="DodgeyBarsted12"]X box Live [...] WONT allow you to turn of the Automatic renewal. OR delete your credit card.[/quote]</p>
<p><span>They allow both, of course. Almost all users must call Support to turn off auto-renew. (There's a
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><b><a href="http://support.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Support</a></b></span>
<span>link at the top of the page; click it, then click
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><b>Contact us</b></span><span> to find your region's phone number if you aren't in the U.S.)<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Then, you wait until the profile goes from Gold to Free (Silver); that is, wait until the current paid subscription ends. Once there is no Gold subscription tied to the credit card (even if auto-renewal is turned
 off), you can delete the card from the profile.</span></p>

<p>Hellhog, we all forgot how it is supposed to be so easy for them to take money, yet make it so hard to stop them from doing so in the future. Not sure what you mean at "any service", but PSN doesn't do this (even before teh haxxorz). It seriously takes fifteen

<p>I have to call once a year to stop them from taking my money just to get Gold deals, I try to do it online or on the console and it is seriously like a joke. Except it is just the MS model, so I know it isn't a joke.</p>

<p>Man, you keep saying 90% of services, but all you're giving for examples are cable and phone.</p>
<p>You can't just spew out percentages and expect people to say "OH THERE'S A PERCENTAGE lol this looks legit".</p>
<p>That being said, even if that was an accurate number, it doesn't mean it's okay in this case. XBox Live is an ONLINE service, and things were put in place to keep your account safe and secure, and you can buy all the things you want without require "phone
 verification" but as soon as you want to STOP paying? Forget it.</p>
<p>In all honesty it shouldn't be a big deal but I have severe anxiety problems so... Ahh, I guess I'll just have to pump myself up before making the call.</p>

<p>You do know that if you look in spotlight you can sign up for deals while you have gold (usually the best ones appear in the last 30 days)?</p>
<p>Also to help reinforce a point - Services I have to call to cancel:</p>
<p>My Internet (also has a cancel fee if i want to cancel early, and has a contract)</p>
<p>My TV (same as internet)</p>
<p>My Cell Phone (same as internet)</p>
<p>My Credit Card </p>

<h2>            HTML5 video doesn&#39;t play properly after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10, HTML5 videos on You-tube and other sites do not play properly.&nbsp; About 1 second of video plays, then that 1 second of video repeats about 6 times.&nbsp; Then the video moves on to display the 2nd second of content, and then the 6ish
 &nbsp;repeats happen again until eventually moving to the 3rd second, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem occurs with both IE11 and Edge browsers.&nbsp; I have not tried Google browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer is an HP Pavilion X2.&nbsp; All hardware drivers have been updated to the latest according to Windows 10 device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Flash videos play OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Software rendering instead of GPU rendering does not affect the video playback behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp; Running SFC/scannow did not find any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to correct this problem or what to try?</p>

            <p>Joy:</p>
<p>The article on setting up HTML5 videos didn't help, but after much searching&nbsp;I did find a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem was caused by the IDT High Definition Audio Driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 says this driver is the best for my device, but that is not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp; On
 the HP forums, many people have mentioned problems with this driver, although most of the reported problems are sound related rather than repeating video.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not clear why the audio driver would cause video to repeat, but I'm not going to argue with success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to fix where:</p>
<p>1. In Device Manager, select Sound, Video, and Game Controller, then right click&nbsp;IDT High Definition Audio CODEC.</p>
<p>2. Select Update Driver</p>
<p>3. Select &nbsp;-&gt; Browse my computer for driver software.</p>
<p>4. Select -&gt; Let me pickup a list of device drivers on my computer.</p>
<p>5. Select &nbsp;<strong>High Definition Audio Device</strong> (Not &nbsp;IDT High Def... &nbsp;this is important.) and click Next.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Appears Warning message, but reply Yes.</p>
<p>6. ! Windows has successfully update your driver software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Key is step 5.</p>

            <p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. After carrying out some of the suggestions above without success, I started to suspect a hardware fault. After replacing the cable I found the camera would connect as usual. I have a 2 year old son that loves to break cables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have another question about the wireless connection for canon cameras. The computer can no longer be found by the camera Wi-Fi. It used to connect to Windows 7 without drivers, I am sure. Any idea why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>

<h2>            xbox live account</h2>
                    
<p>just got new xbox 360 and hooked it up, everything was going well untill i had to creat a xbox live login, using my hotmail.com account seemed to be fine then it crashed out giving me an error, tryed searching for the error number on the wepsite got nothing.
 tryed repeating the process only to have it error out because my email accont is now associated with another gametag. cant seem to undo this. trying loging on to the xbox.com site to see if i could fix the account issure there and it keeps crashing, tired
 firefox and internet exploer. if i click on the My Account link it crashes, if i click on the sign out it crashes. so far i'm less than impressed with the new system and wondering why its even on the market if this is how they run things. are you sensing that
 im very unhappy and frustrated??? oh did i mention that i'm getting an unknown error when i click on support as well. I just keep getting this "uh oh, that wasnt suppost to happen" message. which is not at all helpfull.</p>

<p>Hey Rook! So it sounds like you created the account, and then when you tried creating it again, it told you it was already in use. Have you tried Recovering the account you just created? Follow the steps we have here:

<p>your are almost correct, never finished creating the account because it errored out during the process. but the recovering procedure didn't work either. thanks for responding though, i have been in contact with the support team who is stumped as well but
 are looking into it.</p>

<p>Hmm, so you created the account far enough for it to register the WLID as taken, but not far enough to let you recover it. That is odd. I'll tell you what, why don't you PM me (envelope below) the GT you tried to create and we'll look into this on our end
 and see if we can't figure out what's going on here. We'll post back when we learn more. Thanks!</p>

<p>Apparently I created this account over 10 years ago (don't remember what it was for!). I continue using it on the daily basis for all Windows Live purposes (Messenger, email, Mesh and so on), but the one for xbox has expired a few years ago. The Customer
 Support representaves told me there is no way to recover it. Is this so? I could create a new one, but all my contacts and emails are associated with this one! Any ideas?</p>
