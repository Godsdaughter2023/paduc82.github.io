                    I can no longer find the "Scan Offline" tool in Windows Defender, and the one that you download from the Microsoft web site also does not work. It can't find the OS Drive. I am running Windows 10 on multiple machines and the "Scan Offline" is missing&nbsp;on
 all of them.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Assistant will not work.</h2>
                    <p>Each time i go to boot up my Alienware 17 R3, it tells me i need to do the security update. Before i am allowed to do said security update, i must update my windows version. I downloaded the Windows 10 Update Assistant and let it do its thing. It either
 will not work or download the update, the computer restarts but then crashes while installing. Saying there has been an error installing the new version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what is wrong. I checked my Anti-Virus company website, webroot.com, and they said their program should not effect the computer from updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what to do?</p>

            I don't recommend you using the Update assistant, instead, you should upgrade manually using the Media Creation Tool or ISO:

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<p>I've been trying to update W10 on a newly purchased PC and got tired of the forever Windows update process and went to the update assistant.&nbsp; It seems to be running in circles, download, updating but never installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will a media creation tool get over this or, do I need to clear out something on the laptop?&nbsp; This is a Dell laptop that started with W10 and it's at version 1607.</p>

<p>Hi Lil Hinninger if your console is in a well ventilated area heat shouldnt be an issue regardless of a bug or no bug. The xbox one by design is built to be used for long periods of time, thats why it has all those vents around it. The coolers lenzio point
 out dont work and also it isnt recommended you put fans like that on your console.</p>

<h2>            Studio1537 laptop keyboard</h2>
                    How do I disable the on-screen keyboard to revert back to using the traditional physical keyboard? If I click the x icon on the top right corner, the on screen keyboard closes but I still cannot use the traditional. I can 't even type in my password at
 the log in page. I have to do the one key at a time bit with on screen keyboard or use external keyboard. I tried your suggestions and nothing changes. Your link 'thread' is no longer working(Dated July 27, 2010, 8:38 PM under on screen keyboard). HELP!!!!
 I am using a Dell Studio 1537 laptop that is about 18 months old and running Windows 7 Upgrade from Vista.

<p><span>Hi liL0Ladehoo,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you turn off On screen keyboard from automatically starting using the below method (only if you have not
 tried it)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 the &nbsp;<strong>Use the computer without a mouse or keyboard</strong> page by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, clicking &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking&nbsp;<strong>Ease of Access</strong>, clicking&nbsp;
<strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>, and then clicking &nbsp;<strong>Use the computer without a mouse or keyboard</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Clear
 the&nbsp;<strong>Use On-Screen Keyboard</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then check and remove entry named “ork” under the startup item in the system configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or
 click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

    <title>SSD vs HDD Detection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l. cearley  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD vs HDD Detection</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading from windows 7 to 10 I have a raid volume that is improperly identified as an SSD and not a HDD. &nbsp;The major issue with this will be attempting to set up a defrag schedule for the HDDs while optimizing the SSDs, attempting to trim only HDDs
 wont do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel z77 chipset using intel sata raid controller, most recent driver version 14.5.0.1081</p>
<p>Array 1: 2x SSD in RAID0 - identified properly as an ssd</p>
<p>Array 2: 4x HDD in RAID5 - identified improperly as an ssd</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to run WinSAT as i know that could help with win 7/8 in identifying what type of drive that is but it did nothing. &nbsp;After that i deleted the result files from winsat and it did nothing so not sure if win 10 is even reading those for this
 info anymore. &nbsp;Attempted looking for any kind of registry value that looked like it could be storing the mediatype of the physical disks but no luck. &nbsp;Powershell can change the medieatype of a pool only so that was no help either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within the program provided by my raid controller (Intel RST) i can see it is properly identifying the drives as array 1 as SSDs and array 2 as HDDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know any workaround for this issue? &nbsp;Or even just where windows 10 gets its information on ssd vs hdd from and/or where it is stored?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The display adapter is responsible on how things in Windows are displayed and perceived by the monitor. We suggest completely removing your display driver and reinstalling the latest version. We would also like to know if the issue persists in other display
 resolution settings to isolate the issue better.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Let us know how it goes.

    <title>Why does the Windows &#40;10&#41; Start menu keep disappearing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does the Windows &#40;10&#41; Start menu keep disappearing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean Win 10 re-installation a couple of weeks ago ... Before that had an upgrade from Win 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>I noted before the clean installation a number of things going wrong including the Win Start not reacting when you click the Start button or the Win key.</p>
<p>At that time, <strong>I tried several different methods suggested here to get the start menu back, but they did not help.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I made a clean install. Of late I have noted the same problem. I have all available updates installed including the latest build. I cannot say when this started because I do not use this often, though it's probably in the last 1 - 3 weeks that it started,
 but it is very irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also on at least one other PC of an acquaintance I use now &amp; then, upgraded from Win 81.1 to 10. Also the start menu does not appear when you click the start button or Windows key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be an issue in Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is what exactly triggers it &amp; how can it be stopped???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I have tried <span><span>Sfc /scannow, which supposedly repaired some things, but which did not include getting the Windows menu back.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>I did follow the steps, but when it came to what comes after RESTART, it got quite confusing.</p>
<p>One is offered 9 options with the F Keys.</p>
<p>As I could see none immediately connected to the Start Menu &amp; still wondering what to do, the PC shut down. On starting it again, the issue was still there. It seems you must choose one of the F key options before you continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is one supposed to go thru running each of the F1 - F9 options &amp; letting it restart or what do you mean with "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span>"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried selecting F1 - after restart - no change</p>
<p>F4 ... leading to restart in Safe mode: ... even in safe mode, the Windows Start menu does not respond after clicking the Start button or Windows key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see how Enabling low resolution video or the other options helps or precisely what am I supposed to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said, if you do not select any of the F key options, the PC completely shuts down after a few moments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do also think this is an issue of Windows 10, because it's the 3rd time it is turning up, the first time a couple of weeks after upgrading to Win 10 from 8.1 &amp; that time, none of the methods suggested here helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this &amp; other issues, I made a fresh install of Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of weeks down the road the issue has reappeared. No idea what triggered it. Moreover as mentioned, another PC upgraded from Win 8.1, used by a friend, the Win 10 Start menu no longer works, no reaction when u click the Start button or Win key!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Observation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>A separate account on laptop</strong><strong> does NOT have the Start menu problem</strong>, which works normally. I wonder what that means?</p>
<p>The one which has is the one I normally use.</p>
<p>

            <p>I installed Windows 10 from a new computer I purchased that had 8.1.&nbsp; The tile menu would not come up when left-clicking the start button.&nbsp; I keep calling Microsoft Support, a total of three times now.&nbsp; Each time, the suggestions fixed the problem and it
 would remain OK for a period of time, averaging perhaps a month or so each time.&nbsp; Then the problem just reappears.&nbsp; Last time, I was told that I could only get the problem fixed by creating a new user, which has to be an email, so I had to create a new email
 address in order to create a new user.&nbsp; Now I have 2 users on a computer which I alone use.&nbsp; This seems ridiculous.&nbsp; On the old user, tiles would still never appear.&nbsp; Now they have stopped again on the new user.'</p>
<p>Does this problem ever end completely?</p>

            <p>I am having exactly the same issue. I also called Microsoft Support. The tech remotely logged in to my laptop but could not fix it. finally he created another account with admin rights which worked. I have been using that account for about a month and now
 the start menu disappeared again :( This is really pathetic and annoying. I keep losing my documents folder and files with other accounts. Seriously thinking to switch to Linux instead and dump Windows 10 for good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem have been reported for a long time with Windows 7, 8 and 10. But Microsoft have not been able to fix this. They need to figure out why User Profile is getting corrupted, there has to be a way to recover or backup user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please someone let me know if they found any solution.</p>

            "Setup.exe" is a generic name used by many, many applications.&nbsp; The short answer is "yes," it's OK to terminate the process, but you really need to find out what it is and why it continues to run.<br />
<br />
You probably should download, install, update, and run these free malware scanners (not simultaneously):<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes AntiMalware</a><br />
<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a><br />
<br />
If that doesn't fix things, and assuming that this process starts when you boot up the computer, download, install, and run
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a>.&nbsp; When Autoruns has finished scanning, click the "Logon" tab and look for the line that contains "setup.exe".&nbsp; You can either just uncheck the box at the left or delete the
 item, either of which will prevent the routine from starting when Windows boots.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Preferably, however, you should look at the path that includes setup.exe from which you should be able to deduce what application is trying to set itself up.&nbsp; You can then take the appropriate action, which may be simply to delete the folder containing the
 file.&nbsp; Note that if you delete the file, you should ALSO delete the line in Autoruns, or you'll get a "file not found" error each time Windows starts.<br />

                    Ok, Win7 Ultimate here, I had been using windows backup utility to backup my C: drive (128Gig SSD) and my data drive which is D: &nbsp;to a third hard drive, E:. &nbsp;My E drive got full so I upgraded it to a 2 tb drive, I disabled the old backup, removed the old
 one, plugged the new 2tb in then set up the backups again. &nbsp;It seemed to start ok, but it never seemed to finish. &nbsp;I can tell by the amount of space used on E that my backup is NOT complete. &nbsp;This was all done a couple weeks ago. &nbsp;I go into control panel &gt;

 one recommendation was to run SFC /SCANNOW, which I did and it said "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations"... so that didnt help. &nbsp;At a loss now, what c

                    I have had a Skype account long before Windows 10. It seems I now have a second one now with Windows 10. Apart from sign in problems caused by this, I now have to keep track of two skype accounts. Can I get rid of the new one and just keep my old one that
 has all my contacts, credits, and histories? If so, how? If not, then what?

<p>Hello tunday(2),</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is to you. I'd be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Skype Name is the username you created when you first joined Skype, other than your email address or phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sign in with an email address instead, then you have a Microsoft account, not a Skype Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, you can bring this two accounts together. That will be a single sign-in for Skype and your other Microsoft services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34657/a-single-sign-in-for-skype-and-your-other-microsoft-services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Hello AidedHawk49! I'm sorry to hear about your dilemma with your Xbox Live account being suspended.&nbsp; Although you sent a E-Mail back to the Xbox Live Enforcement team, there is no guarantee that you will receive a response back in a certain amount of time.&nbsp;
 Most companies use a prioritized first come, first serve basis when it comes to customer support.&nbsp; I assume that Microsoft and the Xbox Live service uses this same system.&nbsp; If there has been a large amount of customer support requests in the last few days,
 then you should be put in the queue in the order you came.&nbsp; I am NOT a Microsoft employee and therefore am only suggesting they use this system.&nbsp; As far as your problem with your account, here's an excerpt from www.support.xbox.com:</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<div><b>Service suspension</b>
<p>Service suspensions are imposed because of inappropriate gameplay or system abuse. Inappropriate conduct includes these kinds of actions:</p>
<p>Inappropriate in-game behavior (scamming or cheating)</p>
<p>Attempts to manipulate Xbox LIVE services through network interference, feedback abuse, complaint abuse, or other system tampering</p>
<p>A service suspension completely blocks a member from being able to sign in to the Xbox LIVE service. The duration of the suspension depends on the frequency or severity of the offense. Temporary suspensions usually end at approximately the same time of day
 as when the suspension was issued.</p>
<b>How you are notified</b>
<p>A message with the suspension end date appears when you sign in to Xbox LIVE with the suspended gamertag.</p>
<p>An email message is sent to the address that is associated with your Xbox LIVE account.</p>
[/quote]</div>
<div>I'm sure the Enforcement team shall assist you soon enough.&nbsp; Until then, this is all the help I can provide.&nbsp; I wish you the best of luck with your dilemma.</div>
<div>Best regards,</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deadlyinslght</div>

            Hi KarenW6 
<br />
<br />If that PhotoStick device has specific software that needs to be installed, the only way to install that software is to take your PC out of S Mode, which is a one-way operation, there will be no way to restore S Mode . . .
<br />
<br />Is that sofrware on the PhotoStick for syncing files to and from the PhotoStick?

            Hi KarenW6
<br />
<br />If it has that functionality, there must be some software providing that functionality and that is why there is a requirement to switch out of S Mode . . .
<br />
<br />Actually, I just checked and there is software on that stick that needs to be installed - ThePhotoStickWindows.exe

 is not possible to return it within the 30 day time limit! Thanks for your help, anyway. k

            Hi.  KarenW6 
<br />
<br />I'm Charles, an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />	You can disable Windows 10 Start in S mode if you want to install programs or applications that are not offered in the Microsoft store. You can not go back to Windows 10 in S mode once you have disabled S mode.
<br />
<br />	To exit S mode in Windows 10, perform the following steps:
<br />
<br />1. On your PC, running Windows 10 in S mode, open Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />2. In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to Store.
<br />
<br />3. On the Exit S (or similar) page that appears in Microsoft Store, select the Get button.
<br />
<br />	Important Note: Windows 10 in S mode has been designed to offer security and performance and runs exclusively in Microsoft Store applications. If you want to install an application that is not available in the Microsoft Store, you must exit the S mode. Exiting the S mode cannot be reversed. If you make the change, you will not be able to go back to Windows 10 in S mode. There is no charge for exiting S mode.
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />Charles.

<h2>            Auto Hide Taskbar Not hiding Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>On Dec 13 2015 there is a request for help from someone whose Taskbar is not auto hiding.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
19 Months later and the problem still exists on my computer even though it is only 9 months old.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
It has appeared only recently and I have followed all the "HELP" but still no joy.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
My work around is to use the "Restore" button top right between - and x. This reduces the app display to about 0.75 of screen size so it is fully readable.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
A proper fix would be better.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Any help please?.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like you're having problems with the auto-hide feature of your taskbar. For us to effectively assist you with your concern, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did you start experiencing the problem?</li><li>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you tried to turn on and off the auto-hide feature, and see if it helps?</li><li>Have you tried turning on the auto-hide function without any apps opened on the taskbar?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure that there are notifications from apps whether on the taskbar or on the system tray that requires your attention, and need to be checked. This is also one of the reasons why the taskbar doesn't automatically hide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>I am not sure when it started. My guess would be after the last update. I say this because after the update certain desktop shortcuts will not stay on the right of the screen where I like them to be. They always close up to those on the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only really noticed the taskbar problem when I wanted to use the bottom of the screen and it kept getting in the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't play around with settings and I have not experienced problems with added software that I can remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try switching the auto hide off and on but to no gain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that there is no problem if only the background apps are running apart from Chrome and Outlook which are not actually opened. As a matter of fact to test this comment I shut down all the other apps which I had been using except for the ones
 mentioned and the taskbar is now behaving nicely. Even though I have restarted those same apps (then minimised them.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have been careful to make sure that there are no notifications wanting attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The conclusion I am coming to is that the problem may occur when there are numbers of files minimised to the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I wish Ms would find the reason and fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

<p>Let's try to restart your Windows Explorer, and see if it makes a difference. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the taskbar.</p>
<p>2. Select <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>3. On the <strong>Processes</strong> tab, click on <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>4. On the bottom right corner of the window, click on <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted and we'll be willing to assist you further.</p>

<p>Thank you Ramon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto Hide was not working.</p>
<p>I went through the Windows Explorer restart steps.</p>
<p>Auto Hide worked.</p>
<p>Opened VLC Media Player - Task bar still good.</p>
<p>Opened a Folder of JPG and MPEG3 files of about 1.5Gb and minimised the window.</p>
<p>Auto Hide stopped then after a few minutes worked as normal.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p>
<p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears that restarting Windows Explorer worked for you. We suspect that the auto-hide function didn't work right away when you opened a folder is because that folder is a bit heavy, and it took some time to load. We would like to know if you need further
 assistance on this.</p>
<p>

 every so long to Windows 7 operating systems.</p>

    <title>Multiple Problems with Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Problems with Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium </h2>
                    
<p>I just recently rebuilt my pc with the following new components and installed Windows 7 Home Premium:<br />
<br />
Gigabyte GA-EP45-UD3R Motherboard<br />
EVGA 260 GTX Video Card<br />
Western Digital Green WD5000AADS 500GB<br />
4 GB Corsair XMS2 DDR2 800 RAM<br />
Lite-On iHAS-324-98&nbsp;DVD Optical Drive <br />
Corsair 750TX PSU<br />
<br />
The only thing that I reused from my previous pc was my Q6600 processor. I installed Windows 7 64 bit Home Premium, but from day one I've had multiple BSOD's and overall slow performance. IE8 constantly crashes on me as does Firefox and now Chrome. I've opened
 up my Event Viewer and am attaching a sampling of the errors that I'm receiving:<br />

I've just about had it with Windows 7 and am asking...begging for someone out there to help me fix these issues. I'm no IT guy and so I ask that if you have any advice that you please speak as if you are speaking to a child so that I can understand what it
 is&nbsp;that I need to do. I've opened up my Device Manager and tried to update all my Drivers thru there, but Windows 7 tells me that I have the best driver already installed. I have no issues in my Action Center to lead me to believe that there is an actual problem
 to address, but the constant BSOD's, IE8 crashes, screen flickering and slow performance tells me otherwise. I've also ran the Windows Memory Tester and my RAM checked good. HD checked good. Video Card appears to be running correctly. Not sure what else it
 can be. Please help!!!</p>

            This may be a wild guess but the first thing I'd check is that your new power supply is securely connected and&nbsp;functioning properly. Problems can easily cause crashes like you're having. Recheck the supply to motherboard connector for starters, I also
 use a Gigabyte MB and know the socket can be an awkward fit with some supply cables (I use a Coolermaster and had a ____ of a time getting the plug to seat in the board properly :)<br />
<br />
Good luck,<br />

            Had a similar problem with my computer...I too just rebuilt, and actually it turned out to be problems.&nbsp; First was a DDR2 module component failure (the only two components from my previous desktop were the memory and the power supply).&nbsp; After replacing
 the RAM with new, everything worked fine, then without warning, sudden shut downs, etc.).&nbsp; Did the checking of connections, reseating RAM, etc.&nbsp; It turned out to be the power supply, which probably messed up the RAM.&nbsp; Replaced the powersupply with a Zalman,
 and the system runs great.&nbsp; I'd suggest you check your RAM (Microsoft offers a free memory checking app if your bios does not have a built in memory check tool.).&nbsp; Then I'd check your power supply.&nbsp; They will sometimes keep running (fan, etc), but actually
 be the guilty party.

I'm unclear what I'm supposed to be looking for while in Safe Mode as the BSOD's are so random that I get them when I'm in the internet or&nbsp;browsing files on my PC; however, they most commonly occur when I'm on the internet. I've gone a few days without a single
 BSOD and then I might have two in one day. The errors and IE 8 crashes are a constant happening though. I updated my Nvidia driver, Realtek Audio and NIC drivers as well as my Chipset and SATA drivers last night. I know that I still have some drivers that
 according to the Driver Detective software that I just recently installed are considered out of date, but I have no idea how to track those down...<br />
<br />
Here something new...today, I tried to get onto the IRS website to download some forms and my IE8 continues to crash everytime I select to view a publication.&nbsp;I tried this with Chrome and got an Adobe plugin error. I can view PDF's on any other website, just
 not the IRS website.<br />
<br />
I ran the Windows Memory Tester and my RAM checked good. I changed out my HD's nearly two weeks ago and reinstalled Windows 7 on a&nbsp;brand new HD and still get errors and BSOD's.
<br />
<br />
How can I view my minidump files? Surely, there is more information there that I could obtain and post.<br />
<br />
Thanks

            I had a similar problem.&nbsp; My 64-bit Win 7 was crashing with bsod all the time.&nbsp; I eventually wiped the drive and reinstalled everything.&nbsp; When reinstalling I took my time and used each program for a day or so before installing the next.&nbsp; Once I installed
 a program called "Cute pdf"&nbsp; the problem returned.&nbsp; I uninstalled it and have been bsod free for almost a week now.<br />

<h2>            How do I put a laptop hard drive into a desktop computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have a HP Pavilion ZV 5000 that died a while ago and the hard drive is still good. It is 60 GB Running Windows Xp. it has &nbsp;I got the laptop from a friend because they did not want it.Also I have a IBM Aptivia desktop from 1998 and it has a gigantic 8
 GB Hard drive running windows 98. I want to put the laptop drive into the desktop computer and take out the old one. I would buy a whole new hard drive but it has Microsoft Office 2003 pro. That is the only copy I have and I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;have the product key to re
 install it. I need this computer for my workshop. How do I get it to work? Is there a part I need? If so, where do I get it from?

If I understand correctly, you have an HP Pavilion ZV 5000 laptop that does not run but has a 60 GB hard drive that has Windows XP installed and also has Office 2003 installed.<br />
<br />
You want to put the hard drive from the laptop into an old desktop.<br />
<br />
You have two issues: hardware and software.<br />
<br />
The hardware issues can probably be easily solved (you would need something like this $10 kit --&gt;
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/d539pwf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/d539pwf</a> -- but read the comments).<br />
<br />
The software problem is that you can't take an existing installation of Windows XP and completely change the computer hardware.&nbsp; If you try that, you have to do a reinstall of Windows before it will work.
<br />
<br />
If you have a generic OEM XP install CD, you may be able to do a repair install (saving the applications -- e.g. Office 2003), but the CD must be at the same or later version of XP (Home, Pro) and Service Pack level as the version of XP which is installed.&nbsp;
 You must also have the product key that goes with the OEM install CD (I think the key from the label on the HP will fail).<br />
<br />
More likely, you will have to do a clean install, which will involve formatting the drive.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you have the install CD for Office 2003, you can recover its installation key from the laptop drive before you install it in the desktop.&nbsp; Probably the easiest way to do this is to put the laptop drive in an external drive enclosure, attach that to a working
 computer, and use <a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Magical Jelly Bean Keyfinder</a> using its "Load Hive" feature.<br />

    <title>Surface RT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thisguyislame  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT</h2>
                    <p>I was looking to buy a Surface RT from Amazon, thinking it had a pen. I quickly stopped the ordering process when it didn't have one. I know Wacom makes pens that support a wide range of devices, and some other pens that have their own method of creating
 a pressure sensitive environment without the device in question being pressure sensitive itself. I can't afford the Surface Go and up, and I really like this tablet, so are there any suggestions? I'm going to primarily draw with this tablet if I find a compatible
 pen. I'd really appreciate some help.</p>

<p>It would be a total waste of money to buy a Surface RT or Surface 2 for which both run Windows 8.1 RT.&nbsp; Both tablets have ARM 32-bit processors and are stuck with what they have and cannot install any software outside of what is available in the Store app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no TWEAKS, HACKS, or anything else you can do to get it to run anything other than what is available in the Store app.&nbsp; There is no more support for the two tablets and the developers of the existing apps that are in the Store are pulling the plug
 on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you want a digital picture frame that can act as a paperweight, go ahead and buy it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Amazon.com and check out the "Asus T103HA" tablet.&nbsp; Not a speed demon by any means but is a good machine (I had one).</p>
