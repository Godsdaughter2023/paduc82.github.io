<h2>            Dual boot Win 7 64-bit and XP Pro 32-bit &#40;win7 Installed first&#41;</h2>
                    How do I set up: dual boot Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and Windows&nbsp;XP Pro 32-bit (Windows 7 installed first)? I have Win7 on a 2 terabyte HDD, with another 1 terabytle internal HDD and two 1 terabyte external HDDs. I have an Intel i7 960 @ 3.20GHz, 20 GB
 RAM. I want to keep Win7 on the 2TB drive and add WinXP on the other internal 1TB drivw in a&nbsp;dual boot setup. The other two&nbsp;external 1TB drives would be used for backups and data. I would like to be able to boot to XP&nbsp;because I have numerous Apps that run
 on XP wothout having compatibility issues.&nbsp; Both Win 7 and XP are full versoins.Or would I be better of trying A virtual setup?

            <p>The first option I would recommend, if you really need to run Windows XP is to use Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode, you will need to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate in order to gain access to Windows XP Mode.
</p>

<p>-----------</p>
<p>or, if you have a full retail version of Windows XP Professional or XP Home, you can download the free Windows Virtual PC and use your own license;</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/how-to-use-virtualization-softwarewindows-virtual-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/how-to-use-virtualization-softwarewindows-virtual-pc/</a></p>
<p>The other option, if you already have a Windows XP license, is to dual boot with Windows 7:</p>
<p>The following instructions will show how to dual boot Windows 7 and XP on your machine instead of replacing one with the other.
</p>
<b>
<p>It is important you have a reinstallation or repair disc in case you need to reinstall or repair your WIndows 7 installation.
</p>
<p>The following article will show you how to create a repair disc:</p>
</b>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/02/09/how-to-create-a-system-repair-disc-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2011/02/09/how-to-create-a-system-repair-disc-in-windows-7/</a></p>
<b>
<p>Drivers for Windows XP:</p>
</b>
<p>You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP.</p>
<b>
<p>Create Partition</p>
</b>
<p>In order to do that, use Easeus Partition Master Home Edition - <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Manager-Home-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Manager-Home-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html</a></p>
<p>Proceed to install Easeus:</p>
<p>Click Next, follow the easy on screen instructions.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, click Finish</p>
<p>Click Go to main screen</p>
<p>Select the drive you want to resize in the partition window</p>
<p>Drag the knob until you have a desired amount of disk space to install Windows XP, then release it.
</p>
<p>Click apply to apply the changes you just made. </p>
<p>Click Yes</p>
<p>Click Yes</p>
<p>Your computer will restart a few times and changes will be made to the partition layout, this process is hands free, so no interaction is required.
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<b>
<p>Install Windows XP</p>
</b>
<p>In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE.
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created;</p>
<p>Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer.</p>
<p>When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Windows XP will go through its setup process. </p>
<p>Once you arrive at the Welcome Setup, press Enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process</p>
<p>Press F8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement</p>
<p>Select the partition </p>
<p>Select Format the partition using the NTFS file system</p>
<p>Press F on your keyboard to begin the formatting.</p>
<p>Installation files will now be copied to your hard disk</p>
<p>Your system will be restarted, Windows XP setup will continue</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<b>
<p>After Windows XP installs successfully, you will not be able to boot into Windows 7. This is where the recovery disc for Windows 7 comes in.</p>
</b>
<p>1. Put the Windows 7 Recovery disc installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.</p>
<p>2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.</p>
<p>3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.</p>
<p>4. Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p>5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p>6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>7. Type sfc /scannow, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have repaired your Windows 7 installation and try to boot it, you will notice that Windows 7 does not boot.
</p>
<p>Boot into the BIOS again and set the hard disk mode to SATA. You will now be able to boot into Windows 7 again.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After doing that, download EasyBCD and add a boot entry for Windows XP to the Windows 7 boot manager;</p>
<p>EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windowsboot manager.

<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The next step now is make it possible for Windows 7 to boot in IDE mode. </p>
<p>Here are the instructions for doing that:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html</a></p>
<p>Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 7 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error
 code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod
 and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !<br />
<br />
Here are the pases :<br />
1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 7 with AHCI set from BIOS !<br />
2) Download my registry fix (to add the ide keys to regeditor) simply apply the key
<br />
3) Now the manually regedit part Go to : <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_Msahci <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStor<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStorV<br />
<br />
And in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named "START" change at all three (Msahci,iaStor,iaStorV) values from 0 To 1
<br />
Now navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_PciIde<br />
,then change the start value to "0" <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Now u are allmost done , restart your computer/laptop , and go to Bios and set from AHCI to IDE !!! , save settings in Bios and restart<br />
<br />
5)Windows will be loading , and VOILA !!! NO BSOD !!! , windows Vista/Seven will install new Ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have AHCI drivers anymore , u have Ide drivers !<br />
6)It will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy </p>

            <p>&nbsp;Are you aware that you can install the free XP mode on your Windows 7 system?&nbsp;&nbsp;Once installed you can start it in 15 to 30 seconds as a task under Windows 7 and run your XP applications without having to reboot.&nbsp; It works very well&nbsp;as long as you can live
 with the graphics.&nbsp; The XP Mode graphics are fine for business applications.&nbsp; This would be my first preference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You'll probably get posts suggesting a way to install XP and then download a program or two and patch a couple of places.&nbsp; However to me it's much more straightforward to just create a small 30 GB partition and do a "quick and dirty" 30 minute install of
 a second totally minimal copy Windows 7 in it.&nbsp; This will get everything bootable after you install XP, should you decide to go that route.&nbsp; It's not as intelectually sophisticated as the more involved patchwork approach, but it's faster and simpler.&nbsp; As my
 freshman chemistry professor used to say "anybody&nbsp;can make things complicated; it takes&nbsp;some thought to make things simple".&nbsp; I think that professor was very smart!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Desktop Icon Display</h2>
                    <p>I have somehow messed-up how my desktop 'ready'display appears. It used to show all icons spaced across screen and the selection grid (small 1"x1" squares to choose) didn't automatically appear unless I clicked on the Win-10 icon located at the bottom left
 corner of my task-bar below 'start'. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now that whole grid shows up alone with no desktop icons visible anywhere. I have to separately click on the left vertical cursor line to plant all my regular icons on screen........and, then they disappear
 as soon as I'm finished what I am doing at the time.</p>
<p>How can I return to normal in the way it was before? &nbsp; Please Help!</p>

<p>Woops............The problem for me was that I mistakenly had the screen layout on Tablet Mode. Go to bottom right of the task bar where network, connect, airplane mode, all settings, etc. is listed along with 'Tablet Mode'.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you all who might have also inadvertently&nbsp; caused this to occur.</p>

    <title>Skype Number Call Forwarding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> accordgroup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Number Call Forwarding</h2>
                    <p>I have an overseas Skype Number and set up call forwarding after 5 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I was signed into Skype and sitting in front of my computer, when I received a call that was forwarded to my mobile, i.e. the Skype application didn't even ring.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my online account settings to confirm that I had set up forwarding correctly. I noticed my Skype application had "call forwarding" set in the preferences, but then I changed it to "receive calls normally" to see if it would make a difference. I
 made numerous test calls with different settings but it didn't change anything. All calls are being forwarded automatically to my mobile without ringing on Skype for 5 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Mac computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help is appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Trying to install my HP Photosmart C7280.  </h2>
                    My HP Photosmart C7280 worked great until I moved and tried setting it up again.&nbsp; I couldn't get it to print so I decided to uninstall and reinstall the software.&nbsp; When I connect my printer to my computer using the USB after installation, the hardware
 wizard pops up with the following information:<br />
<br />
Cannot install this hardware<br />
There was a problem installing this hardware HP Photosmart C7200 series<br />
An error occurred during the installation of this device.&nbsp; The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.<br />
<br />
I have already contacted customer support and they told me to do the following (this also failed and I keep getting the same message).<br />

1. Verify Windows Update &amp; Bits Serviec Settings&nbsp;<br />
2. Reregister the windows updates DLLS<br />
3. Rename the windows update folder<br />
4. Restart the window update service<br />
5. Reboot System<br />
<br />

I am about to go crazy!&nbsp; I need help!!&nbsp; Please help me!!</span></p>

            HP has some nerve to blame this on MS! I know 2 people with this same printer. It should be recalled and money refunded since the user and HP cannot figure out how to get this piece of junk to work. We are going to make one last attempt to load their 300mb
 bloatware on a Windows 7 system!<br />
<br />

            Spent 4 hours on free&nbsp;chat sessions , wanted to charge me 34.00 for phone and Remote Desktop session which probably would be 1/2 hour. HP is trying to save money the free 4 hours don't count. How does that make sense. Hp you lose money and custormer goodwill.

<p>I take it this is an inkjet. Problems of this kind abound with inkjets. If you can afford a bit more outlay, get yourself a color laser instead, preferably one that uses a PCL or Postscript driver.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One possible HDMI Cord and&#47;or Input Issue&#63; Need Help.</h2>
                    
<p>Alright I will just jump to the point and Issues. Woke up today Turned on my nearly brand new 2015 LG hdmi smart tv and My cable box would not show a picture. (yes i know Im not on an LG Support forum. Just hear me out.) Could not figure out what the issue
 was, It would say that the external device couldnt get a signal So it was picking it up through the hdmi port and cord. I decided id leave it and figure it out later. Turned on my xbox one and it works not thinking it would or wouldnt. (tv's plugged into hdmi
 1 and xbox hdmi 2) watch netflix for maybe... 20 or 30 minutes. then start to mess with the tv again cause my mom came in and i was showing her how the tv and cable box was being odd. I Tried the cable box with the xbox hdmi cable to see if it was the tv's
 hdmi cable and it did the same thing before, it picked the connection up but didnt show the picture, so the xbox and tv's hdmi cable both work. Then started swapping through the 3 hdmi inputs on the tv with both cables and it gave me the same results.. SO
 I give up on the tv for now. Go to switch to my xbox with the xbox hdmi cable on the original hdmi tv input it was on before. It now does not show a picture for my xbox with the xbox cable and original input It doesnt even say it knows something is connected
 to the tv on that input. (thinking maybe thats just something it does with cable boxes and not xbox's? not really sure.) I tried the same thing I did with the cable box. Used both cables on each of the three inputs and it still did nothing. I even went to
 my bedroom and tried all 4 of those hdmi inputs on the other tv with both cables and Still nothing.</p>
<p>So I want to say its the Xbox's HDMI Inputs issue. Not the hdmi cables or the tv cause like I said with the cable box it shows that something is actually connected to each of the inputs with both cables. Though yes the cable box also isnt working but im
 pretty sure its a coincidence. A really aggravating coincidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Also tried some trouble shooting. The holding the eject and power for five seconds to turn on the lower resolution mode did nothing. Alot of people were saying Unplugging the brick and plugging it back in does wonders for them. Still doesnt do Anything
 for me. I bought the alittle before christmas. Id like to know if anyone knows any solutions or if anyone knows my actual issue. Im pretty sure its the HDMI input on the xbox and that the cable box is just a other issue. Maybe i somehow damaged it when switching
 out cables? I really dont think i did cause i take care of my stuff but shi... Stuff happens. Haha. Let me know I would REALLY Appreciate it.</p>
<p>THANK YOU. :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK so I didn't read everything cuz it was confusing as CRRRAAAP so I don't know if you have tried this. Cuz I have had problems before with my lg not getting a signal I've found out that if you have the TV on and on the in put you want to use THEN turn on
 the xbox or whatever you're using, it work. Its like it needs a fresh signal for it to pick up that something is going on in that input.

<p>To be honest mate, it sounds like an issue with the TV, and from what I've heard, its a common problem with LG's</p>
<p>If you google 'lg tv no input signal' then you will find quite a few others with the same issue. If its a new tv i'd reccomend getting onto LG promptly for a replacement or fix</p>

                    In Win XP I could rearrange photos by simply dragging them.&nbsp; I often did this to get them into the sequence I wanted.&nbsp; I can't do this in Win 7.&nbsp; So, with Win 7, how can I rearrange the sequence of photos within a file?&nbsp; Is there a simple method, like
 the old "drag and drop"?

<p>That option was removed in Win7. I have no idea why and I miss it too.</p>
<p>What I do now is use this freeware tool as a workaround.</p>
<p><strong>FastStone Image Viewer</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.faststone.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.faststone.org/</a></p>
<p>A: Create a new folder so the original can be left as is.</p>
<p>B: Open FastStone and open the folder with the pix I want to rearrange.</p>
<p>C: Move them around as desired and then use the Batch Rename Selected Images option. This renames them in a new alpha order.</p>
<p>D: Move them to the new folder. They are in the order I want.<br />

<p><span>Hi Splortched,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 System File Checker (SFC) scan report any errors after scanning?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, let’s boot into&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>safe
 mode</span></a> (to confirm if any third-party application is causing the issue) and check if the computer continues to crash and to verify if the<strong><span>issue persists.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on how to log in to safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Advanced startup
 options (including safe mode)</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode, the next of troubleshooting would be to put the computer in a clean boot and identify the problem causing
 third-party program. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you
 may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>

            Same issue here, few programs will run, no programs will install, and Bad Image errors due to "C:\windows\system32\samcli.dll" pop often. Attempted clean boot, safe mode, and other work fixes. Not sure if it's related or not but on Autocheck Disk feature
 is not working. Upon scheduling a disk check, when the restart happens it says Autocheck program does not exist and that this step will be skipped, sometimes it says this once, sometimes twice, sometimes three times. Not sure if these issues have anything
 to do with each other but I'm sure they both are keeping my computer from performing correctly. Any help will be a great help, thanks.

<h2>            How to make all Public folder private on WIndows 7 pro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a windows 7 pro system and I am going crazy. I recently noticed that many of my folder say Public. for example my sony picture program says the following c:/users/public/public desktop. I have tried to change the settings but it only takes
 me to advanced settings were it asks me to turn on or off network discovery, amongst other settings. I turn all of them off and turn on the password protection etc, save the settings and I still see many programs as "public" including my sony picture program
 that still says c:/users/public/publicdesktop. I don't want anything on my computer to be accesible to other people over the internet. I have wifi in a form of a router in my home although it is password protected. I want to know if anyone knows how I can
 change all the "public" folder/programs and make them private and what "public" really means, I mean can other people see my folders? Like pictures, documents etc. I use to have all the picture folders in my micorsoft program as "public" then I went on and
 clicked "Share eith" then "nobody" then "stop Sharing" and those no longer say shared. However when I go into the library and I see other programs sucb as the sony it says the "public" I click on the "shortcut" and on the bottom it says "shared" I have no
 way of making this private so I don't know what I am doing wrong. I don't know what additional steps I must take other than do the "advance sharing" steps although I don't understand why by completing and saving that it stills says "public" and "shared" please,
 please help me I'm desperate! Thank you so much</p>

<h2>            How to get video files to show image instead of icon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I open a folder to view video files, many extensions, such as .wmv and .mp4 will display an image from the file instead of the default file icon for that extension.&nbsp; But other video file extensions, such as .flv and .mov, will not display an image from
 the file but only the default file icon.&nbsp;Is there a way I can get these other extensions to display&nbsp;an image rather than the icon?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for approaching Microsoft Community. I understand that you have issues with On screen keyboard and Narrator. I would definitely assist
 you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you tried turning it off from “Change Sig-in Settings” in Ease of access centre?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If not I would suggest you to disable On-Screen keyboard and Narrator from Change Sign-in settings.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Start” button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Then Select “Control Panel”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select “Ease of Access”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select “Chase Sign-in settings” from the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure Narrator and On-Screen keyboard option is unchecked on both “At sign-in and After sign-in” option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “Apply” and then “Ok” option to save the changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and then try to install Service Pack 1. You can start Windows by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot</a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 3</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps you in fixing the issue. If the issue continues, post us back. We would be happy to help you further.</span></p>

<h3> nandanbhambore  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need to operate alt &#43;tab&#40;2 times&#41;. This problem occurs only while switching from excel to other apps and not vice versa.</h2>
                    <p><span>Original Title: </span>ALT+TAB.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Problem is prevailing with Excel 2007 on windows 10 platform</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Alt + Tab responds in one key stoke &nbsp;by switching from excel to other program if only one excel file is opened. If you open multiple excel files and then&nbsp; try to switch from excel to program X(or another excel file), I need to operate alt +tab(2 times).
 This problem occurs only while switching from excel to other apps and not vice versa. Please check with the following combination in office 2007.&nbsp; Open &nbsp;4 excel files and another program outlook and you can figure out the problem while switching between them.
 To switch from excel to outlook you will have to use alt + Tab(2 times),and vice versa it takes one key stoke of alt+ tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have checked &nbsp;and the problem &nbsp;has been reported by my colleagues as well who have switched to windows 10 and have been working on office 2007.</span></p>
<p><span>I have been using windows vista, win-8 and have never faced this problem. I open several excel files during my work and have been facing lot of inconvenience and loss of time as I have to use different key stokes different time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft technical person had come online and has seen and &nbsp;understood the problem through remote assistance and has recommended me to use office 2013, which is not the solution I am seeking.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Below suggested driver for key board was also installed during the remote assistance without success.</span></p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Nandan,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Alt+Tab </span><span>↹</span><span> is the common name for a keyboard shortcut that has been in Microsoft Windows since Windows 3.0. This shortcut switches between top-level windows without using the mouse; hence it was named Task Switcher.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Perhaps the most common use of Alt+Tab </span><span>↹</span><span> is to alternate between the two most recent tasks, but it can also be used to switch to any running program that has a top-level window. The window environment maintains a Z-order
 list of top-level windows (tasks) with the most recently used tasks at the front, so the most recently used tasks can be switched to the most quickly.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The use of the modifier key Alt in using Alt+Tab </span><span>↹</span><span> differs from typical modifier key use in the following ways:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>There is a difference in behavior when the user releases Alt and presses Alt+Tab
</span><span>↹</span><span> again vs. holding Alt continuously while pressing Tab
</span><span>↹</span><span> repeatedly.</span></li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><ul>
<li><span>Releasing Alt has an immediate effect: it closes the task switcher and switches to the selected task.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There are many subtleties to the behavior of Alt+Tab </span><span>↹</span><span>, and they have remained mostly unchanged over the years.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If there is more than one top-level window, the task list appears as soon as Tab
</span><span>↹</span><span> is pressed for the first time while Alt is being held down.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful, In future, if you have any issues related to Windows, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            avcodec.dll corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I just puchased and installed a program for burning DVDs (called DVDFab) and it complains now that my avcodec.dll is a problem. The error is the standard windows type.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top of the error box says DVDFabNonDec.exe - Ordinal Not Found</p>
<p>The error says "The ordinal 284 could not be located in the dynamic link library avcodec.dll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that I need the library file but I cannot find a valid and trusted copy.&nbsp; Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

    <title>Aiming and getting the first shot... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xboxfan5167  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aiming and getting the first shot...</h2>
                    
<p>First of all I want to say I'm NOT&nbsp;trying to make this sound like Im complaining but trying to gain insight from others, I'm fairly new to BO and really havent played any other COD online. So I realize the people that are able to get the first shot on me
 probably have played the other COD for years&nbsp;and have logged wayyy more time than me.</p>
<p>It seems when I see an enemy I try to get my cross hairs lined up for a head/body shot, but I am always too slow. They seem to get the drop on me almost every time. Would one of the perks help me have a more steady shot and allow me to be able to keep the
 cross hairs on the enemy? When I look at the killcam, it just appears that their crosshairs never leave my body, they seem to have a steadier aim basically.&nbsp; When I do get a chance to get the first shot in, my crosshairs just dont seem as steady on the enemy.
 I hope this question I'm trying to pose makes sense.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Aagain I realize it may just take time and practice/time to improve getting the first shot and keeping a steady aim/crosshiars on the enemy. But was wondering if a perk would help or is it experience that is the answer Im looking for. I am loving the game
 and willing to take my beatings by the veterans!&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<p>Cod is a fast paced game so you have to adjust from other games like Halo, which are somewhat slower paced. I recommend using sleight of hand because that's what will give you faster aim down sights and might guarantee winning the gunfight, but not always.
 Even if you get the first shot on a guy, he might still kill you due to the bad hit detection in this game. I've learned to deal with it though so it's no biggie for me.</p>
<p>What I suggest you do is play Team Deathmatch where the pace is slow(most of the time) and then when you feel you're up for the challenge, play some objective game modes like Demolition or Headquarters. They can get pretty hectic at times.
</p>
<p>Oh and one more thing, you might be using bad guns. I recommend trying the Famas and Ak-74u for now. As you level up, try to get a feel of other guns and see which ones you like the best. I use nearly every gun with the exception of Lmg's because they're
 just not for me. Hope this helps and if you need any more help, feel free to ask.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; In pretty much any game mode you are going to have to learn to aim and fire in one step. Soh will help some, but the key here is to get the fell of the weapon you are using and pretty much be on target before you ads (or as I said, one step).
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This will actually help in another sense. When you point and shoot all in one step ... the sticky aim feature works better and kind of makes that detailed adjustment for you. &nbsp;This is basically the way quickscoping works, but the feature works on all
 weapons. The m16/acog is a great example of this. I've made some shots with it that make shake my head as to how I got a hit. ( not recommending a burstfire weapon for a beginner though)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another tip as far as keeping aim while firing. I have really messed up hands .... arthritis etc. &nbsp;I can spin and lock on a target quickly, but if I am off slightly or have to track an enemy while firing, I'm as good as dead. I just cant make the fine
 adjustments. So ..... I play hc mode . this may or may not be helpful to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I describe the difference in core and hc as this:</p>
<p>hardcore requires you to aim quicker, while core requires you to aim longer.</p>

<p>I realize that what kills me a lot of the time is me sprinting. Just try taking it slower and walking instead of sprinting. It sounds obvious, but check your corners that always helps. And walk when you have a feeling that the enemy is in the next room or
 see red dots on your mini-map. </p>
<p>And for abrupt encounters with the enemies start shooting from the hip as you bring your gun up to ADS (aim down sights). Steady aim works exceptionally well with SMG's but has good effect with assault rifles as well. Sleight of hand PRO lets you ADS faster.
</p>
<p>And do not worry about aiming up a headshot, just shoot the ***. And if you can tell that your aim is erratic then use a silencer, they won't know where you are for a moment, and when they do figure out where you are you'd have shot them dead.</p>

<p>sLEIGHT OF hAND pRO aims down the sights faster. I cant help you with LAG though, its very minute sometimes, but its a part of online gaming. &nbsp;Steady Aim helps with hipfire accuracy. Also checking your controller "sensitivity" may help. Check that through
 in game options. Lower means turning slower, but better for aiming down range.</p>

<p>Someone else can chime in on this and tell me if it is true, but I am trying to work myself out of a habit of just spraying a target. Sometimes &nbsp;when you catch a person out in the open, I would tend to pull and hold the trigger down until the target drops,
 I drop, or I run outta ammo. More times than not, I would get a hit but my opponent would still get me because I am going full bore with the sights jumping on me from the recoil. I think you would be well served if you could shoot, move, shoot move, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;It depends on the weapon .. some have more recoil and work better in bursts. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Something helful too ..... once you start shooting, instead of standing still, and turning back and forth to hit your target,&nbsp; ....... dont turn, and slightly move side to side to tune your aim. It gives him a moving target to hit and seems a little more
 sensitive at times.</p>

<p>The case of "steadier aiming" is just luck.</p>
<p>Many times you will notice that sometimes your weapon just has ridiculous recoil and other times it's incredibly stable.</p>

            Thanks for your help but no, I've received no error messages when sending documents in Word to print - it simply does nothing, and the print queue shows zero documents waiting print.&nbsp; And yes, it prints just fine in WordPad, etc.&nbsp; The problem is solely
 with the documents I create in Word, and the only change I've made is upgrading from Windows 7 to 8.&nbsp; And I've already tried the Printer Troubleshooter and it claimed to find no problems to fix.

            i have had the same issue when trying to print anything from the new start screen with Windows 8. Anything printing from the app, email, documents, etc.. won't print. It shows it going to the printer and then it just goes away. No error message if any
 kind. It just leaves the print queue and nothing prints.&nbsp;If I go to my desktop, I can open and print things just fine. . it just won't print from the "new" print function in Windows 8
