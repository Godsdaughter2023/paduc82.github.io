<h2>            DVD&#47;RW drive not working - Asus DRW-2014L1T</h2>
                    Can consider me an intermediate to advanced windows user so don't be afraid to talk specifics.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no idea why the DVDRW stopped working. The only drivers available seem to be back from 2008, compatible with windows vista only.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For some reason windows is assigning my DVD/CD-Rom device a driver from 2006, called "DTSOFT VIrtual CdRom Device" and this seems to be the only one it finds in a search and the only one compatible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Seems to be a windows 8 thing, worked fine when I had windows 7. I am running Win 8 Pro.</div>
                </div>

<h2>            HELP&#33; i deleted myself of of a familly list thingie</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so yesterday i was trying to download m-rated content and it kept saying i couldnt so i got mad and went to my moms account to see if i could do anything about it. i pressed some buttons and then got to a screen that said are you sure you want to delete
 rob1tooby1 from the familly list he will have to submit a new windows id and pasword. thinking that this would solve this problem i did. so then i signed out of my moms account and back on to mine and it said that my parrents windows id is not valid. so i
 hit okay and put in my info and password. then i got to a screen that was like verify your info so i looked at it and everything was okay(windows id, age, and that kind of stuff) i hit yes and it said i wasnt old enough to do that. so now im kinda stuck and
 have no idea how to put my account back on this "familly list". btw this is not a familly gold pack thing</p>

    <title>how to stop windows from downloading driver updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khidreal  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to stop windows from downloading driver updates</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>I have a problem and it's very hard to install my AMD driver correctely... when I am able to do it, after some days it goes bad again... windows update insists on installing and older driver, and since my driver is relieve version and it tries to install
 a crimsom (older version of amd drivers) so they don't work well together and the computer starts malfuncioning.</p>
<p>installing the windows update driver, it does not install the driver, only the AMD driver manager............</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to disable ALL driver updates for windows 10 (Home edition), disable chipset, bluetooth, bla bla bla drivers updates, while keeping windows update able to download updates for windows and software like updates for visual C++ and such...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried an option on system &gt; advanced system settings &gt; hardware that is said to disable updates for drivers, but everytime I uninstall my AMD driver to reinstall it again, before I even open the installer, windows update is already downloading the damn
 broken AMD driver...</p>
<p>I tried 2 options on the registry, one on local machine &gt; microsoft &gt; windows &gt; windows update and created a dword 32bit that's said to stop driver updates, and another in some place somewhere that says something like search order config on driver searching,
 put it both to 0 and 3 and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>why do Microsoft insists on installing their crappy generic drivers and not let users install the official manufacturer drivers designed specifically for the computer in question? worst is, Microsoft installs a driver for AMD HD7xxx graphics card, while
 mine is a R7 m265..............................</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyway, how do I stop windows from updating drivers? do I need windows 10 pro or something? I have licences connected to my microsoft account, i have license for W8, W8.1, W10 and 10 pro... linked with my motherboard there is also a windows 7 Home premium
 and ultimate versions... so I can install all this OS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed windows 10 Home.</p>

<p>There is another issue that the Show/hide tool does not address, and I believe this may be your problem, not Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall if this happened when I installed an AMD gpu driver, but with Nvidia Win10 quickly installs a driver it keeps cached</p>
<p>(maybe by WU at some point ) when you reboot after uninstalling your current driver using Programs and Features (or the AMD driver tool ? ).</p>
<p>This will happen even when off line.</p>
<p>With Nvidia&nbsp; I can verify this has happened because the Nvidia driver is no longer listed in Programs and Features,
</p>
<p>but the driver and Nvidia Control Panel do still function fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The best way to prevent this happening is to use <em>Display Driver Uninstaller</em> or
<em>Driver Fusion</em> (free version ) to uninstall your graphics drivers</p>
<p>(being careful to select only the graphics driver).&nbsp; These tools delete some Registry keys that seem linked to Win10 being</p>
<p>alerted to pop the cached driver in while Windows is rebooting</p>
<p>I generally go off line before doing a gpu driver update as extra precaution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, first uninstall the AMD driver using DDU/DF and setup Windows to reboot into
<em>Safe Mode </em>rather than normal </p>
<p>Windows, and try installing <em>your</em> driver of choice from there ( I've had to boot into Safe Mode since 1709 or the driver install fails ).</p>

<p>No I know that, honestly what I do is to go to device manager &gt; video cards&gt;Uninstall and check the box that says "delete driver for this something", that way the driver is not cached, and I know it because WU downloads it...</p>
<p>to completely remove the driver, after I removed and deleted it on device manager, I use the AMD official program to uninstall all AMD products, such as drivers and configuration apps, launchers and stuff...</p>
<p>than I reboot and the computer downloads the generic driver from microsoft again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so, What I am gonna do is:</p>
<p>Im gonna install the pro version of Windows 10 - since I have it linked on my microsoft account to have a fresh windows (and group policy). I tried to disable driver updates through registry and settings, but there is also an option on Group Policy to do
 that, except only W10 Pro and enterprise have it, not the Home edition.</p>
<p>maybe group policy can solve it, and it will also remove all the drivers I have, so I can reinstall all of them again from fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>than I am gonna run the tool Mike P. suggested, at least will prevent WU from downloading those tools till I find a permanent solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a permanent solution: set all the folders for the drivers as "read-only", windows won't be able to install updates to drivers that way, thing is I will have to intensively search for every bit of folder for my around 20 drivers, specially for both
 my GPU, but that's as a last mesure...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Even when you have disconnected from the internet as I suggested ? Magic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also used the Show/Hide tool since I first got Win10 (prior to update version 1511).&nbsp; It has<em> never</em></p>
<p>prevented Win10 from installing a driver on rebooting, but it has prevented WU from doing driver updates</p>
<p>at other 'random' intervals (the version updates being a possible exception, but I'm not sure as I do a driver update manually</p>
<p>after each version update as a matter of course ).</p>

<p>I missed this earlier... <em>"Microsoft installs a driver for AMD HD7xxx graphics card, while mine is a R7 m265."</em></p>
<p>The R7 200 series is a re-baged and tweaked HD7000 series. The drivers are the same, not only for these two series,</p>
<p>but several others. However, I should have asked, but now I see you are using a laptop.
</p>
<p>With laptops best practice is to use only the driver provided by the mfg of the laptop. Even if it's an old driver.
</p>
<p>As the laptop mfg's modify the AMD driver to suit the way they configure the gpu.</p>
<p>AMD and Nvidia both have disclaimers to this effect on their download page.</p>

<p>okay so I am back with my fresh Windows 10 installation and it works like a charm.</p>
<p>my problem is solved:</p>
<p>going into gpedit.msc (group policy) you can control windows update and there is an option on computer configuration\administrative templates\windows components\windows update called "Do not include drivers with windows updates" that you activate and windows
 update no longer downloads any updated cataloged as a driver, I just searched for updates and despite I still have to install 70% of my drivers, it's downloading service packs and virus definitions, not a single driver :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found out that if you want to disable windows update at all, you can go to services.msc and find windows update, right click, properties and select "disabled" on the dropdown box and windows update won't be able to search for any updates. useful to
 prevent windows from downloading updates when you most need your internet connection.</p>

<p><em>"my problem is solved:"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Good to hear...&nbsp; I don't know why the Show/Hide tool did not block your drivers. I used it when first 'upgrading' to Win10</p>
<p>prior to the 1511 version update and have never had WU update my gpu drivers. I only have that minor reinstall old driver on reboot issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the group policy editor provided in Win10 Pro can be useful for putting off version updates, and I was very disappointed</p>
<p>when they also included a specific option to block driver updates in one of the version updates ( 1703 ? ) but did not include that</p>
<p>option in&nbsp; Win10 Home. I see now that this was a new feature of gpedit , not an add-on to WU as I had thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did disable the update Service briefly early on, but disabling updates altogether is probably not necessary for regular updates as they</p>
<p>are small enough not to be a problem for those of us with download limits, and don't generally affect performance.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you prevent automated WU altogether you will miss security updates, and potentially important bug fixes if you don't run WU
</p>
<p>manually every few weeks.</p>
<p>- The version updates are another story. Being quite large they <em>do</em> affect internet performance.&nbsp; I always do version updates manually
</p>
<p>with the update tool MS releases with each version update before WU starts in on&nbsp; it. This allows dedication to the update task.</p>
<p>Allowing WU to do version updates seems to be more prone to corrupting Windows, and as you mentioned can also slow performance while Windows is downloading the update files in the background. I reckon because the version updates number in the GB's,&nbsp; the
 download is </p>
<p>more prone to corruption if it gets started and stopped too often before the download completes.</p>
<p>I also make a clone of my Windows before doing any of the version updates as a precaution. The version updates overwrite</p>
<p>large sections of Windows which makes them prone to corrupting Windows regardless of how they get installed. Murphy's Law...</p>
<p>

<p>yes too bad the home edition does not have gpedit.msc, honestly I prefer home versions because I like to keep things as slim and small as possible, I don't run unecessary programs or anything, and I don't need anything that windows 10 PRO offers, besides
 gpedit.msc because of my WU problem... if home verson had gpedit.msc, I would not be running windows 10 PRO.</p>
<p>actually a relative offered me windows 10 PRO thinking it would be good for my courses on programming languages, so I am glad that happened hahaa, this computer is all pumped up, it came with windows 8 that later on updated to windows 8.1... than I installed
 windows 7 Home premium later, with a disc I have, got W7 ultimate because of my brother, he bought it on a sale (80% off) and never used it lol. than I used the free upgrade to windows 10, later on a relative offered me windows 10 PRO and this is how I got
 all this windows versions for my PC hahahah.</p>
<p>I am glad I have all of this, specially windows 10 PRO which solved my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but Home editions should also be able to control things minimally, I mean, on home forcing you to install old or broken drivers or even updates that you know they will create damage... Microsoft should allow the user to control that, they are not perfect,
 neither us, that's why they should allow the user to change things while they can keep providing security and performance updates on their forced way, just allow users to control a little bit of it...</p>

<p>Movie Maker used to be so easy...</p>
<p>I've pretty much given up.&nbsp; Creating DVD quality videos was so easy with Movie Maker under XP.&nbsp; Under 7, I can't capture anything.&nbsp; I had to purchase a new web cam.&nbsp; My old HD quality video camera is not recognized.&nbsp; Previously, I spent about 3 hours to
 create a nice 10 minute editted video with imported music to import to a well know video sharing website.&nbsp; With Windows 7, I've probably spent 40 hours and I can't say that I have 1 second of video captured yet.&nbsp; Sadly, my next purchase may be from a competator...</p>

<p>Unless I can get Windows 7 to recognize my camera, I'm going to be forced to capture my video using an XP maching, and then saving to a thumb drive and transferring to my Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; Once that's done, I can import into either WMM 2.0 or 2.6 (I have
 both now).</p>
<p>I wonder if I could go into "XP Mode" and get the machine to recognize my camera... I may have to experiment with this. Not the best solution, but perhaps a viable work-around...</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Wake up from Sleep Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gkantz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Wake up from Sleep Issues</h2>
                    <p>So I have been having several issues with my new SP3. &nbsp;The biggest (some of you have experienced this) is that upon wake up the unit does strange things. &nbsp;Note that I have installed the firmware update from June, reinstalled wifi drivers, and even restored
 back to factory settings. &nbsp;These are the types of issues I have experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Upon wake-up, pen button does not work to open OneNote sometimes. &nbsp;Tried shutting BT on and off - that does not work. &nbsp;Tried restarting the device and it hung on "Restarting". &nbsp;Had to do a hard reset to boot up again.</li><li>Wifi problems after wake up. &nbsp;I am no longer having problems when I switch to battery because of rolling back the wifi driver, but after sleep I get the network "unavailable" notification. &nbsp;Disconnecting and reconnecting to Wifi router works. &nbsp;Tried rebooting
 - sometimes I get the same "restarting" hang like the pen problem above.</li><li>BT mouse just stops working. &nbsp;Uninstall and reinstall mouse works sometimes.</li><li>Type Cover 3 does not work if attached when waking up - saw this twice. &nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>In many cases after waking from sleep, if I restart, the device hangs on "restarting". &nbsp;Saw this behavior with my "old" SP1 which was fixed with firmware updates. &nbsp;One would think this would not happen again with a third generation device, so this is very
 upsetting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want resolution to these issues, MS. &nbsp;You want to compete with the big boys, these need to be fixed IMMEDIATELY.</p>

            <p>Hi Walter, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I'm up on all updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an intermittent issue. My device enters sleep mode either because of the timeout I've set in the settings, or because I push the power button manually. This issue seems to be happening off of either scenario, so that doesn't appear to be a
 determining factor. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time that I posted the issue, I had *not* made any changes to the power settings. However, since then, I have disabled hibernation through the powercfg command. I did that yesterday, and so far the issue has not occurred again, despite many sleep/wake-up
 cycles since then. </p>
<p>So maybe this was an issue with hibernation? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll report back on here if the issue starts occurring again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, </p>
<p>Dominique</p>

<h2>            how do I fix a appwiz.cpl is corrupted problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 SP-1 Professional on a HP workstation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was set up to install updates automatically</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Macaffe anti=virus installed and it is up&nbsp; to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My network printer stopped working on the workstation so I did a search and came up with a fix that said to turn the Windows Firewall of and reinstall the network printer. I could not turn off the fire wall, so I looked in my events log to see if there was
 anything there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The events log shows that there was an update, but that the update manager was corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the update Fix-it program and it could not fix the&nbsp; problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore to an earlier date, when the updates were working and tried to check for updates. I could not do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC and it could not fix all of the problems, I displayed the CBS log and it shows that Appwiz.cpl could not be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have another copy of W7 on my computer, but it is been a few years since I booted it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP installs a System disk on the computer and I do have the original HP disks to initialize and install all of the HP provided programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 60 programs installed on this computer and another 80 gig of data that I do not want to lose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft and they want to sell me a service plan. They said it is a registry problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this without destroying all of my programs and data?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One possible reason why other updates failed to install is due to missing or corrupted system files. To help you resolve the issue, kindly run the System File Checker (SFC) tool. Windows may not behave as expected when a system file or some system files
 are missing or corrupted. SFC will help you scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. You may check the link below for
<span>instructions on running the</span> SFC. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Once done, kindly run the DISM or System Update Readiness tool. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors. You may check the article below for the steps.</p>

<p>hello madam</p>
<p>I really appreciate your reply on my question, but I earlier run System File Checker (SFC) before getting your reply&nbsp;and it removed corrupt files which might creating problem on installing my updates and after that I re-download windows updated and this
 time updates got installed and there are no new updates now but my window download assistant program still show that some updates are available for my window&nbsp;but when I&nbsp;check&nbsp; window updates there are no new updates available for my windows help on this please.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And second is that while running window update troubleshooter I got a message that system registration is either missing or corrupt(Problem with BITS service --NET- HELPMSG 2182) what does it means also help me on this..

</p><p>I just downloaded the troubleshooter for windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did not choose to delete and reinstall windows updates, or search for updates, as I did not want "Feature Update for Windows 10" to download and fail again and waste another 5 hours of my time.</p>
<p>Here are my results - - - It is that first item that irks me and what I believe is the source of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; To try and do the manual fix scares the crap out of me, and I think Microsoft should provide an update to fix this.&nbsp; Am I being unreasonable?</p>

<p>hello again</p>
<p>I really thankful for your replies to my problems but it's been a long time I haven't use my pc so I don't know that still I persist with service registration missing or corruption problems. So I can't say much now but last time when I run window update
 troubleshooter it show that all problem's regarding window updates were resolve so I think all problem's might been removed.</p>
<p>I attached a screenshot regarding window updates problem's might be resolved.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for updating us. The error that you got from the troubleshooter most likely occurs when your operating system can't access the C:/Windows folder. One way of resolving this is running the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System File Checker tool</a> several times. Just to verify, have you already tried performing it?</p>

<h2>            Why don&#39;t folders reopen in the same size and position as they were when last closed&#63;</h2>
                    I find it infuriating that folders do not open exactly the same (size and position) as they were when they were last closed.&nbsp; This was basic in Windows XP and 7.&nbsp; How can I achieve this with Windows10?

            Thank you for the suggestion.&nbsp; I have tried it and the window remains the same size when reopened as it was when last closed, but not in the same position.&nbsp; I have one particular window that covers about half of the screen and I always use it in the bottom
 half of the screen with another window using the top half.&nbsp; I want the bottom half window to reopen in the bottom half every time, but it always opens in the top half of the screen covering the top half window and I have to drag it to the bottom every time.&nbsp;
 So annoying when Windows XP and 7 handled this with no problem at all.<br />

<p>If you got to <strong>Settings, Update and Security, Windows Update

<p>Ok, so this was resolved in 2015 with an update, but it has returned with a newer update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window positions are not saved when reopening (size is fine). This happened when updating to the latest version. The windows are doing a cascading movement up and to the left around 5 pixels. Previously I was experiencing down and to the right... go figure.<br />

<p>Microsoft, why has this changed again and when can we expect a fix? Very frustrating as the OP has indicated.</p>

<h3> rondraw1955  say:</h3>
<h2>            Who is Responsible When Windows 10 does not take and Reverting back to 8.1 Corrupts the OS&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    My church recently tried the free upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 for their main computer. Windows 10 worked for a very short time before it crashed. Upon trying to downgrade to 8.1 it got stuck in a repair loop which meant we had to take it to
 a local computer service center. They determined that the operating system was now corrupted and they were going to have to perform a fresh install of 8.1. I ask, who is responsible? If the Microsoft utility said the system was good for the upgrade and now
 it is in the shop getting a fresh install of 8.1 which means a loss of data, shouldn't Microsoft flip the bill for this? The same thing happened to me when I tried to upgrade from Windows 7. My OS was corrupted by trying this and I was out over a hundred dollars.
 Sorry, but something stinks here. Just my opinion.

<p>It is always user beware; there are no guarantees in Computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advice given here&nbsp;was to make sure your data was backed up and if you wished to, to do a System Image Backup of the existing operating system before doing the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When doing a major Upgrade and even for everyday use in case of System Corruption or Hard drive failure, you should always have your Data backed up to external media.</p>

            Hi Jon, Windows Spotlight has been causing issues for lots of users lately. Personally I find it very buggy . . .
<br />
<br />Below are the steps to reset Spotlight, I have listed it out in as simple a form as I think possible:
<br />
<br />Open Settings App - Personalization - Lockscreen 
<br />
<br />Under "Background," make sure Windows Spotlight is NOT selected and change the option to Picture 
<br />
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, then copy and paste this into the Address Bar 
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%/AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets 
<br />
<br />Select all the files (Ctrl + A) in that assets folder delete everything 
<br />
<br />Then copy and paste this into the Address Bar: 
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%/AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\Settings 
<br />
<br />In that folder, delete settings.dat and roaming.loc 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />When your PC starts: 
<br />
<br />Open Settings App - Personalization - Lockscreen 
<br />
<br />Under "Background," set it to Windows Spotlight 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            Are you connected to the Internet? Because they are dynamic images sourced from Bing.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; File Explore &gt; This PC
<br />Select the View tab then check Hidden Items
<br />
<br />Copy and paste the following into the address bar
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%/AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState\Assets
<br />
<br />Right click settings.dat and roaming.lock each,
<br />Rename each respectively settings.dat.bak and roaming.lock.bak
<br />
<br />Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Open Settings App &gt; Personalisation &gt; Lock screen &gt; click in the 'Background', list box then choose Windows Spotlight.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: regedit 
<br />Right click Regedit
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following key 
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Authentication\LogonUI\Creative\S-1-5-21-826134325-3229497062-2753576501-1001
<br />
<br />this will be your first user, if you got more change on all of them:
<br />
<br />Double click LockScreenOptions
<br />
<br />Change the Value data to 4
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Exit the Registry then restart.

            Hello, I’m Virginia, a volunteer.
<br />You could use this fix from the tenforum to reset &amp; re-register Spotlight: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset-re-register-windows-spotlight-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/82156-reset...</a>
<br />There’s a bug with Spotlight since the Fall update, if you choose ‘not a fan’ it resets the background to the default photo so you have to run this fix again.

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue. I definitely understand how frustrating it can be to not be able to join groups with your friends. What I recommend doing is making sure your console is up to date as well as your friends. Once
 both console are up to date I suggest performing a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle on the Xbox One</a>. I hope this info helps. Please let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Lost sound after system restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wavesofdelusion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost sound after system restore</h2>
                    I recently did a system restore after my computer crashed and everything seems to be okay except for the lack of sound coming from my speakers. This isn't an uncommon issue because I found a bunch of stuff on Google, but nothing that I've tried has worked
 for me and I'm getting frustrated. I tried uninstalling the device from the device manager, but even if I do that and restart the computer it manages to reinstall itself anyway, yet I still have no sound. Everything appears okay despite these issues. I tried
 downloading the newest drivers and installing them to no avail. Updating the drivers didn't work either. So, I wonder if somebody can help, and if you manage to get me through this, I will record a 30 second tribute song for you. Yeah, I know. I'm pretty desperate.

This may be of some use to you guys:<br />

    <title>File Access Denied error from external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffrey hallett  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Access Denied error from external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I have mounted an external hard drive that I used in my previous job on my home computer.&nbsp; When I try to copy a file off, I get a dialog saying "You need administrator permission to copy this file.... [Continue][Skip][Cancel]"&nbsp; When I press "Continue", I
 get a second dialog box that says "File Access Denied" with the description "You need permission to perform this action.&nbsp; You require permission from &lt;local user name&gt; to make changes to this file ..."&nbsp; [Try Again] [Cancel]&nbsp; &nbsp;The &lt;local user name&gt; is the old
 name of my account on this laptop before I upgraded to Windows 10 and started using my Live account to log in.&nbsp; I am an administrator on my laptop already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the ownership change route a number of times trying several combinations of administrator, the &lt;local user name&gt;, my current user name (the Live one).&nbsp; I get this error every time regardless.&nbsp; I'm not even trying to change the file - I'm just copying
 it from the external drive to my local drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, this only occurs for files I created while using it at work.&nbsp; They are in a specific folder.&nbsp; I can read/write other files and folders on the drive without any error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I "provide permission" to copy the files?&nbsp; Is there another route to force an ownership change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

<p>I think though this might not really be a permissions problem at all.&nbsp; I just tried something different and got an error about not being able to decrypt the file.&nbsp; Now in File Explorer, the icons all have little yellow locks superimposed on the icons.&nbsp; My
 previous company did use Druva to encrypt/compress laptops.&nbsp; I thought when I copied these files I instructed it to create a clean version of the files, but it might've actually copied encrypted versions anyway. &nbsp; I might be hosed.&nbsp; I would like though to
 see your command as it might come in handy in the future provided it isn't a waste of your time.</p>

            Sorry, the command I had in mind would be useless for encrypted files. You must obtain the decryption key from your former employer.

<h2>            google docs on edge browser is displaying blank page with family safety on for a kid account on win10</h2>
                    this seems to be some setup issue as it works on a different pc. resetting win10 to factory state didn't help address the issue. would like to know if any one else has similar issue and was able to resolve it.

<h2>            Win 10 security warning - &#34;These files might be harmful to your computer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This is driving me crazy! &nbsp;If I try to drag an image file to a new folder I get the ""These files might be harmful to your computer" message even though the files are already on my computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I move files at least 20 times a day so it's not hard to understand why this might be VERY annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can cut and paste but that takes 5 times longer and defeats the whole 'drag and drop' intent!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried numerous settings without success. I read another post that said removing Internet Explorer solved the problem. BUT IE does not show as a program in Win 10 System!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>

But I've changed everything, I've already removed the email from windows 10, put it back, logged in to the xbox app and nothing solves it. Please help me.</span></pre>

<h2>            Desktop will not load after Windows 10 update - screen flashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has been rendered pretty much unusable by recent Windows 10 updates. &nbsp;We bought it approximately 8 months ago (it's an HP Pavilion) and it was working fine until a month or so ago. &nbsp;Since then, having attempted to update to a newer build of Windows
 10, it refuses to work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The login screen shows as usual but, once the password had been entered, it doesn't load the desktop. &nbsp;Instead, the screen keeps flashing to black and it tries to load the desktop - flashing - desktop - flashing - desktop. &nbsp;Occasionally, it gets as far as
 loading the desktop icons, but only around 1 attempt in 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done as much reading as I can, and things I think this isn't:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This doesn't seem to be a display driver issue - task manager loads just fine. &nbsp;When it does, it generally shows CPU usage of 80%-100%</p>
<p>2. This isn't an issue with error reporting or problem log - I've disabled them both and it still happens</p>
<p>3. There isn't a hardware issue - I can recover the computer, but as soon as it tries to load the most recent security updates, the issue happens again</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;It doesn't happen in safe boot, but does happen in clean boot, so it can't be a third-party app causing the problem</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Last time I saw a new error message, about not being able to load explorer.exe and not being able to find shell:::{5dfb-447d-801a-d0b52f2e83e1}</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;I have tried to uninstall the most recent updates (KB4040724) the only time I was able to hit Windows + I fast enough to load the settings menu (like task manager - works without a problem). &nbsp;Didn't seem to make any difference</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;To date, the only applications we have actually downloaded onto the computer are Chrome and Citrix. &nbsp;Neither of those were on the latest recovery, so it really must be a problem with native Windows software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the update, I was running build 1511. &nbsp;The update took me to 1703 15063.632. &nbsp;I have tried forcing the update myself. &nbsp;I have tried downloading the update tool and updating from there. &nbsp;I have tried disabling the forced update service, but they happened
 anyway. &nbsp;Nothing seems to make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer is basically unusable - we can't take it back to where we bought it because it's clearly a sotware issue. &nbsp;I'd be eternally grateful for anyone who can help me understand what is going on and how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
                </div>

            Can you boot into Safe Mode again then try the following method to remove the recent update?

Press Windows key + R
Type: appwiz.cpl
Hit Enter
Click View installed updates
Select the recent update
Right click it then click uninstall.

Try uninstalling the update to see if it restores functionality.

Press Windows key + R
Type: appwiz.cpl
Hit Enter

Open View Installed Updates
Right click the recently installed updates since this started happening
Click uninstall

Restart your computer then check if you can load the desktop successfully.

            If that doesn't help then here are other steps to recover from a WIndows or Version Update that makes Windows fail to start.  I will help you work through the steps, or you can contact HP Support which provides an included one year Support and Replacement warranty (which you do not need to pay extra for if they try to sell you up):  

 1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html

If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.

2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/2

<p><span>Thank you both so much for your help.&nbsp; Have been travelling this week, but got around to attempting to fix the other day.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With some frantic button pressing whilst the screen was flashing, I got Windows + I and selected the 'go back to previous Windows version' option (@Greg - Option
 1). &nbsp;So I was running 1511 again, which worked fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday, Windows has managed to install some cumulative security updates:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KB890830, KB4035632, KB3172729, KB3150513, KB3152599, KB4041689, KB890830</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>again - all worked fine. &nbsp;Today, though, the 'Your device needs the latest security updates' window popped up, saying I need to install the most current version
 of Windows 10. &nbsp;This is the thing that has killed it every time.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I used the Windows 10 updater tool to download the newest version.&nbsp; True to form:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. The new version of Windows downloaded and installed and the computer restarted</span></p>
<p><span>2. I logged in and got scrolling messages about 'hi, we're installing some important updates'.&nbsp; 'It's taking a bit longer than expected but we'll get there
 as fast as we can' (who writes this stuff?!)</span></p>
<p><span>4. &nbsp;It restarted and the screen started flashing again</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I re-booted to safe mode, and looked at recent updates.&nbsp; There were two installed today:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>KB4021572</span></p>
<p><span>KB4041676</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I uninstalled KB4021572 and restarted.&nbsp; Still flashing, and CPU usage constantly &gt;66%</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I re-booted to safe mode again, and uninstalled the KB 4041676 (Creators Update).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Screen still flashing!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I re-booted to safe mode, and back into installed updates.&nbsp; A new one pops up as having installed today: KB4025342, which I can’t select to uninstall.&nbsp;
 This update wasn’t showing before I uninstalled the other two.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System information says I am now running Version 10.0.15063 Build 15063. &nbsp;Windows Update Assistant congratulates me for running the latest version
 of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Short of recovering again, I’m now at an impasse, and would really value any further advice as what to try next.&nbsp; Is that last update the one causing
 the problem?&nbsp; Why can’t I uninstall it?&nbsp; @Greg – should I try your bootable installation media?</span></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this post after searching the same issue I am having with my daughters HP Pavillion PC, following a recent Windows 10 update, last week. Tarb's flashing&nbsp;screen description appears to be identical to my daughters. I've reset the PC to factory setting
 which then went on to update files in setup resulting in a repeat of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise me if this issue has been resolved and how I might fix my daughters PC? Shes currently doing her A Levels and tearing&nbsp;her hair out in frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Pete</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what you've mentioned about having the same concern, we'd like to confirm if you've tried also the suggestion provided
<strong>Greg Carmack - Windows MVP</strong> which was to use the Media Creation tool to perform some troubleshooting steps, apart from the factory reset that you've already performed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may try to perform an <strong>in-place upgrade&nbsp;</strong>with Windows 10. This will help repairing any possible corrupted system files that may cause the issue. This will keep your personal files, settings, and installed applications.
 Please click this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">Forum Article</a></strong>

<p>Hi Louie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intended to follow Greg's suggestion but thought I would try another attempt to do a factory reset first. I'm pleased to say that this time it was successful and I didn't get the message 'it's taking a bit longer than expected' come up. I've managed to
 re-install without a repeat of the problem. I'm hoping the update that caused the issue is now safely installed as part of the reset. If not I would be persuaded&nbsp;to try your suggestion of&nbsp;<span>in-place upgrade&nbsp;</span><span>with
 Windows 10 as next step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your help</span></p>

            <p>There are no downgrade options. As you found out a Windows 10 product key will not activate Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You either need to locate and use your Windows 7 OEM product key or purchase another copy of Windows 7.</p>

            <p>I don't get this.&nbsp; OEM versions are eligible for downgrade rights according to link below.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>What are the correct steps to exercise downgrade right?&nbsp; The guide from Microsoft below are not clear.&nbsp;
</p>
The downgrade process
<p>Follow these steps to downgrade to an earlier version of Windows software: </p>
<ul>
<li>Use genuine Windows media <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(Which one do I use, Win10 PRO or Win7 PRO media?)
</span></strong>and a corresponding product key for the version of Windows that is eligible for downgrade. The media/key should come from a previously licensed product from the OEM or retail channel.
</li><li>End users who are licensed separately through Microsoft Volume Licensing (VL) may provide their VL media and key to a system builder to facilitate the downgrade on their own systems.
<strong>(I'm not using VL media)</strong></li><li>Insert the downgrade-eligible version<strong> (Is this Win7 PRO (OEM) or Win10 PRO (OEM)?)
</strong>of Windows media and follow the installation instructions. </li><li>Enter the product key. <strong>(Which key, Win7 PRO (I don't have)&nbsp;or Win10 PRO key (I have)?)</strong></li><li>If the software was previously activated, it cannot be activated online. In this case, the appropriate local Activation Support phone number will be displayed. Call the number and explain the circumstances. When it is determined that the end user has an
 eligible Windows license, the customer service representative will provide a single-use activation code to activate the software. Please note that Microsoft does not provide a full product key in this scenario.
</li><li>Activate the software. </li></ul>

            <p>Since what you have is an OEM System Builder Windows 10 license, you would be identified as the system builder, similar to a DELL, HP, Lenovo, Sony, Acer or ASUS. Which, means, you would have to supply yourself with the appropriate Windows 7 license for
 downgrade rights. Thats what the other OEMs have to do; thats why OEM System Builder licenses are not available to the general public. It is for entities that build and resell computers. Many individuals simply take advantage of it because its a cheaper way
 to acquire a Windows license. </p>
