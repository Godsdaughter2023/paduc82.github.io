    <title>Deleted Fonts I didn&#39;t think I needed&#59; Japanese and Chinese - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleted Fonts I didn&#39;t think I needed&#59; Japanese and Chinese Characters render as boxes everywhere</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was deleting a bunch of unnecessary fonts on my Windows 8&nbsp;by searching for "regedit" and then deleting the fonts from "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE → Software → Microsoft → Windows NT → CurrentVersion → Fonts"</p>
<p>I followed some of the steps from this wiki article. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Protected-System-Fonts-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.wikihow.com/Delete-Protected-System-Fonts-in-Windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I deleted I lot of fonts that I thought I didn't need, or that I thought I must have downloaded. Now all Japanese and Chinese fonts render as boxes, EVERYWHERE. In word editing programs, in graphic programs that allow fonts AND in all web browsers on
 web pages, Internet Explorer AND google chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 8 is not a touch screen or a phone or tablet, it's a desktop computer.</p>
<p>I tried something new that I never thought of and I'm going to restart the computer here in&nbsp;a moment, to see if what I did worked, which was go to the control panel, go to language and region and then to fonts, then font settings.</p>
<p>I clicked restore and I'll see if that worked after I restarted the computer, since it really didn't do anything when I clicked it. (I'm checking google translate, to see if the fonts come back.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downloading language packs and different free Japanese and Chinese fonts but nothing worked, the fonts I downloaded are&nbsp;rendering in English or&nbsp;as boxes, and the language packs are only&nbsp;for the keyboard settings.&nbsp;I spent around a month or two with
 out these characters and it's frustrating to not&nbsp;have them render right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of downloading the official fonts or whatever font families are from the Microsoft website, but it costs money, and I don't have the funds to do that right now, and I'm not prepared to put money in such a little issue at the moment.</p>
<p>I can't find any article online to help fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

            <span>Hi Carol,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the steps and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
a. Press alt to bring up the file menu.<br />
b. Go to /tools/internet options/fonts/<br />
c. Set the "Language Script" to Chinese Simplified<br />
d. Select the only option - Arial Unicode MS<br />
e. Accept the changes- problem solved.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span>

<h2>            I&#39;m trying to log in after I appropriately shut down my computer, but when I try to log in the message&#58; &#34;Logging in...&#34; appears indefinitely, and it seems that my computer won&#39;t hand off the reins to my operating system.</h2>
                    My computer will only allow me to log in completely after I press and hold the shutdown/ start-up button to turn off my computer. If I try to log in after a real shutdown, not a manual one, the screen, after I insert my correct password, will just read,
 "Logging in..." forever. And I have tried for hours to just let the computer think, and to no avail. Help?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
•&nbsp;Have you made any hardware/software changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to restart the computer in safe mode and check if it’s able to restart normally. Safe mode will start Windows Vista with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to
 start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:<br />
i. Restart the computer.<br />
ii. Start tapping F8 key.<br />
iii. You will get advanced boot option window.<br />
iv. Select the option “Safe mode”.<br />
<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
If you are able to restart the computer properly in safe mode, perform clean boot which should resolve the issue. Clean boot will start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.
<br />
<br />
The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
1) Perform clean boot (Check the link for performing clean boot).<br />
2) Enable half of the services.<br />
3) Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
4) Enable half of the startup items.<br />
5) Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
6) Repeat the above steps until you find out which service or program is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>.</p>

<h2>            Gamer Score Has Changed Believe account was compromised or altered</h2>
                    
<p>I had a Gamer score close to about 5k on 12/25/2014 then I logged on my Xbox on 12/26/2014 at about 11:05 PM CST and noticed that my score it has changed tremendously. The score is now 2995. Also, console&nbsp;is plugged is plugged in the wall and I haven't joined
 a modded lobby or anything like this because I very rarely play games so I am VERY&nbsp;confused.&nbsp;I did profile protection and deleted the profile ONLY and cleared the cache and still shows the incorrect Gamerscore. Please HELP! I am concerned that my account has
 been compromised, or altered. I do have proof as well but had issues loading the images.</p>

<p>This hasn't happened to me now (but then again, I don't really pay much attention to my gs). Best option would be to start a new thread on support or even call Xbox support to get the issue immediately resolved. The servers are under attack at the moment
 which could possibly indicate the source (or not). You probably here to see if anyone else has this problem, and well....I do hope it works out for you. Too be honest, it may be resolved whenever the servers are back up. Best option is to sleep it off and
 check in the morning. </p>

<p>Excuse me.. Not to be rude. I promise. &nbsp;But I am not posting this to see if any one else is having the issue I am posting this because this is a serious issue and also because I currently still have the same Gamerscore and it has been 2 days now. Also, I
 thought I did start a new thread I created this topic// if not can you inform me on this.. Also, I thank you for the kind words, but this is a serious issue. As my account may have been compromised. Also, Calling support will not help me as I know what to
 do already :) if you know what I mean. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, Yesterday I did the text option on the support website for when the Service Alert was lifted and then logged into my account on the Xbox and then seen that my Gamer Score was altered was like WHOA hold up. So, I did the troubleshooting I mentioned
 above and am still very confused about this situation. Doesn't really make since, unless Enforcement has changed it or unless someone who has gained access to the servers &nbsp;has altered my account.</p>

<p>Not a problem. Just out of curiosity, you're aware that xbox.com says your gs is 4520? Because that's what I'm seeing on your profile at the moment. Right, you said that your gs has remained the same for the past 2 days but has anything happened since then?
 Have you noticed any unusual activity since them two days? Have you alternatively, gone onto your xbox dashboard and checked your games and counted the gs of each particular game you've ever played. Do they add up to your original gs? I know I'm asking a lot
 of questions here, but they're questions that need answers. &nbsp;You say you know what to do already.....I'm going to take a wild guess here and assume we won't be seeing much more of DLG GuttaGutta6? If you can, remove any sort of personal identification on your
 xbox account immediately (I know you know this too well) but I'm just trying to put myself in your position.

<p>Not to be rude once again but I have deleted my profile and re downloaded it several times I also have confirmed from the website that my gamer score compared to what it shows on my Xbox are completely different my gamer score reflects 2000 points difference
 from what it shows on the website compared to my consul I have checked for corrupted data I have powered cycled my console checked security proofs done all of the necessary steps to make sure my account has profile issues resolved I even called support which
 I know myself personally. That there shouldn't be an issue with this but just to confirm I had to call for documentation purposes as well but I called support to make sure that there isn't an issue with the enforcement team but as far as my account reflecting
 as if I was being banned or suspended for cheating but I have a good reputation level so that was ruled out as well. &nbsp;For the post about this I cannot believe that you can say that this is not a serious issue as the servers were down and it could be a potential
 that my account was compromised whether you believe it or not that could be a possibility I have much faith in the Xbox community but this is downright not fair I have been a valued Xbox live member I have never cheated modded my console or my profile or done
 anything to deserve this I am at straight gamer and love to play games and for my achievements I earned this my gamer score may not be high but I work a lotand for the achievements that I have earned I on them for the time that I do put into play which means
 a lot to me because this is the time I do actually have spare to actually play Larce also Thank you as well for the kind words for the encouragement and also trying to help troubleshooting as this does help somewhat LOL also I don't mean that sarcastically
 I truly mean that especially when it comes to removing PII</p>

<p>Now I will say this it could be a possibility that it is taking some time for the servers to catch up to the profile since it was down for some time so it just may need a little bit of time in order for the profile to understand it's correct gamer score
 considering that The servers were down and the information may need to sync which I totally understand. Alternatively, another solution or resolution is that this could be my Old Xbox one gamer score but that really fathoms me as well as it should not be reading
 on the Xbox 360 as my Xbox one was stolen almost a year ago so how would that make sense??? Nevertheless I have full faith like I said in this issue getting resolved as I know Xbox live and the team that is working on it is dedicated and super awesome</p>

<p>owen is right,no one has the ability to remove some of your Gamerscore.</p>
<p>The only people who can remove your Gamerscore are the enforcement team &amp; they can only remove all of your Gamerscore.They would only do this if you are caught with modded achievements.</p>
<p>It just sounds like a syncing issue to me as your gamercard here says you have 4520gs.</p>
<p>If you are worried about your account then change any passwords linked to it but the chances of anyone getting into your account are extremely slim.</p>
<p>I've encountered similar issues on the support forums in the past &amp; it usually corrects itself after a few days but if it doesn't then i'd suggest posting in the support foums where an official staff member could look into your account.</p>

<p>Yeah, two achievements for Southpark: The Stick of Truth aren't showing up for me, but when I click on the achievement list it shows the two achievements I got. I'm not too bugged by it, but I hope it changes soon. Then again, I did play it offline for a
 while and it was fine, signed on live and that's how it showed up. Maybe I just need to load up the game for it to work.
</p>
<p>Oh well. OP, it does seem to show you have 4520. Probably just a small error that'll be fixed soon.

<h2>            Start Menu Closing After Entering Two Letters</h2>
                    I have a problem with the start menu on my Windows 10 computer. Every time I open the start menu and start a search, the menu closes after I enter the second letter. I'm not sure what's going on, but is anyone else having this problem?

<p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues with the Start menu are often caused by a corrupted system file and user profile. For us to isolate what causes the issue, we can perform several troubleshooting steps. Initially, we have to make sure that your PC is up to date. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;key + <strong>R</strong>, type <strong>
ms-settings:</strong>, and then select <strong>OK</strong>. This opens <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In <strong>Settings</strong>,&nbsp;choose&nbsp;<strong>Update &amp; security</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>
<strong>Update </strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Check for updates</strong>. Install any available updates and restart your PC if required.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is the same after the steps above, you can <span>try the <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start menu troubleshooter</a>. After you've completed the troubleshooter, restart your PC as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you need additional assistance, do not hesitate to let us know.</span></p>

 </blockquote> <p>E x a c t l y... it's not even that you shouldn't or can't defend yourself. But if you do it in a way that is just as bad, abusive, or worse than whomever initiated it, then you're being just as bad as they are. Why should you be treated differently? In the end, the rules are the rules and if 2 people who can't get along both decide to break them, then enforcement will see 2 people who broke the rules. Why should they care who started it? Short answer is they shouldn't.</p>

            Hi Harish.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If the router is within a year of purchase, it includes Support and replacement warranty so I'd contact them to get it set up properly.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise go to the router's Support Downloads web page to download and read the Manual which should cover all of this.    
<br />
<br />You may need also to refer to the wireless adapter's Support web page to see what Security it supports to match it to the router.  There is also covered here:  <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Wireless-and-Networking/Ralink-RT3290-802-11bgn-Wi-Fi-Adapter-not-connecting-to-wifi/td-p/6447927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Wireless...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi Shanon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which application are you using the music files? What is the full error message displayed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this issue occur with all file formats or with a particular file format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to first check if you are able to play music files using Windows Media player and check. If the same issue occurs and if an error stating the required codecs are not available, then try running Windows update to make sure that all required
 updates are installed. If the issue persists, then check and install the required codecs for your PC as mentioned in this article:</p>

<p>Hi, ok so you enabled two step verification and are using the app password rather than your regular password do try and sign in/download your profile? Could you try clearing the system cache three times one after the other, power the console off and back
 on and then try downloading the profile in question.</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>I turned on two-step verification. How do I sign in to apps or devices that don't accept security codes?</p>
<p>Some apps (like the mail apps on some smartphones) or devices (like the Xbox 360, for example) can't prompt you to enter a security code when you try to sign in. If you get an incorrect password error with an app or device, you'll need to create a unique
 app password to sign in. Once you've signed in with your app password, you're all set to use that app or device. You'll need to create and sign in with an app password once for each app or device that can't prompt you for a security code.</p>

<p>Did you check out the link regarding two step verification, if you have that enabled you will need to generate an app password to use in place of your regular account password, that or simply turn off two step verification.</p>

<p>Hey Albertababe,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear your having issues with your Profile I know how frustrating that can be.</p>
<p>If all else fails I would suggest deleting the system updates and then download them again.</p>
<p><b>Solution 6: Delete and then redownload system updates</b></p>
<p>To delete and then redownload the system updates, follow these steps.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> These steps delete system updates that are installed on your Xbox console.</p>
<ol>
<li>If necessary, follow the steps in the <b>Move and then redownload your Xbox LIVE profile</b> section (Solution 3, above) to move your Xbox LIVE profile.
</li><li>Press the <b>Guide</b> button, and then select <b>Xbox Home</b>. </li><li>Select <b>settings</b> and then <b>System</b>. </li><li>Select <b>Storage</b>. </li><li>Highlight your storage device (but do not press <b>A</b> to select it). </li><li>Press the following buttons:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>Left bumper </li><li>Right bumper </li><li><b>X</b> button </li><li>Left bumper </li><li>Right bumper </li><li><b>X</b> button </li></ol>
</li><li>On the <b>Delete System Update</b> screen, select <b>Yes</b>. </li><li>After your Xbox console restarts, select <b>OK</b> to download and install the system update.
</li><li>After the system update is installed, redownload your Xbox LIVE profile and try to sign in to Xbox LIVE.
</li></ol>
<p>I hope this gets you back gaming.</p>

<p>Ok.....tried all that.....didn't work. &nbsp;I was, however, able to download my profile on a USB on my daughter's xbox. &nbsp;I can access it from the USB and even moved to my HD on my xbox, but now the problem is that it will not take my password!! I tried changing
 my password on the PC and then tried the new password on the xbox, but it still won't sign me in!!! &nbsp;I'm sooooooooo frustrated.</p>

            <p>Hey there Albertababe!<br /><br />We haven't heard back from you in a while. Were you able to find any corrupt files like EggsBoxJuan asked about?<br /><br />Also, from looking at this thread, it might not be all Two-Step Verification related. <strong>Have you set up <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/security-proofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security Proofs</a>/Two Factor Authentication on your account as well?</strong> Major Nelson also has a great <a href="http://majornelson.com/2013/04/19/using-microsoft-two-factor-authentication-with-your-xbox-live-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Blog on Two Factor Authentication</a> that helps walk you through it if you need that as well.<br /><br /><strong>Once your Security Proofs/Two Factor Authentication/Two Step Verification are all set up properly and good to go, let's give these steps a shot:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that you still have a copy of your profile on a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">USB drive</a> for safekeeping.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your profile</a> ONLY (do NOT delete profile and items) from your hard drive.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear your system cache</a> 3 times in a row.</li>
<li>Restart your console.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your profile</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Let us know how everything goes and we'll be happy to work with you from there ^_^&nbsp;</p>

<p>MY club is being held hostage by gamer with gamertag "SunshineSumo59". The club (which was at the time ranked #1 on the leaderboards), FC Agweegwee, made a group decision to kick this player off the club. Unfortunately, the guy who did it was unaware that
 "SunshineSumo59" was still in the match lobby. Now this guy is refusing to leave the match lobby, and he even has captain, effectively preventing us from playing games. We have already slipped to #3 on the leaderboards and falling quickly. If this keeps up
 we will be out of contention within days or maybe less. I have made a report of this matter to both EA and Xbox live. If this guy is disconnected from Xbox Live or EA servers for even 1 second, this problem will be resolved. This happened at approx. 10pm last
 night, and so has already been going on for 12 hours (!). PLEASE RESPOND TO THIS POST MODERATORS!!!! I NEED YOUR HELP!!!! WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!!! SOMEBODY CONFIRM MY ADULATION FOR XBOX LIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!! I AM BEGGING YOU!!!!!</p>
<p>The following are the reference numbers for my formal complaints, starting with Xbox Live</p>

            <p>From other threads on a similar problem with previous version of Windows, there were two suggestions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Perform an <strong>in-place upgrade</strong>. &nbsp;However, people have reported that this did not work. &nbsp;I haven't tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Run <strong>Windows App Troubleshooter</strong>, &nbsp;I have tried this and got the same results as others, it found a possible problem with damaged cache, but did not fix this, and offered no solution to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still wondering why Microsoft has no solution for this problem, nearly a year after it was reported.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that this issue is due to app corruption after the update. Let's isolate the issue by performing the methods below:<br />
<br />
The methods are listed in order, so start with the first one, see if that fixes the problem, and then continue to the next one if it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">clean boot</a></strong> to eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Run <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">System File Checker</a></strong> to check for any file corruption.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for the results.<br />
<br />
Regards.

The methods are listed in order, so start with the first one, see if that fixes the problem, and then continue to the next one if it doesn’t.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">clean boot</a></strong> to eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Run <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">System File Checker</a></strong> to check for any file corruption.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for the results.<br />

<p>Thank you Romel!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> and then tried Feedback Hub. &nbsp;The spinning dots reappeared, but I let it run a while. &nbsp;After about 30 seconds the Feedback Hub displayed Collections. &nbsp;I suppose this is the normal, working condition. &nbsp;I had never seen this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then reset my settings to normal settings, rebooted, and tried Feedback Hub again. &nbsp;It is now working. &nbsp;So, apparently just doing a clean boot and running Feedback Hub allowed the corrupt cache to be cleared, and now the app is working.</p>

 &nbsp;Still not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The results from the troubleshooter linked me to Feedback Hub that has other posts about this error message about the Windows Store cache may be damaged. &nbsp;</p>

            This is very similar to your problem though with a different error code: <a href="http://www.winstructor.com/kb/questions/36/Windows+Vista+Error+0x80070241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winstructor.com/kb/questions/36/Windows+Vista+Error+0x80070241</a>. In essence, this says there's a problem with the CD. Try cleaning it before trying to install it again. You may need to return the CD for a replacement (but I'm not sure - wait to
 hear from others to see if they have any better ideas - unless you have a time limit for returning it).<br />
<br />
I've looked up the error code and I think it means that the operation timed out - I don't think it tells us what the error actually is (which isn't very helpful i know).&nbsp; I also looked up the error message itself (assuming it was word for word) and got nothing.
<br />
<br />
When does it give you this message?&nbsp; Is it immediately or after install has run for awhile - what's happening in install when the message pops up?&nbsp; I mean, how far into the process does it get before it fails?<br />

<h2>            How to disable Secure Boot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus G750JM gaming laptop. I want to disable secure boot, so I can modify my msconfig.exe settings. This is what happens if I try to modify them. Also, when I try to change the secure boot options, it's grayed out.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Users said to set a "supervisor" password in my bios to change the settings. It doesn't work, I don't have a supervisor password, only a master password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I will not be booting to another os or so, just want to disable it so my system is free from it and I can change these settings without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">With the issue description I understand that you are experiencing problem with secure boot on Windows 8.1 computer. I will certainly help you in changing
 the secure boot option. Before we start I would like to inform you about secure boot is option
</span><span>When the PC starts, the firmware checks the signature of each piece of boot software, including firmware drivers (Option ROMs) and the operating system. If the signatures are good,
 the PC boots, and the firmware gives control to the operating system. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The following versions of Windows support Secure Boot: Windows 8.1, Windows&nbsp;Server 2012 R2, Windows&nbsp;RT 8.1, Windows&nbsp;8, Windows Server&nbsp;2012, and Windows&nbsp;RT.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now as you have mentioned regarding “supervisor password” so windows no longer need to set up supervisor password to change the boot sequence you may refer
 the steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to disable the secure boot option please follow the options as given below.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open the PC BIOS menu. You can often access this menu by pressing a key during the boot up sequence, such as F1, F2, F12, or Esc.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Or, from Windows, hold the Shift key while selecting
<strong>Restart</strong>. Go to <strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options: UEFI Firmware Settings</strong>.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Find the
<strong>Secure Boot</strong> setting, and if possible, set it to <strong>Disabled</strong>. This option is usually in either the
<strong>Security</strong> tab, the <strong>Boot</strong> tab, or the <strong>Authentication</strong> tab.</span></li><li>
<span>Save changes and exit. The PC reboots.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: IF you make any incorrect changes in BIOS, this may lead to serious problem on your computer so before making any changes
 to the BIOS, I would suggest you to contact the Computer Manufacturers.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot
 guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

                    I just installed the new update for Windows 10 and the icon for Microsoft Edge has a&nbsp; icon but it is blank, it used to have a Microsoft Edge symbol in it now there is not a symbol. I can still access Microsoft Edge.

            The desktop icon is just blank&nbsp; ( white in the center ) it is not like it was before the download. I have just finished installing the new updates on 7 computers and on&nbsp;all of them the desktop icons are the same ( white in the center ) It say Microsoft
 Edge below the icon but no color or indication in the center as to what it is.

            This did not work for me. The desktop icon use to be Blue with a E in the middle, now it is just white with no E in the icon.

            <p>If you have the Edge icon in your taskbar you can do this to add it to the desktop&nbsp;<span>all you have to do is hold down your shift-key and right-click the Microsoft Edge shortcut that is on your task bar and click create shortcut. A prompt will

<p>I had to do this when mine went the same way - White icon</p>
<p>You can also try right clicking the white icon &amp; choose properties, change icon &amp; look under&nbsp;</p>
<pre>C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe</pre>
<p>this is where the edge icon file is located, click on it &amp; choose ok.</p>

            This first option you suggested&nbsp;does not work. It gives me the Blue Icon but&nbsp;when I click on the icon it will not&nbsp;open Microsoft Edge. The second option does not work either.&nbsp;If I right click on&nbsp;the white icon and go to properties there is no Microsoft
 Edge icon.

            Once under properties you choose the change icon button &amp; then enter the text I posted in the address bar &amp; press enter, this will bring up the edge icon.

            It worked until I shut down the computer . When I started it up again it does the same thing. The desktop icon is white with no Blue E in the icon. Something has to fix this problem.
