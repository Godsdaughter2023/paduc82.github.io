<h2>            System Windows Closes After Completing App Uninstall - Design Issue</h2>
                    <p>While in the "Apps &amp; features" of the SYSTEM window, Why is it when&nbsp;I chose an application to uninstall and the uninstall completes, the system window closes taking me back to desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under previous versions of windows OS under the Control Panel/ Programs when you uninstall a program the window remains open so you can easily choose additional programs to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 requires you to have to click the windows symbol, located where the start button used to be, then click Settings, then click System, then select Apps &amp; features each time an selected program uninstall completes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are always many ways to get there in Windows and in this situation a more learned computer user will know they could just type "Apps &amp; features" in the search field.&nbsp; But the system window will still close and the user will have to type in the search
 phrase again after each uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the issue is not getting there it is being able to remain there until finished uninstalling and not having the window close after each uninstall so you have to go there again and again for each uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you make it so the system windows does not close after an uninstall completes?</p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response was not helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I can uninstall programs in Windows 10, the&nbsp;issue that I am&nbsp;asking about&nbsp;is what happens after the uninstall completes.&nbsp; Why does uninstalling a program close the uninstall window (System Window)?</p>
<p>It should not close as part of the uninstall process because I may want to select additional programs to uninstall.</p>
<p>Once I am done uninstalling programs, I&nbsp;should be the one to&nbsp;close the window not the system.</p>
<p>For example if you go into Windows 7 and go to Control Panel then&nbsp;"Programs" then "Programs and Features" then click on&nbsp;"Uninstall Program" the window that opens and displays a list of installed programs, when you select a program to uninstall and it completes
 the uninstallation&nbsp;the window will remain open and will not be closed via automated processes, the window is closed by the user when they no longer need to uninstall programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,&nbsp;the "Programs an Features" window&nbsp;in Win7 is designed to&nbsp;be closed by the user, but in Windows 10 the System Window either by design or in error closes when it should not.</p>
<p>I am asking the programmers to correct the functionality of the window so it does not close when a program finishes uninstalling.</p>
<p>I will check to see if Windows 10 has a "Problem Steps Recorder" if it does I will attach what it captures for more clarity of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration</p>

<p><span>Hi Leha Leman,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site. I would suggest you to try out these options
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Option 1:
</strong>You can try running the System File Checker, this will scan protected system files and replace incorrect versions, with the correct Microsoft versions of the files.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Open an
<strong>elevated command prompt</strong>. To do this, click <strong>
Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs,</strong> click <strong>
Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Option 2:
</strong>The issue may be caused also by your <strong>security program</strong> such an anti-virus or a Windows Firewall /Defender which might have conflicting settings as to not to perform certain tasks. I suggest that you
<strong>temporary disable</strong> the anti-virus and firewall and check the result again. You would need to turn on the security programs again which you had disabled</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Option 3:
</strong>To check if a<strong> third party application</strong> is a cause, follow this link (</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a><span>)
 for this Boot to the desktop in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> option and check if this issues still persists, if the issue is resolved, you need to perform a
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> by following the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source and isolate it:<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Option 4:
</strong>If that doesn‚Äôt help, you may need to do an <strong>in-place upgrade or a reinstall</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An in-place upgrade will essentially repair Windows Vista and retain your applications, files, and settings as they were in your previous
 edition of Windows. If you have installed Service Pack 1 for Windows Vista and your original Windows Vista DVD does not include this Service Pack, then the Upgrade option will be disabled, thus preventing you from doing an in place upgrade you will need to
 Uninstall Service Pack 1 from your PC prior to attempting the upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows
 Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming and may take several hours to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the computer by using the current Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type Drive:\setup.exe, and then click OK. Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's
 DVD drive. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Install now.
</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the current operating system to
 Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please run Windows Update again as you will need to download and install the most current updates.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>If you do not have the Windows Vista Installation DVD, I suggest contacting your PC manufacturer or our Customer Service to order a backup disk.</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 creators update - Screen does not come back on after sleep&#47;hibernate</h2>
                    <p>After updating to&nbsp;Windows 10 creators update (1703), my laptop display does not turn on after resuming from sleep or hibernate (80% of the time). &nbsp;I can wake the display by causing the adapter to sync when an external HDMI display is plugged in. &nbsp;Obviously,
 for some reason the display is not told to wake up after sleep/hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Latitude E6530 with NVIDIA NVS 5200M display adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updated the display driver to 21.21.13.7735 (May 1, 2017) from NVIDIA</li><li>Updated BIOS to A21 (latest available today)</li><li>Updated all other drivers (NIC, storage, etc...) using Dell Driver Detect</li><li>Tried using "Project" to change active screen. &nbsp;This doesn't do anything as there aren't any other screens attached. &nbsp;If one is connected the main screen comes back on.</li><li>Disabled hibernation and only used sleep.</li></ul>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons for this issue to happen, like the computer needs to be restarted in order for the changes to take effect or it could also be the power settings. In order for us to efficiently assist you with your concern regarding the issue of
 waking up from sleep/hibernation, we just have a few questions for you:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Aside from the Creators Update, were there any changes made to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>If you have change the power plan settings, have you tried restarting the computer?</li><li>Have you tried running the power troubleshooter?</li></ol>

<p>I have the same problem: Windows 10, Medion desktop PC and Medion monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power Options exactly the same before and after Creator update: </p>

</p><p>Until Creator update moving the mouse brought both PC out of sleep and turned on the monitor.</p>
<p>Since Creator update moving the mouse brings PC out of sleep, turns on the monitor - but with a blank screen!</p>

<p>I'm not going to call this solved yet. But I disabled Fast Startup, and the problem has not come back after going to sleep 4 times now. &nbsp;I'll keep it like this for a few days and re-enable it again to see if the issue comes back again.</p>

            @EzDee36 - my problem has disappeared!?! After turning fast startup off the problem went away (as reported), after turning fast startup back on it still hasn't reappeared so I have to assume it is no longer a problem. It was 100% immediately after creator
 update, switched fast startup off/on - never seen it since. Very peculiar, but now I don't see the problem I will forget about it and withdraw from this thread.

                    Has anybody managed to get an HP LaserJet 4000 to work from a Windows 8 PC over a network when printer sharing? I managed this all right with the printer working in PCL6 mode but not in PostScript mode. If so, how? Thanks.<br />

            <p>Rajith, thanks for your response and your help, but the problem in getting my HP LaserJet 4000 to print correctly from Windows 8 on a mixed network of PCs running on every version of Windows from XP up to 8 was not one of finding and/or obtaining the correct
 drivers, as I did that over a year ago. Having installed the correct drivers, I found that it would print in PCL6 mode from Windows 8 without problems over my intranet, but that it printed near jibberish when printing in PostScript mode from the same PC. Following
 on from your reply, I have had another go at it and I found that it now prints correctly in PCL6 mode and also correctly in PostScript mode, and this is on a printer attached via the parallel port to a PC running on XP. I was only able to do this by changing
 the PostScript options so that it was optimised for portability as opposed to speed. This Windows 8 PC also has a second boot option by way of a cloned hard disk; on booting from the latter, the printer works correctly in PCL6 mode but I have been unable to
 replicate the same success in PostScript mode. So, to a greater extent, my problem is now resolved, and at least I know that it is possible to print as required. When I have more time and patience, I will have another go with the second boot disk, so thanks
 to all once again.</p>

    <title>tips on clearing up storage space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bloomingqui  say:</h3>
<h2>            tips on clearing up storage space</h2>
                    <p>After&nbsp;a "chat" with Microsoft support,&nbsp;I am informed that&nbsp;I do not have&nbsp;have enough space on the C:/ drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A previous responder to my previous question told me that "recently there has been a steady string of similar questions".&nbsp; He continued "The simple reality is that while 64bit Windows 10 only needs 20GB for the initial install, there is also the crapware
 the factory adds, and all of the subsequent Windows updates. So Windows itself keeps growing in size AND the bits and pieces of those updates that windows forgets to cleanup. What you are running into is planned obsolesence....&nbsp; We can give you a number of
 techniques to hopefully free up enough space to get by this time, but you can expect that this is going to be an intermittent ongoing problem depending on the size of each subsequent update in the future. Some will fit, some won't."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can give me&nbsp;advice on what to do I would really appreciate it. My notebook is only a year old, so I am very upset that it is already obsolete! Especially since it came with Windows 10 pre-installed and a year of Office.&nbsp;I only work with documents
 and do not need the Apps and I save everything ont the external D:/ drive. I have a total of 29.1 GB of storage space and do not need to save anything on the C: drive. It seems that 17.2 GB is system reserved, and then another 4.27 GB is reserved for games
 and apps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some additional&nbsp;questions: </p>
<p>1. does it matter that Windows Defender is not updated?</p>
<p>2. I know that it is not possible to use and external drive for the updates, so is there some other way of increasing the internal storage space of a notebook?</p>
<p>3. Do I really need the Windows the updates if I am only using Office and consulting my email?</p>
<p>4. If I am saving all my documents on he external drive, will my work on the notebook still be safe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>K</p>

            As for cleaning up your drive.
<br />Go to search and type disk cleanup.
<br />Let that run.
<br />If that still doesn't give you enough space you can delete some of the Windows app manually.
<br />Before you do this please backup your machine and\or create a system image.
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/how-to-create-an-image-backup-in-windows-10-and-restore-it-if-need-be.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />To get rid of some of the windows apps you will need to open Powershell as and Administrator.
<br />Go to search and type Powershell.
<br />Right click on it and select Run as Administrator.
<br />
<br />Run the following command.
<br />Get-AppxPackage &gt; c:\apps.txt
<br />This will create a apps.txt file on your C drive with all the windows apps.
<br />Easier to see this way.
<br />From this file look for any apps you don't want.
<br />For example Xbox.
<br />
<br />To delete all the Xbox apps you would run the following in Powershell.
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage *xbox* | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />Use the same command for any other app.  Just replace the *xbox*.

<br />Another thing I would suggest if you haven't already is use a cloud drive like onedrive to store your files.
<br />Then go to file explorer right click onedrive and select "Choose onefolders drive to sync" and pick which ones you want... don't select to many or this will take up space.
<br />
<br />As for Defender you want to keep that up to date because it will protect against viruses.
<br />As for Updates you can run updates from a USB drive so it doesn't take space on your machine.  You will need to make sure you keep on top of the Security and Critical updates, they also protect you.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/323166/how-to-download-updates-that-include-drivers-and-hotfixes-from-the-win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/323166...</a>
<br />
<br />And I use an external drive for all my documents.
<br />I use bitlocker to encrypt the drive in case i lose it or it's stolen.
<br /><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff404223.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff4...</a>
<br />If you do this you never have to have the files on your computer because you just work off your USB device.
<br />That will save a lot of space too.
<br />
<br />Hope this all helps.
<br />Let me know if you have any questions.

            First, check out this article how you can use an external drive to facilitate the upgrade:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update-on-a/d7cdba8b-c59b-4a23-86e2-6635a7e44489">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Ways you can free up space:
<br />
<br />1 ‚Äì OneDrive On Demand Files - <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-onedrive-on-demand-files-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-onedriv...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 running on a limited capacity device, you probably are looking for the most affordable option to recover some space. Starting with Windows 10 1709, Microsoft reintroduced OneDrive Files on Demand. This nifty functionality lets you keep all your files on OneDrive and only download the ones you need. Our recent article covers all the details how to set it up and configure it.
<br />
<br />2 ‚Äì Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is notorious for creating archived files you don‚Äôt need. Two features in Windows 10 that can help you with that are Disk Clean up and Storage Sense.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: disk cleanup then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Once Disk Cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if it‚Äôs not already. Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup completes its scan, click the button Clean up system files.
<br />
<br />This will perform another quick scan including every file that can be removed. Browse through the list then check off what you don‚Äôt need. Pretty much everything in Disk Cleanup can be safely removed. If you keep files in Recycle Bin for safe keeping, you probably should remove them.
<br />
<br />Storage Sense helps automate storage management by automatically deleting files like temporary files and content in your Recycle Bin. Starting with Windows 10 1709, you can delete files in your Downloads folder that haven‚Äôt changed in 30 days. Storage sense can also be set to run automatically when you‚Äôre low on disk space.
<br />
<br />To set it up, open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage. Click Change how we free up space.
<br />
<br />Enable and modify the settings you would like to be applied when you are running low on space.
<br />
<br />Within the Storage interface in Settings, you can get a bird‚Äôs eye view of what‚Äôs stored on your drive and what might be using up a lot of space. Under Local Drive, click your Local drive where Windows 10 is currently installed.
<br />
<br />There you will see a list of locations and the amount of space being used by each. As you can see, Temporary files are using about 7 GBs of space, installed apps and games 6 GBs, and Documents 2 GBs. If you click on one of the locations listed, you are not given many options except viewing the contents of the location and manually removing files you might no longer need.
<br />
<br />3 ‚Äì Delete Data Stored by Apps and Games
<br />
<br />Going back to apps and games a bit, sometimes data no longer in use is kept by the app. If you have exhausted all the options previously mentioned, maybe it‚Äôs time to see how much data is being stored by each app installed from the Store.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app then click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Reset which will delete all the data stored by the app.
<br />
<br />4 ‚Äì Delete Your Recovery Partition
<br />
<br />The recovery partition used to reinstall Windows 10, can eat up a significant amount of disk space. It‚Äôs used rarely, if ever, so there is no need to keep it. If that makes you nervous, you can back up your recovery partition to a USB thumb drive, which you can use to reinstall Windows 10 when you need to.
<br />
<br />To do that, open Start, type: create the recovery drive and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Connect a USB thumb drive with enough space‚Äî16 GB should do‚Äîthen click Next. At the end of the wizard, you will be asked if you would like to delete the recovery partition. Proceed to do so.
<br />
<br />5 ‚Äì Use Treesize to Find Hidden Large Files (Free)
<br />
<br />We previously reviewed Jamsoft‚Äôs TreeSize (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-u...</a>) and found it handy for finding large files not readily visible in Windows 10. The program is simple and easy to set up. Our previous article covers the details for scanning your drive and looking in the right places. Jamsoft provides a portable version of Treesize, so you can run it from a thumb drive and scan your system without using up disk space for the program itself.
<br />
<br />6 ‚Äì Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
<br />
<br />Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn‚Äôt really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
<br />
<br />Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It‚Äôs fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups. <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/partition-hard-drive-macos-time-machine-windows-10-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/partition-hard...</a>
<br />
<br />There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.
<br />
<br />Repeat this step for other folders where you keep large files.
<br />
<br />7 ‚Äì Install an SD Card for Apps.
<br />
<br />For devices with an SD card slot, Windows 10 lets you move large apps and games from the main drive. These days, you can get an SD card with as much as 256 GBs of space. This is more than perfect for a system with limited onboard space.
<br />
<br />Note: This only works with Microsoft Store apps. Classic desktop apps and those that come built into Windows 10 cannot be moved.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app or game downloaded from the Windows Store, then click Move.
<br />
<br />Click on the Select a drive to move this app to: list box, choose the drive representing your SD card then click Move.

DECRAP- DISKCLEAN- FREE UP SPACE / DISK CLEAN
If you are looking to identify what is taking up the most space, there are free tools you can download the provide a ‚Äútreeview‚Äù or ‚Äútreemap‚Äù display of your HD. Basically, they display the relative file and folder sizes graphically.  I‚Äôve used this tool in the past:  https://windirstat.net/   but there are other similar tools.
If you want to do a general cleanup you can use the built in diskclean tool. Here are a couple of articles on using the tool
http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-clean-up-system-files-with-the-windows-10-disk-cleanup-tool/ 2016 04 04 How to clean up system files with the Windows 10 Disk Cleanup tool
https://www.howtogeek.com/256594/how-to-enable-hidden-options-in-windows-disk-cleanup-tool/ 
If you want to do more ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù cleanup, including cleaning up some application specific temp files a tool like CCleaner is what I use. You can get it here:
https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download 
When you download CCleaner, make sure you get version 5.34 or later
Finally, most computers come with unwanted ‚Äúdemonstration‚Äù applications which the builder is paid to install. Technically it is called ‚Äúcrapware‚Äù (really). There are a number of free tools you can download. I have used PCDeCrapifier in the past.  This article reviews a couple of applications. Look for newer reviews too:

HOW TO USE NTFS COMPRESSION AND WHEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO
http://www.howtogeek.com/133264/how-to-use-ntfs-compression-and-when-you-might-want-to/ 
The NTFS file system used by Windows has a built-in compression feature known as NTFS compression. With a few clicks, you can compress files, making them take up less space on your hard drive. Best of all, you can still access the files normally.
Using NTFS compression involves a trade-off between CPU time and disk activity. Compression will work better in certain types of situations and with certain types of files.
You do NOT want to compress program files, EXE COM, especially ones that you use frequently. Compressing will only slow the program down, especially when starting them.
Compression does not work well on:
  -  COM EXE program file types
  -  Office 2007 and newer ‚ÄúX‚Äù and ‚ÄúM‚Äù file types. They are already compressed.
Compressions works best on large text files such as TXT and HTM.
2017 11 07- 7 WAYS TO MAXIMIZE STORAGE SPACE ON LOW CAPACITY WINDOWS 10 DEVICES
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/ 
A few years ago starting with the launch of Windows 8.1, Microsoft and industry partners launched devices that could compete with Apple‚Äôs iPad. These devices were severely limited in their storage space, including some with around 16 GBs of storage. The use case was multimedia consumption and casual usage ‚Äì web browsing, email, listening music, streaming video. You were expected to use Windows Store apps, keep your files on OneDrive and use On Demand Files to manage storage.

https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/delete-windows-old-folder/ 
&lt;snip&gt;
When you upgrade your current version of Windows to a newer version, the upgrade process will create backups of important directories from your previous version of Windows. These directories include your user profiles, Windows folder, Program Files directory, and other important locations. These backups are then stored in two folders called Windows.old and $Windows.~BT, which can be used after the upgrade to recover any data that may not have been properly migrated over to the new version of Windows.
Before deleting the backups of your old Windows folders, please make sure that you have all of your data migrated to the new version of Windows. Unless you have created a backup, these folders will be permanently deleted from your computer.

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I am so impressed by your support and totally grateful for your time!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, it has taken my alot of time to report back on my progress, partly due to a broken metatarsal bone in my left foot! But here I goes now...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, the Microsoft support had already deleted the heavy apps like Xbox and 3D printer, etc, etc, etc, at the time of last year's Windows Update. I successfully deleted "bloatware" that came pre-installed with the HP notebook (and re-did all the cleanup
 of storage space - although I had already been saving all documents to an external drive). This leaves me with 25.3 GB out of a total of 29.1 GB, and apparently I need 8 GB for the update. Therefore, I need 5.8 GB more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In among the apps and programs are a number of Windows 10 related things that make up +/- 8.5GB&nbsp;</p>
<p>- 1.64 MB for Windows 10 Update for x64 based system&nbsp; (10/02 2017)</p>
<p>- 2.11 MB for Windows 10 Update and Privacy Settings (07/07/2017)</p>
<p>- 5 MB Windows Update Assistant (18/02/2018)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my first question: can I delete these? ( I am thinking that the new Windows 10 update will include these?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then my second question: can I exclude sections of the Windows 10 Update from using my C:/ drive (you (SaraKong) already advised me that I can put the Defender onto an external drive... )</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if that is possible: question 3 is how much space do I need to aim for, for such a partial update? (if possible of course)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, question 4: There are other things that seem to repeating themselves, eg. over 60 MB is dedicated to 3 different Microsoft Visual (x64) and another (x64) and a third (x86)&nbsp; ... are all 3 of these necessary for my limited use of microsoft Office/Word
 and consulting the newspaper+email?<br />
</p>
<p>So many thanks for your help in saving my one-year-old notepad from obsoletion!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I continue with your instructions</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>K</p>

    <title>Xbox ONE ELITE gamepad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox ONE ELITE gamepad</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>I have become a problem again. For the third time I have an Elite gamepad on Xbox One, it has happened that my rubber grips have gone off.<br />I tried to claim a claim via Microsoft, but I did not find my problem there to complete the complaint. So I would like to ask you if you could send me labels for resolving the claim.</p>

<p>As I have already written, the problem has become my third time, and it seems like this problem is totally insoluble, and it is a problem with every Elite gamepad. These are rubberized grips. If they were going to stick somehow better. Or was it possible to replace the gamepad completely for another gamepad without rubber grip, I would like to. But I do not know how this problem can be solved, as the service center will send me a new gamepad that will last for half a year at most three-quarters and then the rubber grips will begin to peel away.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Please help me</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I thank you in advance for the answer</p>

<p>Please contact me for technical support by email.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these methods:  
<br />
<br />Method 1.
<br />Run the Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />  
<br />1.Download the ÔªøWindows Update Troubleshooter, and then select Open or Save in the pop-up window:
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/wudiag</a>
<br />
<br />Notes
<br />	‚Ä¢ If the pop-up doesn‚Äôt come up, you might have a pop-up blocker on. If you‚Äôre using Microsoft Edge, instructions for disabling the pop-up blocker are here. For Internet Explorer, instructions are here. If you are using a different browser or separate pop-up blocker, check the website of the browser or blocker‚Äôs manufacturer.
<br />	‚Ä¢ If you select Save, you need to go to the folder where the troubleshooter is downloaded to after the download is complete, and then double-click the latest wu.diagcab file to run the troubleshooter.
<br />	
<br />2.Select Next and follow the steps in the wizard to find and fix problems with Windows Update .
<br /> 
<br />Method 2.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent Servicing Stack Update (SSU)
<br />
<br />Determine whether you are using 32-bit or 64-bit Windows:
<br />	1. From Start, choose Settings.
<br />	2. Select System.
<br />	3. Click About.
<br />	4. Scroll down to System type.
<br />Download the version of the latest SSU (KB4456655) that matches your version of Windows from the Microsoft Update Catalog. 
<br />Restart your device and check for updates.
<br />Did this resolve the issue?
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3.
<br />
<br />Download the most recent KB
<br />
<br />	1. Go to the Update history page. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/windows-10-update-history?ocid=update_setting_client" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12387/window...</a>
<br />	2. Find the most recent update KB for the version of Windows 10 you have ‚Äì it‚Äôs usually at the top of the list ‚Äì and either write the KB number down or copy it.
<br />	3. Go to the Microsoft Update site and search for the KB number. <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Hom...</a>
<br />	4. Select the link for the download, and then choose Download. Select Save if you are prompted. 
<br />	5. When the download completes, select Open to start the update.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4.
<br />
<br />Fix Windows file corruption
<br />
<br />Important
<br />You need to run both the DISM and SFC commands shown below, not just one of them.
<br />	1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, right click the Windows button, and then select Command Prompt (Admin). If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow or Yes.
<br />	2. Type the following command, and then press Enter.
<br />	DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	3. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />	sfc /scannow
<br />	Note It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.
<br />	4. Close the command prompt, and then run Windows Update again.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Method 5.
<br />Perform an in-place upgrade
<br />
<br />Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/win...</a> and use it to perform an ‚Äúin-place upgrade‚Äù of Windows 10. We have a video that can show you how if you aren‚Äôt sure. <a href="https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/W10CleanInstall</a>

<br />Okay, click your Start Button, then just type cmd and hit Enter

<br />Type winver into Command Prompt and hit Enter, does that bring up the dialog?

<span>Hi marb0i,<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Have you made any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
Let‚Äôs follow these steps &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Step 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may boot into ‚ÄòSafe mode‚Äô and check if the issue reoccurs. It will start Windows 7 with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs
 do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span>i.
<b>Restart</b> the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Start tapping
<b>F8 </b>key.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. You will get Advanced Boot Menu option window.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Select the option ‚ÄúSafe mode‚Äù.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer:
</span></b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></a><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><br />
<b><br />
Step 2</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not persist in safe mode, you may configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue reoccurs. It will start
 Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the
 step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>

Hope the information helps.<br />

<p>Hi Aiden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to us. By any chance have you tried a different headset and does the same issue occur? If not, I suggest to try another pair of headset or phone ear buds if available to try it out and see if you still can't hear anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can't get sound to come through the headset <span>w<span><span>e suggest (if it hasn't already been done) a reset of the console
</span></span><span><span>s</span></span><span><span>ince
</span></span><span><span>the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a

 Factory Reset</span></span></span></a><span><span>(while keeping games and apps)
</span></span><span><span>Before resetting your console make sure of the following:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you own the encircled device?</li><li>Were there any instances when you connected this device in the past?<br />

<p>First of all, thanks for your kind help. </p>
<p>I decided to reinstall windows, because it was time for that anyway, thus the problem is more or less solved for me now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But maybe you would have known a solution, which may help out others who stumble across the same situation, so I'll answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am frequently updating the OS of my Android tablet, once this process failed. It was plugged in while it was failing, so this may be the moment this entry popped up, though I cannot confirm this as I was busy with the tablet and did not pay attention to
 windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plugged in the device with the firmware installed correctly, it shows up with it's model name and I can browse it normally. The strange entry is still there though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I did not make any changes to the computer at that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned before, I do not know when it started, though it may happened on the failed installation of the android OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that came to my mind now: When i clicked the ghost, it said something like "Failed to open file" an I think it mentioned .exe somewhere, though don't quote me on that.</p>

<h2>            How do I &#34;safely ignore&#34; error 15016&#63;</h2>
                    Hi Microsoft,<br />
<br />
Having upgraded to Vista SP1, I face multiple blue screen of death everyday, I visited several forums looking for answers (for example, see:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://www.help2go.com/forum/computer-help/102817-bsod-multiple-times-day.html#post427586</span> ). What motivates me to post a question here is that I just had 5 blue screens in a row when I was watching HD clips in
 YouTube in the past hour.<br />
<br />
I went into the Event Viewer and check if there is any new* error that surprises me. No! it is always the Event ID: 15016 that kills my computer. With a little help from the forum, I realize that "Microsoft Technet" actually said I "can safely IGNORE this error."
 An error that bugs me with BSoD almost everyday can be safely ignored? Hello? (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc727677.aspx)<br />
<br />
Please, give me a hand.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Philip <br />
<br />
P.S. In the past 7 days, according to the actual figure in my Event Viewer, I had a total of 36 fatal errors that lead to BSoD.

<p><span>Hello P.Chan,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Answers Forum.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I understand your frustration with what was stated in the Technet article that you provided the link for above.<span>&nbsp;
</span>While the 15016 error code can be safely ignored if it is associated with multiple errors or BSoG‚Äôs as you have indicated then obviously it would be better to get to the root cause of the problem rather than just ‚Äúignoring‚Äù it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You indicate that you have had 36 fatal errors in the last 7 days.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Were all of these errors related to watching HD content on YouTube?<span>&nbsp;
</span>When did the errors begin?<span>&nbsp; </span>Have you ever been able to watch HD content on YouTube without getting these errors and BSoG‚Äôs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With the info that you have provided so far I can only make general suggestions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The most obvious place to start, since this is related to video performance is to recommend that you determine what video card/chip set is in your computer, then go to the manufacturers website and download the most current drivers and install them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this corrects the problem great!<span>&nbsp; </span>If not, please include the answers to my questions and as much detail as possible about what you were running when the BSoG‚Äôs occur in your reply.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will greatly assist us with helping you troubleshoot this problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I hope this information is helpful.<span>&nbsp; </span>Also, since this post seems to be related to Sound and Media rather that Install, Upgrade, and Activate I am going to move it to the correct Forum.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Thanks,</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.Chan, the general theme I'm drawing here is that there may be system file corruption, as well as driver corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some steps that I would like for you to take involving this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These are general steps but will provide results and analysis that will assist in hitting the actual cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>I 'd like for you to make a good backup of all of your computer onto external media.</span>
</li><li><span>Then please run the System File Checker tool to verify if there is any corruption.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>
<br />
, and then type </span><span style="font-weight: bold">cmd</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start Search</span><span> box.
</span></li><li>
<span>Right-click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">cmd</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span><span> list, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run as administrator</span><span>.
<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Continue</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">sfc /scannow</span>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>If there is corruption that it cannot fix, please follow these steps to analyze the log then report that information into our forum;<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>If no errors were found through that process, please uninstall and then reinstall your drivers to your USB devices, your Video Card.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Remember to download the latest version of the Vista revision of these drivers from the manufacturers website, then follow these steps to uninstall and then use the files to reinstall the drivers.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>, and then type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">cmd</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start Search</span><span> box.
</span></li><li>
<span>Right-click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">cmd</span><span> in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span><span> list, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run as administrator</span><span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Continue</span><span>
</span></li><li>
<span>At the command prompt, the following commands (press ENTER after each):
</span></li><li>
</span></li><li>
</span></li><li>
<span>When in Device Manager, click </span>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Show hidden devices</span><span>
</span></li><li>
</span><span style="font-style: italic">double-click</span><span> the name of the device (Find any names that you would notice come up for your storage devices
 when they are being recognized).</span><span style="font-style: italic">
</span></li><li>
<span>Click the Driver tab, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Uninstall</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>If there is a </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Delete the driver software for this device</span><span> box, check it (make
 sure you have internet connectivity so that you may reacquire these drivers). Read and Confirm Notification, click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Exit </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Device Manager</span><span>, and restart your computer.
</span></li><li>
<span>When you renter your desktop plug in your USB device/then video and check if it is now being recognized, if so:
</span></li><li>
<span>You will be prompted with Found New Hardware. Select
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Locate and install driver software</span><span>. Confirm permissions. Windows will now search for your hardware driver and reinstall it.
</span></li><li>
<span>Test the devices again</span> </li></ol>
</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Let's start with those steps to try to help find if within these parameters the error was resolved.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The next step would be to reinstall the CODECS for Vista on the Media player or what player you are using to play the media files through.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may find this by searching online for the Codecs for Vista.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Remember downloading third party programs cannot be guaranteed to leave your system stable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you download these programs, please do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
You may find some codecs through searching <a href="http://www.wmplugins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.wmplugins.com</a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Keep us up to date as to the progress of this issue.</p>

    <title>Windows Update Standalone Installer is taking FOREVER to search for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erichoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Standalone Installer is taking FOREVER to search for updates on my computer</h2>
                    Okay, so here is the deal. We wiped the computer clean and installed the OS fresh. The OS is Windows 7 SP1.&nbsp; This is the first time trying to install updates. For two days the Update client was "searching for updates". We got tired of that and we researched
 for alternative things. One was to install a specific update to the Windows Update client. After many hours of waiting for the Standalone Installer to "search for installed updates" which should have taken mere seconds because it being a fresh OS there were
 no updates to find.<br />
<br />
I am now pissed off. I am pissed that this BS is taking so long and that Microsoft has not found it in their expertise to install miniscule updates (50mb or less) onto our computers. We have no problems with the Internet connection, logging 50mbps routinely,
 and as I stated, there are no updates to get in the way of searching the system quickly and there are no programs installed either. This is frustrating to say the least.<br />
<br />
Crap like this sends me over the edge to Linux land. I don't think Linux is a good competitor in this arena (yet) but I am serioiusly considering going in that direction.

    <title>Cannot Enable My Wireless Network Adapter in Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Enable My Wireless Network Adapter in Vista</h2>
                    
<p>I replaced a broken network PCI adapter with a new USB Belkin Wireless Adapter.&nbsp; I installed everything, restarted, and now my computer cannot find any networks.&nbsp; I opened Network Connections and tried to repair.&nbsp; When I "Reset the Wireless Network Adapter"
 it says a problem still exists. Under that it says "Belkin 54g Wireless USB Network Adapter" is experiencing driver or hardware related issues.&nbsp; I have already updated the driver to the latest driver.&nbsp; When I go into Network Connections and right click on
 the Wireless Connection for Belkin 54g, I try to enable with no luck.&nbsp; I also try to Enable in the Device Manager with no luck.</p>
<p>I've come to the conclusion there is some conflict causing the wireless network adapter to not "turn on" or Enable.&nbsp; What's the deal?</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Brent in Texas,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>√ò<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What is the status of the Wireless network adapter in the device manager, do you see any yellow exclamations or bangs?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error code indicates that the drivers are not installed for your Wireless Network Adapter.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should try to uninstall and reinstall the drivers for your Wireless network adapter instead of updating the drivers. Make sure that you remove
 the previous version of Driver and install the latest version. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "devmgmt.msc" and press Enter.<br />
2. Expand "Network Adapters, double-click on the entry of the wireless network device.<br />
3. Click the tab "Driver", click "Uninstall".<br />
4. Click Start. In the Start Search box type "appwiz.cpl" and press Enter. <br />
5. Remove the entries related to the wireless network adapter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then reinstall the driver with your driver CD. After installing, re-create the connection.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively, you can try to uninstall the driver from the Device Manager, then go to the computer or the device Manufactures website download the
 latest driver for your Network Adapter and install it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can refer the article that will give you all the steps to troubleshoot Network connectivity problems:

    <title>Blue screen &#40;0xc000021a fatal error&#41; on boot after Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oboreruhito  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen &#40;0xc000021a fatal error&#41; on boot after Windows Update - Win7 Pro 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: I've noticed that this is in the Windows Vista Forums. I selected Windows 7 when I submitted this.
<strong>This question is regarding Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.</strong> I have previously installed Windows Vista Business 64-bit on this machine and have not encountered blue screens on updates.</p>
<p>On a clean Windows 7 Pro 64-bit install - not upgrade - on my Toshiba L305D-S5934 (AMD Turion X2 RM-70, 3GB RAM), everything works fine. All hardware is recognized and functions without additional drivers. Shutting down, sleeping and rebooting all work fine.</p>
<p>If I set Windows Update to automatically install updates, the computer enters a BSOD loop upon reboot. Safe Mode doesn't boot, and Startup Repair and reverting to earlier System Restore points do not resolve the problem.</p>
<p>After a new fresh install, I disabled Windows Update, hid all updates, and tried installing them one at a time and rebooting after each.</p>
<p>After installing the first update (KB974571), I rebooted and received the same blue screen.</p>
<p>Blue screen message:<br />
STOP: c000021a {fatal system error}<br />
The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000001, 0x00100448).<br />
The system has been shut down.</p>
<p>Event Viewer message for all critical errors:<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0xc000021a (0xfffff8a005bfe9c0, 0x0000000000000000, 0xffffffffc0000001, 0x0000000000100448). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP.</p>
<p>All bugcheck numbers are consistent except for the second (0xfffff8a005bfe9c0), which changes with each crash report.</p>
<p>Safe Mode would not boot. I booted into System Repair and used System Restore to go back to a Restore point before the update, and all was well again.</p>
<p>I went back into Windows Update and applied each of the 11 important updates one at a time, rebooting after each, whether Windows Update required it or not. (KB973525, KB974455, KB974571, KB975467, KB973874, KB974332, KB974431, KB890830, KB915597).</p>
<p>Seven Microsoft Windows security and stability updates, including the malicious software removal tool, resulted in blue screens or silent crashes, and the only way to recover from them was to enter System Repair and perform a System Restore to an earlier
 point. The only updates that did not result in either a blue screen or a silent crash during boot were KB973874 (IE8 Compatibility View List update) and KB915597 (Windows Defender Definition update), and the two driver updates marked as Important (Atheros
 AR5007EG Wireless Network Adapter, ATI Radeon 3100 Graphics).<br />
<br />
Installing third-party drivers did not improve or degrade the situation. Running Windows Update and installing any of those seven security or stability updates after installing Toshiba-issued Windows 7 driver updates did not resolve the Windows Update blue
 screens. Restoring to the System Restore point created after the driver updates resolved the blue screen issues.<br />
<br />
The system is otherwise stable for all purposes. I've not experienced any blue screens or stability issues unless I attempt to apply Microsoft Windows stability or security updates.</p>

<h2>            When I boot my computer up, i get a blank white screen</h2>
                    &nbsp;i get the regular "starting windows" splash screen, and then the "enter password" screen. after i enter my password, it takes me to a white screen with nothing but one single instance of "my documents" open. In order to get anything else to work i have
 to "ctrl+alt+del" then "open task manager -&gt; run -&gt; explorer". at this point windows boots the desktop and everything else. how can i get "explorer" to boot automatically as it usualy does

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows 7 Forum!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps as below and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to perform a SFC scan in normal mode and check for the issue:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>[The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft
 versions.]</span></p>
<p><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -</span></p>
