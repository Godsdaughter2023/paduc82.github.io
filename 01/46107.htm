            Hi Gig518, <br />
<br />
I think the firewall is blocking the ping operation. Disabling firewall should work, but it may lead to some security risks.<br />
<br />
So, the simple solution is to just <strong>allow ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) requests through the firewall.</strong>
<br />
<br />
Here are the two methods of allowing ICMP requests through the firewall using command line and GUI.<br />
<br />
<strong>Allow ICMP Echo Request (ping) From the Command Line</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Start; in the start search type cmd. In the programs list, right click on cmd and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; run as administrator.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now execute the following command<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>netsh firewall set icmpsetting 8 enable</strong> <br />
<br />
If you want to disable it, netsh firewall set icmpsetting 8 disable<br />
<br />
<strong>Allow ICMP Echo Request (ping) With the GUI</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type in firewall into the start menu search box, and you want to choose “Windows Firewall with Advanced Security”.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then click on Inbound Rules on the left-hand pane:<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And find the following rule in the list:<strong> Networking – Echo Request (ICMPv4-In)</strong>
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the rule, and choose “<strong>Enable Rule</strong> ” from the menu, which should immediately enable ping.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want more control over the rule, you can choose Properties from the menu, and choose which interfaces or profiles this rule applies to.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<p>Transferring data is easy. Programs can't be transferred - they must be reinstalled. And your programs should be supported on Windows 10, which likely means you'll need to update your programs to their newest versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to find out with 100% confidence whether your programs are supported is to visit the developers' websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To transfer your data, <em>copy</em> the files to an external USB hard drive, then
<em>move</em> the files to your new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Easy Transfer was discontinued long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use unsupported software on Windows 10, and it might work very well. Or it might work&nbsp;<em>sort of</em> or it might not work at all. Without developer support, there are no guarantees and no official solutions if your programs don't work, so you're
 on your own.</p>

<h3> runourhie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera&#47;webcam app on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I want to take videos using the camera app on Windows 10, I can't capture videos without being far away from my laptop as I could do with Windows 8.1. There's no delay timer for video capture, like the one used for photo capture. Also, I would have
 to press &amp; hold the camera button, it starts recording instantly. When I click Video button it instantly records without delay timer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I capture videos now on Windows 10 if I want to be far away from my laptop when recording? Where's the delay start-up timer for the camera app in Windows 10?</p>

            Hi Amy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's annoying that the Fresh Start doesn't have the USB drivers that are always provided in the Installation Media.  If you can get the installation media to run from within Windows to do a Repair Install it would load them.  But without keyboard or mouse one can't even access the on-screen keyboard! 
<br />
<br />So I'd boot the media to do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install you follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />This is a bit of extra work but in return you get the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the steps, tips, tools and tricks in the tutorial which is a better install than any amount of money could ever buy. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            I find it the best and most reliable to make a bootable copy of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />- Download ISO file.
<br />- Make bootable copy using Rufus on a USB thumb drive or DVD
<br />- Boot from it then wipe the drive.

<p>
</p><p>I cloned drive C: to the blank ssd in dvd port.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now downloading and installing Wkn10 upgrade to win7 on the new ssd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I have Win10 up and running,plan is to reinstall the msata ssd with Win 7 with view to being able to dual boot Win 7 &amp; 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I need to do in order for a menu to appear offering a choice of which OS to boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When updates to either system require a restart, will they automatically restart the original OS?</p>

            <p>You can not use the same Windows 7 product key to get the free upgrade to Windows 10 and then re-install Windows 7 using that same key to Dual Boot as the key was the basis of the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to purchase another copy of Windows 7.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The menu automatically offers a choice of which OS you want to load if you follow the steps in the Wiki article listed below.&nbsp; If you simple reconnect the original Windows SSD then you will need to chose which OS to load using the BIOS options.</p>

            <p>Seeing that only one version of windows can be used at any time when they are installed on the same machine, it is hard to see why the Win 7 licence would need to be replaced. Are you sure about that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If what you say is correct, the Win 10 upgrade is NOT free. It requires us to forfeit a license that we paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest, I see no point in moving to Win 10. It does nothing better than Win 7, and does some things worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dual booting idea was just so as to learn more about Win 10 while still using Win 7 for everyday use. If that cant be done, I guess Win 10 will have to go into the trash can :(</p>

            <p>You need to purchase an additional copy of Windows 10, not Windows 7, since the system is already licensed for Windows 7, you are restoring it, but keeping the free upgrade separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: buy Windows 10:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/categoryID.70036700?=en_US_Store_UH_software_Win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Buy Windows 10 Home/Pro</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: enter the product key and activate it:</p>
<p>Click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security
</strong>&gt;<strong> Activation</strong> &gt; <strong>Change the product key</strong> then enter the new product key then click
<strong>Next </strong>to Activate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3: I would advise downloading EasyBCD so you can add a boot entry for either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The premise of the free upgrade is to replace the qualifying product from which it is derived. You can't dual boot with it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to evaluate Windows 10, you can always download the Windows 10 Enterprise trial or continue with the installation you have in a non-activated mode.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I still don't see why two Windows licenses are needed on one machine, but there you go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second older laptop with Win 7 home and have upgraded that to Win 10. Just for when I have time on my hands and I want to check 10 out further.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for my main day to day use, I will stay with Win 7 until time comes for a new computer. By then perhaps there will be better options. I look after some other neighbourhood computers too and we have decided to stay on Win 7 on all of them.

</p><blockquote>
<p>I've removed quicken due to hacking/whatever it's called and am installing money plus sunset.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems like a pretty bad idea.&nbsp; Money Plus Sunset is 7 years old and unsupported.&nbsp; What "hacking" was involved?&nbsp; Quicken can occasionally&nbsp; be a PITA, but it is still a currently-supported and maintained program.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Tried to open but the microsoft password doesn't work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tried to open what?&nbsp; And what Microsoft password are you referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as "will there be a problem" in getting your data from a Quicken backup file into Money, my guess is that yes, there will be.&nbsp; Most of the websites that show up when searching on this topic deal with importing Money files into Quicken, rather than
 the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As near as I can tell, Money Plus Sunset can import OFX and QIF files downloaded from financial institutions.&nbsp; Quicken's QFX files are very close to OFX files, and there are various websites that give suggestions for how to import QFX files into Money Plus
 Sunset (for example, <a href="https://microsoftmoneyoffline.wordpress.com/reg-file-to-import-quicken-qfx-files-automatically-into-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://microsoftmoneyoffline.wordpress.com/reg-file-to-import-quicken-qfx-files-automatically-into-money/</a>).&nbsp; Also see
<a href="https://thefinancebuff.com/import-quicken-downloads-to-microsoft-money-on-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://thefinancebuff.com/import-quicken-downloads-to-microsoft-money-on-windows-10.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that backup files, at least from recent versions of Quicken, are QDF files and not QFX files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still had Quicken installed, you could export your data as a QIF file and Money Plus Sunset
<em>might </em>be able to import that (I don't know), but since you've already removed Quicken, that's no longer an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you ask for help in the following forum (you can log in with the same Microsoft ID/password that you used to log in here):&nbsp;

            Sorry I ended up with two posts on this same issue in my eagerness to contradict Microsoft's rating of this drive as Win 7(64) compatible. &nbsp;I am suspecting the issue may be hardware related. &nbsp;There are numerous suggestions out there that the use of a powered
 usb hub may give the drive the little boost it needs to be seen. &nbsp;There are countless people not being able to use this large 1tb drive with notebooks. &nbsp;I have not had trouble with this same drive being recognized by any of my desktops or with my HTPC. I would
 like to purchase and try a powered hub but can't find one where the ac power adapter has a large current capacity for each of the usb ports on the hub. BTW, if I didn't mention, the laptop is an acer aspire 7551G sold by futureshop. &nbsp;I would still be with
 Western Digital support but you know about the widespread outsourcing of tech support and the resultant effect on quality. They won't or can't (who knows) identify the issues.

<h2>            Chrome pages not fully loading</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 8.1, a few web pages will only partially load, then I get rotating circle (working signal) with windows at the bottom of the page saying either "waiting on www.google-analytics.com" or "waiting on ajax.goggleapis.com". &nbsp;The page does not time

<p>Thanks for the quick response. &nbsp;Expert was Edward, Chrome Community Specialist. &nbsp;I forgot to mention that I uninstalled, reinstalled Chrome before I ever contacted him. I agree with him that this is a software issue with Windows because Chrome worked well
 for 2 days in safe mode. I did not press him on what the web sites are that the pages are "waiting on". &nbsp;Wish I would have done that.</p>
<p>I was hoping Microsoft might have some useful suggestions, but this is not the end of the world. I have determined a work around, but would rather have the issue resolved.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface book 2 15&#34; Fan switching off during games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arcblue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book 2 15&#34; Fan switching off during games</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I've been having a very strange problem with my surface book 2 since using the latest windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, whenever I open a graphics intensive program or game, the fan immediately lowers it's intensity, almost to silent. Naturally, this then causes problems after playing for longer than 5 minutes, causing the game to lag and the graphics card
 to shut off temporarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I minimise the game or program, however, the fan immediately comes back to life. Opening opening the game again the fan returns to it's low powered quiet state. It seems as though whenever I ask the 1060 to do anything, it turns the fan off, but
 then while resting it turns on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some digging online to see if anyone else has had this problem but I can't seem to find anything.</p>

<p>Hi ArcBlue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that some applications that have an independent GPU preference override the system settings. You may need to check with the application provider if that is the case. To look into this deeper, are you able to see the
<strong>NVIDIA Control Panel</strong> on your device? If you have it on your Surface Book 2,&nbsp;you would have to specify the GPU preference in the NVIDIA Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues after applying the preferred GPU settings for your apps, then I would suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the NVIDIA GeForce GPU adapter in Device Manager. To do that, right-click on
<strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Device Manager </strong>&gt; <strong>Display adapters
</strong>&gt; right-click on your <strong>NVIDIA GeForce</strong> adapter &gt; <strong>
Uninstall device</strong>. Restart your Surface Book 2 for the adapter to be reinstalled automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step is to run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. This will help verify that you have the recommended drivers and firmware for your device. It will also check for underlying software issues that can affect the system's performance. For more information
 and to download the tool, go to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></strong>. Afterwards, perform a forced shutdown
 by pressing the power button for 20 seconds. The device should be able to reload the drivers properly upon bootup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you need more help, please update the post so I can get back to you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to give a few more details, I have been using the N-vidia control panel to default all programs to using the 1060 rather than the integrated graphics, pretty much since I got the device. I have also set certain applications to run on high performance
 regardless of the global settings, which are still having the same problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already updated all of my drivers and windows updates.</p>
<p>As of today, I have also uninstalled the GPU adaptor in device manager, and after restarting nothing had changed. I also used the Software Diagnostic Toolkit, which did not change the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of other things that might be relevant, I recently had used the Software Diagnostic Toolkit before this problem started occurring to solve a different problem (the problem being that the Nvidia graphics card wasn't being detected; the diagnostic
 tool seemed to fix this). Another point I should mention is that not long after using the&nbsp;Software Diagnostic Toolkit the windows Photo app stopped working altogether (I haven't found a fix for this, but this is much less of a concern than the graphics card
 not working).</p>

<p>Heya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having the same problem. I tried to play a few games (different games requiring low and high performances), but the laptop CPU clock drops down to around 0.5 Ghz. Lowering the settings to even the lowest end doesn't change anything.
<p>One thing i noticed is that when I am in game, the fans hardly work (or very silent) and when the lagging starts and I go to desktop, then the fans turn on running fast and loud..Going back to the game seems to fix the problem for 20-30 seconds
 before which I get the problem again. So I am assuming that it is a heating problem where the laptop is not able to turn on adequate cooling process unless I exit the game.</p>
<p>This is a £ 3000 device and its breaking my heart that I cant play any game even with such high end components!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help someone&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Yeah I realised after playing around with the problem for a while that it was the CPU that was having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately&nbsp; troubleshooting became far too long winded and tedious, so I did end up using Windows reset. So far (touch wood) it has been working with no problems.&nbsp; I actually even installed the latest windows update and it's still fine, so I'm not sure
 if it was just an installation&nbsp; problem with the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry that I can't offer a solution other than reset your&nbsp; pc but the MS guys don't seem to actually care about getting a £3000 pc working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made some additional discoveries that might help you atleast temporarily.<br />
</p>
<p>Games seem to start and perform well when the surface book is not plugged in and is running on battery power. The fans seem to be running perfect then. On the other hand, if the power is connected when the games start, the fans does not work and
 the laptop stalls in a few minutes. The only way to fix it then is to unplug it and Alt-Tab in and out of game till the fans work in game and then plug in the laptop at which the fans keep working and everything goes smooth. This is a very inconvenient and
 roundabout way to make things work and is increasingly frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope there is a better solution for this.</p>
<p>

<p>Yesterday i was using my surface with the intel power gadget on to see how he would react with light work as browsing on the internet etc. It seemed to work fine and the cpu never locked down on low freq.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today i'm going to try to play a game first with the surface plugged in to see if it makes any difference and if it starts to going "mad" i will try your method!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad thing is that MS doesnt even bother to help us with a patch or something like that.</p>

<p>Hey!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes there is, so i talked with the MS support and the guy was very nice and told me to try installing a fresh copy of windows directly downloaded from the MS website. Since i was suspecting that this problem was a software issue i downloaded a older version
 fo windows and after that i ran AIDA64 to see if the problem was still there, for my surprise the Surface was running smoothly.
</p>
<p>Temps between 70-75 and the clock goes up to 3.20GHz and starts going down to 2.50GHz and it reaches it's base clock @2.1GHz and stays there. And how do i know this is normal? I went to youtube and watched a video form Linus tech tips about the surface and
 he run a AIDA64 too and we had the same result.</p>
<p>After that i installed the latest updates from windows and run the test again, the result was the same but sometimes (like 1:100) the clock goes to 0.4GHz as before stays there for like 20 sec and goes normal again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i think this is a software issue and the best thing to do is wait for another update</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what about you? how's your surface running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you.</p>

    <title>How to make the Windows 10 taskbar black again. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make the Windows 10 taskbar black again.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, nice move Microsoft, getting rid of the black taskbar. I want to know how to change it back, even if I have to install a program to do so. After the April 2018 Creators Update or something, it got rid of my beautiful black taskbar, now it's just an ugly
 gray. I need this fixed, it really bothers me, as it takes away from the more 'modern' feel of Windows 10. But I'm not kidding about installing a third party software, if that's what it takes, just don't give me a virus, I mean seriously. People have tried
 to do that to me, but now I'm ranting, just tell me how to get my black taskbar back. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi DylanNewcomb.</p>
<p>Here's what I did to make the taskbar black: open Windows Settings, go to the "Personalization" section, click "Colors" in the left panel, then, under the "More Options" section at the bottom of the page, turn off "Transparency Effects".&nbsp; Then, under "Show
 accent color on the following surfaces", uncheck the "Start, taskbar, and action center" box.&nbsp; When I did this, I got a black taskbar.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 does not recognise NavMan GPS when connected by USB Cable</h2>
                    <p>I have a Navman EZY200 GPS connected to my Acer Aspire E1-531 PC, running Windows 10, and the GPS recognises that it is connected to my PC, but the PC does not recognise that the GPS is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sad thing is that this used to work when I was running Windows 8.1!!!<br />

Can anybody please tell me what I have to do to get this to work?</p>

            <p>No! The problem has not been resolved, but the manufacturers asked for the device to be sent back to them for tests to see if it is the device, their downloaded software, or Windows 10 which is the problem. More news when I have more news.</p>

    <title>Vista not recognizing WD External Elements 640GB HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eryk13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista not recognizing WD External Elements 640GB HD</h2>
                    Hello - <br />
<br />
Recently I decided to format my system to clean it up of all the junk it built up over the past year.&nbsp; On the previous build, I had Vista SP1.&nbsp; I purchased the WD Elements 640 GB external hard drive to back up my important data (all of my videos/pictures of
 my 1 year old baby girl since she was born).&nbsp; Vista recognized the hard drive fine, and was able to back up this data.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to yesterday, after I had finished installing a fresh copy of Vista, including the SP1 upgrade, it no longer recognizes the hard drive - no popups or anything.&nbsp; Not showing anywhere in Disk Management - just my four other internal hard drives and
 HP Printer with flash drives.&nbsp; I've plugged it up to my work laptop (which uses XP) and it works fine, the data is all there as well (whew).&nbsp; But right now I have no realistic way to get it off the hard drive, as that laptop has no CD burning ability on it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on how I can procede to get this fixed?&nbsp; Any help is appreciated - thanks!

            hello !!<br />
<br />
thank you for using microsoft answers forum..<br />
<br />
you can try to check device manager( click on start menu and type device manager) click on it and check if it shows your harddrive there.. !!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
if you got the USB cable with two ends USB that you can plug into the computer.. plug them both and then check if your harddrive works..
<br />
<br />
you can also try to download the USB drivers for your motherboard from the manufacturers website, if you got a software with your harddrive try installing it..
<br />
<br />
the best bet is that your USB drivers are missing for some reason..

            Hello Eryk13,<br />
<br />
Your drive might just need to be assign a letter in the disk management.<br />
<ol>
<li>Log on as Administrator or as a member of the Administrators group. </li><li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>
Control Panel</strong>, and then click <strong>Performance and Maintenance</strong>.
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If you do not see <strong>Performance and Maintenance</strong>, go to step 3.
<strong>Performance and Maintenance</strong> appears in <strong>
Control Panel</strong> only if you use Category view. If you use Classic view, <strong>
Performance and Maintenance</strong> does not appear. </li><li>Click <strong>Administrative Tools</strong>, double-click <strong>
Computer Management</strong>, and then click <strong>Disk Management</strong> in the left pane.
</li><li>Right-click the drive, the partition, the logical drive, or the volume that you want to assign a drive letter to, and then click
<strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Add</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Assign the following drive letter</strong> if it is not already selected, and then either accept the default drive letter or click the drive letter that you want to use.
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
The drive letter is assigned to the drive, to the partition, or to the volume that you specified, and then that drive letter appears in the appropriate drive, partition, or volume in the Disk Management tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />

            Shantanu - <br />
<br />
Where am I looking for the device to show in device manager?&nbsp; Should it be listed as "mass storage" in there?&nbsp; If so, its not showing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've wondered about the USB drivers myself, but every other USB device I have works fine, and I have several.&nbsp; I've downloaded something called the Intel INF file from my manufacturer's website, but I didn't see anything on the website specific to USB drivers.&nbsp;
 I have an ASUS P5B Deluxe board.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The C -<br />
<br />
The external hard drive won't show in Disk Management.&nbsp; I have four internal hard drives now, and each of them shows fine (D, E, F, and G).&nbsp; The DVD-R drive also shows up in there, and my printer since it has the memory card storage drive on it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you both for your help - let me know if you have any other thoughts.&nbsp;

            Eryk13,<br />
So this drive is not showing up in either device manager, disk manager, or computer?&nbsp; Have you tried plugging it into a different USB port?&nbsp; You said all your other USB devices work fine, try plugging it into a known good USB port - where another working device
 is now.&nbsp; Try plugging it in when it is powered off, then turn it on once it is plugged into the USB port and see if Windows sees new hardware.&nbsp; Have you checked to see if WD has new software / drivers available for download?&nbsp; Let us know if any of this helps
 or if we can be of further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I'm positive its not showing up in Disk Manager, My Computer, but I'm uncertain about device manager.&nbsp; If its supposed to be categorized as a mass storage device in there, then I'm 100% sure its not showing up.&nbsp; If there's another place in Device Manager I
 should be looking, let me know.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I've tried plugging it into a port that currently works, and powering it up only when its in a "known" working port, but it didn't help.<br />
<br />
WD's web site seems to suggest that there are no drivers for this HD.&nbsp; I've downloaded the programs that can be used for the drive, but there are no drivers included in them.&nbsp;

<h2>            wireless adapter does not detect my network</h2>
                    
<p>I recently just installed window 7 ultimate. and for some reason, my wireless adapter cant dectect MY wireless network. it can detect the ones around my neighborhood but not the one in my house. I currently have other laptops/desktops connected to the router.
 so i believe it isn't the router. the adapter is able to detect other wireless networks. what should i do!</p>
<p>oh i have a D-link WDA 1320 wireless adapter</p>
<p>&nbsp;32 bit</p>
<p>i have tried to connect it manually, but now it just shows limited connectivity and unidentified network, no network access.</p>

<p><span>Hi Noobyzpower,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 antivirus program is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 type of network security do you use, for e.g. WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) etc?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>You could try checking for the router firewall
 and see if there are any settings that are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>T</span><span>ry
 updating the drivers from the device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;Start
 and type&nbsp;“devmgmt.msc” (without quotes), and then press Enter</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find
 and expand Network Adapters from the list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click the wireless adapter and click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Driver tab and click Update driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Log on to the D-Link website and update the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Temporarily disable the computer`s anti-virus
 program and check if the issue persists. If no issue occurs, then you might need to firewall settings within the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Ensure to enable your anti-virus back on the computer
 after you finish these steps. It is not recommended to disable these settings on the computer. This is just to troubleshoot the issue.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I believe Vista Antimalware is one of the varieties of this :<br />
<br />
Try Safe Mode with networking - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
The top two methods allow the scanners to run and/or get AV.exe out of the way or removal.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
CTRL SHIFT ESC&nbsp; - Task Manager&nbsp; OR Right Click the TaskBar - Task Manager <br />
<br />
Processes tab - End Process on AV.EXE and then proceed with the Uninstall Guide.<br />
<br />
If needed use Start - Computer&nbsp; OR&nbsp; Windows Explorer&nbsp; to navigate to <br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware\mbam.exe&nbsp; or where ever it is installed at - if
<br />
needed Right Click the Malwarebytes - Properties - Shortcut tab -&nbsp;target line to see where it
<br />
is installed.<br />
<br />
Right Click on it and Rename it to ZZMbam.COM (or anything different than it is now) and
<br />
then double click on it and run it that way. You can rename it back later. Do similar with
<br />
other programs as needed. Use this method for others as needed - DO NOT ASSUME any
<br />
one program removes it all or that there&nbsp;is not other malware involved. Use the .COM<br />
extension as this malware prevents .EXE from running.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Another method is to use these :<br />
<br />
Use Process Explorer to "Suspend" not Stop&nbsp;the Processes <br />
<br />
Then use AutoRuns to&nbsp;remove the malware startup items.<br />
<br />
Now use UnLocker to delete the files in the malware.<br />
<br />
You may have to do this one file at a time.<br />
<br />

<br />
AV.exe<br />
<br />
==============================================<br />
<br />
<strong>There are MANY varieties of these with many names however all can be removed
<br />
with the same methods :<br />
</strong><br />
Vista Antispyware 2010, XP Internet Security 2010, Antivirus Vista 2010, and Win 7 Antispyware
<br />
2010 are rogue antivirus,&nbsp;scams to force you to pay for them&nbsp;while&nbsp;they have no benefits at all.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to remove ALL varities of this malware - please read the Removal Instructions
<br />
carefully.<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-antivirus-vista-2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-antivirus-vista-2010</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>RENAME these as needed to allow them to run : (use another name with the .COM
<br />
