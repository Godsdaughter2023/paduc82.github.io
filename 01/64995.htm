<h2>            How does a System Restore Point continue to grow in size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have updated to Win 10 from Win 7...This was a 'clean' install.&nbsp; Everything seems to work well except System Restore.&nbsp; The machine will delete all restore points if it is Shutdown.....not usually with just a restart.&nbsp; I've posted three or four different
 questions to Microsoft on this with no joy on repairing.&nbsp; I've also read everything on this site that I could find that relates, whether Windows 10, 7, or 8.</p>
<p>As part of this I have been watching the restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed them 'growing' in size.&nbsp; I have asked Microsoft about this but have never received an answer to the question...of how can a system snap shot, continue to grow.&nbsp; It kind of defeats the purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title says, the restore point created yesterday started at 24mb......six hours later this same restore point was listed as 237mb......early this morning the same restore point was showing that it was using 430mb.&nbsp; The same restore point two hours
 later is&nbsp;2.1gb.&nbsp; After putting the machine in sleep mode I went and played 9holes of golf.&nbsp; The machine is now reporting a restore point size of 10.9gb.&nbsp; That is a rather large increase of a 27mb file.&nbsp; I also used TreeSize to see that this is all in the System
 Volume folder and pretty much one file.&nbsp; BTW, there is only one restore point showing in the system protection screen....and it is highly unlikely it would be good for anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc/scannow.&nbsp; Adjusted Vss size to 20% of drive....it is a 2tb drive.&nbsp; The same machine was running Win 7 and never had any problems with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main problem is after shutdown all restore points are deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the above information, does anyone have any ideas.</p>
<p>Microsoft will answer a question/ticket one time and will not come back after you tell them that their recommendations did not work.&nbsp; Also, they don't really seem to read the question/problem at all.&nbsp; Apparently they have a manual that gives stock answers
 and they are confined to those answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone in this community have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>It doesn't seem like any help is forthcoming on this....a typical response from Microsoft help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I was able to fix the problem in Windows 10....I did a clean install with Windows 7 and the problem has disappeared....and so has Windows 10, so no problem at all.</p>

<h2>            &#39;File Explorer&#39; hangs up and won&#39;t open</h2>
                    Have a new laptop with Win 10. I have set everything up, and ported over files from the old computer (using a Seagate backup drive). I notice that all of a sudden File Manager will not open. The window pops up, but then it says 'working on it...' and the
 little blue circle just sits there and nothing loads. In fact, sometimes it hangs up so bad that I need to restart the computer. Any thoughts?

<h2>            &#34;This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exits and that you can access it...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install an update for a POS system on my computer (Mac laptop on which I run Windows 10 in Parallels) Every time I try to install the update I get this message. "This installation package could not be opened. Verify that the package exits and
 that you can access it, or contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package." And that's it. No option to override, nothing. I've tried to look up solutions but nothing I've come across has worked so far.

<p>Hi Myke,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by software conflicts. For us to provide a solution suited to your concern, we'd like to know the answers to the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Where did you get or buy the installer?</li><li>Have you tried using the installer in other devices and see if it works?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response. </p>

<p>The installer is just the standard Windows Installer that came on Windows 10. As for the POS update install it's been used on at least 5 other computers in my office successfully. It seems like the problem is with my system it seems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for troubleshooting I've kind of been all over after looking at similar responses from previous versions of Windows. Gone through System to start Windows Installer since it's on Manual. Used Command to to try and get it reset. And a few other things I've
 forgot. </p>

<p>Thank you for the answer. We'd like to know if&nbsp; you're using a CD or USB device, as it needs to be a bootable device in order to install Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following steps below to troubleshoot the error and see if it will work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the setup file to make sure if the installer is for a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows device.</li><li>Right-click on the .exe file, select Properties and check if it is blocked. If it is, click the Unblock option.</li><li>Disable your antivirus software and see if it helps with the installation.</li><li>After doing all these, try if you can now install Windows.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your update about the result. </p>

<p>Okay Anne, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to help but it seems you are not understanding the situation. I'm not trying to install Windows. I'm trying to install a program onto my Windows computer. I have Windows 10 already and Windows Installer (the default installer program)
 is not allowing me to install a much needed upgrade to a program I already have installed. But since that program is linked to others in our network I cannot access it unless this update is installed. All the other computers have been upgraded with no issues.
 I on the other hand cannot even access or open the update due to the message I referenced in the the title of this post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know which board to post on due to the specific nature of this issue. So I went with the one that included the word "Install". Hopefully that makes more sense.

            <p>Thanks for the input, but still having the same problems. I do have a 64-bit system so I tried all sorts of combinations of settings in the compatibility window. All with no success. I have sent several emails to Broderbund with no response. What great customer

            Run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit version of <span>Windows</span>
<div>
<div>
<p>When you run a 32-bit program on a 64-bit version of <span>
Windows 7</span>, the program runs in a 32-bit <span>emulation mode</span>, using software to simulate a 32-bit version of
<span>Windows 7</span>. This allows 32-bit programs to run smoothly on the 64-bit operating system. But note that programs designed for 64-bit computing might run faster on a 64-bit version of
<span>Windows 7</span>.</p>
<p>Certain older programs that won't work on a 64-bit version of <span>
Windows 7</span> might run fine in <span>Windows XP</span> Mode in
<span>Windows 7</span>. As the name suggests, this feature allows programs designed for
<span>Windows XP</span> to run smoothly in <span>
Windows 7</span>. (Some types of programs might not run in <span>
Windows XP</span> Mode, such as security software and programs with intensive graphics.) For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Install and use Windows XP Mode in Windows 7</a>.</p>
<p>You can also try changing the compatibility settings for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter. For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Make older programs run in this version of Windows</a>.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Unlike hardware drivers, even older programs designed for 32-bit versions of
<span>Windows</span> should work well with the 64-bit version of
<span>Windows 7</span>.</p>

<h2>            Windows blank screen</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;A MS support agent rolled back my computer to a previous critical update and now my brand new computer won't even boot. Blank screen. This was an attempt to "fix" the new Windows 10 bug of applications not allowing you to choose their default opening program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted every single recovery option; system restore fails, clean restting fails, resetting fails and using a USB drive fails. I can only access recovery mode or BIOS. It either shows me a blank screen (win10 usb drive) or loads up the original
 Windows recovery from the SSD, which cannot do anything. That or it blank screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had several other agents all taking remote control access over my old PC and just re-installing Windows 10 USB/iso boot managers. So now I am stuck with a blank PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited a little while when attempt to boot from the USB blank screen, and heard three error notifications. The second two were closer together if this means anything to anyone. It may be a driver issue?</p>

            Hi ConstantAbyss49
<br />
<br />Wow, they really have made a mess, that File Association bug is well known and they should not have attempted that fix . . .
<br />
<br />The only thing you can do now is to clean install Windows 10 . .. . 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers

            Hi ConstantAbyss49
<br />
<br />Try the Repair option first, if that does not succeed, then go for the Install . . .
<br />
<br />Please Note, an Install will remove all your files . . .
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

 running on your system. So it makes use of all your computer’s resources like RAM, Disk, etc. For the battery life, it will depend on the things that we do on our Surface Devices specially for gaming so definitely it will consume too much power. For us to

            Thank you for your response, sorry it's taken me a couple days to get back. The issue of the machine running hot and burning through charge is definitely related to Bluestacks, although I think my battery life is noticeably lessened now, even not running
 Bluestacks4. This machine is fairly new but has had some extremely fast discharges followed by complete recharges since I started running BS4 and now the first 50% of the battery seem to go pretty quickly. Can I check my battery status in detail?

<p>95% of all the Game covers you see nowadays have someone holding a Gun.</p>
<p>I've noticed a lot of Yankee heroes out there saving our Butts with good old USA gun culture subversively driven down our throats, Now this revelation came to me while playing&nbsp; three American stereotypes in GTA 5, It just made me realize the influence that
 American culture has on the gaming industry.</p>
<p>Thank god for games like: Minecraft and soon to be released: Project Spark... Games that bring creativity and learning into the market...</p>
<p>Please Mr / Mrs gaming industry give us smaller portions of this negative Pie imported from America..</p>

<p>The GTA franchise does disturb me a bit because it glamorizes the slimiest of the slimy. &nbsp;I don't think some parents realize how brutal and sleazy the content is when they let their kids play it. &nbsp;Most American neighborhoods are nice places for families
 to raise children. &nbsp;The stereotypes that the game portrays makes up only a pretty tiny percentage of our culture. &nbsp;RPG's allow a person to enter into a life that they would never normally dream of actually living out. &nbsp;We generally like fighting enemies in
 games. &nbsp;Guns are just a convenient weapon. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes Biz, I know :)</p>
<p>I can see why the Market is dominant in north America it makes a lot of sense, the trouble is that there isn't much competition in other areas and that's why Europe gets all of the spillage of your less redeeming qualities of a Nation.</p>

<p>I understand your second point Biz, I'm talking about the demographic, the percentage comparison, I understand the market and reasons games like this are made and that they're to some degree exaggerated, It's just the amount of games compared to anything
 else, all game creators think about is Gun and Zombies lol... Why? because you like Guns Biz, It's a pretty demeaning and populist game industry I would say.</p>

<p>The game industry caters to our natural instincts to survive and thrive. &nbsp;If herding sheep and milking cows were an exciting activity from Scotland they could fashion into a marketable game, sure. &nbsp;But having your life threatened by a zombie and then pummeling
 said zombie is much more satisfying to the general population. &nbsp;I too like games like Minecraft but even in that you are fighting enemies, just more pixelated versions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>[quote]95% of all the Game covers you see nowadays have someone holding a Gun.[/quote]</p>
<p>The last few games I've played didn't have any guns on the cover... Assassin's Creed 4, Zelda, Portal 2, Knack, Resogun (sort of, but not what you're talking about), The Show, Gravity Rush, just to name a few. Yea, there are a lot of shooters out there,
 but it's nowhere near 95% or even a majority.</p>

<p>Yeah, it's more like 60%. &nbsp;I think it's that the more gun-oriented games get more reaction/attention from people so you hear about them more often. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't think it's even near 60%. I'm sure the number seems high since shooters are one of the most popular genres so you see them in the spotlight more (like you said), but if you look at the list below it seems more like maybe 20% at the most.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Xbox_One_games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/.../Category:Xbox_One_games</a></p>
<p>Side note: I realized I was wrong and Edward is holding a gun in the AC4 cover. It's far from being a shooter though and the gun is barely significant in the game. I think I fired mine maybe a dozen times throughout the game.</p>

<p>Honestly, the easiest way to do that is to create an account for yourself and then remove hers. The username of a Windows PC account is recorded in many places, which makes it difficult to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User accounts don't have 'owners' per se. Anyone who signs in to a user account has as much right to use the account as anyone else who signs in to the same account.</p>

<h2>            My CD drive keeps disappearing&#47;reappearing&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have a CD-DVD RW on my Aspire 4520 laptop that worked until recently. I installed Windows Service Pack 2 recently and a day later my CD-DVD RW drive just disappeared from "My Computer" and device manager. I looked up solutions on the internet and none
 worked. I decided to reformat my computer and that did not solve the problem either..so I installed both Vista service packs again..updated all my drivers again..and still no fix. Recently I rebooted my computer and upon start up I noticed my CD-DVD RW drivers
 installing automatically. I thought "Wow, Vista fixed it!"...I was wrong. My drive worked for a day and then out of the blue...it disappeared again...no where to be found. I looked up stuff on the Microsoft website and found a tool that fixed the problem...and
 less then a day later...gone. Why does this keep happening...EVEN when I reformatted my computer? My cables are all properly secured by the way. Please help! Thank you.

            I really think you're going to need to replace the drive. You'll need to get it from Acer parts or look in the after-market for a replacement drive for your model laptop. Usually replacing a laptop optical drive isn't hard so this is something you can
 do yourself.<br />

            Either the optical drive is failing or the connection on the motherboard is failing. Contact Acer tech support for repair/replacement.

            Hi Mick<br />
<br />
Finally I've deleted all win32.tdss files on my windows vista and now It seems ok.<br />
<br />
But for those who have same problem as me ,I've to say not even Spybot or MalwareBytes<br />
but any freeware software cann't really help , you should ask from serious security companies<br />
I find out that there is new method of ROOTKIT attack which spybot or malware can't remove
<br />
those files they just can show you and say "problen FIXED" but it's NOT !!!<br />
<br />
I've used an ANTI-ROOTKIT software from a security company "SOPHOS" it was really update<br />
and removed all files REALLY so I'm happy now :DDD<br />
<br />
anyway Thanks Mick for your help , I hope no body get same problem it was terrrible
<br />
<br />
THANKS<br />

<h2>            Odd Problem With File In &#34;Games&#34; Folder... &#40;The story of the pointless, useless and unresponsive shortcut that has tortured me for months&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><em>(I'm using Windows 7)</em></p>
<p>Well, a while back I dragged a shortcut for a game that I had downloaded into my Games folder (The one in the start menu), because I wanted it to be easier to access. However, since I hadn't even played the game yet, I didn't realize that the "Game" was
 just a shortcut to a WEBSITE where you play it, and all I had downloaded earlier was a client for it or something (I don't quite remember, it was months ago).</p>
<p>So, I ended up with a generic web shortcut file sitting there with all my other games. I figured that I could just delete it and get it out of there, but when I right-clicked, nothing came up... It's completely unresponsive. And no matter where I look, I
 can't find where it's located other than in the games folder.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I could get rid of this? I can't do anything with the file other than select it. It doesn't even show up in a system search.&nbsp; I'm just getting sick of that annoying icon sitting there in my games folder...&nbsp;

<h2>            My Themes, My God&#33; How do you make simple&#40;&#63;&#41; changes&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've just been having a right time of it trying to make a few basic changes to a theme + it turned into one of those events when a darker, far from admirable, corner of my inner self is unwittingly accessed + at the very least some highly specialized
 language, at an above average decibel level, usually follows soon after, + it's a fairly steep rate of descent from there on in. Obviously, I take no responsibility for anything that might take place thereafter, that burden is for the real culprit, who we'll
 call, M'oft, to bear, provocation + incitement are wicked sins + this shouldn't be forgotten, not for a minute....................</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If anyone knows of the user hostility I'm on about + knows of any resource available that might shed some light on this deliverer of despair, any tips, or prescription medicines, you might feel would help to navigate this slippery road, I'd be grateful
 for your input.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>Sir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; firstly, I'd like to thank you for your time spent in reply, I'm especially grateful considering your high-ranking state in the chain of command, your concern for the rank + file is commendable + I salute you. Metaphorically speaking, I mean, I'm not
 actually standing to attention + saluting, that would be weird, I'm sure you'd agree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The 'My Themes' issue has been overcome, I'd disabled Aero, which had I been reminded of with a pop-up of some description it would have saved me from a lot of grief but the feeling of 'being on the same side' is, sadly, not how I ever feel, this being
 a case in point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The fact that when you try to change a theme it becomes a new unsaved theme caused me problems, too, but now I'm aware of this annoying fact + having spent more time than I even want to think about achieving the minor alterations I wanted to make, I'm done
 + dusted. Unnecessarily&nbsp; difficult, in my opinion, but some brief anger events + highly specialized language aside, I got there without anyone getting hurt!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once again, I thank you for your reply, I'm going to fall out, now, + leave you to your R+R, so, as you were.............</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cheers,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Query regarding the Microsoft Solitaire game play.</h2>
                    <p>Once again, I cannot solve a Klondike game. </p>
<p>In Microsoft Solitaire Collection go to Star Club and under the "Mixed Collections" find the 'Classic'. Once there go to Klondike and find the 'Expert' game in the second row.&nbsp; I have tried and tried but cannot get the required score of&nbsp;720. The max I can
 get is 710 and I have gotten as low as 690. I am very confused. Has anybody beat this one game? Can you share the solution?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Print server 2008&nbsp; print spooler keeps crashing with hpb6sy2917_x64gui.dll file error
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened on 10/2/15 and has happened again on 02/24/16. We have two printers that are dependent on this file. HP Color LaserJet 553 and HP LaserJet M604. I have over one hundred of the M604 on my network and last time this happened, it dominoed through
 the print server system.&nbsp; This also caused the print spoolers to stop on the end users. The only way I can get the end users back up is to uninstall the driver package.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue&nbsp;is affecting the Windows server 2008 and the windows 7 computers as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Trying to identify why this has happened twice and determine how to&nbsp;fixit before the rest of&nbsp;my Server 2008&nbsp; and end go down as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is in the <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

<p>
</p><p>This time around I had to remove the printers and drivers with a regedit. I also&nbsp;removed all files in the all files for 2917&nbsp; in&nbsp;the

<h2>             COM Surrogate is not responding</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>COM Surrogate Error</span></p>
<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Home Basic (32-bit) on my PC.</p>
<p>Recently I started facing a problem for which I need help. Many a times when I am browsing through pictures in Windows Photo Viewer, the program stops responding. When&nbsp;I hit Alt+Ctrl.+Del and try&nbsp;closing the program, I get the usual option of closing the
 program or waiting for it to respond. On selecting close the program, I&nbsp;am told that COM Surrogate is not responding. After this I can't even switch off or restart my PC&nbsp;and have to hard reset it which I know is not safe. I will really appreciate your help
 in this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Samarth,</p>
<p>Which third party players are installed on the computer?</p>
<p>The Help article below has complete details about codecs.</p>
<p><strong><span><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Codecs-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Codecs:
 frequently asked questions</span></a></span></strong></span></strong></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><span>COM surrogate error mostly occurs because of codecs and other COM components installed by various softwares that aren’t fully Windows 7-compatible.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue is mostly related to third party software, check and see if you can find out the culprit application.</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, put your system in clean boot state and restart the computer. See if the error shows up.</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>

<p><span>If the error doesn’t show up after restarting the computer, that indicates one of the installed third party software causing this problem. Follow
