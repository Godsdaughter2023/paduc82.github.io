            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read this link your model&nbsp;KAV60 apparently is actually AOD250</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://community.acer.com/t5/Notebooks-Netbooks/Drivers-for-Acer-Aspire-One-KAV60/td-p/101553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.acer.com/t5/Notebooks-Netbooks/Drivers-for-Acer-Aspire-One-KAV60/td-p/101553</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And when you go to Acer you will find Drivers for Windows 7 32bit Operating System; but not Windows 7 64bit (you do not say what you have).</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox One X &#34;Over Heating&#34;</h2>
                    Hi i seem to have a very strange issue of the xbox supposedly overheating. Its in a nice open space but it seems to keep crashing everytime i get to this one part of a raid on Destiny 2. I have no issues anywhere else but as soon as o get the this same
 section it automatically turns off and when i turn it back on it comes up with the over heating message even if the console hasnt been on for a couple of days and only been playing for 20 minutes...

<p>Hello Oliver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Does your console actually feel hot after it forces a shutdown? Have you attempted to try different wall outlets?</p>

            Doesnt feel warm at all. Ive changed cable and wall outlets but its the same spot every time in this raid that it turns off. Its fine on every other game i can play everything else for hours on end but i havent been on the past couple of days and only
 been on for about 30-45 minutes and it goes in this one spot. I attempted the same raid a couple of months back which it did it back then and i havent had any issues since not doing it but now wanting to go back on and finishing it it always does it...&nbsp;

            Im unsure whether or not its the console or the game causing the issue as i have only had this message pop up attempting this one part on this raid. I suppose i could uninstall the game and retry but its odd that i can play any other game hours on end
 and no issues but come back to this one part on this raid and ita the only time it has an issue...

<p>Hi Oliver,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think we should try some troubleshooting is it is just happening at that one point in the game. First, go ahead and do a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">
 turn on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help&nbsp;then&nbsp;you will need to try out a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Console info</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Make sure to select "Keep my games &amp; apps" and have&nbsp;the correct&nbsp;account login information plus your WIFI password ready if you connect wireless because&nbsp;you will need to re-add the account's that were on the Xbox&nbsp;and
 re-connect to your network during the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue continues, re-install the game and play to that same point in the game to see if it gives you the same error.</p>

            It sounds to me like it might be a game glitch. Have you searched for that particular part of the raid in Destiny 2 to see if others have experienced it and how they bypass that?&nbsp;

            I posted into a Bungie forum which i have just had a reply from someone replying "Did you get the One X at release or very soon thereafter in 2017. I know there were some early release One xs that had the thermal gpu past improperly applied, thus causing
 overheating when a lot of graphic changes are going on" which I personally haven't heard that and its been playing well up until attepting this section. Guess it would make sense but crazy that its taken this to notice an error.

            <p>DISM with windows 10 version 10.0.10586.0 keeps sending me an error message - as does sfc/scannow.</p>
<p>Basically the DISM can't find the Install.wim file in Sources because there isn't any such file there any more. It's been replaced with Install.esd that doesn't work with DISM.exe.
<strong>So Microsoft, you&nbsp;need to address this oversight please because it renders your repair tools useless.</strong></p>
<p>The problem I get is that there are issues with accessing the right click menus in explorer, or, msconfig especially after updates - the programme hangs as if stuck in a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the previous version of windows 10 running very stable. Now it's annoying and its seems evidently down to a lack of a holistic approach to improving the product update before its release.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access games downloaded from the Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>Original title: HELP ME to Access my Downloaded Apps/Games!!&nbsp; Windows(h)8 (at the moment!!!)<br />
<br />
I have downloaded games/apps on my windows8, it says eg. "Wreck it Raplph is Installed". &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to access my games, so I click on the Icon to Play it, but I am directed back to the STORE where I am informed that the game I am clicking on is "Installed".</p>
<p>I have done a lot of downloading with no Gaming Action at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted my Computer, Clicked on the WINDOWS Icon, Clicked STORE, Clicked MY ACCOUNT, gone to MY APPS then clicked on the App I want (The App notes "PURCHASED 12th June 2014" and underneath "INSTALLED"). &nbsp;I will click on the App I want and it takes
 me to The App Title and underneath it says "THIS APP IS INSTALLED ON THIS PC". There is Info about the App with Reviews &amp; Screenshots, but no Gaming Action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP ME ACCESS MY APPS / GAMES!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO???&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also getting a lot of ERRORS while downloading Apps/Games. &nbsp;I will goto STORE, click on the Game/App I want and it will start to download and then after Approx. 10-seconds, it will tell me ERROR (With 3 or 4 #'s) Unable to Download, with no excuse as
 to why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased my Laptop (Toshiba Satellite) last week and don't really know much about Windows8 or PCs in General. &nbsp;I have really only updated to PC for the Kids, so they stop using my iPhone as a Gaming Platform..</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading through the issue description it appears that the game apps&nbsp;are not correctly installed from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the complete error message that you receive when you try to download apps from Windows Store?</p>
<p>2. What troubleshooting have you followed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly, follow these methods and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there is a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, try running the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apps troubleshooter</a>. <br />
This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You can also try clearing&nbsp;the cache for the Windows Store on your PC and check the issue.</p>
<p><span>a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap
<span><strong>Search</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>b. Enter <span><strong>run</strong></span> in the search box, and then tap or click
<span><strong>Run</strong></span>.</p>
<p>c. Enter <span><strong>wsreset.exe</strong></span> in the Run command and then tap or click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
</strong>If that does not help, try to reinstall the app.</p>
<div>
<p>To reinstall an app, follow these steps:<br />
a. On the Start screen, swipe down on or right-click the app you want to uninstall, tap or click
<span><strong>Uninstall</strong></span>, and then tap or click <span>
<strong>Uninstall</strong></span>.<br />
b. Tap or click <span>Store</span> to open the Windows Store.<br />
Tap or click <span><strong>Account</strong></span>, and then tap or click
<span><strong>My apps</strong></span>.<br />
c. Swipe down on or right-click the app you want to install, and then tap or click
<span><strong>Install</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Let us know if it helps. If the issue persists, we will be happy to help.</p>

<h2>            Skype Number Not on Profile</h2>
                    I purchased a 12-month subscription for a Skype phone number. I go to my account settings and the skype number isn't there. I had a friend try calling the number, it rings once or twice, and then the calls ends. I had skype open when they called and I
 got no notification or a call or a ring like usual. Shouldn't the skype phone number be automatically added to my account? I have no idea how to get the skype number that I am paying for to work. I know I signed up with the right skype account info. Please
 help.

            Hi George<br /><br /> I agree it  doesn't make sense to me to install the OneDrive app just so you can uninstall it<br /><br /> OneDrive is now integrated into Windows 10 and into Microsoft office as a default save location, so chances are if you've never logged into the OneDrive application of Windows you have had things unintentionally save to OneDrive through your Microsoft Office applications<br /><br /> Really the best thing to do is to just be certain when you save office files that you choose save as and make sure that they're saving to a location on your local hard drive

 boot back to normal mode once in safe mode. After booting up my computer to safe mode, when i tried to log in with my 4 digit pin it said it was incorrect. I know im putting the right password but i dont know why it doesnt let me log in now. Please help me

</p><p><span>As you are facing this issue after installing Windows updates, let us try to perform a system restore and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>System restore</strong>: This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you
<span>create a restore point manually</span>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the section “<strong>Use installation media to restore or reset your PC”
</strong>in the following article to perform a system restore:</span></p>

<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead

<p>So after following these steps, it says it has restored my files to yesterday when the update was installed when my laptop was working just fine. However, I'm still stuck at the log-in page. My password is not working and I know it was the right pin. Something
 else that I noticed is that it seems as though my laptop is no longer connecting to the internet even though it's been plugged into an Ethernet cable this whole time. Maybe my laptop is still in safe mode? My pin only stopped working after I rebooted to put
 it in safe mode.</p>

<h2>            Acer Aspire sw3-016</h2>
                    <p>Can someone help? &nbsp;I am the sole user of my Acer notebook. &nbsp;Yesterday I found a way (by searching) to amend my C:\username on my Acer. (I only did this, wish I hadn't now, because I had mispelt my username when I initially set up the device). &nbsp;After doing
 the change, I restarted my device &amp; now I cannot get logged in the a PIN or a microsoft password. I just eventually get a message stating that there is a software problem etc.. &nbsp;I am writing this from another laptop. &nbsp;I need some technical help. Any suggestions
 welcome. I am currently in Germany. &nbsp;ELaine&nbsp;</p>

            Hello. Thank you. I do have 2 microsoft accounts, but that has not been an issue. I can loin to either. The exact message I have after trying to get logged on to my Acer Aspire device is in a small box (it is in german) headed .. ACCStd.exe - Fehler in
 Anwendung (error in application).&nbsp; The words following that is .. Die Ausnahme "Unbekannter Softwarefehler" (0xe0434352) ist in der Anwendung an der Stelle 0x00007FFAB4209E08 aufgetreten.&nbsp; In ENGLISH this translates as nn The exception "unknown error software
 error" (0xe etc...) has occurred in the application in the location (0x00007 etc...).&nbsp; &nbsp;Just in front of this main wording there is a red circle with a white cross.&nbsp; I am no techie person, but having read a bit about the problem, it seems that I should not
 have changed the system's C:\Username unless there was another standard user of the device, as I am the 'adminstrator' &amp; sole user of the device. Hope this helps you to help me. Regards, Elaine

<p>Thank you for responding to our query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that you have received has something to do with the your laptop computer's proprietary software. The issue can be resolved by uninstalling and re-installing the software. Since you are unable to log in to your computer to uninstall and
 re-install programs, try resetting your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset your computer, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the <strong>Login screen</strong>, hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key on your keyboard (Don't let go of the key.).</li><li>Click on the <strong>Power </strong>icon and a <strong>contextual menu </strong>
should appear.</li><li>Click <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>The <strong>Advance</strong> <strong>startup</strong> options will appear.</li><li>Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Reset this PC</strong> &gt; <strong>Keep</strong><strong> my files</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you still can't log in after resetting your computer and keeping your files, try to reset your computer again and selecting the
<strong>Remove everything</strong> option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important</strong>: Selecting the <strong>Remove everything</strong> option when resetting your computer will remove your personal files, apps and drivers installed, and changes that you made to the settings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after resetting your computer.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Hi &amp; thank you. With your great help I managed to get to restart &amp; &nbsp;all was looking good. However, the 'Acer Portal' came up &amp; down the side where it refers to my device, I clicked this &amp; that brought me to 'Connected Devices' ..
 it showed 2 devices, the 2 names of which I HAD already previously written down on my original set-up guide. &nbsp;The names of these (.. may mean nothing to you of course) are ED-ACER , &amp; the other was called.. DESKTOP-EE54H75. &nbsp;In Acer Portal, I kept the ED-ACER,
 as it was a name I would have set up myself &amp; removed the other name. &nbsp;I cannot recall where the other name (DESKTOP-EE54H75) came from, but can ONE device have 2 names ??</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it must have something to do with this same device (OR, perhaps a smaller Samsung tablet I owned until it broke down recently &amp; I disposed of it, but that was not a 'desktop').</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;Also, ..I already have 2 microsoft accounts, using 2 different email addresses... &nbsp;I have just logged into both, but only the ED-ACER name shows as the device in both microsoft accounts. The different thing showing is when I click
 on 'my devices', on just 1 of the logins it says the device has not been seen since 30th Sept!?!&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">What is amiss &nbsp;too is that although I seem to have internet access, our Wifi router number does not show under the small WLAN icon on the bottom bar, although it shows when I view Network &amp; Internet under settings!</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Also, I tried to change the language under settings &amp; it does nothing. &nbsp;There should be a 'Cortana' help search bar, but that is not there either. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp; I am wondering whether I should try resetting again though now?? &nbsp;I thank you for your advise again.</p>

            Hi again, I will add that I think that the DESKTOP-EE54H75 name that I removed is the one I should have kept, as it must be the device. &nbsp;If I go through the reset again, would this fix it? Thanks again, Elaine

<p>You are most welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what I have observed, the Windows 10 will automatically rename your device to a generic name like DESKTOP-XXXXXXX after performing a reset. In your case, the system automatically renamed your computer to DESKTOP-EE54H75.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to reset your device again. All you need to do is rename your device by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch the <strong>Control Panel</strong> and go to <strong>System and Security</strong> &gt;
<strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Change settings</strong> under the <strong>Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings</strong>.</li><li>Just change the computer name and click on the <strong>OK</strong> button.</li></ol>

 but I want to remove that account anyway (confusing having 2). There remains the same issues though,butI have noe noticed a small shield icon, which when hovering over with the mouse, states .. 'Software not installed'.&nbsp; Can you advise what I can do to correct
 this?&nbsp; Elaine, with regards&nbsp;</p>

Hi again. Just discovered that the shield I refer to is McAfee internet security, so this maynot be an issue.&nbsp; BUT, there is a problem with the windows emblem icon in the taskbar at bottom of screen.&nbsp; This icon I believe, is a way of opening the 'Store' which
 has the windows apps, because (like the separate 'Store' icon) it is giving me the following message .. "Try again. The page could not be loaded. Refresh page. Error code is 0x8000FFFF, if needed" .&nbsp; Do I need to rename my device also under my 2nd microsoft
 account.&nbsp; Can you still help? With thanks, Elaine</p>

<p>Try resetting the Store by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Window</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys on your keyboard to launch the
<strong>Run command</strong> window.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>WSReset</strong><strong>.exe</strong> in the filed of the said window.</li><li>Wait for the process to complete and try to access the Store again after.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about renaming you computer under the second account, you do not have to do that.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much, Gerry,&nbsp;for your quick reply, but I decided to skip trying to figure out what was going on.&nbsp; I too agree that it isn't possible to have 3.99 TB of stuff for Disk Cleanup to remove from a very small solid state drive,&nbsp;so I am sure glad I took
 a screen grab to save for posterity. &nbsp;I am inserting that screen grab below.&nbsp; I did find several similar posts on other boards and all were exactly the same as my issue and all within the last few days&nbsp;- but no one had any reasonable explanation.&nbsp; So I decided
 to bite the bullet and let Disk Cleanup do its thing.&nbsp; Well, it's gone and everything seems to be working just fine.&nbsp; (That was also the case before I let Disk Cleanup delete that mysterious 3.99 TB of impossible files.&nbsp;)&nbsp; Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First I ran the new iteration of what used to be ScanDisk.&nbsp; It came out clean so then I followed your directions and ran the System File Checker (which I had never heard of).&nbsp; I am pasting a screen grab of the results so it appears that is OK too.&nbsp; I have
 no explanation so I asked a few people at work&nbsp;who "should know" these things and they too were stumped - or not interested.&nbsp; As I said before, the laptop is working fine and today it survived being attached to two different projectors with no hiccups.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For a few short minutes I thought it might be&nbsp;heralding the arrival of the Anniversary Update.&nbsp; But I haven't seen any signs of&nbsp;that update&nbsp;on any of the computers I use and I have been on the lookout for it.&nbsp; Even that wouldn't make any sense so I guess
 I'm going to have to give up and never understand what happened.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks again.&nbsp; The screen grab is below.&nbsp; Mary</p>

</p><p>Those results are fine. It is better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What follows should get you the Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Are you using an ethernet cable or wireless to connect your computer to the router? An ethernet cable connection is faster and more reliable for large downloads. An ethernet cable is
 an inexpensive purchase.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Connect to a mains electricity supply if your computer is a laptop.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Disable your anti-virus and firewall whilst upgrading.</span></span></p>

            <p>I work in a computer repair shop and have had several examples of this issue viz; Microsoft disk clean reporting that there is around 4TB of stuff that can be cleaned up off of HDDs and SSDs that are up to 1TB in size. I suspect that there is a slight problem
 with the disk clean app, that causes it to misreport the size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time this occurred I completed disk clean and then ran it again. Second time it reported a minimal amount of files for removal, so I am happy that the clean-up still worked properly. When this issue pops up now and again, I have a little laugh
 and just continue with the disk clean.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Given that KB 3194798 (1607 security patch update of 10/11) also included this fix:<br />
<br />
Improved support for the Disk Cleanup tool to free up space by removing older Windows Updates after they are superseded by newer updates.<br />

I'm guessing that the gui is reporting incorrect info.&nbsp; Let me see if I can get some attention of a product group somewhere.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>From reports here there are not multiple machines malfunctioning but there have been problems arising recently regarding the use of Disk CleanUp that I have not seen in earlier versions of Windows. When looking at this issue you have to bear
 in mind that the limitations of Disk CleanUp have been obvious for a number of years with the result that many users have switched to third party cleaners, notably cCleaner. Disk CleanUp does, however, tackle some tasks that cCleaner does not take on. There
 is therefore a case for using both utilities.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>An emerging problem with Disk CleanUp is that you need to shut down all open windows (put another way stop multi-tasking) to get the best results. It also seems to have a problem with File History, although the problem could be with File History
 not retaining settings.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The point you make about KB3194798 is not recorded as a key change:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 10 update history</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A Windows Update CleanUp function was added to Disk CleanUp in October 2013. Can you provide further details of the latest change?</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Backup fails, error 0x81000019, shadow copy could not be created</h2>
                    <p>This may or may not be a duplicate question as I've seen a number of similar posts, but I've read everything I've found, didn't get a solution, and came across something potentially interesting.&nbsp; One response that I found (through
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/error-0x81000019-windows-10-desktop/78f10c72-08fb-474b-aa65-2163b99dffe1">
this page</a> and then <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/25deba76-464b-4a9d-9b32-a283bb6a88ce/windows-7-rc-backup-fails-errorcode-0x81000019?forum=w7itproperf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>) led to this passage:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually this error come when 100 MB hidden System Reserved partition created by Windows 7 does not have enough space to store a shadow copy. Please check the freespace on this volume. Follow the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Start -&gt; Computer -&gt; Right click -&gt; Manage 2. Select Storage -&gt; Disk management. 3. Verify that you have a System Reserved partition of 100 MB size. 4. If yes, right click on this volume and select Properties. 5. View used and
 free space.</p>
<p>Windows backup requires around 40 MB of free space on this partition to backup successfully. So if the free space is less than 40 GB, backup does not get enough free space. As a workaround try the following solution:
</p>
<p>&lt;<em>Remainder Omitted&gt;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the reason I find this interesting (this is all back story, and not completely relevant; skip ahead if you like): I'm running Windows on a Macbook Pro.&nbsp; A while back, I spent weeks researching and asking people about how to get Mac OS and Windows
 7 to play together with a shared data drive on a single internal hard drive without third-party tools.&nbsp; Ultimately I deduced that the two problems I had were that Apple's BootCamp was authoritarian in taking over HDD configuration and that Windows 7 could
 not deal with more than 4 partitions on a drive.&nbsp; I was trying to install OS X, create Windows and data partitions, and install Windows.&nbsp; The problem was that OS X creates 3 partitions on its own: a boot partition, an OS partition, and a recovery partition.&nbsp;
 Add my Data partition, and I had 4 before even installing Windows.&nbsp; So I started over.&nbsp; I installed OS X and manipulated the file system so that there was no recovery partition, shrunk the OS X partition, created a Windows System Reserved partition (which
 is hidden), created an NTFS partition, used the rest as my data partition, and installed Windows without BootCamp (which will not run with file system customizations).&nbsp; After Windows installed (without a hitch), then I installed the BootCamp drivers (necessary
 for the keyboard and trackpad to work), and everything worked.&nbsp; After the PC was set up, I set up an external USB HDD to mirror the internal: Mac-OS backup, Windows backup, and Data.&nbsp; Everything has worked great since, until now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I "upgraded" to Windows 10 a few weeks ago, and after I felt the OS was configured to my liking, I connected my backup drive and tried to back up (I had no backups since before I went from 7 to 10, and I can't trust a new OS to work properly).&nbsp; This is where
 I circle back to my problem.&nbsp; I already explained how I got to that process above.&nbsp; I tried to follow it and found that there is no longer a Windows System Reserved partition on my hard drive.&nbsp; Considering I had to specifically create that partition when I
 installed Windows 7, I have to imagine that the Windows 10 installer chose to remove it, because what I do have (that I certainly didn't allocate) is an unallocated space of 129 MB on my hard drive.&nbsp; My other partitions are a 200 MB GPT Protective partition,
 a 119.21 GB HFS Primary partition (OS X), a 692.78 exFAT Shared Data partition, and a 119.21 GB NTFS Windows C: partition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that the unallocated space used to be my Windows system reserved partition and that that is the cause of my failed backups, how do I fix it?&nbsp; If for some reason that is not the cause of my problem, I'm definitely accepting other suggestions, as
 this particular error doesn't seem to have a solid solution yet.</p>

            <p>The problem specifies Windows 10, and the "Clean Boot" page linked in Method 2 includes no mention of a procedure for Windows 10. &nbsp;I hope it isn't the same process as for Windows 8. &nbsp;If Microsoft really intends for customers to go through a procedure like
 this to correct errors, perhaps they need to examine other solutions that they might provide the customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently having a problem exactly along these same lines, but the Properties menu choice on my 100MB partition is disabled -- as is every other choice except for Help. &nbsp;That Help menu choice, by the way, isn't help about the volume or the disk, is
 takes the user to a web page on the Disk Management console in general. &nbsp;As an application developer, I think this is a misleading use of a Help menu item. &nbsp;The user is led to believe that help is context sensitive like the rest of the right-click menu. &nbsp;Unfortunately,
 this is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any suggestions regarding how to examine any of the properties of my newly created "Healthy" 100MB partition so that I can diagnose these issues?</p>

            Ensure the service "Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider" is not disabled. Set it to manual if it is.

<h2>            Upgraded to Windows 7 and get &#34;DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER&#34;.</h2>

                    <span>I upgraded to Windows 7 64-bit Premium Home Upgrade this weekend and now, whenever I reboot the system, I get the message
</span>"<span>DISK BOOT FAILURE, INSERT SYSTEM DISK AND PRESS ENTER". If I leave the Windows 7 installation disk in the DVD drive, but do not boot from it, the system then boots from the hard drive and operates
 without any problems. I have four (4) Seagate SATA hard drives in the system. Two (2) of the drives are in a RAID configuration and two (2) of the drives are stand-alone. I installed Windows 7 to one of the stand-alone devices. I checked my BIOS and could
 not find an option for booting from a specific hard drive, just the hard drive in general. The motherboard is an ASUS P5Ne-SLI and I am using the onboard SATA controllers and the Nvidia RAID that was included with the system. If anyone has seen this before
 or may have an idea on how to fix it, I would appreciate it. I did see some of the other posts about similar problems, but the one's that I seen seemed to be about the hard drives not being recognized by Windows 7. That's not the case here, it just seems like
 something didn't install properly so the machine can't boot without the install DVD being inserted.<br />

<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the

<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Restart the PC afterwards, and try the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command again.<br />
<br />
If still not, then try using <strong>OPTION ONE</strong> above to run the <strong>

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.

<p><span>Hi SingerPaul,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to your computer after which this issue has started to occur?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in Clean Boot state and try running the program again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you
 may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in
 Windows 7:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure
 to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in </span><strong><span>Step 7</span></strong><span>
 in the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not help, contact the program manufacturer for further assistance on this issue.</span></p>

            All I can offer is that some viruses prevent you from using task managaer, this makes it more dificult to remove them, however you can download "Process explorer" which is another Task Manager, which isnt usualy targeted by viruses. wether its a virus
 or not it still is usefull as its got lots more bells and whistles.

            Hi<br />
<br />
To have a<span style="font-weight: bold"> real server</span> with active directory you have to purchase and install a real Server OS (like Windows 2008).<br />
<br />
All Win 7 version are <span style="font-weight: bold">Client OS'</span> and do not install Active directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can use a Win 7 computer as a "server" to the extend that it is connected to other computers on a peer-to-peer network and you make a personal decision to put your files on this computer, and Share through the Network.<br />
