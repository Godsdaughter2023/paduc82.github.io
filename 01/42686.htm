<h2>            Windows 10 disabled usb ports etc.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 two weeks ago .&nbsp; The install went well I thought.&nbsp; I even got a pop up message
</p>
<p>from MS and asked how I like Windows 10.</p>
<p>I replied back that I could not make a judgment since it was on running for 3 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to wake the machine up the next morning it kept saying that it had to go into repair mode.</p>
<p>I let go into repair made several times.&nbsp; It never repaired it's self.</p>
<p>The next time I put it into safe mode. Nothing happened after that.</p>
<p>The system froze up.&nbsp; It showed a black screen only on my monitor.</p>
<p>After a week of frustration I discovered that none of the 6 usb ports had power to them. (maybe all the ports)</p>
<p>When I was running 8.1 all the ports worked as I used a wireless mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>Any ideas</p>

<p>Before I upgraded I checked both the manufacturer and windows as to the compatibility of my computer. the both said it was ok to up grade. My computer is a HP Envy h8 1435 pc. It is only acouple years old and was preinstalled with Windows 8 and had all the
 updates.</p>

<p>Hi, have you had any problems since? &nbsp;A friend of mine keeps loosing the USB ports and has to go into device manager and remove the USB ports and then restart the computer to get them back again &nbsp;This only last for a few days and they are gone again. &nbsp;I
 suspect that each time Windows 10 does an automatic update they get wiped out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What a pity Microsoft released Windows 10 before it was working properly as there are so many people being plagued with problems after upgrading. &nbsp;I was fortunate enough to be able to rewind to Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>No wonder they gave it away for free.</p>

    <title>Your use of Xbox 1 - What are your likes&#47;dislikes with it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smileskybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your use of Xbox 1 - What are your likes&#47;dislikes with it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HAPPY NEW YEAR. Can I still say that? Yes, cause it's still the 1st month of 2017! I've had Xbox 1 since day 1, even went to the midnight launch too. I have the Xbox 1 Day 1 Edition console (500GB) with Kinect.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to get people's opinions on what they like, and not like so much, with their experience with Xbox 1. I'll just list some of mine quickly:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. We have smilies now in the Do you have something to share? I love this! K it came on a while back, but it's the summer holidays for NZ and Australia so have been mostly outdoors. I love the activity feed section where people just tend to spam there with hey whats up etc etc, or their achievements, screenshots, video clips. It's a much cleaner UI to PS4 (sorry for the comparison), but Xbox Live is the best online service for consoles, ever made! Xbox 1 makes it effortless and super easy and quick to capture screenshots and video clips and share them on a nice UI design in the activity feed.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. I like the Windows 10 like UI on Xbox 1. Too many people hated the slow non friendly Windows 8 like UI which Xbox 1 launched with. And there IS a difference between Windows 8 and 10 -like.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. I like how my wireless controller automatically turns off after so many minutes of usage. I also like how you can choose your choice of AA batteries to power it. I use energizer rechargeable batteries and have an energizer battery charger that can charge 2 AA/AAA batteries in 16 minutes and 4 AA/AAA batteries in 34 minutes. PS4's controller has a non replaceable lithium ion battery which lithium ion batteries are unreliable and don't last very long. And you have to rip your controller or open up the controller and have to source a replacement battery. Ayeee......</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. I like having voice messaging, change the dash background, Kinect Sports Rivals, Final Fantasy XV, Minecraft, Forza Horizon 3, Rocket League, and looking forward to Halo Wars 2 next month.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Xbox Play Anywhere. Play some of your favourite games on your high end PC with Windows 10 to get better visual fidelity. Smartglass where you can check messages activity feed and friends on your phone. Even my Xbox online status (which is only viewable by my friends) shows when I play The Sims 4 and Cities Skylines. I might get it to show when I play Planet Coaster too. I like it how Xbox 360 has Party Chat yet PS3 doesn't. This is why I chose Xbox. It's run by a very good company and the online features are just better. Though I do notice that on PS4 Pro (which I only got for Final Fantasy XV and World of Final Fantasy), that YouTube opens and functions more perfectly.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. I love Xbox 1's Kinect. Scan QR codes which is so much funner and quicker than using a keyboard, touchscreen on your phone, or manually entering the 25 digit code accurately (I can't believe people still do this...). Play games like Kinect Sports Rivals Wake/Water Racing, Zoo Tycoon. Use it to talk to friends and randoms, use it to securely sign in onto Xbox, can even differentiate between twins. It can see ghosts in "what else can Kinect see?" where it shows you how Kinect sees your environment. Can use it for voice commands (not always accurate) and voice messaging. I Don't have Kinect for Xbox 360.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Things I'm kinda if-fy about. This list is short.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. The Philips disc drive on original Xbox 1 models (not talking about girl models, hardware models): Half the time it makes a crunch sound (doesn't damage my discs, they're clean) and doesn't recognize the game. And due to Microsoft wanting to keep costs down, it's a cheap Philips drive. Xbox 1 original models aren't designed to be placed upright (only flat) due to choice of disc drive, not just because the console may look fat.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I like the Xbox 1 S but I see no reason to pay NZ$499 the recommended retail price Microsoft lists it in my country (rip off, right? no wonder so many NZ'rs are moving to Australia). As to Xbox Scorpio, but it's gonna cost quite a bit more than the recommended retail price Sony has put of PS4 Pro which in NZ is set at NZ$638. I think I'll stick with my Xbox 1 day 1 Edition console (500GB) with Kinect, until it malfunctions or when they release an Xbox Scorpio Slim model. Xbox has Xbox Play Anywhere which I love. I love how Microsoft is broadening their Xbox content to more devices (smartglass for phones, Windows 10 is a fairly likeable OS, though it's not a perfect OS with the annoying updates which sometimes when they release, mess up programs on your computer. I use sometimes including Hauppauge Capture, etc). As for Clubs thing the introduced a few weeks ago, I can't say I know what I'm doing with it half the time lol but might give it a go. I already run a clan. Even The Sims 4 has clubs. So now I'll l

            <p>I only use it to do voice commands. "Xbox, record that or Xbox take a screenshot". That's it. I enter codes on my phone and it takes like 2 seconds.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Other that I do not use the Kinect for anything else. I do not use my console for anything other than games.

            <p>Smileskybird, I'm not surprised that your topic hasn't gained traction, because it comes off as one of those 'smarter-than-thou' user surveys commissioned by Microsoft. While I agree with pretty much everything you've said, I don't *need* to be told why Xbox One&nbsp;is more fully featured than the competition. It just does what it *needs* to do and that's&nbsp;all she wrote! 🙂 </p>

            <p>Heeey-oooh! First things first. I just love gaming on my Xbox One. It's the one thing I love to do. I love the controller, I love the achievements, I love navigating to achievements while I'm gaming, I&nbsp;like the 'scloosive games; I just love the whole she-bang! I mostly&nbsp;love Fallout 4 and Skyrim Remastered, heh ha, but occasionally I play other stuff! I watch movies on my X1, I stream stuff off my&nbsp;laptop and tablet onto it, and my X1 is on more often than it is off.</p><p>Gaming, and everything around gaming, I love. That aside though, I&nbsp;like that they've added a good&nbsp;library of emoties for messaging, and I think the addition of clubs was a pretty cool idea, and it was implemented well. I think if done properly clubs could have the ability to purge the <em>abysmal</em> trending section - that I rarely visit, but when I do I just get, <em>urgh!</em> - purge it&nbsp;of so-called "supporters." And rebalance this whole broken social system on X1.</p><p>If club admins and own
seen a marked rise in the number of so-called "supporters". The somewhat depressing trending section is basically their domain, and most of their 
Activity Feeds are comprised of shared content - that is, other gamers' 
content! Content that was attractive, varied, and frequent enough to 
gather followers -- <em>for the "supporters"!</em></p>
<p>Many of these "supporters"
 share more than they play video games, many certainly share more content than
 they themselves generate, and their favourite game is gaming this add 
for add, follow for follow, with all the benefits of tapping into the 
endless stream of other gamers' content [for more followers for 
themselves] - broken system.</p>
<p>A supporter can reap hundreds to 
thousands of likes and lots of comment engagement on another gamers' 
screenshot for example, while that gamer's screenshot, in their own 
feed, sits with its unremarkable one or two, four or five likes, if that, and few comments.</p>
<p>Many
 of these uploaders, I imagine, never realise their content has had the 
attention it had, because all of the feedback is on the sharer's feed, 
as if it is the sharer's content, and the original uploader just sees a 
rise in views - if they're looking.</p>
<p>Shared content that is liked 
and engaged with, should reward the original uploader with that 
attention and engagement from the community - not the sharer or 
"supporters". Shared content that accumulates likes, and comments, 
should accumulate them on the original uploader's original content, in 
their Feed, not the "supporter's" feed.</p>
<p>If the good folks at Xbox fixed this nonsensical rewarding of "supporters" "supporting" I imagine the number of 
"supporters" would drop dramatically. As the likes and engagement on content would go where it's
 supposed to go, and reward who it is supposed to reward. Not the "supporter" who I think wouldn't be so keen to "support" content that didn't get them more likes, comments, and followers, but the original uploader - the gosh darn content creator! The gamer who played the game, and took the screenshot, or game capture, the gamer who had that moment and in-game experience... and then uploaded it.</p>
<p>I think shared 
content should also have a Follow icon next to the like, comment, and 
share options. While the likes and comments go to the uploader's feed, and not the "supporters" little feed of theft. Because as it is, masses of shared content by so-called "supporters"
 does not translate to more followers for the uploader, but rather more 
followers for the "supporter" who is basically a <em>curator</em>, a channel of 
interesting content that they've plucked from the community...</p>
<p>... like some non-YouTuber mirroring content and taking views and engagement from an original content creator, an actual, real YouTuber. Xbox's 'share' button is basically what a 'mirror content' button would be on YouTube. But YouTube doesn't have one of those, because it wants to reward original creators, not people taking and uploading their content elsewhere. lol</p><p>I love everything about my X1. But this social media, gamed system, shared content, reward the bad spammer "supporters" with good exposure, while the good gamers gaming have their content nicked and get no credit for it. [Beyond y'know, a "supporter" saying how good it is as they "support" it all the way into reaping more followers and likes for themselves.]  I hate that stuff. I largely ignore it.</p><p>But I'd like to like a person's content that appears in trending with a thousand likes, without having to go to the shared "supported"thousand-likes feed post, then go to the original uploader's profile from there, and add one like to th

<p>Hey Argontheos, TL;DR? Actually, I *did* read your wall of text and can sympathize because it's maddening when you've got a LOT to say and&nbsp;want to share this passion with others, but there's a disconnect when it comes to basic forum functionality.&nbsp;I'm hardly&nbsp;'au fait' with netiquette, but I do gradually take note of what can and can't be done on my basic web browser (Microsoft Edge through Xbox One). For example, to separate paragraphs, you now need to make two line breaks! Why? I do not know.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Before punching the enter key, it's always best to revise your post (in effect, previewing your own words because there's no other means), or else hope and pray that your edit takes effect within the allotted FIVE&nbsp;MINUTES of grace before the function is disabled.&nbsp;Additionally, I've also made rookie mistakes by posting a long and thoughtful comment but by the time I'm&nbsp;ready to submit my Xbox controller has timed out, and when I reactivate it I sometimes hit B (return) by mistake and the web page&nbsp;reverts to the&nbsp;last posted comment and nullifies all that work I just did! 😠</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You've raised some very valid points (and I hope smileskybird is taking notes), especially regarding what DOESN'T work for you&nbsp;on Xbox.&nbsp;When I'm not actively engaged in the latest game or focusing on my achievements - or enjoying Twitch or YouTube - I *may* just poke my nose into the trending area. But generally don't stay long because,&nbsp;like you said, it's all about "likes" and popularity and page views!&nbsp;Kinda reminds me of a snake eating its own tail. Oh well, I guess when you're bored - with literally no outside interests apart from your own nested community (GTA&nbsp;Online, I'm looking at you) - you've gotta do something to feel like you're making a narcissistic difference. Yeah right. 😆

            <p>My perspective and most likely, mine alone.</p><p>It's a good app machine and Blu Ray player. Except for being regin locked.</p><p>Flaws? Too many to list, but the main flaw. Which I have been saying&nbsp;since 'Day One' is.&nbsp; That which governs the system. (Rep, political correctness, or&nbsp;more properlly put. Communications bans. Interupted console updates - power/isp failure etc occuring during an update. Which&nbsp;according to one xbox admin/ambassador - may brick/ban the system - Still can't&nbsp;get over hearing about that one)&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Sea of Thieves play time in the Xbox app on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p><p><br /></p><p>I have enjoyed quite a bit of Sea of Thieves over the past week and was researching on how to get some exact numbers out of the Xbox app, but I only seem to get results about the console. Thinking the process should be similar enough I went to "My games" -&gt; "Sea of Thieves" -&gt; "Achievements", but couldn't find a play time meter there:<br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fqQ8oxDj.png" /></figure><p><br /></p><p>The strange thing is that it is there for other games (like Minecraft):<br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fXVOv84z.png" /></figure><p><br /></p><p>Doesn't Sea of Thieves track my play time at all or is it logged somewhere else?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you in advance,</p><p>Daniel<br /></p>

            There is a work-around which you can try - Navigate to Settings&gt;Region and change your region to any country where Cortana isn't supported like North Korea. After closing all the Windows, change it again to where you are.

            With version 1709, Cortana's color would be in according to the theme you have selected. Vijay's country changing instructions would work but temporarily.

<h2>            Network control panel keeps hanging on some wireless networks</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm trying to change my IP on a wireless network because the routers' IP addresses are on a network that's inaccessible from the DHCP network. When I try to open Network and Sharing Center, or view Network Status and Tasks, the entire window is frozen.
 Is there any way to unfreeze it or access it, without constantly killing explorer in task manager?</p>
<p>I just want to change my IP so that I can connect to the resources I need. I don't understand why windows 7 would perform so much worse than XP that the network connections isn't accessible at all, since something like ifconfig isn't available. Someone told
 me that I could wait 20 minutes (!) and it would work. There's no way I'd wait so long every day I need to work over here. I've generally had good experiences with Win7 but the network browsing in general is a huge letdown, it feels just like using Win95.</p>

<h3> davidfontanese  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 PC all apps not responding</h2>
                    <p>I have 5 windows 10 PCs, different motherboards, all Dell, 2 are laptops, all on latest W10 release. One has recently started to hang sporadically with Not Responding - all apps - and also see typing lag in Yahoo email sporadically. Task manager shows high
 CPU utilization of Windows Explorer and various MS services. Not sure what could have caused this, I've done a bunch of things to isolate the problem, tried pretty much all the suggestions on this forum without success. Almost couldn't recover from Safe Mode
 (the password issue), so don't want to go there again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've seen only one reasonable suggestion: wait for Microsoft to fix it...</p>
<p>So, Microsoft, are you working to resolve this? I'm not the only one having this problem, and I haven't seen a bonafide solution posted anywhere.</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this only happened recently, what changes have been made to the device? If you recently installed any software, temporarily uninstall it to further isolate the issue. Also, if you did tweak your device settings (Personal preferences, Command Prompt, PowerShell,
 Registry, BIOS, etc.), restore its default settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may consider doing a repair upgrade to reinstall Windows. This should keep your files and installed applications. Follow the steps created by Andre Da Costa in this<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">
 Forum Article</a>. If the issue persists, reset your device. Also, review this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>about tips on improving PC performance and check if there's anything you haven't done yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            I think I may have found the issue and resolved the problem. After I posted (and I did pretty much everything you suggested short of a reinstall with no success) I read a post suggesting my account was corrupted. So I created another admin account, logged
 out of it, then back in with the "corrupt " account and everything has been working normally. That's all I did, which leads me to believe nothing I did previously caused or obviously helped resolve the problem. I'll post back if things change, but I didn't
 install or change anything other than MS updates :). I was a developer at one point in my career, so I understand how changes are the first place you look. Thanks John. Adding another account was too easy, but it seems to have worked. Any ideas why?

<p>Interesting. It's possible that Windows Update might have corrupted some of your system files during its installation. The funny thing is that I've been giving the test user account workaround before. I guess I just didn't see it coming on this scenario.
 Bummer.</p>

<p>John, as I had previously posted, after adding a new admin account, things improved dramatically, almost (but not quite) going away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But over time, it's getting worse - the typing lag (happening as I type this), the Not Responding, etc. seems to be happening more frequently, and taking longer to correct itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's still not as bad as it was when I originally posted, but something is going on to make this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just been using the PC as usual, no changes, no new software, I just run Advance System Care periodically, and their Driver Booster - which I do on all my PCs (but only this one is affected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what I can do next, I suppose adding another account? I did do the reset - not a complete reinstall - you had mentioned before I added the account, but it didn't do anything to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to wonder if it's a memory (hardware) issue - but memory scans show no issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by software conflicts after the downgrade. To help you eliminate the software conflicts, you can perform a clean boot. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to perform a clean boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try checking if the same issue will happen when you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">boot your PC in safe mode</a></strong>.

    <title>Where is the Sleep option in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bwhelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the Sleep option in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just updated to Windows 10, and in checking the functions out I immediately noticed there is No
<em><strong>"SLEEP"</strong></em> function on the Power button. I at first I thought "Hibernate" took the place, then I learned not even close.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read some of the suggestions on the subject, and none of them work for me. I don't see the option of
<em><strong>"SLEEP"</strong></em>. So I can't change it. </p>
<p>
I have no idea on what I am missing/not doing but I Need Help, Please!</p>

            <p>Thank You again ZigZag3143 and I am sorry I have&nbsp;taken so long to respond. I&nbsp;am having a new problem, which so far I have not been able to fix.(I will write another post to ask that question though.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I had the new issue I read the instruction, trying to do what it said by going to the manufacturer website. In my case AMD. Problem is they do not want to maintain the driver I have and said the only way to update is through Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I looked for the Update and I found it but there is no way to just download that Update. My question is what do I do? I have a very slow connection, and trying to update absolutely stops me from doing anything else on the internet. I need some help, please!</p>

    <title>mmc could not create the snap-in in event viewer &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelpuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            mmc could not create the snap-in in event viewer &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>On Friday 14 June 2019, after saving File History, I attempted to check whether there were any errors or problems. I got the error message&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"mmc could not create the snap-in in event viewer".&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>After googling and binging this problem I found that there have been many instances of it being reported between 2010 and June 2019. For some reason the threads are locked. No wonder - it is such a common error!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I replicated the problem on my Surface Pro 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both my machines currently are on Windows 10 Pro version 1803 build 17134.829.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Now, what strikes me as odd is that the problem occurred after the cumulative update KB4503286 of patch Tuesday on 12 June 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Looking at the numerous patent "cures" in this instance I would suggest that the problem is likely to go away by backing out that update. Or perhaps Microsoft will even fix the problem - again.&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li>
Open File Explorer on the device.</li><li>
Navigate to the following path: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Event Viewer\Views</li><li>
Backup the content of the folder. The next step deletes the custom views and you may want the backup to restore the views when Microsoft fixes the issues.</li><li>
Delete all View_X.xml files in the folder (it starts with View_0.xml and increments the number by 1 for each file).</li><li>
Start the Event Viewer after deleting the files.</li></ol>

<p>Hi JohnD, </p>
<p>You may have noticed that in there MS also state "You may also receive the same error using
<strong>Filter Current Log</strong> in the <strong>Action </strong>menu with built-in views or logs."&nbsp;
<br />
The issue has come up repeatedly since 2010. It would be interesting to know the reason for that.
</p>
<p>MS also say they will fix this later.</p>

<p>better question isnt how long it is, but when will communications be restored? I have recently been banned for the second time (first time totally my fault second time i fail to see how «shut up bruh» warrants a ban but WHATEVER. Fact of the matter is my
 enforcment page said the ban would end 7/27/2016 at 3:11 pm CmT which in my time is 8:11 am. now yes at exactly 8:11 am my time it did allow me to try to send a message and said it sent HOWEVER when attempting to join a party or whatever nobody can hear me
 and nobody recieved my messages. it is now 10 am and im curious as to when exactly my account will really be restored. seems a bit fishy considering automatically restored should literally mean «automatically as in by itself» «restored as in like it was before»
 maybe i should grab a dictionary or a thesaurus perhapss?</p>

</p><p><strong>Reinstalling Windows 7 - Clean Install Using Recovery In Control Panel</strong><br />
<br />
You can reinstall Windows 7 using Recovery in Control Panel, under Advanced Recovery Methods. This method reinstalls Windows 7, either from a recovery image provided by your computer manufacturer, or from your original Windows 7 installation files. You need
 to reinstall all of the programs that you added, and restore all of your files from a backup. For more information, see Choosing an Advanced Recovery Method:</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>Note:<br />
<br />
Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows 7 if possible, even if you're reinstalling Windows 7 on a hard disk partition, and you have personal files on a separate partition. For example, if you have encrypted files, you might not be able to access
 them after reinstalling Windows. A custom installation replaces the current version of Windows 7 and all personal files.</p>

<p>I don't understand what you're asking.&nbsp; A file named "label.bat" already has a file extension.&nbsp; it's ".bat".&nbsp; The period and whatever comes after it is the file extension.&nbsp; Please explain in detail what you mean by settng up a file extension for a file that
 already has an extension.</p>

            <p>It sounds as if someone created a batch file called "label.bat" to print your lables, so all you need to do is find it on the first computer and copy it to the same place on the second computer.&nbsp; This is not a Windows program, it's not something that came from Microsoft, it was created for you by someone. </p>

            <p>Thanks for the response. After many hours of trial and error we discovered that it is an issue with XP home edition. the label.bat file does not automatically come up and when you search for it the file does not open but opens with Notepad.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your continued response to my problem. Although Notepad is the program that created the label.bat file, the instructions are to save the file as "All" in the field types. On my two computers that are running XP Pro the EPL2 extension reads
 "label.bat", which&nbsp;works seamlessly in a blink of a black pop up box and then goes immediately to the thermal printer. One the new location computer running XP home the EPL2 extension when associated with Notepad opening the label.bat file, it stops and you
 have to select to open the file or download and both do not work.</p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft and was quoted $99 to fix the problem, which I may have to do.&nbsp;</p>

            You may not use SuitePrint (although you seem to be using Netsuite), but you must be using some other proprietary application that takes the output from Netsuite and gets it to your thermal printer.&nbsp; If Plum Development Tech Support is not the correct
 vendor for you, then you should get in touch with tech support for whoever supplied that application.<br />
<br />
This issue is not related to any Microsoft software and I suspect that if you paid the $99 Microsoft support fee, there is no guarantee that you would get an individual who would be able to figure out what is going on.<br />

<p>Thanks for the response. After many hours of trial and error we discovered that it is an issue with XP home edition. the label.bat file does not automatically come up and when you search for it the file does not open but opens with Notepad.</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>It sounds to me like your .bat file association may be set to open by default with notepad.</p>
<p>First it would probably be a good idea to set a restore point...</p>

</p><p>Had a call from someone who claimed to be calling on behalf of Microsoft and Windows. I asked what he wanted and it wasn't clear. I then asked how he knew I had a Microsoft Product he said from the registration and he was going to read out the licence number
 and I can confirm it as 'I can see it with my own eyes and believe my own eyes.' I then old him I had no Microsoft laptops/computers around me which he then jumped to and said 'yes windows'. When I tried to see who called, the number was hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing this is a scam caller? Has anyone else had this?&nbsp;</p>

 hack my account and I would be suspended from live and all that stuff he said he had a jtag or something like that (don't even know what that is) and then he said F me cause I apperantly am japanese
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-7.gif" /> and started sending me party chat invites, so my question is, can he somehow hack my account? should I believe him? should I be affraid?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah Elf, it's just a false threat. It's nearly impossible to get hacked unless you get phished, and you seem way to smart to fall for that.</p>

 phished <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /> a second time LoL

<p>-</p>
<p>I might also file a complaint since he is still on my recent players list but he really didnt do anything
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>now only one question remains, who was more of a douch, him for threatening me or me for making him commit suicide over and over again?</p>

<p>people who hide in corners are just those people who try to up their perfectionist in Firefight by getting afew kills and nothing else. The whole AFK thing has been posted on Bungie.net informing ANY AFK-ers about their credits being reset and armor lost.
 But sadly, I have not heard about anything on commendations being restarted. So try all they might, they will still have us ACTUAL players doing our part, showing them what happens when you shoose not to play. This is why I try going in with a full party so
 the rounds will go quicker. Better luck in your next game though</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Gold codes in other countries</h2>
                    
<p><span>My sister is currently living in Singapore and is considering Live Gold for her 360. Can she buy a code for a 12 month subscription (or 3 month) from the US and have it work with her Xbox. It's a US Xbox she brought with her. I don't thin I they've
 got very connected it to the Internet. They also apparently have some sort of VPN router or som thing that can make their Internet connection look like a US one (to get US Netflix and Comcast Xfinity).</span></p>

<p>Prepaid Gold membership codes should be multiregional but prepaid cash and points are region locked. If she has a US credit card attached to her account it shouldn't be a problem buying membership and adding money to her account if it is an American account.
 Interesting how she can spoof her internet connection to think it is an American connection as it shouldn't be possible to access region locked apps.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>This can happen if the Boot priority in the (Basic Input Output System) BIOS is not configured to boot from CD/DVD as the first boot device, to fix it you need to change the first boot device in BIOS as the CD/DVD drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Try to change the boot priority: </span></p>
<p><strong><span>To boot to the Boot Priority Window in BIOS follow these steps: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>a. Insert the installation disc. And Restart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: </span></strong><span>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>b. <strong><span>Tap F12 </span></strong>when your computer is restarting. When you get to the boot priority Window select the CD/DVD Drive to the first bootable device and keep the Hard Drive as the Second.</span></p>
<p><span>(<strong><span>NOTE: </span></strong>Tapping F12 might not work on all computers. It depends on the make and model of the computer. If you are unable access anything with
<strong><span>F12</span></strong> then, verify the settings on the very first screen. You should see the keys to access BIOS and to change the Boot Priority, use these keys to access BIOS and make changes. If you are unable to access the BIOS or the Boot Priority
 then get in touch with the computer manufacturer for help.)</span></p>

BIOS: frequently asked questions</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>c. You will get a message “Press any key to boot from CD”. Press any key then</span></p>
<p><span>Now perform these methods and check:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Remove all external devices and then try to boot.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Perform a startup repair from Windows Recovery options and check:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> Rebuild BCD using the Bootrec.exe tool.</span></p>
<p><span>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Put the Windows Vista or Windows 7 installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.<br />
<br />
b. Press a key when you are prompted. Select a <strong><span>language, a time, a currency</span></strong>, a keyboard or an input method, and then click<strong><span> Next.</span></strong><b><br />

</b><br />
d. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click <strong><span>Next</span></strong>.<br />

<h2>            Skype for Mac won&#39;t accept that I am who I say I am</h2>
                    <p>As an early adopter of Skype (there were only 1,000 users worldwide when I joined) I have been using it for years with no problem. that is, until Microsoft took over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About three weeks ago, with no warning, no reason, each time I try to sign on to Skype, I am told that someone may be trying to use my account and asks for me to prove who I am with a series of screens.&nbsp; Once I respond to each of the questions, ending with
 the screen names of three of my contacts, Microsoft then announces that there is some trouble responding and for me to try again at a later time === which I have for the past three weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried opening new accounts.&nbsp; Was able to open two new accounts, but when I tried to sign into these, too, I am told that someone else is attempting to use these accounts.&nbsp; The last time a new account was created, the very first sign on told me someone
 was trying to use the account...the only person who could've been trying had to be me because the account had been created not two minutes previous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled, reinstalled.&nbsp; I've tried to use the web version.&nbsp; The same thing keeps happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this screen name for more than a decade.&nbsp; I still have $$$ associated with this screen name that is now down the toilet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on.</p>
