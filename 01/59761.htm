<h2>            File Explorer crashes when I try to open the Video folder</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 10. When I open "File Explorer" it shows the various folders such as Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Music, Video etc. When I click on the twisty to expand Video it shows the sub-folders in the Video folder. I can open any of the sub-folders.
 But If I click on the main Video folder, it briefly shows the contents on the right side of the screen then File Explorer closes

            <p>I have the same problem which only started recently. I have tried using System File Checker but that reports no problems. &nbsp;Explorer opens in the video folder but as the icons load, it then simply closes without error messages. &nbsp;It is generally possible to
 open the folder in "list" mode but changing the view to icons causes it to crash. &nbsp;It happens on all my video folders so is not a corrupted file problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another problem which started around the same time. &nbsp;I upgraded Outlook 2007 to Outlook 2016 (actually Office 2007 to Office 2016 Professional) and now Otlook's email "search" doesn't work. &nbsp;It says 246,000 items have been indexed but it finds "no
 results" (no error messages) when searching emails. Running the troubleshooter is not particularly helpful - it says "Incorrect Permissions on Windows Search Directories - not Fixed". &nbsp;I have been through all the fixes for this without success, tried reducing
 the number of folders searched and tried the DISM solution. &nbsp;I have also tried reinstalling Office and Repairing Windows none of which did anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if the two are linked but they are both extremely irritating.</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest performing a clean boot to check if the issue is caused by a software conflict that occurs when you installed a program or an update. To perform a clean boot, kindly refer to the article below:</p>

            You can't be serious?&nbsp; If the only suggestion you can offer is "reinstall windows" which would result in me having to spend DAYS redownloading and reinstalling all my programs, features and preferences, then you cannot really be serious in offering a support
 service. Both these problems have been widely reported so must be "known issues".&nbsp; You need to find and offer solutions to the issues that does not require your customers to waste hours of their time.&nbsp; Most of us live in the real world - "reinstall windows"
 is an unrealistic cop-out.&nbsp; Very disappointed with such an unhelpful suggestion.<br />

            I have just done a "Windows Update" (cumulative patch) which for some reason had not updated automatically but was waiting when I checked for new updates.&nbsp; This fixed the explorer crash problem without me doing anything else (although I still have the
 broken search in Outlook).&nbsp; So glad I did not "reinstall windows" which was the best Microsoft could come up with!<br />

            <p>Chris50259,</p>
<p>I agree that reinstalling Windows 10 is a pretty drastic step.</p>
<p>I went to the Microsoft support page and started chatting with an agent. He asked me some questions then sent me a link that I understood would be a fix or patch. Turns out the link was to do what I found out later they call an "inline Windows refresh" or
 something like that. I asked if I should create a restore point or back up anything. I was told "No. This will not affect any of your programs or data" Stupid me for believing him.</p>
<p>After a couple of boots, my laptop went into a loop telling me it was trying to restore a previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>More chatting online with Microsoft support (4 different people) I was told it could not be loaded remotely and I would have to take my laptop to a Microsoft store. They would fix it no charge. Luckily I live within 45 minutes of a store so I took it in.</p>
<p>They were not able to "fix" Windows 10 but said that they would need to install Windows 10 from scratch. You know what that means? They were able to pull most of my files and data from the hard drive before they started (Thank goodness). They were able to
 restore my data, but I lost all the programs that I had installed.</p>
<p>So now I have a fresh new copy of the latest build of Windows 10 and almost all of my data. But I will be spending a number of hours re-installing programs and customizing back to what I had.</p>
<p>I am not at all happy about this situation. I told the agent at the store. All he could&nbsp; do was offer a very weak "I'm sorry".</p>
<p>Next time I will be much more careful before I click on a link that Microsoft sends me.</p>

            Well I was certainly very pleased that I did not "reinstall Windows" as suggested by the Microsoft rep.&nbsp; As reported above, a regular Windows Update fixed the explorer crash and then following the Creators Update the Search Problem has been resolved.&nbsp;
 So I now have a system working as it should without spending hours reinstalling everything.&nbsp; Clearly both problems were caused by bugs in updates fixed by later updates.&nbsp; Very disappointed with Microsoft for such a poor response to my problem.<br />

    <title>Realtek wifi adapter isn&#39;t working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quiltam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek wifi adapter isn&#39;t working</h2>
                    <p>This problem started a few days ago. Initially I thought it was due to a dead spot in our home. After a few days I realized that was not the case. The troubleshooter narrowed it down to the Realtek wifi adapter. I went to
 the Network adapters under Device Manager. There was an indicator there (the yellow triangle I think).&nbsp; I checked for driver update, there were none. Received a "message" that I had the driver recommended and/or up to date. I found info suggesting I roll back
 the driver. That option is not available. I found suggestion to uninstall the network adapter, restart and hopefully that reinstalls the driver. That didn't work. The Realtek adapter that I initially was dealing with is now gone. I had other messages in Device
 Manager saying the adapter couldn't start code 10 and couldn't be found. I currently have Realtek PCle FE Family Controller listed. I think that was there before but not the wifi adapter initially identified as this problem. This controller seems to be ok.
 I found information suggesting some type of installation or update could be the culpret. I had recently upgraded a program so did a system restore back to before the update. Initially this seemed to work but now the problem is back. I found information about
 generating a wlanreport but received "failed, error is 0x3A98."&nbsp; I found this&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues. I don't believe the problem is the router, modem, etc. basic issues. Ethernet cable works
 but that was never the issue. I did not turn off firewall, antivirus protection, etc. as that seems irrelevant and I'm hesitant to do anything anymore. This only other thing on this list that I haven't done is the network reset. Again, hesitant to try anything
 else, especially when this article says "last resort." It appears to me that I have completely lost the ability to use wifi and that the realtek adapter needs to be turned back on or reinstalled and nothing else I've seen seems to offer that solution. I tried
 virtual assistant which led to some of the suggestions. I thought there was a chat available, can't find it. I don't see what the Skype option is supposed to do; it doesn't seem to "call" anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to find more Realtek info in history: Realtek RTL8821ae wireless lan 802.11ac may be the actual adapter that no longer shows up.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WiFi adapter driver that has been uninstalled might be the reason why your WiFi adapter isn't working. We suggest that you download and install the latest WiFi adapter driver from the manufacturer's website and see if it helps. After ensuring that the
 correct driver is installed, check if the device is recognized in the Device Manager.

<p>Everything was going OK...I believe I got through the first 24 hours...then I started having trouble again. It may have been related to the other issue I have with Windows, it's been documented but I don't know which version caused the problem. (I think
 it was upgrading from 7.X to 8.X but going from 8.X to 10 didn't resolve the issue.) My lap top can't sleep or hibernate. The screen seems to do the "right" thing (it's black and blank), but the laptop is still doing something, the power light is on and I
 can hear the fan running. The only way out of this is to hold the power button down until the light goes off and then push it again to turn it on. I was using a "regular" outlet and pushing the button and it was ok, but then I went back to my other power source
 where I turn the power strip off, essential forcing the battery to die every night, and it started acting up again (after initially being OK).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I quit using the power strip and got everything going again but today it's been one thing after another. Everything going fine and then the adapter quits again. Same error message, "The Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11 bgn Wi-Fi adapter is experiencing driver-
 or hardware-related problems." The first time it happened I noticed there was an update to install (noted by the power button, not a pop-up). I did install and restart and it worked again. At least one time it quite when I was using Messenger (which has also
 been giving me trouble on my phone.). A couple times it was while using email (Outlook). Restart seemed to fix the issue, but it happened repeatedly. One time it got "stuck" (I think it was on the manufacturer's logo screen) and I had to hold the power button
 down again and then turn it on. At least one time it didn't work until after several restarts. How many widows I had open or which apps I was running seemed irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A missing or corrupted system files may have caused the issue. What we recommend is that you run the System File Checker (tool) to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing
 or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. You may check the steps in running the SFC by simply following the steps provided in this

<h3> lukas_d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Encrypted word document - &#34;user does not have access privileges&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just did a fresh install on my new hard drive, I backed everything up on an external HDD and reformatted the old one.&nbsp; Now when I try to copy my encrypted word and excel documents over, or try to open them it tells me "user does not have access privileges".&nbsp;
 It won't even give me the option to enter the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing permissions and I already have Full Control of all the files, but it still denies me access.&nbsp; It won't let me move, copy, open or make any changes to the files at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files were encrypted via MS Office, and stored in an ecrypted folder.&nbsp; Even the files in that folder that weren't password-locked cannot be openned, they just say "invalid file extension" or "file is encrypted or corrupted".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help please, these are important docuements and <em>need</em> to get access to them.</p>

</p><p>You have encountered one of the major problems with encryption.&nbsp; When you encrypt an object it is tied to the OS.&nbsp; When you did the fresh install you broke that link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you have an un-encrypted backup of those files they are probably gone.</p>

            It appears that you created a double-whammy by both encrypting/password-protecting the files
<em>and</em> encrypting the folder, which serves no purpose if the files are encrypted.&nbsp; It's the encrypting of the folder that's causing your issue because normally Office files that are password-protected are transferable.&nbsp; If they are important documents,
 surely you have backups. <br />

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />If issue persist celan cache of web browsers:
<br />
<br />IE:
<br /><a href="https://clear-my-cache.com/windows/internet-explorer-11.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://clear-my-cache.com/windows/internet-exp...</a>
<br />

            Let’s try the easiest thing first: 
<br />
<br />Click on Start - and type "control panel" and click on it
<br />
<br />Once open, search "recovery" and hit enter. When it comes up, click on recovery. 
<br />
<br />On the next page, open "open system restore" 
<br />
<br />They'll be a box that says "click for more restore points" that I would click. Choose a restore point (before this happened), and follow the prompts. 
<br />
<br />** Please note, all your files and photos, etc will be fine. Any applications (ex. candy crush) you've installed since the point you're going back to will be removed. Just a heads up **
<br />
<br />Once done, check your browsers again and see if we’re in better shape. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

<h2>            Can&#39;t Upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hey there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Lately, I've wanted to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 but I noticed that the upgrade isn't in the WIndows Store. I tried contacting the Windows Team via Twitter, and they've asked me to try some solutions to see if it works, but all of them didn't
 worked. I've also tried to update using a product key which failed because it said that "Windows isn't available in your country/region". How can I upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1? Are there any more solutions then the ones that are on windows.com?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,</div>
<div><br />

Dears,<br />
<br />
I have bought a computer this week (Lenovo computer) and it had windows 8. Anyway, I wanted to move from this Windows 8 (very badly built) and move to the version 8.1.<br />
<br />
I have encountered the same issue - the update is not shown in my Store. On the other hand, I have done today all the updates the system proposed me. So as far as I can seem I cannot update more my system...<br />
<br />
I really want to move to the new version and it has been 2 complete days that I am searching how to resolve this problem.
<br />
<br />
What I have done:<br />
1. I have done all the updates;<br />
2. I have done "run", then "wsreset.exe", then restart and nothing;<br />
3. I have read and reread the instructions given by Microsoft. <br />
<br />
Below are the links I have looked at: <br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/cant-update-to-windows-81-from-windows-8/553be020-23de-4ee6-ad45-db7eb5e4fe8b<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/update-from-windows-8-tutorial<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me? It is not a great gift to have a new computer and not being able to update it to the new version. Is there no other link to avoid the "Store"?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ones who will be able to help me.<br />

            Microsoft is now providing a Windows 8.1 disc. It must be purchased from the Microsoft Store on the web from the supplemental parts section. The cost I am told is $20.00 US.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Thank you for choosing Microsoft answers forum for windows vista.</span></p>
<p><span>You can put the computer in
<strong>clean boot</strong> and then try to download.</span></p>
<p><span>Try performing clean boot and then see if the issue still persists or not. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista
 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp; Follow the steps below:</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>4. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>5. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>6. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span>If you are able to boot without any issues, please follow the later steps after clean boot that is steps 1 in the below article:</span><span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Next try download and run
<strong>System Update Readiness Tool</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0435684b-8d12-4028-9cb0-b2903257f1fd&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0435684b-8d12-4028-9cb0-b2903257f1fd&amp;displaylang=en</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>This article describes the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista-based computers. Microsoft released the System Update Readiness Tool to resolve certain
 conditions that could cause installing updates and other software not to work. You do not have to manually run this tool.</span></p>

            Hi Rodrigo.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this retail Windows 10?  You can only move a retail Windows Product Key.  
<br />
<br />Then to change to new hardware follow these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It may require Support to help activate so contact Microsoft Support, asking for Activation help, then keep asking for an agent.  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> jonathanhall1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1709 upgrade failure</h2>
                    I am attempting to upgrade to Windows 1709. The update fails at 49% indicating that some apps need to be uninstalled. These are McAfee HIPS and McAfee Enterprise Edition. These apps are not installed on my PC&nbsp;and no folders exist for this software. The
 uninstall and continue option does not work. I am told to uninstall manually which is impossible since these apps are not installed. I suspect that there are some redundant registry keys which are causing this problem. I have unsuccessfully tried using MCPR
 to uninstall this McAfee software. Where in the registry&nbsp;does Windows 1709 check for incompatible software ?

            If you are using the Update Assistant, you can try upgrading manually using the Media Creation tool or iSO file. I notice this tends to happen with the Update assistant.

<p>Thanks for the advice. I have a Lenovo Z500 Ideapad (laptop). It originally came with Windows 8.1 Home Edition (x64). I have successfully pushed it through all updates up until now. It is currently running Windows 10 1703 Pro (x64). I am busy downloading
 the full iso and will try an offline upgrade. I still don't understand why the 1709 upgrade has an issue with software that is not installed (McAfee). I may have had&nbsp;McAfee Enterprise installed when I was running Windows 8.1 but that was a long time ago. There
 may be some residue of it in the registry somewhere. However, previous builds and feature updates have not complained about it.</p>

            The offline ISO installation did not work. I encountered the same problem. I was requested to uninstall McAfee HIPS and McAfee Enterprise Edition. These are not installed programs under Programs and Features therefore a conventional uninstall is impossible.
 There are no McAfee folders under Program Files, Program Files (x86), Program Data or Windows folders. No McAfee services are active.&nbsp;I repeat one of my original questions - Where is the Windows 1709 Feature Update checking for incompatible software. Is it
 somewhere in the registry ?

            It could be checking your startup programs and services. 
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the Services tab
<br />Scroll the list and look for any entries for McAfee
<br />
<br />Uncheck them then try again. Another user had problems with Symantec EndPoint and they ultimately had to resort to a clean install. These enterprise security clients tend connect all over the place.

            If you look at my last posted message it indicates that no McAfee services are running and there is no McAfee software installed, no folders etc. Therefore nothing can be running.(I have checked services with msconfig and there is nothing.). Where is the
 1709 upgrade detecting McAfee HIPS and McAfee Enterprise ?? Do you think it is in the registry ?

            I purchased it approximately 4 years ago brand new&nbsp;from a reputable dealer (Incredible Connection) and I am the sole user. If you look at my original post you will notice that I mentioned that McAfee may have been installed when the laptop was running
 Windows 8.1, but it has not been installed while running Windows 10. Previous upgrades i.e. 1511, 1607 &amp; 1703 have never complained about McAfee. And as I have indicated it is not installed and no folders exist for this software. No McAfee services are active.
 I ran MCPR on Friday 17th to try and remove it, but as you indicated, and I discovered it does not work with Enterprise edition. I have not run Norton Removal Tool or Norton Remove &amp; Reinstall. Current Windows Version is Windows 10 1703 (OS Build 15063.726).
 I would really like to know where/how the 1709 update checks for incompatible software ?

<p>And&nbsp;a second problem. When I Skype with my cousin the image that she sees of me on her side is fine for about 4 minutes then it's all scrambled and we hang up and reconnect and again are okay for another 4 minutes... any ideas there?&nbsp; Her Skype is a bit

<h3> antman159  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pvp player rules. &#40; in game community rules &#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I've found a list of rules of the pvp community rules. <br />
<br />
I find the rule listing fair in some points and not so far in other how ever I've looked on not only the dark souls rules but the Demon souls as well. (seeing how both games are made and play the same, well like 95% the same gameplay. [no magic bar in dark
 souls]<br />
<br />
so I've taken the&nbsp; time to post some of the rules here, I've also seen that some players brake a few of the rules in the Area pvp in the Dlc zone. so I'll make a rule list for that and people can change what they see fit, I just want a rule set here not only
 for fun game play but for game play that isn't overly cheap.<br />
<br />
here are the player rules. (from launch date to now) <br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>When invading, make yourself visible and if applicable allow the host to clear an area of enemies and items so a fair and fun duel can take place without undue distractions. If you end up running into the host or other combatants unexpectedly or in tight
 quarters, do your best to get clear of them at first so they know you intend to face them honorably rather than by ambush.
</li><li>Before a duel you should always bow to the other player to signal the start of the duel.
</li><li>Don't get a player to follow you into a group of enemies, as this is cheap and frowned upon.
</li><li>Allow players to buff their weapons after or before bowing if they choose to.
</li><li>Do not use an Estus Flask or Humanity to heal once a duel has started, as this is also generally frowned upon. (how ever I think spells like great heal are in play seeing how you are left open for a wile)
</li><li>If you win, be respectful to your defeated opponent and do not use rude gestures unless they for some reason engaged in very underhanded tactics. Even if you think you were much better than your foe, understand that they may be new
 to PvP, have weaker equipment, or were even having problems with lag, so you only tarnish your victory if you try to gloat and rub their face in it. Act like you've been here before. At the same time, even a veteran PvPer can have a bad match, bad luck, or
 just run into someone with better skill or a character build that happens to be perfectly designed to defeat theirs. None of these are reasons to show off.<br />
<br />
<br />
okay here's my rule list for Area pvp<br />
# healing spells are in fair play but only one pre-duel.<br />
# using buffs are in play but Crystal buffing weapion ( seeing how the weapon buff wasn't lowered.)<br />
# unless in Team battle Jumping people isn't fair. (Death match) unless show by using pray emot showing that it's all out battle.<br />
# no Chaining back stabs, lets make it fair. not a pain.<br />
# if you lose don't attack the other player(s), with messages. this is not only a pain, but brakes the terms of xbox live.<br />
# don't stand behind the other player(s) spawns. yes it's funny but brake the fun for the other player(s)<br />

    <title>Outlook 2016 Not Sending Attachments After Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lori889  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Not Sending Attachments After Update</h2>
                    Since the Fall Update, I can no longer send emails with attachments on Outlook 2016. I understand that the size limit for attachments is 20 mb but my emails with attachments only total 7 mb so this does not seem to be an issue. Prior to the update, I could
 send emails with such attachments easily but no longer. I have reinstalled MS Office Professional Plus 2016 but the problem remains. I suspect the cause is something in the update. Any suggestions? Thanks.&nbsp;

            Hi, Lori,
<br />
<br />1. Have you browsed for the attachment or selected from a pre-existing recent item?
<br />Try browsing for the file and verify if it sends.
<br />
<br />2. Are you using Rights Management Protect in both Outllok and Excel or Word? Use it in only one app and verify if it will send.
<br />
<br />3. Report this in Feedback Hub. Support/Developers can look into the issue to determine if it is on the Server side.

<p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. I have tried numerous ways to attach the photos, by browsing and selecting from a pre-existing item. I don't know about the Rights Management Protect option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been sending emails with photo attachments for a year and a half with no problem until I did the Fall Update on December 12, 2018 and then the problem arose. So it appears they are related. I will look into reporting it on the Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Lori.</p>

<p>I appreciate your suggestions and have been working on them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build: I checked that I have the current build and confirmed that all the updates are complete.</p>
<p>Server Settings: I checked the server settings. I had only POP3 accounts so I created a new email with an IMAP account but the IMAP emails with attachments are not sent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Format: All emails with attachments are not sent, whether the attachments are .jpg, .pdf or .doc</p>
<p>New Profile: I have two types of email: Outlook 2016 which is not sending emails with attachments, and Outlook.com app which is working fine. I tried to create a new profile but it merely put my Outlook 2016 account into the Outlook.com app. Now I am getting
 password popups in the Outlook 2016 email accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I am having trouble establishing a new profile without unintended results, I hesitate to do a reinstall of Outlook 2016 with a new profile. I did reinstall Office 2016 in total to try to fix the problem but it didn't work. Very frustrating. There doesn't
 seem to be an easy solution.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

 an Office 365 engineer. I continue to find that my emails with attachments get hung up in the Outbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anymore suggestions?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Lori</p>

            Microsoft's Response: Microsoft is committed to helping prevent software piracy, which often results in end users being the victims of software counterfeiters. Counterfeiters abuse product keys to create fake software packages and distribute these to the
 public. These packages are not licensed, do not have Microsoft support, and can also include dangerous malware and spyware.<br />
<br />
Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key to
 multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become
 non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to www.microsoft.com/geniune and follow the links provided to repair windows.<br />
<br />
Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory can
 secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.<br />

<br />
EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
If you have a similar PID, or your key is blocked and you want confirmation post a new thread with a report from the MGADIAG tool, download and run the tool, click copy and paste it in a new post here and Darin Smith from MS can verify your key for you. NEVER
 post your key, the report will suffice.<br />

</p><p><span>I use 4 workstations connecting to my network all windows 10, two workstations are x64 and other two x86.</span></p>
<p><span>I have map and share all the drives to the network no problem all workstations share everything on the network. When comes to one of my X64 machine when I turn media streaming and go to all Networks to enable is not retain the settings, only to local
 Network not to all Networks. Also I see a check mark on the other workstations folders that they share but not on this that has the issue. Is it a limitation on the Media streamers how many should be on the same network? Because they all use the same Microsoft
 e-mail account connecting to it.</span></p>

    <title>Installing Windows 10 with a usb Drive, Black Screen After Selection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leilani sky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 10 with a usb Drive, Black Screen After Selection</h2>
                    <p>I had to factory reset my laptop (asus modle X205T) because it was a second hand one and had little space to do anything. I contacted a Microsoft employee on July 28th and he live chatted with me to help solve my problem. He said I had to do a system reset
 to remove files that I couldn't delete manually. Something went wrong, however, and it deleted almost all my files (including Windows 10 files). From what I have seen through the command prompt only two folders remain; USERS and Windows, both seemingly empty.
 I got a bootable version on my new usb drive, but when I try to boot up from it my screen goes black, sometimes with or without a cursor. I am an aspiring digital artist and animator and need my laptop for practice so if anyone could give advice that would
 be marvelous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you &lt;3</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: the order in which the events take place is as follows;</p>
<p>
</p><p>restart three times to get to recovery menu&gt; trouble shooting&gt; exterbal method&gt; usb 0.00&gt; fades to dark with some of the menu from the external method selection darked out&gt; black&gt; ASUS logo&gt; black again.</p>

<p>Hi Lisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Tablet keyboard fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted, incompatible or due to hardware problems.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the <span>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with devices and hardware. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
</span><strong><span>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Update the Drivers</p>
</span></strong><span>
<p>
</p><p>Most hardware interfaces require driver software to work properly. If you recently upgraded from one version of Windows to another, power outages, viruses, or other computer problems, it's possible that the drivers have become corrupted. Downloading and
 installing the <strong>latest driver </strong>can resolve these types of problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below article to know how to <strong>Update drivers</strong>:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update keeps breaking my operating system. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyfisher1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update keeps breaking my operating system.</h2>
                    <p>So I am currently stuck with the stable build of Windows 10.0.14393.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the large update that I am being told is mandatory. It breaks a TON of things. Most of them I managed to fix. I fixed my network card, was working on fixing Norton Antivirus, and trying to find a work around for fixing the origin client when
 the next wave of updates installed and on the next reboot happened I received a message that said there was an error. It went through a process of trying to fix the error, and then there was a blue screen where it said Advanced options, or restart, except
 the screen was unresponsive. This would occur every time I booted. Basically any time I would patch to this build, no matter what (I have replicated this error) it gets to this point. It completely breaks my operating system and the only option is for me to
 revert back to the stable build which I keep getting messages about that Microsoft is going to stop supporting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a tad frustrated here. I understand there are major security fixes in these updates, however they are clearly not polished either. When the updates are not optional and they break my computer... I need a little help here.</p>

            When there’s any major update - cumulative update feature update - I disconnect all external hard drives &amp; disable Norton &amp; Malwarebytes to be able to install with no problems. If I didn’t I’d have serious problems with slowdowns or black screens.
<br />I would recommend returning to the stable build &amp; blocking the update/s using the windows update mini tool or you can try what I have to do.
