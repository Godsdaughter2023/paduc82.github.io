<p>My USB device un-configured itself! </p>
<p>If your USB device suddenly has no data in it, or it has reverted to its pre-configured state, it may not meet all the requirements for using it with the Xbox 360 console. Did you get a warning message during configuration? The best thing you could do is
 to find a USB device that better meets the requirements for use with the console.</p>
<p>If you want to give your USB device another try, format it to FAT32 again on the PC and then try the configuration process over again. It would be recommended to make sure your files are saved on the console as well in case there is another issue.

<p>Take a look at the sticky above. It has some good information about flash drives.

<h2>            Windows Repair Tool</h2>
                    <p>So I tried to dual boot Ubuntu after already having Windows 10 installed. I can no longer boot into windows, and would like to. I created a bootable USB with the Windows 10 Anniversary update iso and tried to boot my pc with it. On bootup, it tries to run
 the repair tool, but it tells me that boot/winload.efi is missing. Error code 0xc0000225. Please help me! I need to get back to windows asap.</p>

<p>Hello Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate your earnest effort to reach out with Microsoft Community. We understand that you were unable to boot your PC with Windows 10 after booting your PC with Ubuntu. The "boot/winload.efi is missing" and/or error code 0XC0000225 that you get when
 you boot your PC using the Windows 10 ISO file that you created, might be caused by the ISO file being corrupted. We strongly recommend that you create a new ISO file on a disc using a different PC running on Windows 10 version 1603. You may check the article
 below for reference. </p>

<h2>            Odd and confusing External USB 3.0 HUB behavior.. Only 1 port works for only ONE specific device.</h2>
                    <p>2 days ago I opened up my laptop to put new cooling paste on the CPU and GPU, it went somewhat ok, had to redo the opening part once because it didn't function properly. Now it works fine, but something have happened with my Externally powered 7port USB
 3.0 hub.<br />
<br />
I used to have my Xbox 360 USB wireless dongle, 1 USB 3.0 External SSD, some USB Steelseries Headphones, and 3 other items only for power (Lamp, Phone charger etc)<br />
<br />
Now, after first boot the ONLY port that works when it comes to making the lamp lit (as it communicates with the computer) is port 4 (the middle one) But it gets worse there as it only works with the external harddrive (SSD) Nothing else works, no port, not
 even the same port if I Eject the external harddrive. But I am still able to get the power from all ports, so I can use the charger etc, just no other ports for data transfer of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really confused about this error</p>
<p>

            Hi Ungwel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You really can't rule out that hardware damage was done when you disassembled to repaste the CPU heatsink, since it always a very risky operation depending upon how many parts must be removed to reach the heatsink.  Some parts are so fragile that no amount of precaution can prevent them breaking.  
<br />
<br />But due to the migration error logged it may only be a USB driver issue which is common in Windows 10.  I'll give you everything to try so that hopefully something works.  I'll also be standing by here to help with any steps and continue if necessary to help you further until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />1) Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />2)  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />3) If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  Do you know when this started?   If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then you can roll it in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Was going to reply when you first replied to my post, gotta start with saying WOW that was frick'n fast :) Very informative answer too, doesn't even feel like a copy pasta.<br />
<br />
Well I also got a lot of experience in building, fixing and tweaking computers done it basically my whole life with computers being disassembled and did things that normal users don't usually do since age of 7 (I'm almost 40 now). But Can't say that I started
 doing things myself until around 14, but I have never before disasembled a Laptop to the last detail which is basically what I had to do with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too suspected that the USB controller which is not solded onto the motherboard but connected with a cable inside the laptop case had possibly gotten broken. But it gets even more confusing when I did the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unplugged the External SSD case from the USB hub, Changed the port (same controller on the laptop / 2 Ports on it) And the USB hub works perfectly. The other port though, I can't plug anything in there and get it to work EXCEPT the External SSD, seriously
 confusing but I'm ok with this solution until I reinstall my windows which I do on a regular basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have uninstalled all USB devices and the controller's drivers, restarted computer, reinstalled the Asus Chipset drivers for my laptop (even though it said it's a downgrade by 3 years when installing it) Nothing seem to remedy this confusing conflict or whatever
 it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the 2-port USB 3.0 Controller on the laptop works, but one port only accepts the external Harddrive, even if I plug in a 7-port USB hub into it, it only accepts the External drive. But the 2nd port on the laptop works for everything.<br />
<br />
I really have no clue how this is happening, but I'm guessing it has something to do with I/O conflicts /registry of the hardware that have been messed up somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks a lot for the extremely quick reply. Never bothered to create an account and post tech questions here, something just told me it would probably take a lot of time to get answers. Don't ask me why I believed that :) Turned out I was wrong</p>
<p>

    <title>Win 7 Not Genuine After Removing Vista Dual Boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vba_djs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 Not Genuine After Removing Vista Dual Boot</h2>
                    I had Vista and Win 7 Ultimate dual booting each on a separate partition of the same hard drive. Vista was installed first.<br />
<br />
I used EasyBCD to (a) remove Vista from the boot menu and (b) set Windows to boot directly into Win 7.<br />
This worked.<br />
<br />
I then used GParted to remove the Vista partition and add the space to Win 7.<br />
<br />
I then used my Win 7 Ultimate disk to do a startup repair because Bootmgr was 'missing' since it was on the Vista partition. This also appeared to work because the computer boots into my login screen and even shows the local domain that I log into.<br />
<br />
However, after logging in, the 'Preparing your desktop' screen appears for a long time, and then a blue-blank desktop appears with the 'Win 7 Build 7601 This copy of windows is not genuine' message in the lower right.
<br />
<br />
Thinking that it might be a BCD error, I followed the steps in this <a href="http://think-like-a-computer.com/2012/04/17/boot-bcd-0xc000000f-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.<br />
<br />
This was no more successful - I still get the same screen.<br />
<br />
The copy of Win 7 Ultimate is from my subscription to the Microsoft Action Pack.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to fix this without having to re-install Windows 7 and all of my software?

<br />
This tool told me that my Win 7 partition was now being assigned to the E drive.<br />
<br />
Using the tool to change the drive back to C did the trick.<br />

            Hi, i hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately Skype doesn't have a built in option to save a video call from an iPad, for that you would need a third party app.
<br />

</p><p>I don't have a surface book 2 but I believe this is a designed shutdown to prevent GPU overload and overheating. But cannot get enough RAM, CPU usage to shut it down so it terminated all the programs and forces a bluescreen. We, as a community can't do anything
 about it until Microsoft releases a new patch.</p>

    <title>Type Cover 2 not detected properly on Surface Pro 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Type Cover 2 not detected properly on Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a Surface Pro 2 (256GB) and a Type Cover 2 which worked perfectly, until I refreshed Windows. Now when I connect the cover I can use the trackpad, trackpad buttons, and Fn+Del and Fn+Backspace to control brightness but no other keys work. In device
 manager it seems to be detected as a standard keyboard (there is no mention of a Type Cover in device manager), and the software keyboard does not appear while the cover is attached, so it looks like Windows knows a keyboard is present.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I installed all the latest updates again after my Windows refresh without the cover attached and think this might be the cause of the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried doing a hard reset of my Surface (10+ seconds on the power button), letting it boot both with and without the cover attached with no success.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions or ideas would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Managed to solve this one - uninstalled all windows updates,&nbsp;attached the cover, restarted, re-installed all the updates (with the cover still attached), restarted to finish re-install of the updates and I was able to log in using the cover keyboard.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's probably one update in particular that the cover needs to be attached for, but I don't know which one.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps someone else with a similar problem!</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t find a program in my windows pc</h2>
                    <p>I installed the program DriveHUD today. If I go to Control Panel. I can see that it is installed and it is giving me the option to uninstall. I reinstalled several times but to no avail. &nbsp;After I "repair" the program I &nbsp;can't find it to execute. Where could
 I find the execution path of my program on Windows 10?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>If it's a 64 bit program, the exectuable file will live in C:\Program Files.&nbsp; If it's a 32 bit, it will be in C:\Program Files (x86).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The quickest way to get to it is to use the Search Window and look for "DriveHUD".&nbsp; That should offer you an access to the executable without the need to use File Explorer to find it.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before we troubleshoot the issue I need more information about the issue you are facing.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since when are you facing this issue?</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue started?</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get this error when using a particular application or is it random?</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is the computer manufacturer and what is the model number?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Blue Screen errors (also sometimes called black screen errors or STOP code errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your
 computer." </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, I would suggest you to access the computer manufacturer’s website and download the latest version of drivers and install it and check if it helps.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also you may try to update all the drivers from device manager and check if it helps you fix the issue.&nbsp; Access the link below and follow the steps to update drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also use Event viewer to check what is causing this issue. Event Viewer is an advanced tool that displays detailed information about significant events on your computer. It can be helpful when troubleshooting problems and errors with Windows and
 other programs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To open Event Viewer follow the steps below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Event Viewer. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the
 password or provide confirmation).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Access the link below to know more about how to access Event Viewer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may access Event Viewer and let us know the exact error message.&nbsp; </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>You can also refer to the article below :</p>

</p><p>

<div>Hope this helps. Let us know the status.<br />

<h2>            Corrupt Windows files &#40;8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I use Windows 8.1 on a Toshiba Satellite C875 and I had some issues lately. I want to install Windows 10 but I know if my current Windows has corrupt files, I won't be able to upgrade. I ran&nbsp;sfc/scannow command and was unnable to fix the errors I've
 been having. When I start the laptop I get errors about some dll files missing.<br />
<br />
I also tried the commands<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
and I got the following error: 0x800f081f<br />
<br />
Here are some parts of the log file (No idea what it means)</p>

<div><br />
<span><strong>Which files will be affected?</strong></span>
<div><br />
When you reset your PC, the drive will be completely reset, and all your apps and files will be removed from it. Windows 8 will be reinstalled, and you'll need to change any settings and reinstall any apps that you want to get back after resetting. If you know
 if any files that you don't want to lose, then you should back those files up before starting the reset.</div>
<br />
<span><strong>What if I have multiple drives?</strong></span>
<div>
<p>You can choose whether to reset all hard drives or just the one with Windows 8 installed on it. Any drive that Windows 8 doesn't recognize, such as those with non-Windows operating systems, will not be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Help Needed&#58; Switching from Outlook 2000 to Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dexter52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help Needed&#58; Switching from Outlook 2000 to Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to request that my question/issue be seen by someone who is an expert in your e-mail programs (Outlook, Windows Live Mail, etc.). Thank you!</p>
<p>Here is the scenario:</p>
<p>1) We have a 9 year old Desktop PC that is being replaced.&nbsp; The operating System is Windows XP Home - SP 2.&nbsp; This PC has been running Microsoft Office 2000 Professional forever...including Outlook 2000, which we have been using for our home e-mail accounts.</p>
<p>2) There are 2 users on this PC (myself &amp; my wife).&nbsp; Outlook 2000 is configured in a way that allows both of us to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">share</span> the same accounts. Regardless of whether I am logged into the computer or she is logged in, when we launch Outlook we are both accessing the same ".pst" file with the same Messages, the same Contacts &amp; the
 same Calendar.&nbsp; (There are currently 2 POP3 e-mail accounts set up from our provider (Verizon) that both feed into the same Inbox &amp; folders.)</p>
<p>3) The old PC is being replaced by a new Desktop system running Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; The new system came pre-loaded with Microsoft Office 2007 - Home &amp; Student edition - which does NOT include Outlook.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4) Outlook is a&nbsp;terrific program, but as great as it is as an office e-mail system, it's really more than most people need for home e-mail.&nbsp; So we decided to try Windows Live Mail on our new computer.</p>
<p>5) I copied the ".pst" file from our old PC to the new one &amp; attempted to import the messages into Live Mail.&nbsp; Live Mail did not provide an option to import from this format - only Outlook Express 6, Windows&nbsp;Mail &amp; Windows Live Mail itself&nbsp;seem to be supported.</p>
<p>6) I read a bulletin board entry online (can't remember where) that said that Outlook 2000 is not in a format that is compatable with Live Mail.&nbsp; So, on our old XP computer, I opened OUTLOOK EXPRESS &amp; imported all the messages, contacts &amp; calender entries
 from Outlook 2000's ".pst" file.&nbsp; The problem is - I don't know what to do next!&nbsp; Everything is imported into Outlook Express on the old PC, but I don't know the name of the file they are in or what I need to do to get Live Mail on the new PC to see them.&nbsp;
 The Dell tech support technicians were absolutely no help at all, so I have turned to you all!</p>
<p>Here are my questions:</p>
<p>Can I set up Windows Live Mail to work the same way that Outlook 2000 did - shared between 2 users?&nbsp; Our provider allows for multiple e-mail addresses.&nbsp; They don't all have to feed into the same account inboxes, but I would like for myself &amp; my wife to be
 able to see the same message archive when we are logged in.</p>
<p>Additionally, my wife also got a new Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; Would it be possible to "network" the ".pst" file in a shared folder so that either computer can see it in Live Mail?&nbsp; (This would be a nice "plus", but it's not a necessity by any means.)&nbsp; Or does
 Live Mail not even use ".pst's"?</p>
<p>Or, do we need to forget Live Mail entirely &amp; purchase Outlook 2007?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, for any help you can provide!</p>
<p>Dexter</p>

<br />
Each user account has its own set of accounts and folders in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; If you both want to see messages from the same E-mail account, configure the account to leave messages on the server, and choose one of the message deletion options.<br />

            You're doing all the right things!&nbsp; To find the folder containing Outlook Express files on the old XP computer, click
<strong>Tools </strong>&gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Maintenance</strong> &gt;
<strong>Store Folder</strong> .&nbsp; Copy that folder to the Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; Then, import from Microsoft Outlook Express 6 into Windows Live Mail via that folder.<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail supports multiple E-mail accounts.&nbsp; Each one has its own set of folders (Inbox, Sent items, Deleted items, etc).<br />
<br />
Only Outlook uses ".pst" files.&nbsp; I don't know of any way to share a ".pst" file between two computers.&nbsp; You can configure the E-mail programs on both computers to read the same incoming messages.

    <title>Converting basic disk to dynamic without losing data - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Converting basic disk to dynamic without losing data</h2>
                    <hr />
<div>
<p>I posted this earlier today but I think I posted it in the wrong place so am reposting it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Intel my laptop has RAID capability built into the chipset but it would seem Samsung has disabled it as there is no settings in the BIOS. In doing some reading it would appear there is a software RAID built into Windows 8.1, or at least driver
 mirroring which is what I want. It is also my understanding that you have to have the drive as a dynamic drive and mine is currently basic, so need to know;<br />
<br />
1. Does the drive have to be changed to dynamic in order to use mirroring?<br />
2. Can I convert my bootable drive with the OS and all of my data to dynamic without any data loss, and will it retain the recovery partition that has been provided for recovery purposes?<br />
3 Is there any downside to having the disk as a dynamic instead of a basic, and if not why are all disks simply not dynamic to start with?<br />
4. Is using this type of mirroring the same as a hardware RAID 1 where if one drive fails the other can be used without any interruption and will be bootable?<br />
<br />
<br />
One other thing, is the program to check your computer for compatibility with Windows 8 still available? I did a search and everything I found said it was no longer available. I purchased Windows 8 when first released with the $39.95 special price and have
 an older Vista laptop I would like to use it on if it is compatible but can't find the program to run that checks for compatibility. Also would I be able to upgrade from Vista to 8 and maintain my data or programs or would I have to do a complete fresh install?<br />
<br />
Thank you. </p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you need assistance in converting basic disk to dynamic disk. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Answering to your questions respectively:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Question 1. Does the drive have to be changed to dynamic in order to use mirroring?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Answer: Yes, the drive needs to be change into dynamic volumes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Question 2. Can I convert my bootable drive with the OS and all of my data to dynamic without any data loss, and will it retain the recovery partition that has been provided for recovery purposes?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Answer: When you convert the basic disk to a dynamic disk you must delete all disk partition from the disk and then use the “Convert To Dynamic Disk” command. If you want to keep your data, you must first back it up or move it to another volume.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Question 3. Is there any downside to having the disk as a dynamic instead of a basic, and if not why are all disks simply not dynamic to start with?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Question 4. Is using this type of mirroring the same as a hardware RAID 1 where if one drive fails the other can be used without any interruption and will be bootable?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Answering to your question 3 &amp; 4, I would suggest you to refer to this Microsoft TechNet article:</span></p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363785%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363785%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To check the <strong>computer compatibility with Windows 8 </strong>refer to this Microsoft article:</span></p>

<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-download-online-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-assistant-download-online-faq</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>Making any changes in the BIOS for RAID capability I would suggest you to contact the computer manufacturer (Samsung support).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting
 from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also like to inform you that after converting the basic disk to a dynamic disk, you cannot change the dynamic volumes back to partitions. Instead, you must delete all dynamic volumes on the disk and then use the “Convert To Basic Disk” command.
 If you want to keep your data, you must first back it up or move it to another volume.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Once you change the basic disk to dynamic disk, it cannot be changed back to basic disk without deleting the partitions and rebuilding the disk and subsequently resulting in data loss. Hence before proceeding, please
 backup all your data.</span></span></p>

    <title>Firefox&#58; VLC Media Player not listed as content type - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daviddouglas3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Firefox&#58; VLC Media Player not listed as content type</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 computers: Acer Veriton M4650G and HP Pavilion Notebook, each with Windows 10 Pro - exactly the same version/build on both: Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.407). Both computers have exactly the same version of Firefox: 63.0.3. Both have exactly the
 same version of the VLC Media Player: 3.0.4 Vetinari. Both computers have the VLC Media Player set to every possible default settings.</p>
<p>On the HP notebook computer, Firefox (Options&gt;General&gt;Applications) has the following Content Type: "MP4 Video File (VLC)" with the "Action" set to: "Use VLC media player (default)" (See attached image):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c46463b-2126-4db2-b7bd-8adb69de3318?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c46463b-2126-4db2-b7bd-8adb69de3318?upload=true" height="329" width="467" /></a></p>
<p>The Acer computer doesn't show a video Content Type: "MP4 Video File" or any video file option at all. I scoured the Firefox support forum and found this remark:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">"A media player like VLC comes with its own drivers to handle all media types it supports. Firefox doesn't come with such drivers to handle all file types and for playing MP4 files Firefox checks the operating system to see whether
 it supports this specific file type. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">On Windows this is usually done via Windows Media Foundation (Vista, Windows 7+). If there isn't support available on the OS then your only option is to open the files in a media player that supports this content type. Native in
 this context means support at the operating system level."</p>
<p>Since the issue seems to be at the operating system level that can mean that there is something in Windows that is responsible for this discrepancy.
</p>
<p>Any assistance with this issue would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help. I followed your instructions to the letter and it didn't work. I dug a little more and found out that Mozilla dropped support for the VLC mp4 plugin so, even with the Mozilla mp4 plugin installed in VLC Media Player, it would not show
 up in Firefox.</p>
<p>I found a Firefox add-on: Play in VLC. This worked. It's not a plugin but an extension.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will help others with the same issue. As for me, I consider the issue to be solved.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help.</p>
