                    <p>Boa noite,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Assinei a Xbox Game Pass, mas não estou conseguindo baixar os jogos, vou no jogo da lista e quando seleciono, aparece pra mim comprar o jogo e não para jogar através da assinatura do Game Pass. Isso acontece no site e através do xbox 360.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Atenciosamente,</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Good night</strong></p>
<p><strong>I signed the Xbox game pass, but I'm not able to download the games, I go in the game list and when I select, appears to me to buy the game and not to play through the game Pass subscription. This happens on the website and through the Xbox 360.</strong></p>

<h2>            Music folder acting as hard drive</h2>
                    I have both an ssd and hard drive and was attempting to redirect my folders to the hard drive but made the mistake of not 1st creating a music folder on my hard drive. Now my music folder is acting like the hard drive folder. When I right click and select
 the properties for the music folder it looks like the properties of a hard drive. Is it possible to fix this?&nbsp;

            Hi Nicholas, that will require a Registry hack to fix  . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to this Key:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, double click My Music
<br />
<br />Set its data Value to: %USERPROFILE%\Music
<br />
<br />Close the Registry editor and restart your system
<br />
<br />Your Music folder will be back in its original location
<br />
<br />Then you can either copy your music into that folder or move the folder again this time to a folder !!

            Hi Nicolas.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you redirect the Music folder to the hard drive from the Location tab on Properties as shown here?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>
<br />
<br />If so use the Restore Default Location button in the Locations tab to restore the files.  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />Do not choose to copy the files so it doesn't copy System files to the default location.  You'll need to move them back manually.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Tablet sign in after tablet reset with microsoft account password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet sign in after tablet reset with microsoft account password change</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I have decided to reset my windows 10 tablet, because its keyboard was not attached properly. I have been using it for 2 years at least. Now first I encountered this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile I changed several times my sign in Microsoft account password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reset - also did more than one time - my tablet does not respond to the changes around my account as if it had only the information till the last use of it. I have no complaints over my laptop, that is up to date. So my laptop does not let me in. It
 requires password change, but when I change it, there is no effect. So it looks like, if it had in its brain something previous information to my original account, but that has been already several times changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now a valid Microsoft password. But it does not work for my laptop. I seems as if the win10 reset was not quite successful. I should let me in. After that I could try again how to connect the wireless keyboard to the tablet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional information: if it helps. When choosing resetting my tablet there were two options and I chose to keep my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a solution thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why this issue occurs is due to a corrupted user profile. We'll need to gather more information about the issue. Kindly answer the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you receive any error messages?</li><li>After resetting your PC, how did you set up your account?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>Have you tried booting your device in safe mode and check if the issue persists? To do this, kindly follow the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If in case that you're able to boot in safe mode, we recommend that you create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10. You can follow the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong><span>after you've booted </span><span>your device in safe mode. By doing this, we will be able to isolate if this is a corrupted account issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please post back with the result.</span></p>

<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick answer. I decided to take the tablet to a computer service for maintenance.</p>
<p>They promised me to recover it and I will have the factory software installed on it. The whole story has to do with a bluetooth keyboard and a temporary account keyword change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes it is a legal outlook account. I did use the account for years. From hardware side, I am not able to do anything with it such as reboot since it does not approve the new keyword changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software then will be refreshed, and i will try the keyboard as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you though.</p>

<h2>            How do I stop wallpaper syncing&#63;</h2>
                    Some of my home computer's wallpaper aren't "appropriate" for my work computer.&nbsp; Even though I turned off the "Personalize" setting under "Sync Your Settings" on both of my computers, it's still syncing the wallpaper.&nbsp; How do I turn that off?&nbsp; Plus I have
 dual monitors at home with a different resolution and it doesn't look good.

<h2>            Skype Contacts Deleted&#63;</h2>
                    So yesterday I set up a new Skype account, I had some issues adding my friends to my contacts but I managed to get it to work on my own. Now when I log on all of my previously accepted contacts are set to pending requests? They all accepted yesterday,
 and none of them removed me from contacts nor did I remove them from mine. Does anybody know a possible fix to this or some way to get this resolved that doesn't involve switching to another app? Some of my friends only have Skype and refused to download anything
 else for whatever reason, and since most of them are in different countries this is our only form of communication.

    <title>Windows 7 64-bit Upgrade stuck in a reboot loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nostalgic link  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 64-bit Upgrade stuck in a reboot loop</h2>
                    
<p>I successfully upgraded from Vista Home Premium 64-bit to W7 Home Premium 64-bit about 2 years ago. To cut a long story short... I could not install 1 security update from windows updates for an unknown reason for quite some time and after exhausting all
 known possibilities and following a 100 different trial and error steps with a microsoft employee I chanced on a repair/upgrade install to hopefully replace any lost files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The installation started ok and after several hours it completed the file transfer process and then came up with the following error:</p>
<p>"Windows could not parse or process the unattend answer file for pass [specialize].&nbsp; A component or non-list setting is specified more than once in the answer file."</p>
<p>I Clicked OK (which was the only choice)</p>
<p>A black screen appeared with a message in the bottom right advising "This copy of Windows is not genuine"&nbsp; Which is untrue!!&nbsp; Then it rebooted.&nbsp; Choices at reboot are Windows 7 or Rollback Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both lead to eventual automatic reboot.</p>
<p>How do I get out of this mess and hopefully restore my Windows 7?</p>
<p>PC is an ASUS G71G laptop which came with Vista Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; Originally upgraded to W7 with ASUS supplied windows 7 upgrade disk.</p>
<p>If I try to rollback - I get the error pop-up:</p>
<p>The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an exception error.&nbsp; Windows installation cannot proceed. To install windows click OK to restart the computer and restart the installation.</p>
<p>I click ok and it starts the loop again.</p>
<p>So far, I found another forum where a guy had the same problem, but apparently he got his answer. I followed the steps in the answered solution, but keep ending up with the reboot loop.</p>
<p>I first tried pressing F8 and then repair your computer... which loaded the starting windows screen then went black screen and then rebooted.</p>
<p>Then I tried booting from my W7 disc, chose my language, clicked next, then clicked repair windows. Next I chose the driver: Windows 7 (D:) to repair... then it gave me a list of choices:</p>
<p>1) Startup Repair (1 problem: see below list)</p>
<p>2) System Restore (...I've never made a system restore pnt)</p>
<p>3) System Image Recovery</p>
<p>4) Windows Memory Diagnostic (tried...no errors...restarted)</p>
<p>5) Command Prompt</p>
<p>.....................................................Shut Down / Restart</p>
<p>When I tried to fix any startup problems it says this:</p>
<p>"If you have recently attached a device to this computer, such as a camera or portable music player, remove it and restart your computer. If you continue to see this message, contact your system administrator or computer manufacture for assistance." Then
 there's a tab to see the details and the only problem looked like this:</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>System Disk = \Device\Harddisk0</p>
<p>Windows directory = D:\Windows</p>
<p>AutoChk Run = 0</p>
<p>Number of root causes = 1</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Once again, I have nothing attached to the computer so I don't know what it's talking about... the only thing I can think of it fighting against are some of the hardware features that came on the laptop that it can't find drivers to, such as the webcam built
 into the lid. I don't know... I was just following a microsoft employee's steps exactly as posted... and her last step was to use my windows 7 startup disc to repair it.</p>
<p>HALP PLEAZE!</p>
<p>I swear I won't complain about one lousy windows update not installing ever again! Just help me get my computer running again. Purdeh plz?!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello Nostalgic Link,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you connect the hard disk to a different computer a slave drive and perform CHKDSK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can follow the below steps connect the hard disk as secondary or slave hard disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Turn
 off the computer and unplug the power cord.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Remove
 the computer cover.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Locate
 the ribbon cable connected to the existing hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Change
 the master/slave designation of the second hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Connect
 the second hard drive to the second connector on the cable (colored strip should be closest to the power cable). If the cable does not have a second connector, replace it with one that does, or use a second ribbon cable to attach the second hard drive to the
 motherboard (if a second drive port is available).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Connect
 an available power cable to the hard drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Insert
 the hard drive into an available drive bay and secure with screws.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>h.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Replace
 the computer cover.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>i.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Start
 the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are also several tutorials on how to do this, you can find them using your favorite search Engine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you are not comfortable performing
 these steps, you can contact your computer manufacturer to help you better. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you set this as a slave drive, you can perform CHKDSK using the steps I have given above. Also note that in the above steps, Steps
 D is using Windows 7 installation to be repaired. I am sorry for the typo.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are still not able to boot to the computer, I suggest that you do a Clean installation on your computer. You can refer the below
 article that will give you information on ‘How to do a Clean installation’:</span></span></p>

            <p>Latest graphics drivers installed. Cloning my 144hz monitor to my capture card will cause all animations in windows to run at a lower refreshrate even though both windows and my monitor is telling me it's at 144hz. It's like windows lowers the animation
 fps to the lowest refreshrate on the clone.</p>
<p>I'm cloning my 144hz display onto a 60hz capture card. This was possible to do in Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 the exact same way. It's still possible to do this clone in windows 10 but everything is lagging instead.</p>
<p>To clarify; Monitor is reporting to run at 144hz, and capture card is reporting to run at 60hz
<em>(I've tried cloning to another 60hz display and it's the same issue).</em> Animations are stuttering, like moving windows across the screen. The same thing happens if I extend my desktop and drag a window so it's visible on both screens at the same time,
 like 50/50.</p>
<p>It's impossible to play games like this, which also means I can't use my capture card to capture footage with another computer to reduce fps drops.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Numlock on at start-up</h2>
                    I've seen answers to this question for previous versions of Windows, but what about 10?&nbsp; On start-up, the numlock is always off.&nbsp; Is there a way other than editing the registry to permanently turn on the numlock?

            <p>Hi Denis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>By default the NUM LOCK status is the same as it was in when you properly shut down the computer. If it was on when you shut it down it will be on when you again turn the computer on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also use the following steps to change the setting:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press Windows key + R, type <strong><em>regedit</em></strong>, click OK.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Move to HKEY_USERS\.Default\Control Panel\Keyboard. </span></span></li><li><span><span>Change the value for <strong><span>InitialKeyboardIndicators</span></strong> to
<strong>0</strong> to turn off the NUMLOCK at startup.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base:</p>

<p>Hi Luc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. If this is a paid Ark server, you will need to get with the developers Efecto studios or Virtual basement. As the purchase of the server is through them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Not enough memory, but one partition is nearly empty.  running Windows XP Home</h2>
                    My computer says there isn't enough memory available to perform print.&nbsp; When I tried to defragment, there isn't enough memory to perform that function, either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several years ago, a friend set up this (new then) computer with 2 partitions -- Disc C and
 Disc F.&nbsp; Everything I've done seems to be on Disc C.&nbsp; Now Disc C=935MB free of 19.52GB capacity, while F=56.62GB free of 56.79GB.&nbsp; How do I release the rest of the disk devoted to Disc F?&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few things there, and from reading "help" it seems they
 would be deleted if I deleted a partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; This computer is now my husband's, who uses it for email, playing Spider and occasional Google searches.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm no computer expert, so I'm hoping for a simple solution.

            <p>Marjorie</p>
<p>Your report reveals a number of issues. Your C&nbsp;partition only has 4% free disk space. You need to have a minimum of 15% but preferably 25% free disk space.</p>
<p>Normally&nbsp;the report would contain details of your MFT (Master File Table) but this information is not there. I have not encountered this situation&nbsp;before and at the present time I do not know it's significance. The MFT is a master index of all the files
 on your computer and their location, which enables the operating system to access any file needed to perform any given task.</p>
<p>The reference to the DC4.bak&nbsp;and similar files could be indicating a problem with your Recycle Bin. This is where deleted files are temporarily stored&nbsp;until the user decides to permanently delete the files.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;the Windows XP SP3 update installed? Right click
 on your My Computer icon and select Properties to see the details. There have been three SP updates and you may not have installed the latest updates.</p>
<p>Your version of AVG is out of date. You have version 8 and the current version is 10.</p>
<p>You are using Outlook Express and this is taking up considerable disk space. You can relocate the store folder to your F partition. This link explains how to do this:<br />
<a href="http://www.insideoe.com/files/store.htm#movestore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.insideoe.com/files/store.htm#movestore</a></p>
<p>You can&nbsp;increase free disk space by removing &nbsp;restore points, retaining the latest restore, using Disk CleanUp. Instructions on how to do this follow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Select Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools, Disk CleanUp to empty your Recycle Bin, remove Temporary Internet Files and other selected options. I also recommend you click on the More Options tab, System Restore and remove all but the latest
 System Restore point.</span></p>
<p>I shall be recommending you download and install cCleaner, which is a better utility than Disk CleanUp but this would best be done later.</p>
<p><span>You can create more free space in C by carrying out the measures suggested below.</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation to System Restore is 12% on your C partition which is over generous. I would reduce it to 700 mb. Right click your My Computer icon on the Desktop and select System Restore. Place the cursor on your C drive select Settings but
 this time find the slider and drag it to the left until it reads 700 mb and exit. When you get to the Settings screen click on Apply and OK and exit.</span></p>
<p><span>A default setting which could be wasteful is that for temporary internet files, especially if you do not store offline copies on disk. The default allocation is 3% of drive. Depending on your attitude to offline copies you could reduce this to 1% or
 2%. In Internet Explorer select Tools, Internet Options, General, Temporary Internet Files, Settings to make the change. At the same time look at the number of days history is held.</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation for the Recycle Bin is 10 % of drive. Change to 5%, which should be sufficient. In Windows Explorer place the cursor on your Recycle Bin, right click and select Properties, Global and move the slider from 10% to 5%. However,
 try to avoid letting it get too full as if it is full and you delete a file by mistake it will bypass the Recycle Bin and be gone for ever.</span></p>
<p>When you have carried out the above restart your computer&nbsp;and post a new Disk Defragmenter report together with the answers to the various questions I have asked.</p>

    <title>Transfer audio to bluetooth headset in windows7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hriket  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer audio to bluetooth headset in windows7</h2>
                    I have a bluetooth stereo headset. Its a cheap china made headset called skywing. I am able to pair it and use it with my cell phone. It used to work with my old dell laptop.<br />
I recently purchased a HP tx2z touchsmart laptop and now I installed windows 7 RC 64 bit edition.<br />
I tried to use the headset to use it with skype. Windows detects its installs the software and says the device isready for use. Also it shows a message saying that the device has been added to audio gateway. But there is no icon shown in the sound mixer. When
 I go to the bluetoot device properties. In audio tab the skywing shows up. there are two devices showm skying headset ( audi with mic ) and skying stereo ( audio only ). If if select stereo and click connect it does not connect. But if I click headset and
 click connect it gets connected.<br />
When I go back to skype setting or mixer the bluetooth headset is not shown.<br />
I do not know whats the problem<br />
I would appreciate any help. <br />
Thanks<br />

            I am having the exact same issue.&nbsp; Also with a Motorola HS850.&nbsp; I am unable to get Windows to recognize it as an audio device at all, though it does show up as a connected Bluetooth device.&nbsp; Services show on the device properties include Bluetooth Handsfree
 and Bluetooth Headset.<br />
<br />
EDITED: An update to the Broadcom Bluetooth drivers corrected the issue.<br />

    <title>Having trouble with setting up Local User IDs on my NEW Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roninrr2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having trouble with setting up Local User IDs on my NEW Windows 10 machine</h2>
                    <p>HELP, I AM IN REAL TROUBLE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old computer of several years died 3 days ago (total SSD hard drive failure) - I lost everything -- EXCEPT I "supposedly" have everything backed up on Carbonite, so we will see how that works out.&nbsp; Didn't have my stuff on OneDrive - wish I had, but that
 is another long story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have several problems (printers, workgroup, reload apps, etc.), but will start with the most pressing problem right now.&nbsp; The first download of my data from Carbonite failed (downloaded in form of a Zipfile, which Windows 10 won't/can't open, says
 invalid), but after talking to a Carbonite guy, he initiate some kind of direct download into my new machine and to be honest, it looks like it went pretty well.&nbsp; Some of the data that I spot checked seemed to be OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first App reinstall was Quicken.&nbsp; Went OK, and the data file is there and correct as far as I can tell (pretty sure about that).&nbsp; The next App install was of TurboTax - and then begins the problem.&nbsp; TurboTax could not find the 2017 TurboTax files.&nbsp; But
 the are there, I found them, under some strange Windows ID in C:&gt;Users&gt;rnsmi - something that Windows created while insisting that I log in with my MS Account ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the long history above, but my question revolves around setting up the local user IDs on my system.&nbsp; I spent well over an hour trying to create two local user ID, one with admin privileges and the other as just a standard user -- and I am still
 not sure I have it right, because my MS Accounts seem to also be used ID on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me tell you what I think I should do and see if you can help me.&nbsp; I am thinking of using the same user ID names that were used on my old system, which will never see the light of day again since it is dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old user IDs under Users (I only had 2) were bob and bobsu (not using my real names, but can still make my point)</p>
<p>The user IDs under Users on my new system (there is 3, not counting Default and Public) of rnsmi, rnsmi_mru9wy0, and bobsu.</p>
<p>(NOTABLE: in the Control Panel, User Accounts, I see standard user IDs of bobjonesloc, bobsu, and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** as the Admin ID)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the deal here - only the bobsu ID shows up under the C:&gt;Users&gt;folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently logged in as bobjonesloc, which I suppose is why TurboTax could mot find my 2017 TurboTax files, they are in the C:&gt;Users&gt;rnsmi&gt;documents folder. &nbsp; [I didn't mention this earlier, but since Carbonite had all my data files, like documents,
 saved under the old used ID of bob, and there was not a user ID of bob in my new system, all of my old data was restored under the rnsmi user ID.] &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can I just go to the C:&gt;Users and just rename things to the way I want - it isn't that simple is it.&nbsp; Can I also make one of the standard users the admin user and then just delete the MS Account ID (currently the admin account).&nbsp; Why do I want or need
 anything in my system (it is just me) other than 2 user ID, a standard user and an admin user.&nbsp; I never log into Windows as the admin user, and only use it when necessary to do the admin stuff that Windows requires.&nbsp; So can someone help me out here.&nbsp; Is this
 a difficult thing to fix and is there a reason I can't just go back to a simple 2 user accounts on my new Windows 10 system</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use a local account on your Windows 10 computer but you will not be able to rename the folders located in C:&gt;Users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For steps on how to switch your Windows 10 Microsoft account to a local account, you can refer to the article on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027068/windows-switch-your-windows-10-device-to-a-local-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions, let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Rhina-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading my long initial post, but the link you gave me does not solve my problem.&nbsp; Let me try this again with a shorter explanation of the problem/question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 IDs I can sign into Windows 10 with:</p>
<p>bobstd - local standard account (I renamed bobjonesloc detailed in original post)</p>
<p>bobsu&nbsp; - local admin account</p>
<p>Bob Jones - an admin account based on my MS Account ID (I guess)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 users in User accounts (the User Accounts icon in the Control Panel)</p>
<p>bobstd - Local Account</p>
<p>bobsu&nbsp; - Local Account - Administrator</p>
<p>Bob Jones - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 user accounts under C:&gt;Users (not counting the Default and Public defaults)</p>
<p>bobsu - which I assume belongs or is associated with the bobsu logins</p>
<p>bobjo - which I assume belongs or is associated with the MS Bob Jones ID</p>
<p>bobjo_mru9wy0 - have no idea what this is or where it came from</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I am trying to do is resolve this mess.&nbsp; I guess I am an old-school guy that has yet to understand the need for my MS Account ID to be involved in this.&nbsp; My old system just had 2 user IDs, a standard user and an admin user.&nbsp; Why do I need more than
 that.&nbsp; How do I get back to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried it yet (because I don't want to screw things up farther), but it seems that it may not be as simple as renaming the user ID folders under C:&gt;Users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is my next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, OK, sorry - one last complication.&nbsp; All of my user data (documents, etc.) restored from Carbonite was placed under/in the bobjo folder under C:&gt;Users (the user ID I "think" is associated with my MS Account) -- and I assume that is why TurboTax cannot
 find my 2017 tax files when I log into windows as bobstd, because the files I need are in Documents under the bobjo user ID.&nbsp; For safety and backup, I tried copying the entire bobjo folder to a large USB drive, but for a lot of various reasons that I don't
 understand, the copy and paste would not copy a lot of the files (only copied 15,000 out of 25,000).&nbsp; So, how do I fix that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            I have javascript installed and it works for everything else that needs it. &nbsp;My skype suddenly quit working right after my phone number subscription expired. &nbsp;I still have the paid subscription until the end of the year - but have been unable to use it.

            I just went through "What is my browser" to check if my javascript was turned on ok and in both Chrome and IE 9, they both said it was on and working - then I restarted Skype and I got the same window in the middle saying that javascript isn't enabled....so
 back to square 1 I guess.

<h2>            Asus T100 transformer tablet running Windows 8.1 - startup issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue where if I restart the tablet it gets stuck between shutting down and starting up leaving me with a black screen. I usually then have to soft reset it by holding the power button down for 10 seconds after which it starts up as normal.
 It sometimes does this after a regular shut down or even sometimes after it's just been asleep. I have done several factory resets slowly installing windows updates, programs, everything I can think of to no avail. This is the third tablet (2 replacements)
 so I'm thinking it's not a hardware issue. Asus don't think it's a known problem and I've trawled the net but I haven't found many others having this issue. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi everyone,
<div><br />
<div>I have faced the same problem. But yesterday I tried to update Bios to last version (216) from&nbsp;http://support.asus.com.tw/. Asus Live Update in my T100 dosn't show this update, it is necessary to download it from web pages.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After Bios update everything looks OK, no problems after reboot or sleep.</div>

            I followed your advice Ronnie, but It's still doin the auto response when then cursor lingers on whatever button it's touching. Especially when I have an Internet Explorer window open.&nbsp;
