    <title>Can I more frequently synchronize the internet time on Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous_asdfjkl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I more frequently synchronize the internet time on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I can't find anything that lets you synchronize your time more than once a week. My HP laptop is somehow accelerating the clock, so it very quickly goes 10 minutes fast, even after I've just synchronized it with internet time.<br />
<br />
This is very annoying because I will freak out when I see the clock and think I'm late for something when I'm not.<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            F1 2011 Race Night </h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone fancy a race tonight say around 21.30-22.00 hrs</p>
<p>On a track to be decided by the racers with Qualifying and say 20 percent race with full damage on.</p>
<p>Throw your name down if your up for it and which 3 tracks you would prefer to race at and hopefully get enough for a good fun race.</p>
<p>Track with most votes will be 1st and if theres enough time and interest may even run a 2nd race based on the 2nd most popular choice</p>
<p>I will personally vote for Monza Melbourne and Hungary</p>

<p>We're still in the process of considering so it isn't likely to start too soon, especially as we normally have a reasonable time with sign ups being open so noone misses out.<br />
<br />
I know there's a few guys who are already members over there who are at least potentially keen but if Boas doesn't do it soon I'll go chuck a thread up over there and start gauging interest and see people's thoughts on everything; obviously with the fact that
 you need a reasonable chunk of time with everyone on it will be a little harder to organise than our regular fifa leagues.<br />
<br />
Also, on topic, I'll probably be up for a race or two tonight.</p>

</p><p>3. Every time it wakes up from sleep will not reconnect to my home WiFi, despite that being my repeatedly selected setting.&nbsp;Unlike the MacBook Pro, 3 Android phones, Kindle, 2 ps4's, Samsung TV, 4 iPads, 2 old windows laptops we have in the house.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Even when I try to connect manually, the complaint is, cannot connect to this WiFi network&nbsp;until I wait about 10 minutes. 10 minutes before I can start working! What's the point of fast start up of I have to wait 10 minutes? In this day and age? Really?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Worst of all cannot update apps from windows store. Updates failed continuously now after multiple restarts. So for example&nbsp;Netflix cannot work cos it needs an update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. All new installs from the windows store failed as well, except for Facebook which limped through very slowly and finally managed to get through.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Filled with stupid design choices, for example I can't get to see my desktop and carefully chosen wallpaper ever again in tablet mode, which is the most practical mode to work with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Text cursor handles so tiny when you drag them you can't see where you are dropping them. Autocorrect is inconsistent, chooses when it works and when not. Frequently&nbsp;have to go back and manually&nbsp;apply corrections to incorrectly typed words. Even though
 the setting is for the keyboard app to do it automatically. Most mobile devices get this right cos text entry is the basics. So what's going on with Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No focused inbox on the mail app so I have to mow through 200 emails to get to anything useful. Meaning mail is unusable, meaning I will not use it on this device. But there's a focused inbox on the free outlook app on my android phone. Tapping on a news
 article on the windows menu will open the app but not that article&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Too many clicks to get anything done. For example Cortana talks well and hears well, but you need two taps to get to the active voice question prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Too many crashes and bugs to count. One Skype setup step failed because it wouldn't accept my phone number. Which was a Skype number I purchased from Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. My first Skype call to a family member with the new laptop, the video button did not work so they could not see me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. Then it came back halfway through the call, but then video kept going on and off, theirs and mine</p>
<p>
</p><p>13. Watching videos on the news app, no fullscreen option so I have to see the Microsoft app icons and bars surrounding everything I watch. Have these design guys ever used a proper tablet OS before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>14. Behind the reasonable user interface are the old dissonant windows settings menus, completely at variance with the glossy windows 10 "cover", and not making much sense at all&nbsp;in the context of a convertible tablet/laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>15. During initial setup, a bunch of useless messages like "we're glad you're here", without any indication it was loading something or working in the background, or how long it would take to complete the spaced out message phase</p>
<p>
</p><p>16. During text entry, the spelling error red underline sometimes shows up without cause and continues till the end of a sentence
</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. Most painful of all I requested a verification code from Microsoft and they sent me a text message in Hausa! Hausa is not the national language in Nigeria! It is one of maybe 500 languages&nbsp;spoken in this nation of a 150 million people!&nbsp;Its not even commonly
 spoken in the part of the country I am in right now! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if it was, I don't understand it, and I&nbsp;specified English in my setup, as that's the national language, and more importantly happens to be the&nbsp;only language I speak well or understand! I don't understand the setup&nbsp;text message I was sent! You have no
 idea how many people you will offend and alienate doing inane&nbsp;stuff like this Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>18. Long pressing on text brings up the option to inspect element. What does that do for me? what happened to the basics like placing the cursor, or selecting the word I pressed on,&nbsp;cut, copy and paste? Why does the keyboard give me a UK layout, even though
 I selected us layout at start up? Why doesn't the soft keyboard consistently auto capitalize after all terminal punctuations?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't the onscreen keyboard consistently show up when I tap in a text entry box? Why can't I still update or install any applications?! How was windows 10 even released? Was there no testing? Why did I spend a bunch of my money on such&nbsp;a bad product?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why are device manufacturers still using MS OS's when there are viable, quality alternatives? How is it possible in 2016 to have this bad an experience with a brand new computing or mobile device, you are sending a 19 point complaint post to technical support
 or a user community the day after unboxing? I have never even posted stuff in a community like this before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>19. I see now that I have been pampered by Macs, android, ios, kindles, all sorts of device interfaces.&nbsp;Hard to say this because I am so irritated with MS right now, but I've been pampered even&nbsp;by previous versions of windows. Windows 10 has brought me crashing
 back down to earth. Worst experience I have ever had with a new OS or new device, bar none.

            <p>There is obviously no reason to expend the time reading your long post. HP is responsible for supporting the device, call them and ask them how to use the device you have purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only questions are; Why would anyone that has already purchased a "MacBook Pro", "2 ps4's", a "Samsung TV" and "4 iPads" even consider buying such a low end device? You do not expect it to perform well or do much, do you? Or, are you just kidding about
 the previous purchases?</p>

            Well it wasn't hugely expensive, but probably between $700 and $800 shipping included. I did have expectations it would work, not necessarily outshine all the other stuff. I occasionally need windows for work stuff, my wife as well and our old laptops
 were not doing so well.

            Not kidding about the other stuff. PS4 1TB downstairs, PS4 500GB upstairs, Apple TV downstairs, old Apple TV upstairs. Samsung TV downstairs, Samsung TV no wifi upstairs, ipad air 1 &amp; 2, 2 older ipads not figured out what to do with yet, two galaxy note
 5's, another Samsung phone cant remember what model. 2 old HP laptops, 1 MacBook pro, 1 Kindle. May sound like a lot but when you think about it, probably similar to a&nbsp;lot of households when you've got enough people.&nbsp;None with any issues connecting to, or
 downloading stuff from wifi.

            <p>Interesting, you are paying "between $700 and $800" for something that I can pick up for around $200 to $400. There is something wrong with this picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to do some clarification here. The HP Pavilion x2 Detachable has been available for several years with a 10" screen, Atom processor, 2GB RAM and 32/64GB storage. These are available for around $200, the specs and tested usability are on par
 with a mid range phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just spoke to someone from our testing labs and was told that they have a new model (same name) with a 12" screen, Core M processor, 4GB RAM and 128GB storage. These are available for around $400, the specs and tested usability are on the upper end of&nbsp;the
 budget laptop market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail, it seems these things come with the Home Edition of Windows 10. Certainly, they are not meant for any 'work' product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have something different, please let us know. Nothing I have seen brings this purchase anywhere near the other items you list. Your change in shopping habits may not have treated you well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact remains, you need to call HP support. They are responsible for the product. Complaining in a peer to peer support forum gains you nothing.</p>

            Don't know what kind of processor, 4gb ram, 12" model and not from hp direct. I live in Nigeria so like I mentioned with shipping&nbsp;and a few accessories 700 to 800. Ive never seen even the 2gb 10" for $200 even from hp though so not sure which model to
 which you're referring. Maybe a used one.

            <p>Thanks for the reply but I can't make a new account with an admin rights i don't know why, I tried making a new account(Microsoft Account) and change it's account type but it didn't work. My laptop start to have so many problems when I changed the Guest
 account's account type, I also tried upgrading my Laptop to Windows 8.1 but also not working and has something to do with the Admin rights, I tried using the Guest Account to upgrade but nothing happened still the message appears "You need to use an account
 with Administrator privileges to install Windows 8.1, try logging in with the user account of an administrator of this PC and trying the update again"</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Home User Account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daysunwon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home User Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. I have been&nbsp;having this issue that doesn't seem to be going away. Let's say that I wanted to save a document that I have written. I click on the "save as" button and choose &nbsp;"document folder".
 I then receive an error saying :</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Users\Daysun\Domcuments\test.odt</p>
<p>&nbsp;You don't have permission to save in this location.</p>
<p>Contact the administrator to obtain permission</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you like to save in the Documents folder instead?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then click yes, and I receive the same message. So, I right click on the "documents" folder inside of File Explorer, click on properties,&nbsp;and click&nbsp;on the&nbsp;security tab. I see&nbsp;under "Group or user names:", "HomeUsers(Computer's user name\HomeUsers), and
 &nbsp;(Administrators(computer's username\Administrators)".&nbsp;I only have one&nbsp;account on my computer, and that is the administrators. I have even checked inside of Control Panel for another account. So, since I don't have another account listed I proceed to remove
 "HomeUsers"&nbsp;from the "security" tab by pressing the "edit" button. Once it was removed, I could save files in that folder. (I had to do that same process to all of my files in order to move/save/delete files) I thought that that would be the end of it, but
 the "HomeUser" account&nbsp;returned once I turned my computer off and on.&nbsp; If anyone has any idea on what&nbsp;is causing it, and how to fix it, please let me know. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have a solution that will work on a folder by folder basis. Right click on the folder that is giving the error message, select Properties, then the Security tab. Highlight the HomeUsers group and select Full Control. That will stop the error message for
 that folder. </p>

            Actually, I've been doing this and it works, up until the point where I turn off (shut down) my computer. When I turn it back on, those properties change and return to their previous settings; the HomeUsers group returns to not being Full Control. Basically,
 every time I shut down my computer and turn it on the next day, I have to turn all my folders back to Full Control. Every single time, every day...

            <p>I found a workaround that will keep on re-boot. For some reason some Windows 10 upgrades do not add the correct user in the security permissions. You will need to add your login name to the security user list.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click on the Picture, Document, or any other folder that denies permission to save the file.</li><li>Select Properties.</li><li>Select the Security tab.</li><li>Advanced</li><li>Add</li><li>Click on Select a Principal at the top.</li><li>Object type is User, Group....</li><li>From this location: Your PC-NAME</li><li>Enter the object name to select: Type in the name you use to login</li><li>Give yourself Full control.</li><li>OK out.</li></ol>
<p>Hopefully this will work for you too!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the above, updated driver for the Network card and yet the problem is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i mention earlier it connect fine if i connect with directly to the modem router, it just doesn't connect when i use the gigabit switch. when&nbsp; connect to the gigabit switch the lan icon disappeared, i have to connect through wifi and when i run the troubleshooter
 i get this error message: "An ethernet cable is not properly plugged in or might be broken" but that same cable works fine if comp connect to the modem router directly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I just ran network troubleshooter again and this time round i get this report:</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>After trying to expand the only gigabit port of my technicolor modem router by using the d-link switch failed i then grab the d-link dsl-2770l gigabit modem router to make use of all the gigabit ports provided by the modem instead and of coure the asus still
 failed to recognise the ethernet connection (error: cable in unplugged).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So strange both modem router is gigabit (well the D-link ethernet ports are all gigabit whereas only Technicolor only has 1 Gigabit port (GbE)&nbsp; but that is the port I have been connecting the K52F to) but only the one on techincolor modem worked with my
 laptop NIC</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After many searches on google some one suggest changing the speed &amp; duplex of the adapter so i give that ago and this what i found:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Asus reconnect to the Technicolor modem via the gigaport (GbE) on the modem, on the Laptop I went to: Control Panel, Network and Internet, Network connections, Local Area Connection (the ethernet card), change settings of this connection, Configure,
 ADVANCED, Speed &amp; Duplex, and changed from:</p>
<p>AUTO NEGOTIATION to: 10Mbps/Full Duplex - WORKED ! and then</p>
<p>100Mbps/Full Duplex - WORKED ! then</p>
<p>1 Gbps/ Full Duplex - WORKED</p>
<p>I then went to: Control Panel, Network and Internet, Network connection, Status, speed is 1Gbps, went to Task manager, Performance, Ethernet the throughput shown is 100 Kbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connect to the new d-link gigabit modem router, changed from:</p>
<p>AUTO NEGOTIATION to: 10Mbps/Full Duplex - WORKED ! and then </p>
<p>100Mbps/Full Duplex - WORKED ! then 1 Gbps/ Full Duplex - nothing, and back to</p>
<p>Auto Negotiation - NO CONNECTION</p>
<p>1 Gbps/ Full Duplex - NO CONNECTION</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to 100Mbps/Full Duplex, I then went to: Control Panel, Network and Internet, Network connection, Status, speed is 100Mbps, went to Task manager, Performance, Ethernet the throughput shown is also 100 Kbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both speed 100Mbps and 1Gbps give the same through put, 100Kbps so that 100Kbps through put is my internet connection and not data transferring speed between computers on the next work hence no differ whether adapter speed is set at 1Gbps/100Mbps/10Mbps?????<br />
</p>
<p><strong>The latest driver available for this adapter is dated back to 2012 so perhaps the driver is so old that it isn't compatible with more update gigabit provided by more modern hardware like one use in the D-Link, worked for the Technicolor because it
 uses older hardware?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume the K52F is not compatible with gigabit modem router/switch so data transfer between all computers on my network will never be able to connect to the K52F at gigabit speed, 100Mbps max :(</p>

<h2>            Service Host&#58; Local System &#40;network restricted&#41; WLAN Autoconfig eats CPU</h2>
                    <p>My surface book runs windows 10, i7, 8 GB ram. Recently the process 'service host local system (network restricted)' consumes 30% of the CPU if the WiFi is turned on. And my computer gets very hot. Sometimes the WiFi gets disconnected itself. I later found
 if I stop the 'WLAN AutoConfig' service in the service host thing, it stops eating the CPU, but the WiFi gets switched at the same time. I've try everything online sfc scannow, clean boot and so on, but nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any idea how to fix it? It also drains the battery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

<h2>            Activating Windows 10, Invalid Key &#40;Error Code&#58; 0xC004C003&#41;</h2>
                    I was gifted a Cyberpower gaming computer about a week ago, that was suppose to be Windows ready. After looking everywhere, I decided to contact Cyberpower for my missing key. They gave me my key, but after I punched it in, my computer told me it was an
 invalid key. They practically gave up after that and told me to contact Microsoft.

<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a>

<br />Does that utility find the correct Product Key for your Windows?

            Hi CaitlynStein,
<br />
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you !!
<br />How you doing today?
<br />
<br />You can follow the following steps:
<br />1. Click on Start and then right click on Computer, there select the option Properties.
<br />2. At the bottom of the screen click on the option Change product key, there follow the steps of the wizard and re-enter the product key that you find on the label attached to your computer. Once you finish this process, verify that Windows has been correctly activated.
<br />If the problem persists, perform this other method:
<br />1. Click on Start and in the search box digita slui 11 and press enter.
<br />2. There you must select your geographical location and then press Enter.
<br />3. Follow the process of the activation wizard and when required, enter again the Windows key that comes on the label that is attached to your computer.
<br />4. Once you finish the process, verify that Windows has been correctly activated.
<br />If the system still indicates that Windows is not correctly activated, follow these steps:
<br />1. Click on Start and in the CMD digit search box, in the list of options of the start menu, right click on cmd.exe and select the option Run as administrator.
<br />2. On the command line, type the following commands, after each press enter. If an informational message appears after each command, click on OK and continue with the other command. These commands perform an alternate process to those previously done in order to activate your Windows.
<br />&nbsp;
<br />Slmgr -rearm
<br />Slmgr -ipk XXXXX- XXXXX- XXXXX- XXXXX- XXXXX (here you must type the product key)
<br />Slmgr -ato
<br />&nbsp;
<br />3. Once you finish executing the commands, verify that the problem has been solved.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I hope it helps you

<p>Thanks Azzurra, but this is not relevant to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out the link you provided, the latest version you refer to is for a Skype client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to call using Skype from an Alexa Echo device to a landline.&nbsp; There is no Skype client installed in this scenario.&nbsp; The only Skype component is the Skype skill on Alexa.&nbsp; This is a cloud hosted service operated by Microsoft.&nbsp; I have no ability

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />Try launching Minecraft again.

            Hi Donald.   
<br /> I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?  Turn it off.
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<p>Hello Donald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error seems to be caused by HP Client Security/Device Access Manager blocking access to USB/external devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further researching, <em>"HP Device Access Manager allows an administrator to restrict and manage access to hardware. Device Access Manager can be used to block unauthorized access to USB flash drives where data could be copied. It can also restrict
 access to CD/DVD drives, control of USB devices, network connections, and so on."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I'd recommend performing the steps below to enable access to your external flash drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click or tap on <em><strong>Start</strong></em>, search for <em><strong>HP Client Security</strong></em>.</p>
<p>2. Under <em><strong>Device</strong></em>, click or tap <em><strong>Device Permissions.</strong></em></p>
<p>3. In the <em><strong>Device Class</strong></em>, make sure to set the access to
<em><strong>Allow-Full Access.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try checking the Drive Security and see if your external drives are restricted:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/456beceb-7cfc-4c64-8756-9d4e28dc9c32?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/456beceb-7cfc-4c64-8756-9d4e28dc9c32?upload=true" height="374" width="747" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong>: </em><em>"Standard user can view their current device access. Administrators can view and make changes to the device access that is currently configure for the computer by clicking or tapping Change, and then entering the Administrator
 password."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also recommend checking this <strong><a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c04597082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>to learn more about using the HP Client Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try accessing Device Manager again.
<br />
<br />If the problem persists...
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />

<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

<h2>            Copying a specific folder, I get an &#34;Out of Memory&#34; error, but not when copying the folder&#39;s files individually.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>When copying a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">specific </span>folder between drives or to another drive, I get an "Out of Memory" error near the end of the copy operation.&nbsp; The problem is reported as file "pr_data" is causing the issue.&nbsp; Unless
 "pr_data" is used by the software internally when moving data, it doesn't make sense because there is no file by that name in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "Out of Memory" issue involves copying a specific folder between drives as a folder.&nbsp; But there is NO problem when copying the folder's files individually to or into a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The size of the folder should not be an issue because I have successfully copied larger folders with larger files within the folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 64-bit, version 1803.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, whether the "Hide folder-merge conflicts" option is checked or not does not affect the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how to avoid the issue, but I would like to hear thoughts on why this happens.</p>

    <title>Microsoft tech support agent I called wanted money to do &#34;virus - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft tech support agent I called wanted money to do &#34;virus scan&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased my laptop at the Microsoft online store and after less than a week of use, it started blue-screening so frequently that it was impossible to use. So I called Microsoft tech support at the number on the little pamphlet that came with the laptop
 - 1-877-696-7786.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The agent I spoke to wanted to connect to my computer remotely, but because of it constantly blue-screening, this was impossible, and the F8 during start-up thing wasn't working either. Then she started asking me if I had installed an anti-virus program
 and I said not yet, because the little pamphlet that came with the laptop said my computer was protected with Microsoft Defender (exact words on pamphlet: "It's Protected. Your new PC comes with Defender, Microsoft's security and anti-malware software, built
 into Windows with free updates and no annual charges") and since it was only a few days old, I figured it would be okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, then she went into a whole speech about how it could be a virus causing the problem and in order to rule that out, she would have to do a virus scan on my computer which would only cost me $99, or $149 for a full year of "coverage".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was pretty shocking so I asked her, are you telling me you can't help me any further unless I do a virus scan on my computer? She confirmed this was the case. So that was the end of that call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this happen before? It sounds a lot like the scam where "Microsoft" calls you. Or is it standard Microsoft practice now to charge customers money to provide support on brand new purchases? According to the literature that came with my
 laptop, I get "Signature Support" for free for the first 90 days. I would have thought my issue would have been covered by this.</p>

            <p>Well, if you called the quoted number...&nbsp; That's legitimate:<br />

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>However - what I suggest is telling us more about this "laptop" you purchased off the Microsoft store (the model, etc.) and then we can go from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>You probably just need to update hardware device drivers and do a few free antivirus/malware scans and a little other cleanup to get things fixed up - but not knowing the make and model of the system limits any advice to general...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>

<p>Removing <em><strong>everything</strong></em> they find.&nbsp; Restarting when needed. (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
Uninstall all Internet Plugins (Real Player, QuickTime, Adobe Flash Player, Adobe Shockwave Player, Adobe Air, Microsoft Silverlight, K-lite codec pack, etc.) from your computer.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Restart.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the detailed reply! Actually, I already fixed it. Eventually I was able to reach the F8 menu and from there I was able to do a system reset, and my laptop is running fine since.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No idea - you aren't speaking to Microsoft or likely anyone intimate with their policies and what is covered under said 'support'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had to guess, they support issues with the product itself.&nbsp; Scanning for viruses and general maintenance of the system like that would likely fall under services, not support.&nbsp; Fine line, I know.&nbsp; Similar to purchasing a vehicle.&nbsp; Unless specified -
 you are responsible for putting the fuel in, changing the oil and keeping the other fluids in-check, keeping the vehicle clean, changing the windshield wipers and so on; even with a brand new vehicle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly - blue-screens do not indicate viruses to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still curious as to the make &amp; model of the system...?&nbsp; The reason I ask is because if it is not a Surface (of some edition) you probably should visit the ACTUAL manufacturer's web page (support) and get the latest device drivers downloaded and installed
 as part of the proper maintenance of the system.</p>

            <p>Blue-screens don't indicate viruses to me either, which is why I was pretty skeptical of this offer to "scan" my brand new machine...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it's an ASUS UX31LA. Thanks for the tip on the drivers, I think this model is a little older so that makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't think I'll ever call Microsoft tech support again. I thought I'd try it out, since it's free and was advertised so prominently with the purchase, but it's pretty much useless. The second time I called, they spent over an hour messing
 around on my machine, weren't able to fix it, and then scheduled a "call back" for the next day which, of course, never happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help provided on here seems way more competent - but it seems almost unjust that (as far as I can tell) many of the people providing good quality help here are not being compensated by Microsoft in any way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Smart business model: make your customer support so terrible that your customers have no choice but to get together and help each other - at no cost to you of course.</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
Since you have a Windows&nbsp;Vista installation disc, you need to restart (reboot) your computer using the installation disc. If you do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.

            Yes I have the recovery disc set, but my computer still isnt recognizing it. At first it acts like it is, but then just goes to the error screen.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Ok after leaving it scanning all night I had to do a hard shut down to turn off. After powering back up I pressed F8 and it gave me the start up options. I first tried Last known Good configuration. This did not work. So rebooted and clicked on it to start
 in Safe Mode. This started loading Windows System 32 driver files. But has stalled at \windows\system32\drivers\disk.sys. At the bottom of screen it is telling me to please wait. But I can tell nothing is happening. It's been approx. 30 minutes at this point.
 Any suggestions?
        </p>
