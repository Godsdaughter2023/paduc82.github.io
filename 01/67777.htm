<h2>            Restore the Properties and Personal Information that was Removed on an AVI file.</h2>
                    I created a file on a Flash Card Recorder using a Sony camera (AVI file) and actually used two recorders, two cameras so two flash cards of clips. &nbsp;Each recorder assigns the Clip Name such as CLIP0100, CLIP0200. &nbsp;When trying to save to a backup file, I,
 unfortunately, tried to change the name on the Card with Windows Explorer - right click and rename. &nbsp;I changed the name and as was about to save, my cell rang and answered it and accidentaly hit the Remove Properties and Personal Information link right above
 the OK (Save). &nbsp;The 1.6 Gig file is still there but now not recognizable by Adobe Premiere, Quicktime, or Microsoft Media. &nbsp;Is there a way to save that Clip and, in effect, restore that information so I can import and use in Adobe Premiere?

            Hi<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting in Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
This question are already discussed in one another thread,,kindly you should search the answer before posting for less spam and unless thread or pages,,However this issue will happen while display is not matching to bios version of dell which currently you
 are running<br />
<br />
Have you got any nvidia graphics card from Dell..or it is happening for Intel on-board graphics<br />
Have you tried for updation of graphics driver from dell support site<br />
Have to tried to update your bios <br />
<br />
<p>This error can happen because of an outdated video driver, to many programs running at one time or even high CPU activity. There is a link to a KB article on the following post that gives more info on the issue and helps to fix it, see:</p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2665946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2665946</a><br />
<br />
Or call to dell support for installation of latest driver or bios<br />

            Hi jfmclaugh, try resetting your PC from the Windows Recovery Environment, maybe the other options will not be grayed out
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key whilst clicking Restart - this will boot your system into the Windows Recovery Environment
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />
<br />See if the other options are available to you . . .

            Don't use the Refresh Tool.
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />, select the Device performance &amp; health tab then click Additional info.
<br />Click Get Started then read the description.
<br />
<br />Users should note, desktop apps will be removed by Fresh Start, so make sure you have all application discs, product keys and serial numbers nearby. Examples of desktop apps include Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator), Quickbooks and Quicken. Also, some hardware drivers might be affected, so have your device drivers near by. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Fresh Start runs a scan and determine which apps will be removed.
<br />
<br />In my case, Fresh Start indicates I will need to reinstall Microsoft Office.
<br />
<br />When you are ready, click Start to begin. If not, click Cancel, your installation will not be modified.

<br />
<br />If you are looking for an easy way to perform clean install in Windows 10, starting with the Anniversary Update, the Refresh Tool will help you do just that. Unlike the Reset feature in previous revisions of Windows 10, the Refresh Tool is a bit more automated and easy to use. The application removes personal files, apps, bundled OEM software, and drivers. The most interesting and welcome part of the Refresh Tool is; it installs the most recent build of Windows 10. This means you won’t have to worry about reinstalling Updates or downloading the latest version from Windows Update after setup is complete.
<br />Clean Install Windows 10 Using Fresh Start
<br />
<br />To use the Refresh Tool, your computer must be connected to the Internet throughout the entire process. Your computer must also be running the Windows 10 Anniversary Update or later. It does not work on prior versions of Windows 10 or earlier. To begin, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery then click the link, Learn how to start fresh with a clean installation of Windows.
<br />
<br />Scroll down then click Download tool now.
<br />
<br />After downloading, double-click RefreshTool.exe .
<br />
<br />Refresh tool setup
<br />
<br />Accept the Windows End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Refresh tool
<br />
<br />Choose the type of installation you would like to perform. Please remember, this tool does not give you the option to rollback or perform any type of recovery. Ensure you have your hardware drivers, application discs and setup files available for reinstallation.
<br />
<br />Then you have two options:
<br />
<br />    Keep personal files only: Your applications, drivers, and settings will be deleted. personal files will be kept.
<br />    Keep nothing: Everything in addition to your personal files will be deleted.
<br />
<br />Refresh Tool 3
<br />
<br />After selecting the option you want, click Install to begin. The Refresh Tool will download Windows setup files, then reboot into the setup. This will take some time but will vary depending on the speed of your Internet connection. You have the option to cancel the install before the Refresh tool restarts your computer.
<br />

<br />Using Fresh Start in Windows 10 Creators Update
<br />
<br />In the Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft moved the Refresh Tool from Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery to new Windows Defender Security Center app. Refresh Tool is now called Fresh Start and works pretty much same. Start Fresh works offline too, but if you have an active Internet connection, it will download and install the latest version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />To begin, launch Windows Defender Security Center, select the Device performance &amp; health tab then click Additional info.
<br />
<br />Click Get Started then read the description.
<br />
<br />Users should note, desktop apps will be removed by Fresh Start, so make sure you have all application discs, product keys and serial numbers nearby. Examples of desktop apps include Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint), Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator), Quickbooks and Quicken.

<br />
<br />Wait while Fresh Start runs a scan and determine which apps will be removed.
<br />
<br />In my case, Fresh Start indicates I will need to reinstall Microsoft Office.
<br />
<br />When you are ready, click Start to begin. If not, click Cancel, your installation will not be modified.
<br />
<br />The process might take sometime, so, sit back, relax while the process takes place.

    <title>Language Missing From Windows 10 Sign In Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle badger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language Missing From Windows 10 Sign In Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Arabic as a language on my PC for a few years, and have been using a Local Administrator account with a password that is in Arabic on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the Control-Shift Language switch Shortcut because it was irritating, and so I didn't encounter language changes while playing some games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of this (I presume) Arabic has disappeared from the list of languages I can access with the Windows-Space shortcut on the Login Screen, so I cannot log into my Computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to boot into Safe Mode, but it requires my user password as well, which I can't access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get into the Admin Command prompt through the Troubleshooting in Recovery Boot Menu, because it allows me to change the language for my user authentication there. However, I cannot select the Net User Administrator account even after it has
 been enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried making a password reset USB and I get an error when I try to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do, if I can change the languages available, enable the language through CMD, or forcibly change the user password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like some guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,<br />
Kyle</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 2 Overheating in Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>I was running Photoshop on my Surface Book 2 in Tablet mode with a stylus.&nbsp; The computer began to overheat and there was a lag in the program and then the program crashed. A couple of times.&nbsp; I was not running anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only had this computer for a couple of weeks and this is the first time I was using this program and experienced this problem.&nbsp; As soon as I turned the screen around or reattached it the battery cooled.&nbsp; If I can't use the tablet mode with the stylus

            You need to use the Nvidia processor for Photoshop. Assuming you have a Surface version with it. You can use Studio Mode like a (heavy) tablet.

<p>You will probably have to select the Nvidia processor manually. Right click on your desktop / select Nvidia Control Panel and select the programs you want to run with the Nvidia processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also manually run windows update to be sure you're up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also use the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit.&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit</p>

<h2>            NextBook 8 Windows 10 install wont turn on</h2>
                    <p>So my girlfriend just gave me her NextBook 8 running windows 8.1 I wanted to put windows 10 on it so I did.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After going through the whole installation process and logging into my account on the tablet it gets to the "Hi" screen I walk away come back a few mins later the tablet is off so I tried turning it on wasn't working at all. So I plug it in to charge with
 the red light coming on so I assumed it died on me I let it charge for a few mins. Come back and it still wont turn on. I've also tried taking the battery out waiting a min and plugging it back in not working. I even tried all combinations of power button
 and other buttons. Anyway I'm out of ideas I'm usually very tech savvy and know the in's and out's of troubleshooting anything but I don't know what to do. Please any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update KB4078408 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stofferan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update KB4078408</h2>
                    <p>Our phone system is on a closed network; however, for the past couple of weeks I had to connect a supervisor's laptop to a WiFi router so our phone company could install some patches.&nbsp; I left the laptop connected to the WiFi even when we were not working
 on the system since the laptop was not at the time connected to our phone system.&nbsp; There is only one program we use that laptop for and after some recent Microsoft updates, now that program will not connect to our phone system.&nbsp; We can ping the phone server
 and we tried removing and installing that program over again but it still will not connect to the phone server.&nbsp; Originally, we thought it was the computer so I pulled a laptop from another supervisor and connected it to the WiFi so we could continue with
 the patches.&nbsp; I left that computer connected to the WiFi overnight.&nbsp; The next day, I was not able to connect to the phone server.&nbsp; This time I was able to isolate the issue to the Window's update because that was the only thing that happened overnight.&nbsp; I
 was able to uninstall all but this one update (KB4078408).&nbsp; I know this update is the problem because I was able to connect to the phone server before I left that night and the next day I was not able to.&nbsp; I have only one working laptop left and that is because
 that laptop has not downloaded any updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing this update using:&nbsp;<strong>wusa /uninstall /kb:4078408&nbsp;</strong>but
 a Microsoft window pops up stating I can not uninstall it because my stand alone laptop requires this update.&nbsp; The laptop does not require this update because it is not connected to any outside source.&nbsp; I have seen others are having the same issue.&nbsp; Besides
 having to reinstall Windows 10 on these two laptops again, how can I remove this update or what setting is preventing this program from communicating with a closed network server?&nbsp; Again, I can ping the server so the laptop is communicating to the server.&nbsp;
 It is the program that access the server is not connecting to the server.&nbsp; It is something with this update that is blocking this programming.&nbsp; Also, we only use this one program on these laptops.&nbsp; We use it to monitor our call center.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Your best option to get around is to perform a repair upgrade, which would downgrade the build to 16299.15. So, you could try that:

            That did not work.&nbsp; I downloaded the file to a USB thumbdrive and installed the file.&nbsp; I even turned off Windows Defender thinking maybe the firewall was blocking the connection.&nbsp; I can still ping the server but I can not connect to it with the program.&nbsp;
 Do you have any other ideas I can try?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>I doubt that KB4078408 was the problem as it just preps the system for further updates. It's listed as a critical update so it can't be removed. Just because you uninstalled the other updates, it doesn't mean that the effects of those updates were reversed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know the version prior to the updates?</p>
<p>What application are you using to talk to the phone system?</p>

<p>Look for a Restore Point that will undo it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Ask Cortana or search for "<strong>Restore</strong>", &amp; click best match: "<strong>Create a restore point</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; System Properties opens at the System Protection tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Click the <strong>System Restore</strong> button, then click the <strong>Next
</strong>button.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The System Restore requestor opens, then shows a list of points.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Put a check into the "<strong>Show more restore points</strong>" box, if there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) <strong>Select </strong>each point starting at the top,<span> &amp; click "</span><strong>Scan for affected programs</strong><span>".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Careful</strong></span>: Don't click Next yet. That would restore the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you spot KB4078408 in a top "will be deleted" pane? Then, click the <strong>
Close </strong>button, &amp; then click <strong>Next </strong>to restore the point. But examine both panes carefully first to understand everything that will change.</p>

<p>Too bad a suitable restore point was not an answer on either computer. Yes, in Win 8.1 (&amp; maybe early Win 10), I recall I had to turn restore points ON. It was OFF by default. But that is corrected in later versions of Win 10 (at least with a clean install,
 if not an upgrade-install). Still, everyone should go have a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender &amp; its firewall are sufficient, even commendable. It's all I use now. It's got cloud-based protection &amp; an easy, one-click offline scan capability. Windows also runs the Malicious Software Removal Tool periodically &amp; has SmartScreen in its
 browsers. I doubt any of that is at fault. Of course, you've got to allow internet access to get the full benefit of any anti-virus scanner. And only later versions of Win 10 have all of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling<strong> McAfee</strong>, a visit to its site for a <strong>
clean-up utility</strong> is always recommended. Chances are McAfee was never the problem with
<span>Avaya or with the mal-functioning restore point either, </span>though. Restore points are cleared by Windows after certain events, like an upgrade. I've heard of existing restore points refusing to work, &amp; can only guess Windows knows it is too old or
 otherwise no longer compatible. They don't give a good error message when they fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you've proven it's something Microsoft did that caused the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Considering you've only got one program you run on these computers, I think a clean install of the Windows version that works with Avaya is in order. That's got to get it back, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) First, I'd probably do a clean install of the latest Windows version. That is v.1709 now, but shortly will be v.1803. It's a 24-minute affair. A clean install will wipe anything twisted that an upgrade-install might carry along.</p>

<p>Avaya CMS Supervisor - Installation and Getting Started</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is large &amp; has many solutions, like...</p>
<p>
</p><p>"</p>
<p>Resolve TCP/IP host name</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that initial configuration of the TCP/IP server for CMS Supervisor has an error or other problem, use the following procedure to resolve host name problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. To ensure that this is the problem, open a command prompt window.</p>
<p>2. Ping the Avaya CMS host.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the host cannot be found, contact your network administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the host is found, the reply will contain the host’s IP address.</p>
<p>3. Check that the Avaya CMS host entry on the Domain Name Server (DNS) is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; If it is wrong or missing, use the IP address returned to you to correct or create the entry.</p>
<p>4. Edit the LMHOSTS file on the PC to include a line for the Avaya CMS server,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; which is in the following format:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; server name IP address</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Example:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; myserver 123.123.123.123<br />

<p><span>Thanks for your help.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Avaya was helping me install the patches when this issue first came to light.<span>&nbsp;
</span>He had heard that there were some Microsoft updates but was not sure how to fix it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>He suggested that I reinstall Windows.<span>&nbsp; </span>I want to hold the reinstall as a last-ditch effort.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Our computer is only a year old and came with Windows 10 already install.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The main reason I want to keep this as a last ditch effort is because I have not found the license information, yet.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m sure I have it some place but I’m not sure where I placed it.<span>&nbsp; </span>
It is not with all the Avaya information I have in a binder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The issue is not the TCP/IP.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can ping the CMS server and the IP address is correct.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is easily proven because I have a third laptop that connects to the CMS server and CMS Supervisor will connect to the server.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The setting for the TCP/IP for the CMS Supervisor are the same for all three laptops.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>I believe there is a Microsoft setting that is check or unchecked that is preventing CMS Supervisor from communicating.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I thought is was either the anti-virus or the firewall but since both are disabled, that can not be it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried comparing the good computer with one the non-working computer and noticed some new features and some features missing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I don’t remember where I found them at because I am searching everywhere and everything I could find but one had something to do with XPS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I know this had no impact on the program, but I got me thinking that maybe there might be something else that is blocking the program.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m not an IT specialist and our IT guy retired early this year.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I have a Lockheed contractor but he does not want to get involved with our phone system because that system does not belong to Lockheed.
<span>&nbsp;</span>You are the only person I have to turn to right now.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Do you have any other ideas as to if maybe there is a feature that is turned on or off that is blocking or preventing this application from communicating to the server?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, we have a HP laptop.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The laptop has a partition D:drive that has a recovery file.<span>&nbsp; </span>
I’m sure this file will restore the laptop to it’s factory settings.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Do you think it will require the Microsoft license?<span>&nbsp; </span>I tried to execute the file but it requires a Window Push Button Reset.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have not gotten up the nerve to move forward with this reset. </span></p>

<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) It is good you are full of questions. It reminds me I am no perfect expert &amp; should exercise caution in giving advice. I know that a computer that has a
<strong>digital license</strong> (at "<strong>START, Settings, Update &amp; Security, Activation</strong>") can have any version of Windows reinstalled into it without the need to know the Product Key. But the
<strong>Edition </strong>must be the same. Of course, you want the architecture (x64 or x86) also to be the same. And you get the digital license by having upgraded to Win 10 for free when that was offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a6b3657-d8e4-4c4c-b52b-91b1aacb6647?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a6b3657-d8e4-4c4c-b52b-91b1aacb6647?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to return to factory state one week/so after purchase of this Dell Inspiron 3542 using the Dell recovery partition. It was Win 8.1 back then. There was no such thing as a digital license. But I didn't have to input a Product Key, I believe because
 it is written in the BIOS. That is said to be true of all (most?) computers that came with Win 8.1 or higher installed. But what is the
<strong>make &amp; model</strong> of the computer(s) in question? We could look for an article at its site about how to return to factory state, if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another consideration: If you've installed something that has a license of its own, like MS Office (&amp; Avaya?), then a return to factory state (or even a clean install) will wipe it out. You will need to reestablish that license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12440/windows-10-activation</a></p>
<p>Activation in Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(2) OK. I thought I was onto something with that "fix" I quoted last post, that there was more to it than just the ability to PING. But, if you've compared the IP address returned to "<span>the Avaya CMS host entry on the Domain Name Server (DNS)</span>"
 - whatever/wherever that is - I guess it isn't the problem, if the IPs were the same. What did you PING? (I don't know that "Avaya.com" is right.)&nbsp; And what did you compare the returned IP to?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ce0a80f-5d07-4404-8e75-9b5dda9c430d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ce0a80f-5d07-4404-8e75-9b5dda9c430d?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(3) Thumb through Chapter 8 (Troubleshooting) of that Avaya manual. Did you get an error message at any point? For the section entitled "Find OCX and DLL incompatibilities", there is this...</p>
<p>

Perform a clean startup to determine whether background programs are interfering with your game or program
<p>
</p><p>Chances are that won't help, though, if really you've installed nothing but Avaya in those computers.</p>

<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">MSI Titan GT80 SLI, was running Win10 1803, just bumped me to 1809 an hour ago. I thought for sure the driver issue was solved as it nuked my wi-fi ability in October disaster and no. The same thing happened.
 I quickly downloaded the wifi drivers and installed them and I am back online.</span><br />

 in October. It's the same broken upgrade.</span><br />

<p>I Windows 1809 installed on January 21, 2019. Even with the latest driver updates my internet connection turns off every 2 hours. What kink of junk is Microsoft offering to us. My local wifi net stays us but the internet goes down. How do I fix that? Just
 to set Driver install settings to yes is useless. Every 2 hrs disconnect and then reconnect that is horse hockey.</p>

<p>My HP laptop just updated to Windows10/Pro 1809 and now the wifi doesn't work.&nbsp; The indicator light is on; running the troubleshooter finds "No errors".&nbsp; The icon on the taskbar shows the router is "Secured; No Internet"&nbsp; I reset the router and tried to
 reconnect.&nbsp; I tried to "Forget this device" and re-add it to reset the password--no connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried connecting a CAT-5 cable from the laptop to the router and I connect just fine.&nbsp; So, basically your 1809 update just bricked my WIFI, and I can't connect except with a cable.&nbsp; That may be practical at home, but you just screwed my ability to connect
 anywhere a cable won't reach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer not to have to rollback the update to the previous version, but this is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You have done some of this however the entire troubleshooter might be needed as you progress.<br />
<br />
Even though the temp seems to be ok it could still be heat related such as a bad sensor that mis-<br />
reads the correct temp or&nbsp;shuts the computer down prematurely.<br />
<br />
Could be heat related, make sure computer has adequate ventilation, maybe use a small fan to
<br />
add some air flow. On a PC the cards, memory and cables (both ends)&nbsp;might need to be reseated.
<br />
Remove all power and remove and replace those, do not just snug. Can't do that on a laptop though.
<br />
Also check the Power Plan Advanced Options to be sure there are not some settings there than cause
<br />
the power off - Control Panel - Power Options.<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>NETLOGON error seems to be causing unexpected crashes and Kernel Power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kellyh96  say:</h3>
<h2>            NETLOGON error seems to be causing unexpected crashes and Kernel Power error &#40;41&#41;. How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since one of the recent updates to Windows 10, I keep getting unexpected restarts without any blue screen error message. I'm getting worried that it may start to ruin my hardware, and it's extremely inconvenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched for an answer myself and found many people have had this problem, but nothing they suggested has fixed this for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was looking in the Event Viewer, and noticed that just before the Critical Kernel Power (41) error, the crash, there is always a NETLOGON error (ID: 3095). It's the same for every crash.
<em>What's equally strange to me though is that the netlogon errors' time stamp is almost a minute ahead of everything surrounding it, as you know they're all in order and it looks out of place.</em></p>
<p>I assume this is what is causing the problem? Maybe it isn't, but if anybody has any ideas on how to solve this please respond. It's driving me crazy!</p>

    <title>Re-installing Windows 10 to new SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuartg48uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-installing Windows 10 to new SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with updating and re-installing Windows 10 (Home) installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 on a home built PC. (System details at the end of this post.) I was originally running Windows 7 Home Premium on a 1TB Western Digital (Green) HDD and took advantage of the free upgrade from Windows 7.&nbsp; All went well until I decided&nbsp;to
 install an OCZ 120GB SSD and use the 1TB HDD for data and non OS program files. I transferred the OS by cloning to the new SSD using EaseUs Backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was well for a while then the latest update ("Fall Creators Update"?) came out and I kept getting messages saying:</p>
<p>"Low Disk Space. We need more space to install important updates. Select Fix Issues to get started."</p>
<p>Further messages told me I would need at least 8GB of free space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite having all data and non Windows programs on the D: drive HDD My 120GB SSD was showing only 1.71GB of free space so I went through disk cleanup including system files and uninstalling all non vital programs but it was still not enough according to
 Windows 10 Update Assistant. (Which I'd also previously removed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I gave up and bought a new 500GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD. After several attempts I was able to transfer my Windows 10 on to the new SSD by restoring a System Image. (Again using EaseUs Backup.) I used EaseUs Partition Manager to expand the 120GB partition
 from the old SSD into the maximum available space on the new SSD and then I was able to install all the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However over the various updates from Win7 to 10 and redirecting saves to the D: drive my file structure had become a bit muddled so I decided to reinstall Windows 10 with a clean install and start all over again. This is where my problems begin, I cannot
 get Windows 10 to do a clean install on the 500GB SSD. I didn't want to do a clone or restore from a system image as this would include all the old muddled file system so I followed the instructions on the Microsoft website for a clean install using the Media
 Creation Tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Media Creation Tool and chose the "Install to another PC option" saved to a new 32GB USB, disconnected my old SSD and installed the new SSD as Disk 0 but when I try to re-install Windows I get various error messages. e.g:</p>
<p>"Windows installation encountered and unexpected error. Verify that the installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation. Error code: 0xC0000005" and;</p>
<p>"Windows cannot install required files. Network problems may be preventing Windows from access the file. Make sure the computer is connected to the network and restart the installation. Error code: 0x8007006"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted and reformatted partitions on the SSD several times now and even tried to install to the 1TB HDD but all to no avail. The installation proves always stalls around the 58% mark and I consistently get the message something like "The installation
 couldn't complete. Error code: 0x8007006"Is it because I'm not allowed to use a different SSD to the original? My copy of Windows, and hence Windows 10, is legal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful for any help or suggestions as to what I might be doing wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Stuart Gilbert</p>

            I would first disconnect the mechanical hard disk.
<br />Also, try resetting the BIOS defaults.

<br />It is also possible the install media you downloaded and created using the MCT Is possibly corrupt.
<br />

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Stuart, it sounds like the Windows 10 installation Media is corrupt . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download the Windows 10 ISO (choose the 1709 version)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Then use this tool from Microsoft to create Bootable Installation Media from that ISO file:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />Then before installing Windows 10, remove all drives except the one you are installing Windows onto, you can connect your Data drive once the Installation completes . . .
<br />
<br />Also choose not to apply updates during the installation and make sure your PC cannot access the Internet during the Installation . . .

<p>Hello Dave and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded the ISO file from <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Then I followed the link to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This led me to a Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool. Is this correct? I was expecting a Windows 10 Download Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I saved this (also on to the USB) and ran the exe file anyway and it comes up with dialogue box with the options to "Change. repair or remove installation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Change" is greyed out saying "Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool has no independently selectable features."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Repair" is available saying "Repairs errors in the most recent installation by fixing missing and corrupt files, shortcuts, and registry&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Remove" is available, "Removes Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool from your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm reluctant to run the tool as it gives no indication that it will create a bootable drive, and I'm reluctant to let it "Repair" my existing Windows installation on the 128GB SSD as this is the only working copy of Windows that I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the best thing to do next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Stuart</p>

            Hi NofilQasim,
<br />
<br />There is a bug in Windows 10, if you are using a custom scaling that is known to cause this . . .
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />What is percentage your Scale factor set to?
<br />
<br />Try adjusting that using a custom scale factor, then log out and back in and check to see if all icons are visible . . .

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade and system freezing after idle time</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed windows 10 3 times and unistalled it 3 times as my laptop slows down a lot at startup and also when after being idle it does not turn on and freezes at the screensaver stage. I have to restart every time to get back in :(</p>
<p>Reading the forums I have tried all the power settings and wasted a LOT of hours reinstalling drivers etc trying to fix this issue but nothing worked and I had to revert back to the previous version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am happy with the previous version but then we have the WINDOWS ASSISTANT which wants to update the system all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you can provide the solution for one of the below:</p>
<p>1- Stop system freeze after sleep / idle time and computer slowdown after windows upgrade</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">OR if you don't have a solution to 1 above then...</span></p>
<p>2- The windows assistant stop bothering me to update to windows 10.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows go blank if snapping to top of secondary monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan_msforums  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows go blank if snapping to top of secondary monitor</h2>
                    <p>I hit a problem fairly regularly where my app window goes black when trying to snap it to the top of a secondary monitor plugged into a Dell XPS15 laptop. Nothing shows up in the window, but all of the UI elements are still there (if I click where a menu
 item is, I will get the menu drop-down for example).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only seen it so far with Visual Studio 2013 and SQL Server Management Studio. I can eventually get it to work if I snap to the primary (laptop) monitor then kind of drag it over along the top. Or if I close the app and re-start it will sometimes work.
 I never had this problem with 8.1. I just updated my display drivers and have the latest OS update, so that doesn't seem to be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really annoying and adds to the unfinished feel of this OS.</p>

            <p>I am having this same problem. &nbsp;I have a Alienware laptop with Intel Integrated Graphics and a GeForce980M chip. &nbsp;I have found that Atmel Studio (which has Visual Studio Embedded in it) often gives me a black screen when moved to the secondary monitor or
 maximized on the secondary monitor regardless of which GPU I have setup as my preferred graphics adapter.<br />
<br />
Other apps tend to fail more if the GeForce is chosen as my primary adapter, including some of the settings screens, control panel, and some of my own apps that I've developed in DirectX 11.<br />
</p>
<p>I need to find out if my GPU has died before my return policy is up. &nbsp;If it is a windows bug, then I don't have to return anything.</p>

            <p>My system has a GeForce GT 640M, so it seems like it could be an NVIDIA driver problem. I had it happen with Adobe Illustrator as well. Other notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It doesn't happen if I maximize with the menu button, only if I snap to the top.</p>
<p>- After it goes blank I need to move the window all the way to my primary laptop monitor before I get the display elements back.</p>

<p>I had the same issue with the same Alienware laptop. &nbsp;As soon as I turned off the hardware acceleration as you said, things worked just fine.</p>

            <p>A year later, with all the updates on both OS and graphic card driver, I still have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same blank/black window problem with Visual Studio, Chrome, PotPlayer, anything that seems utilizing the graphic card for its UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One solution to it is to stop the Intel Graphic Card driver in the Device Manager. &nbsp;then lose the ability to adjust the brightness of the main monitor of the laptop.</p>

            Only thing to add: Restart SSMS after changing settings. Then, snapping to another monitor no longer blacks-out the UI.

    <title>Windows 10 volume does not stay muted after undocking - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 volume does not stay muted after undocking</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 and I've noticed that even though the volume mixer shows the volume is muted, sound will still play through the laptop speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've only seen this happen after I unplug a DisplayLink dock. When I use the dock, I have a Logitech G430 headset plugged in. When I unplug the dock, the volume icon displays muted but sound will still be heard. Before I upgraded, I noticed that I could
 control the built-in speakers and the headset through separate mixers, but I can't seem to find a comparable option in Windows 10. If I toggle the mute off then on, it does mute the speakers, but this seems to be a new issue since upgrading and it's not a
 great experience when the volume shows as muted but is not actually muted.</p>
