<h2>            Audio Jacks Not Working&#33; &#40;Windows 10 Update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>None of my audio jacks are working. I tried different audio devices in the jacks and still couldn't hear a thing! This only happened after I installed windows 10. If it helps, I use a Razer Blackshark Headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>I have had the same issue. I have installed the latest audio drivers from Dell (Alienware M14x R2) but with no result. Interestingly enough, I have a razer audio program installed on my computer too. Maybe this third party app ruins the sound after the upgrade
 (Razer Synapse)???? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with any help?</p>

<h2>            Re-installing Windows on a Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>My Surface pro has got itself stuck in a uefi boot loop. I followed instructions for creating a Windows media creation tool on a USB but couldn't install this on the Surface. I got this error code: 0x80300002. I searched some more and found advice saying
 I would need to add other drivers onto my USB and use Rufus to complete the tool.&nbsp; I'm looking at this page (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface)</a>
 but I don't know which link to follow or which drivers I need to add in.&nbsp; I bought my Surface from Amazon and this is the description:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Surface Pro 12.3-Inch PixelSense Tablet PC (Silver) with Black Type Cover - (Intel 7th Gen Core m3-7Y30 2.6GHz, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD, Intel HD Graphics 615, 2017 Model, Windows 10 Pro)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what that means about which version I've got and so which drivers I need to install. (I assume a 3 but I don't really know.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an idiot-proof way of downloading the right bundle of software etc and creating USB tool in a couple of clicks?</p>

<p>You have the "<span>Surface Pro (newest)". This is usually described as just "Surface Pro".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp; drivers and firmware are only useful if you already have Windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are installing from a standard Windows 10 medium, you need a USB hub and a USB keyboard and/or mouse because the standard medium does not include touch drivers. Without touch drivers the initial setup commands cannot be input on the
 Surface touch screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can use a recovery image if you do not have a hub and keyboard and/or mouse to use. See&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4023512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Creating and using a USB recovery drive</a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note that it is possible that your SSD has failed. If so, you will not find any medium to install on and you will need to send your Surface in for service.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4023527/surface-how-to-get-service-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How

<h2>            Can not open&#47;read .txt file on Windows phone</h2>
                    I use .txt files and these are located in OneDrive. On a PC setting the default app is easy and I like using Notepad for example. On a Windows phone (Lumia 950) I have not found the equivalent setting for default apps to set their relationship with file
 extensions. For example MS Word would be OK. I tried searching the Microsoft store and came up with lots of non-Microsoft apps. Tried several "notepad" apps and text editors. Found two that work well: Notepad Next by Simplify Designs and Basic Text Editor
 by SpringComputing.&nbsp;Can I set&nbsp;MS Word to open a .txt file?

</p><p>But in all honesty, is all of that data really needed and safe to hand over worry free?</p>
<p>It strikes me there is stuff there that I would not want the company I have purchased my OS from ( came with the PC, not a free update ) to&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;have free access to.</p>
<p>Or is there really nothing to be concerned about here?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but the links seem to show how to turn off the settings that MS are willing to let you turn off, and one seems to suggest using a local account and another email provider. Why would you need to&nbsp;do that&nbsp;if there is nothing to worry about
 in a MS account setup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is nothing unique or personal collected, then why&nbsp;are Enterprise systems apparently allowed to turn it all&nbsp;off? After all&nbsp;MS claim nothing personal or private is collected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And, unless I misread it, some of the stuff seems a little OTT to me. Like why do they need the&nbsp;imei and&nbsp;meid for a mobile device ( assuming anyone is still using W10 on a mobile device ;-) ). True they don't specifically identify a user directly, but why
 do MS need it at all? Even the MAC and IP address is listed on the full version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why do they need to know what 3rd party programs you use and URLs you visit? Which the list seems to suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As I say, I may have misread it and/or misunderstood what's being said, but if it is as I understand it, why do they need it all? And why can't home users simply be allowed to turn it off as Enterprise users can?</p>

<h2>            microsoft volume shadow copy service</h2>
                    I use ZoneAlarm for firewall. It has just reported that 'microsoft volume shadow copy service wants to access the Internet'. It also reports that it is the first time ZA has noticed this.<br />
Have no idea why&nbsp;MVSCS has&nbsp;now decided to do this after 2 years running Vista Home Premium. The module reported is VSSCV.exe.<br />
Is this feature any better/worse than&nbsp;3rd party disk/backup/restore products and why has it just kicked in now?<br />
Anyone got any ideas?<br />
ps - no recent changes made to ZA settings. Current OS version is 6.0.6001 with service pack 1.0&nbsp;

<h2>            Directx feature level</h2>
                    I tried installing the game Player Unknown's Battlegrounds on my new pc. Which is 2nd hand. I know it has a lot of old hardware. When I installed it, I got a prompt saying "Directx feature level 10.0 is required to run the game" I updated my drivers and
 checked the files, and everything seemed fine but I still get this message. My graphics card is Nvidia GeForce 9800 GT. If anyone could tell me whats going on, and how to fix it, that would be great. Thanks

            Hi,

<br />I suggest you to update the graphic card driver by following the steps below:
<br />
<br />1.      Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager.
<br />
<br />2.      Expand Display Adapters.
<br />
<br />3.      Right click on the driver and select Update Driver Software.
<br />
<br />4.      Follow the on-screen prompts to update the driver.
<br />
<br />Also, suggest you to install any pending updates available and restart the PC and check for status.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.

    <title>DVD-RW disk Not working after Clean install of Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nostrildarmus  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD-RW disk Not working after Clean install of Win7</h2>
                    
<p>I made a clean install of Win7 yesterday on my Acer Asprire 5738, and i only noticed this particular problem today, as i needed to use the DVD drive, which is a Slimtype DVD A DS8A3S ATA device.</p>
<p>The problem so far is that it does a disappearing act everytime the disk drive spins down, so for example, i can put a game disk in, for installation, the drive will appear in the my computer folder, the disk will spin up, and run the installation until,
 lets say, i need to insert a license key... the disk will spin down and idle, then will dissapear from the system.</p>
<p>I've checked the properties under the hardware tab, and it displays 2 devices, one is the device which is installed, i.e., Slimtype DVD A DS8A3S ATA</p>
<p>Manufacturer: Standard CD-ROM</p>
<p>Location: Location 0 (Channel 1, Target 0 Lun 0)</p>
<p>Device status: unknown</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>underneath that device, another is listed as a WDC WD2500BEVT-22zCT0 ATA as a disk drive type</p>
<p>Manufacturer: (standard Disk Drives)</p>
<p>Location 0 (Channel 0, Target 0, Lun 0)</p>
<p>Device Status: This device is working properly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont know what the 2nd device is, as i only have one disk drive, and also, i dont know why the switch from vista home to a complete HDD format, and then installing win7 would cause such a problem...</p>
<p>any help would be greatly apreciated</p>

<h2>            USB Port problems with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Since I upgraded to Windows 8.1 I sometimes have a problem on startup that my computer does not seem to be recognizing any devices plugged into usb ports. &nbsp;As my mouse and keyboard are connected through usb, i cannot log in and/or see if any other devices
 connected to usb are live. &nbsp;If I reboot my computer, eventually, it will come on and recognize the usb devices, normally after several tries. &nbsp;The usb drivers are up to date per Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back to Factory
 Settings</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Ask them if you can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p><span>Save all Data, as it will be lost during a clean install.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>

<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Or, use Knoppix Live CD to recover your Data:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Startup Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista, and just serves
 as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft to make this
 available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.</span></p>

<h2>            camera settings, windows 10</h2>
                    I just upgraded to windows 10 and I want to know how do I change the brightness of the camera ? in windows 8 I was able to change if the picture I was taking would be bright or dark but when I open my camera with the new update I cant find a way to do
 that... and I even go to the setting of the camera and you can kind of see that there's more settings if you scrolled down, but I can't find a way to scroll down either.

            Unfortunately, for both the brightness and contrast values, no sliders appear, so although a section for adjusting each does come up, they've somehow omitted any interactive tool to allow for adjustment. &nbsp;

            <p>On the MS Camera App their is a brightness adjustment at the top of the screen where you can switch from forward facing and rear facing cameras, however when you bring up the brightness adjustment it moves but does nothing to help the picture. Everything
 outside is completely washed out and can not be adjusted via the brightness bar. The Windows 8.1 camera app was fine on my tablet until i upgraded to windows 10.</p>

            This procedure is absolutely absurd. Why not have a simple settings dialogue box that can be brought up with a right click? It used to be so simple and now we have to navigate through all this nonsense.

<h2>            Bubbles and peeling my media games</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I´M Luiz Martos and I don't speak english, but let's go.<br />I recently traded my PlayStation 4 for an Xbox One.<br />I regret it because the media is peeling and creating bubbles.<br />In summary as they are exchange products I do not have the notes.<br />But I've always been jealous of my PS4 games and never had problems. I use Microsoft DVDs in the same way and there are several with this problem.<br />I report my dissatisfaction with the brand due to&nbsp;the lack of quality in the media.<br />For this reason I'm reviewing my concept and I did not even do my live registration after all, it might be that all the games I have are going to fail.<br />I picked up a new game and we'll see how long it takes for it to display this defect.<br />I would just like to be one of millions of live players, take advantage of what Microsoft says is the best online experience.<br />And I can not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Overnight (possibily due to an update) the pen pressure whilst using photoshop no longer works! Driving me absolutely crazy!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone know a fix or point me into the right direction please?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p>So, basically...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pen works. However when drawing (Paint, Photoshop, Illustrator) etc., I only get a solid line. Before when drawing depending on the amount of pressure applied I would get a thicker or thinner line... now it's a continuos same thickness line...</p>

<h3> toneloc757  say:</h3>
<h2>            Banned gamer pic </h2>
                    <p>Hello, my girlfriends son uploaded a picture of our dog as my&nbsp;gamer pic, and it resulted in my account banned for 24 hours. I’m confused by this, the picture was her sons favorite, the dog was taking a nap&nbsp;belly up. It was as far from inappropriate. I’m not trying to complain, I know you guys have a lot of content to deal with, but if you would please review this, and revoke the ban, it would be very&nbsp;appreciated. I’m currently currently at work, but I would appreciate it if the&nbsp;ban was lifted&nbsp;by the time I got home. I assure you it was a menevolant image.&nbsp;It’s really silly it got banned over that picture. I will not upload any picture similar in the future, thank you, and again i know you guys deal with a lot of content, but please recognize this is silly to revoke my gaming privileges Over that.</p>

<h3> ohliz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will my new hard drive become corrupt when I transfer files from a corrupt hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My old windows 7 pc was corrupt and I transferred the files to my new windows 8 and it's been a long time but it also is corrupt and I'm now installing a new hard drive. How can I transfer safely? I have windows 8.1 now.</p>
<p>My hard drive failed the SMART short self test, and has been like that for a long time, I don't know when or really how it started but because my old pc was bad I thought it may have been transferred from the old one. That was my first pc, my learning pc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My pc is working good but I'm having update trouble,&nbsp;the disc&nbsp;was running at 100% almost all the time I could barely do anything and I read from another forum about a problem I have that they uninstalled their HP system support, so I uninstalled my Dell&nbsp;support
 assist&nbsp;and now it's working good. But it has something else going on I can't figure out.

            Hi Liz.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The files may be corrupted or missing if the hard drive is failing and blocking out sectors that those files were stored on.  This is why a DIsk Check can take a long time trying to safely move files off of failing sectors.  
<br />
<br />The definitive diagnosis is Disk Check:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>   followed by Drive Diagnostics like Seatools:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />But once those files are transferred to a new hard drive it's the files problems and they cannot infect the hard drive.  
<br />
<br />You'll always benefit most from a Clean install like the gold standard in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg!</p>
<p>I had done the error checking on the local (C) disk and it showed no errors. I ran chkdsk&nbsp;f and&nbsp; r before also but don't know where to read the results. I used DISM and&nbsp;SFC scannow repaired some things but I have a lot of updates that need to be manually
 installed and I don't know how to do that either. But they may be all from windows 10. I had a tech help me in 2014 stop the windows 10 update that I didn't want and I know it's on my pc on legacy and he reinstalled windows 8 in UEFI. I used a windows 8 recovery
 disk to do a repair and it finally did something, I was having trouble doing chkdsk it would stick at 12% I left it on all night and another time I stopped it (not good) I have an installation disk from
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-create-installation-media</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have an exact new replacement hard drive ready to go but I wanted to find out what's going on and if I can salvage this one. It may be registry related, I touch things
 I shouldn't I'm very curious,&nbsp;always been a problem. When I was very little I would open radios and TV's to see how they worked, and sometimes I fixed them. :) The drivers are good and all up to date.&nbsp; I can't fix or figure out how to fix the windows updates,
 I've followed the procedures and they say fixed but it isn't. But All my files are on onedrive and an external hard drive I also have one from File History up to date. So I'm reluctant but I may do a clean install of windows 8.1, I don't want windows 10, not
 yet at least. lol I didn't want to leave windows 7 either but I really like 8.1. Oh and I have my old windows 7 laptop working good, I sent photos and stuff to it, I'm covered!</p>
<p>I appreciate your quick response and help! I'll be back </p>
<p>Liz</p>

            Hi again Liz.  
<br />
<br />There's a good Windows 8.1 Clean Install guide here:  <a href="https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clean-install-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2299-clea...</a>
<br />
<br />I would use the latest media you can create from here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/cr...</a>
<br />
<br />When ready for Windows 10 do use the tutorial I gave earlier because there are no reported problems from hundreds of thousands of users who followed those steps.  Keep in mind that you can still get the free Windows 10 Digital License on the PC by inserting the WIndows 8.1 Product Key (even if embedded) into Activation Settings, as this method to activate free Windows 10 has been in a prolonged grace period which may end Jan 1st from what we hear.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Keep us posted and I will be here to help.

            With regards to 'will my new hard drive become corrupt', no your new hard drive will not become corrupt. 
<br />
<br />Windows will not transfer corrupt files, it will transfer the good files and at the end will give you an error dialog informing you it has found corrupt files and cannot access them . . .

<h2>            Backup size is huge&#33; Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The total size of my&nbsp;overall backup&nbsp;has grown to&nbsp;931 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data file backup portion grew from 56 to 240 GB and is now 296 GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Image is 312 GB.</p>
<p>Other files size is 65 GB.</p>
<p>Free space is 257 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the 312 GB because that is about the size of my C: drive. Which does included my data (files, photos, movies).&nbsp; So I beileve the data potion is</p>
<p>redundant. I also copy all the data onto other internal and external drives everyweek. I will not take the data off of the c: drive untill I set up a NAS which is not</p>
<p>for at least a year away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'Free space' is what is confusing my why Windows backup needs to backup free space?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>Windows</span> Backup provides you with the flexibility of managing the disk space that is used by your backups. After you set up
<span>Windows</span> Backup, you can view how much disk space is being used by the backup and how much free space you have on the disk that your backups are being saved on by going to the Backup and Restore Control Panel. To control how much disk space is being
 used, you can choose how many file backups and how many system images <span>Windows</span> keeps.</p>
<p>Perform the steps mentioned in the following links and check if that helps:</p>
<p><b>What backup settings should I use to maximize my disk space?</b></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the Volume Shadow Copy service is running on your computer or not.
<br />
<br />
To check for the same perform the following steps: </span></p>
<p><b><i><u><span>Step 1:</span></u></i></b><span><br />
<br />
a) Click ‘<b>Start’</b>, type ‘<b>services.msc’</b> and hit <b>
Enter</b>.<br />
b) Locate “<b>Volume Shadow Copy</b>” and check if the <b>service</b> is started.<br />
c) If not ‘<b>Start’</b> the service.<br />
<br />
If the service was already started, I’d suggest you to stop the service and restart the same. Repeat the above steps for “<b>Windows Backup service</b>”, too.<br />
<br />
Shadow copy errors are often caused by disk problems (usually minor) which check disk will find and correct.<br />
<br />
You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><i><u><span>Step 2:
</span></u></i></b></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow the below steps: <br />
<br />
a) Open Computer by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, and then clicking <b>
Computer</b>. <br />
<br />
b) <b>Right-click</b> the drive that you want to check, and then click <b>
Properties</b>.<br />
<br />
c) Click the <b>Tools</b> tab, and then, under <b>Error-checking</b>, click
<b>Check now</b>. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select
<b>Automatically</b> <b>fix</b> <b>file system</b> <b>
errors</b>. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.<br />
<br />
To perform a thorough check, select <b>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</b>. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.<br />
<br />
To check for both file errors and physical errors, <b>select </b>both<b> Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.<br />
</b><br />
d) Click <b>Start</b>.<br />

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t Microsoft back its products&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allisoncamp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Microsoft back its products&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Beware of Microsoft!&nbsp; Microsoft does NOT stand behind it's products.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 3 that I purchased in June 2014 and was great until recently.&nbsp; I only use it about twice per week, it is kept in pristine condition.&nbsp; Microsoft sent out a firmware
 update a few weeks ago that destroyed my Marvel Avistar wireless network controller in the Surface.&nbsp; I spent 6 hours on the phone with Ryan at Microsoft the first day I called.&nbsp; After many troubleshooting steps, we set it back to factory settings, still no
 wireless controller, not even the wireless icon.&nbsp; The call was conveniently disconnected and I never heard from him again!&nbsp; I had called back and was old by the next rep that there was no ticket logged and he could find any record of my issue and working with
 Ryan.&nbsp; So, after a few days I called back and spoke to anohter rep, John, I believe. He opened a ticket and worked with me for over an hour and conveniently again, the call was disconnected.&nbsp; I immediately called back and was told by the rep that answered
 that John had gotten another call before he realized my call was dropped, and John would call me back within an hour.&nbsp; I never heard from John again!&nbsp; Again, a few days later I called back - I am not remotely happy at this point and do not appreciate going
 over the details of my issue over and over again.&nbsp; This time a female rep answered and I gave her my entire story AGAIN.&nbsp; And AGAIN, my call was conveniently disconnected!&nbsp; Guess what? She did not call me back!&nbsp; I immediately called back and spilled to the
 next one my story yet AGAIN.&nbsp; He then told me after reviewing my case, that it looks like Microsoft support had "done all they coulld do" at this point, I am out of warranty, so my only option is to PAY to send my pristine unit back and have it replaced with
 a used unit!!&nbsp; Microsoft will not even fix MY surface.&nbsp; A used unit is not acceptible.&nbsp; And, they did not even try to offer any other options.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The worst part of their so called Customer Support is that each of these reps immediately asked for my call back number as soon as they took my call, yet none of them called me back when my calls were so conveniently disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
If you look online at this wireless controller, it has been an know problem for Microsoft since the early Surfaces.&nbsp; They know about it!&nbsp;&nbsp; I read hundreds of online posts regarding this wireless controller not working after an update.&nbsp; NONE of the troubleshooting
 steps worked to bring it back.&nbsp; Hundreds of other Microsoft customers have this same problem, yet Microsoft is not taking responsiblity.&nbsp; I cannot afford to spend $1500 on a computer that will die in just over two years and Microsoft not back their own product.&nbsp;
 And, by the way, the $1500 did not include the type cover and case that I purchased for it at the same time.&nbsp; For additional protection, I even put a $40 glass screen protector on it to keep it in exellent condition - the way I keep all of my electronic devices
 including my mobile phone.&nbsp; And now, it is worthless.&nbsp; And Microsoft is as worthless as my dead unit for putting me through this when I was trying to get support, and then telling me there's nothing else they can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Have they even thought about the FACT that</p>
<p>A MICROSOFT firmware update was sent to a MICROSOFT device and destroyed the wireless network controller in the MICROSOFT device???&nbsp; That is the bottom line.&nbsp; Their own update destroyed their own product!&nbsp; And now, I have no Surface, which i paid $1500 for,
 got the largest processor, the largest storage, the best unit offered, and I have nothing and MICROSOFT DOES NOT CARE!&nbsp; I will NEVER purchase another Microsoft device again and I will share this with millions of people everywhere to ensure no one else ends
 up with the raw deal from Microsoft that I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question is - Microsoft, when are you going to do the right thing and fix my Surface Pro 3?</p>

            Same for me! &nbsp;Mine died almost a year ago, just after the warranty ended. Everything had been brilliant up until then. Then the battery issue killed my Surface Pro3 (I wasn't aware of the issue at the time until my Surface died). Microsoft have been appalling
 about it. &nbsp; The firmware updates are a total joke and not only can't fix all the Surface Pro3s that were already dead, it has just caused more problems for those still trying to keep their Surface Pro3s alive.

<br />
<br />Thank you for reporting this, this is currently a well reported bug in Microsoft Gaming, lots of users are experiencing the same thing, with this re-direct to a scam web page
<br />
<br />Thankfully you are wise enough to realize this was fake. . .
