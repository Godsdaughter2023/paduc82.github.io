<h2>            Open Office download problems.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Open Office download</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to download Open Office on to my new windows 8 PC. I have used Open Office for years on my old XP PC without any problems. When I downloaded it recently it also downloaded Delta browser &amp; toolbar. I am told (By Know How expert) that Delta is
 a dangerous programme to have on your system. The Delta software would not uninstall no matter what was tried, System Restore eventually cleared it, but of course a lot of trouble re loading all lost programmes. Anybody out there had similar problems......
 and managed to download Open Office safely?</p>

Have you tried downloading WMP11 from the following site:<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player 11 for Windows XP<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1D224714-E238-4E45-8668-5166114010CA&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=1D224714-E238-4E45-8668-5166114010CA&amp;displaylang=en</a><br />
<br />
And...maybe the following direct link would be worth a try:<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/9/5/0953e553-3bb6-44b1-8973-106f1b7e5049/wmp11-windowsxp-x86-enu.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/9/5/0953e553-3bb6-44b1-8973-106f1b7e5049/wmp11-windowsxp-x86-enu.exe</a><br />

<h2>            How to change Windows 10&#39;s Mail quick actions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I customize the quick actions on the notifications in Windows 10's Mail app? I did it before, but it's reverted itself now, and I can't figure out how to change it again. Specifically, I would like to remove the completely useless "Set Flag" option
 and replace it with "Mark as Read".</p>

            Hi Ullallulloo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In Mail Settings (gear at bottom of condensed Inbox), under Message List, there are Swipe actions you can customize which are all I find for this now. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi  Ullallulloo 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Currently, there is no option available to set the default. 
<br />
<br />You can right click the message then click 'Mark as read' or click the message then click 'Actions' menu represented by the three dots (...) in the top right of the message then choose 'Mark as read'. 
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you submit a feature request; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

<p>I do not see any options to configure the notification quick actions in Message List settings. Only options to configure the message list within the app.</p>

            ok so, Open the Mail app on your computer.
<br />In the lower left-hand corner of the window, click on the Settings icon.
<br />Select Notifications.
<br />And see if you can set up again. 
<br />If that didn't work I would recommend repairing the windows mail but before making a back up of all the emails.

            Okay, so I have figured it out. Apparently the quick actions just copy from the swipe actions, which can be set in the "Message List" settings. That's pretty dumb in my opinion, since I would like my possible actions to be different between them, but that's
 how it is. The settings also do not take effect immediately, so one might want to be aware of that.

            Hi MariaK3W1,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Check whether the contact is blocked by you by mistake
<br />v8 - Right Click on the contact / Chat &gt; View profile &gt; Scroll down and at the end you have Block Contact
<br />
<br />2. Check whether your caller ID is set up or not - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>?
<br />
<br />3. If the problem still exists,  You should chat with a live agent from Skype Support on this issue.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options will allow you to chat with a live agent. Select following one from the categories dropdown to get the option for chat.
<br />
<br />Payments &amp; purchases
<br />Account, profile &amp; sign-in
<br />Privacy &amp; security
<br />
<br />On the next screen, you get the Chat link which you can click.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92e87ab0-5ad4-4507-acdd-07e99da9088f?upload=true" />

    <title>Unable to update to Windows 1903 build version and issues with BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denemessina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to update to Windows 1903 build version and issues with BIOS while trying to update.</h2>
                    <p>After endless problems with windows update on my 1 year old asus laptup, i decided to give myself a treat last month because it was my birthday: It was the best present i could of given myself: I decided to not allow it to update at all in may so that i
 could use my computer without the usual snafu.</p>
<p>Of course, come june it was time to pay the piper : to download and install said updates so that i could play catch up and, perhaps unwisely upgrade to the much vaunted 1903 build....this is where it get's&nbsp; really annoying: surprisingly the updates i needed
 to bring me up to the threshold of 1903 actually downloaded with only one failed install that corrected the second time i tried...though there were some oddities: firstly i noticed that it had wiped my update history..o.k, annoying but not the end of the world,
 as winver showed that i was indeed up to date....buuuut...secondly and more disturbingly, update took it upon itself to flash my bios with what i thought must of been a newer, better version that came out in january of this year....unfortunately, at this time
 my battery seemed to go wonky, and would not charge anymore...so, i spent the last 24hrs taking my laptop apart ( my battery is not the easilly removable sort), borrowing chargers, messing with calibration, monitoring software and the like...all to no avail...though
 i did think that it had something to do with the updates, i knew it was almost certainly impossible to roll back my bios to the earlier version and system restoring of course only removed the windows updates (leaving me with a now totally blank update history..grrrrr!!)..so
 with the problem unsolved and knowing that my machine was offering no further updates to bios, i decided to look on the asus site....lo and behold there was a later bios (6 months later in fact) available for me to flash....so, with much trepidation i flashed
 this new bios and thank satan it sorted out my battery problem.</p>
<p>Which is all well and good...until i realized that i wont be offered 1903 again until i reinstall the updates: including the rogue bios "update" that caused such chagrin.... am i being offered this older and faulty bios because 1903 won't work with the latset,
 non-faulty one, or did update just decide to throw that one in out of pure sadism? either way it doesn't look like i'm getting 1903 without screwing up my battery&nbsp; charging again (the last time decreased it's health permanantly by 6% btw).....any solutions?...anybody?
 ...sigh...…</p>

<p>hi,&nbsp; thanks for your prompt reply. I will answer the questions that you have asked me, in order, numbered in the order they were asked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. my windows version/build is as follows: version 1809, build 17763.437</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I am not "receiving" the 1903 update: that is not what my question was about and the faulty bios update was not offered with 1903 but given and installed before&nbsp; it with the final culmative update for 1809: The problem is/was that when i belatedly got
 all the updates for may that i had purposely postponed, which need to be installed PRIOR to version 1903 being offered to me via windows update, i installed them but with them came the strange out of date bios update..i was then offered 1903 by windows update.
 However i uninstalled said may 1809 culmative update just before i flashed my bios with an up to date and not faulty version of bios from the asus website. the reason that i did this was because as stated above, after the updates my battery charging went haywire
 the end result of which has been small but permanent damage to my battery health, losing me perhaps 6 months of it's life. I turned out to be the fault of the bios update and not the updates for windows itself. unfortunately of course i am know minus an update
 which is needed for 1903 to be offered to me. I cannot offer a screenshot as the screenshot would merely be of my now entirely blank windows update history: i have not re-downloaded the update again as it will be installed, i assume with, the dodgy bios update
 again..tbh i haven't checked because if i let it download, it will automatically install itself again and i will be back to square one. i have my updates set to "metered connection" so that i can control when they are downloaded and installed and if i click
 "download" on the "updates available" message that i will get if i click on "search for updates" then there is a good chance that it will be waiting to sneakily install itself during the night.</p>

    <title>Asus Driver Power State Failure BSOD windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonaskeukelier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus Driver Power State Failure BSOD windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am aware there are multiple threads on this but I'm not tech-savy enough to try out all the solutions listed and was hoping the dump files provided would be enough to seriously narrow down the search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought a new Asus N751JX a few days ago. Since then I have had 2 BSOD's at random moments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptop wasn't doing anything specific like waking up out of sleep or opening a program. If anything the problem seemed to occur AFTER closing a program but not immidiately ,more like a few minutes after (both were games I believe but neither were severly
 demanding)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow my operating system is </p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 8.1</p>
<p>I only have the McAfee internet security that came pre-installed (and malwarebytes,superantispyware as additions) for antivirus</p>
<p>
</p><p>The dump files for the two occurences are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.filedropper.com/070515-42171-01</p>
<p>http://www.filedropper.com/070715-49921-01</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now this is in fact the second model of this laptop I have. The first one I bought a day prior to this one but it had a faulty esc button so I returned it for the model I have now. However before returning it to the store I also incounted the same driver
 power state failure BSOD.</p>
<p>Both BSOD happened after an extended period of usage(battery was running low)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Seeing as it has happened with both laptops I don't think returning it will solve the problem (and frankly, I don't quite feel like re-installing all my programs a third time)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>Thankyou</p>

<h2>            Problems connecting wireless laptop with Xbox 360 media extender.</h2>
                    I recently purchases an ASUS laptop running Windows 7&nbsp;with intel wireless b/g/n and am connecting wirelessly through a netgear router (wgr614 v3 with updated software). I have an Xbox 360 which can see media shared on my desktop computer running windows
 XP. However, I cannot stream media from my Windows 7 laptop and cannot set up windows media center to use my xbox as an extender. I have enabled UnPnP on my router, disabled my Windows 7 firewall, and tried just about anything else i can think off including
 using a hardwire ethernet cable to connect my laptop to my router all with no success. Just curious if anyone else has the same problem or any suggestions I might try. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Additional information, the error code given in the windows event viewer under media center is as follows:<br />
general - cannot send media extender software to extender<br />
error: The semaphore timeout period has expired.<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>This behavior is usually caused by factors such as faulty network equipment or an incorrect network switch or router configuration.
 Follow the steps in the "What To Try" section to help determine the cause and to find a resolution.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Reconfigure the network setup. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Connect the Windows Vista-based Media Center computer to the Xbox 360 console by using an Ethernet cable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> In this setup, the console and the computer use "autonet" addresses, such as 169.254.<em>x</em>.<em>x</em>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. On the computer, change the location type from
<strong>Public</strong> to <strong>Private</strong>. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type sharing in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Network</strong> area, click <strong>Customize</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Private</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Close</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;In the
<strong>Media</strong> section, select <strong>Media Center</strong> to start the setup process or to try to connect again. The Xbox 360 console will perform a network test, and you will receive a report that is similar to the following message:</span></p>
<p><span>Limited Network Connection:<br />
Your console didn’t obtain an IP address from your DHCP server. An IP address is usually required for your console to contact your PC with Windows Media center. Check your network connection in Network Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you can establish a connection between the console and the computer in this network configuration, try the original network configuration again.<br />
<br />
If the original network configuration still does not work, troubleshoot the network equipment and the firewall settings.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about the network equipment, contact the manufacturer of the equipment.<br />
<br />

    <title>Microsoft Family Child Account Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yurilekarev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Family Child Account Password</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I created a child account for my 7-year old son using my Microsoft Account (<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>).</p>
<p>The reason - he needed an e-mail account for school.</p>
<p>However&nbsp;it is impossible to&nbsp;log-in to the account&nbsp;and the&nbsp;new e-mail, because it says that I entered an invalid password.</p>
<p>How can I rest the child's password?</p>
<p>Traditional password recovery does not help since this is a child account which has never been used.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>outlook online, with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you probably have to verify the account. If you set it up as a parent acct for child, then the verification email should come to your email and then verify it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as for trying to log on to his email you created, you put in his user name and his password, that is the password for his account. Have you tried to log onto his with your email password and then maybe set up his restrictions. I do not know that part as
 I never set up my kids accounts that way. I just set them as normal and then used family safety in windows defender or restrictions in the modem settings for time allowed on net or block websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but you have to verify any email account you create. and since you set hios up as a child account, there may be a different process. Check out your account page online and see.</p>

<p>then if you are talking about him accessing email from an app on windows vs. web online outlook access, then you have to add the account in windows 10 mail or WLM and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are tying the account directly to his school, then in accounts you can add a school account</p>

            Hi <strong>Jeff Hanna,</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
1. Recently did you&nbsp; make any software change to the computer?<br />
2. When did it work properly last time?<br />
<br />
<strong>(A).</strong> Try running the System File Checker.<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929833</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>(B). </strong>If the above steps does not resolve the issue, perform the system restore on an earlier time.<br />
<strong>Let us try restoring Windows to a previous state and check.<br />
</strong>To use System Restore to restore Windows XP to a previous state, follow these steps:
<br />
1.&nbsp;Log on to Windows as Administrator. <br />
2.&nbsp;Click Start, point to All Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click System Restore. System Restore starts.
<br />
3.&nbsp;On the Welcome to System Restore page, click Restore my computer to an earlier time (if it is not already selected), and then click Next.
<br />
4.&nbsp;On the Select a Restore Point page, click the most recent system restore point in the On this list, click a restore point list, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Note:<br />
</strong>&nbsp;A System Restore message may appear that lists configuration changes that System Restore will make. Click OK.
<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;On the Confirm Restore Point Selection page, click Next. System Restore restores the previous Windows XP configuration, and then restarts the computer.
<br />
6.&nbsp;Log on to the computer as Administrator. The System Restore Restoration Complete page is displayed.
<br />

            <p>Okay, I don't know a lot about settings, but what I did to fix this issue is the following:</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer:</p>
<p>Open tools and open internet options:</p>
<p>Click advanced tab and scroll towards the bottom:</p>
<p>uncheck SSL 2.0 and SSL 3.0:</p>
<p>check TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say is it worked on my desktop and laptop.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following questions by number in your next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. SP3's been available for over two years: How come you just got around to installing it now?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?&nbsp; Were any of these applications running in the background when you
 installed SP3?</p>
<p>3. Has a(another) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on the computer (e.g., a free-trial version that came preinstalled when you bought it)?</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Device Manager may not show any devices and Network Connections may not show any network connections after you install Windows XP Service Pack 3<br />

<p>Service Pack 3 has caused one of my computers several problems before and eventually made my PC crash.</p>
<p>recently though my second computer installed SP3 through an update and SP3 has been messing up my computer.</p>
<p>Now I get a message that says "The procedure entry point apsSearchInterface could not be located in the dynamic link library". and since then, I haven't been able to connect to the internet. It's getting very annoying.</p>

            <p>Step One: Go to the website of the printer's manufacturer.</p>
<p>Step Two: Find the section of the website that provides support.</p>
<p>Step Three: Find your model number.</p>
<p>Step Four: Look for the user guide -<em>or</em>- search for instructions on how to install the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tip: While you're in the 'support' area of the manufacturer's website, search for your specific model number and find out if the manufacturer is supporting that model on Windows 10. If the manufacturer is supporting that model on Windows 10, you'll see a
 Windows 10 driver to install and instructions for installing the printer on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's no Windows 10 driver, you can probably use a driver for Windows 8 or 8.1.</p>

<h3> manfredmalten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Windows 10 DVD player app and not able to play youtube videos in Internet Explorer.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Win 10 DVD Player</p>
<p>Win 10 dvd player does not work, when called, only dots chase each other across the bottom from 00:00 to 10:00 (funny seconds?), sometimes the usual buttons appear on the white bottom band, barely visible and not working either. Any suggestions how to correct
 this? Help, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW.:&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I foolishly "upgraded" form Win7 Home to Win 10, Youtube videos don't play anymore if entered from&nbsp;IE/google - except the commercials. From CHROME however they continue to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any connections between the two problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By now you will have realized that I am not a computer expert, so may I ask that&nbsp;any answers please be on ordinary user level?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Salut!</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer but: No, unfortunately it did not help. Tried method 1 a) through d), the following comments:</p>
<p>a) The key combo given above had no effect whatsoever; however right click on the start icon opened the door for typing in "troubleshooter". From&nbsp; there the next steps and
</p>
<p>b) started a search for h/w changes (?!), although no devices were physically touched in the "upgrade".</p>
<p>c) reported to have found a problem, i.e.&nbsp; that "possibly h/w changes were not recognized", but, now hear this: a repair was effected nevertheless! Made me wonder.</p>
<p>d) was followed, then the computer was restarted - No change, dots still are chasing dots etc etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The links furnished unfortunately did not really get me forward either, unless going in circles is considered progress. None of the problems reported and sometimes answered describes my problem to 100%.
<br />
</p>
<p>Supplementary info: Starting from WINDOWS + X, I ran checks on the installed drive and drivers. According to the test results, the CDRom Optiarc DVD AD-7700 H works just fine, and it also already has the optimum driver installed.&nbsp; The fly in the ointment:
 I still can't play my DVDs. </p>
<p>Still hoping however for someone to come up with a solution.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one problems</h2>
                    Some of you who read my last post know that I was having trouble with Xbox. So I exchanged for a different Xbox One S today and I'm sporadically getting a new error. Sometimes when I try to boot up my Xbox from energy saving mode I get an error saying
 "insert the game disc, we need that to verify the license." Does anybody have any idea what in the world is going on? This is incredibly infuriating and upsetting given that this is a brand new 1tb Xbox One S. I can only that's its an internet/Xbox One server
 issue? Idk I'm out of answers.

            With my last Xbox One I tried power cycling numerous times and it never resolved the issue I had. I kept getting error 8027025 "took too long to start." I really hope that error does not come back, but unfortunately I get the feeling that it will. This
 last week so bad for me that I had to power cycle my Xbox everyday to get it to play my games . That's not exaggerated either, I really did. I don't understand these problems that the Xbox One has, my PlayStation 4 is a tank. I've had my PlayStation 4 for
 3.5 years now and it has none of these issues.

            Actually, I have this issues as well. I have both the digital and the hard copy of fortnite and when I put it in one of my xbox&nbsp;(I have 5 of them} it will not allow my&nbsp;son to play save the world even though the disc was in. I also game share and thought
 that my digital copy was interfering with it so I deleted my profile but with that I lost the ability to game share with my son due to the number of accidental switches. So I pay $120 in live subs to allow 4 of us to play. I even did a system reset and it
 still will not play save the world for him with the disc.

<h2>            The problems with Microsoft and its products</h2>
                    <p>I am starting this discussion to let people know of my displeasure with Microsoft and their products. Here is my opinion:</p>
<p>Microsoft products are overpriced security risks that are slow to receive important updates, lacking in features, are not readily supported by the company that made them. I have been asked to pay money for someone to gain remote access to my laptop to fix
 a problem that should never have happened and risk losing my personal information. The people in support are absolutely clueless when it comes to the products that they are supporting, and if the question has a solution that is more difficult than to restart
 the computer, they will blame the problem on somebody else. The number of viruses that I have had on Windows compared to Linux is absolutely massive. Another security problem is the fact that you are always tracking us. I personally have disabled as much of
 the tracking as possible, but still find that it is a nuisance. My next issue with Windows is the fact that some hardware is not supported on it, and the fact that you make it very hard to write your own drivers. The only reason I use Windows is because the
 programs that I require are only supported on Windows. You guys need to step up your games if you are ever going to compete with Linux and Apple. I urge all members of the community to help me force a change from Microsoft to make life better for everybody.</p>

            The way that I see it is that the only reason that people don't use Linux over Windows is the fact that it does not have some of the same software as Windows and that it is slightly harder to use. I have been having trouble with Windows for years and all
 the while support has not been very helpful. My phone has a disabled GPS and does not have service on it. I have done a good job of securing my systems, but find it hard to trust Microsoft to deal with their security problems in a timely manner. Take Wannacry
 as an example of Microsoft's timely and effective response to a problem. If this same thing had taken place on Linux, you would have had to run the program as a superuser for it to have a large effect. And if you had QubesOS, you would have been able to continue
 working like nothing had even happened. The only reason why I am not using QubesOS right now is because it is incompatible with my computer.

            If I were to respond to Microsoft, they would end up ignoring it just like they always have. Apparently they don't care about providing good customer support without you having to pay them. In the Feedback Hub, I would not be able to ask the community
 to help me fix these problems.

            My preferable solution would be a boycott of Microsoft and its products in order to force a change. I know that this might not be the most realistic solution, but am looking for a way to force Microsoft to provide a better product and better support.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows uses the index to perform very fast searches of the most common files on your computer. When we search any file/folder the indexed location saves these files as&nbsp;the history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try&nbsp;to remove the index location items,&nbsp;follow the steps :</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + X </strong>key on the keyboard.</li><li>Type <strong>Indexing option</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><span>Modify</span></strong>.</li><li>To <strong>add or remove </strong>a location, select or clear its check box in the
<span>Change selected locations</span> list, and then click <span>
<strong>OK</strong></span></li><li>If you don't see all locations on your computer in the list, click <span>
Show all locations</span>. (If all locations are listed, <span>Show all locations</span> won't be available.)
<span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fwindows%25207%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_48.jpg" />&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li>If you want to include a folder but not all of its subfolders, click the folder, and then clear the check box next to any subfolder that you don't want to index. These folders will appear in the Exclude column of the
<span>Summary of selected locations</span> list.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to help you further.
