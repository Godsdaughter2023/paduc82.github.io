<h2>            Would dual booting the Surface Pro void its warranty&#63;</h2>
                    I'm used to using Windows 8 Pro and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS in tandem. Does the Surface Pro address dual-booting in its warranty? If not, does anyone know if this would pose any issues on a Surface Pro?

            Greetings,<br />
<br />
To add to what Jordana listed, if you remove the factory image, that Microsoft has provided and add your own image, even Windows 8 Pro (non-OEM), you have lost support for the Surface.<br />
<br />
So long as you dual boot and keep the factory OEM version of Windows 8 Pro, you're good to go.

<h2>            Customize Suits in Solitaire&#63;</h2>
                    Okay, so I finally managed to get solitaire for Windows 8 (At least it was free or I would have hurt someone--sucks that I needed to make an xbox account, though, since I only play PS3 and Wuu)&nbsp; I love that you can customize your decks, and I made two
 themed ones.&nbsp; However, it seems like from the customization options there used to be an option to customize each individual suit (ace of hearts, ace of diamonds, etc) with a different picture?&nbsp; I want to know if I can still do that.<br />
<br />
If you're curious, here's the decks I've made:<br />

<p>Hi there. My old gamertag was corrupted somehow, and when I tried to use the recover gamertag option, it said that the account was invalid. I went onto the website to try and log in and get a solution, only to have it create an entirely new account for my
 Windows Live ID. How do I recover the old account?</p>

<p>It sounds like you will want to give phone support a call for further assistance with the issue (you can reach them at 800-4MY-XBOX). In the event that you're mis-remembering your password or Live ID, phone support should be able to provide it to you once

    <title>The top of everything is cut off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbic.  say:</h3>
<h2>            The top of everything is cut off</h2>
                    <p>Everything from my desktop items at the top to "All" my browser windows are all cut off at the top. This just recently started happening, yesterday or the day before (March 22nd or 23rd - 2016). For instance, my recycling bin is located at the very top,
 left corner. That is how I first noticed this problem. I noticed the very top of the recycling bin was cut off and before it wasn't. It looks like it's been cut into with only the middle of the icon down showing and the middle of it on up are cut off. All
 web browsers appear the same way when on full window view. The very top of the browser windows are cut off now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done nothing to cause this (i haven't installed any new software). So I assume it must of been some recent windows 10 upgrade that is causing this. I have "After" this started to re-size the appearance of everything but no matter what size I make
 them (text, icons, browser setting, desktop) everything still shows with the top cut off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very annoying when I want to go to full screen and then I have to guess where the lower to taskbar or minimize, or close window buttons are. Often when I am on full window view and try to minimize it back I end up closing it instead because I can't
 see the top and have to guess where the buttons are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said, I didn't do nothing. This all just started with in the last day or two and is very annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[update]</p>
<p>I just took a screen shot with my my browser at full screen thinking I would show you what I was talking about. But when I viewed the screen shot everything looked like it was supposed to look. In the image I can see all the buttons, but open my browser
 again to full window and everything is still appearing with the top cut off. Why is it that what I see and a screen shot sees are 2 different things?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said above, I tried to re-size everything to readjust it but that was "After" this problem started happening and nothing I could do to re-size the appearance worked. Doesn't matter if I set everything to the smallest setting, or to the largest setting.
 Everything still has it's top cut off unless I take a screen shot, then the browser buttons shows otherwise they don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[Last update]</p>
<p>Ok I finally figured it out..geezzsh lol</p>
<p>I do remember something did happen the other day. I was moving the monitor back &nbsp;and I remember I accidentally hit one of the monitor buttons. Well just now I went through every button on it and i don't know what button it's called but it readjust some settings
 in it and everything went back to the way it used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now "ALL" my top's are showing again (Thank God)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wished I would of thought of that sooner before making this post lol</p>

    <title>Error prompt &#58; &#34;Launching Application Verification&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delraybuzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error prompt &#58; &#34;Launching Application Verification&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I boot up since yesterday,&nbsp; a very small window opens&nbsp; reading "Launching Application Verification",&nbsp; and happening about the same time,&nbsp; I noticed on&nbsp;my new Modem Xfinity&nbsp; **** TG862 , the internet light remains steady,&nbsp; not flashing any longer
 when I am online.&nbsp; The digital voice light flashes when being used,&nbsp; but all the rest of the lights are white and steady.</p>
<p>Last week I tried to download an early version of a program which was incompatible with my Windows 7,&nbsp; but I was unable to change the settings so I dropped the whole idea.
</p>
<p>I called Comcast for instructions on fixing my modem and getting rid of that verification launch,&nbsp; but they could not give me instructions unless I bought their support program.&nbsp; So here I am with a Modem less than a month old,&nbsp; and wondering what is wrong,&nbsp;
 if anything!</p>
<p>I used the RESET button,&nbsp; disconnected&nbsp; and reconnected both the Ethernet cable (I have not installed wireless yet) and the electric cord.</p>
<p>Can anyone either help me,&nbsp; reassure me,&nbsp; or re-direct me about this phenomenon?&nbsp; Or am I not having any problems? I am able to access the Internet just fine,&nbsp; but the non-flashing lights and small Window worry me!</p>
<p>Thanks for any help I receive.</p>

            <p>My Windows 7 doesn't recognize the <em>misconfig.exe</em>&nbsp; in the search box.&nbsp; It may be because I never set up Administrative rights.&nbsp; It wants me to go to the system configuration,&nbsp; which Microsoft warns not to do unless someone is there to save whatever
 harm I may cause!&nbsp; (We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.)&nbsp; That
 makes me a bit nervous!</p>
<p>I suspect you may be correct,&nbsp; since I tried downloading an outmoded printing program by changing to a compatible setting.&nbsp; It still would not download,&nbsp; as I think it was made for windows XP and earlier!
</p>
<p>I've been searching for files,&nbsp; bits of downloads,&nbsp; tried system restore,&nbsp; but reversed it as it made no difference. I don't know if&nbsp;that application verification &nbsp;is warning me of harm to my computer,&nbsp; or should I simply ignore it?&nbsp; I don't want trouble
 in the future due to ignoring a warning!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp; step 4 says ". If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points"...and as I read on, the fact that I don't recall,&nbsp; or cannot
 locate what I had tried to download,&nbsp; seems to me to be a lesson in futility! </p>
<p>I will closely watch my boot for a bit,&nbsp; as I do not recall noticing the error the last day or 2!&nbsp; The clean boot,&nbsp; losing restore points,&nbsp; and then reverting to a normal boot is a bit daunting for me.&nbsp; I'll get back when I have more time to really study
 this.</p>
<p>Again,&nbsp; thank you.</p>

Performed a clean boot tonight.&nbsp; Looked at all downloads,&nbsp; but saw nothing there that I've had problems with.&nbsp; I recall trying to download American Greeting Cards Creatacard which did not download since it was created for earlier versions of windows,&nbsp; And I
 recall trying to change settings to allow this disc to download.&nbsp; I never downloaded,&nbsp; but I don't recall how to check on the setting I may have changed to allow for an XP and earlier download.&nbsp; Could that be causing this "verify launching application" search
 ?</p>
<p>How would I find and fix it?&nbsp; Or is it possibly something else?</p>
<p>Is it possible Microsoft installed something in a recent &nbsp;Security Essentials update that might be causing this small Window?&nbsp; It appears after all my Icons are visible and the cursor stops "whirling" and becomes stable.</p>
<p>I have reverted to Normal Boot without any noticeable changes</p>
<p>Any further recommendations?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I understand that you still have problems with the computer.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> key and then type “<strong>msconfig</strong>” without quotes and press
<strong>ENTER.</strong><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
b. On the <strong>‘General’ </strong>tab, click ‘<strong>Selective Startup’</strong>.<br />
c. Under<strong> Selective Startup,</strong> click to clear the ‘<strong>Load Startup Items’</strong> check box.<br />
d. Click the ‘<strong>Services tab’</strong>, click to select the <strong>‘Hide All Microsoft Services’</strong> check box, and then click ‘<strong>Disable All’.</strong><br />
e. Click <strong>‘Apply’</strong> and ‘<strong>OK</strong>’.<br />
f. When you are prompted, click <strong>‘Restart’</strong>.<br />
g. After the computer starts, check if the issue persists. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>If still the issue persists, then try creating a new user account by following the Method 2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>I would suggest you to <strong>create a new user account</strong> and see if that fix the issue. Follow the below link to create a new account:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-7</a></div>

            <p>I performed several more clean boots,&nbsp; and even searched the events log in Control Panel Security section.&nbsp; Still, when I log on in normal boot,&nbsp; I see that small Window&nbsp; titled Launching applications containing the words '<b>verifying</b>
<b>application</b> <b>requirements'.</b></p>
<p><strong>I feel if I knew exactly where to search,&nbsp; I might find the event or aborted download that started this whole thing!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm not ready to go through the entire process of creating a new user account,&nbsp; as I imagine it means changing passwords to all my Microsoft accounts, etc,&nbsp; which is more involved than I am ready to do!&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there another forum where this pop-up is examined?&nbsp; I am concerned it will eventually stop my using various programs.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sorry,&nbsp; I did not mean to use the bold font,&nbsp; but I can't find where to return to regular!</strong></p>
<p><strong>...</strong></p>
<p><strong>I just found a program in files that coincides datewise with that disc I tried to install for creating greeting cards.&nbsp;&nbsp; Events showed there was an error that was not fixed.&nbsp; I either wrecked my computer or may have fixed the problem,&nbsp; but I deleted
 the 2 files involved with that event, and I will try a reboot and let you know!&nbsp; Hang in there!</strong></p>

    <title>Inescapable Blue Screen of Death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephamsel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inescapable Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    <p>I'm no stranger to that dreaded blue screen, but I've never personally encountered a situation in which it wasn't obviously a software/virus issue. Recently, as Windows was attempting to install updates the installation failed and it took its sweet time
 reverting the changes only to give me a BSoD upon startup. The error message I received was "BAD_POOL_HEADER". I restarted in safe mode and scanned the computer with my antivirus to be safe, and when nothing was found and no further BSoDs were seen, I assumed
 it was a glitch of some sort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, fast forward to today/yesterday, and once again Windows wanted to install updates. I postponed it for as long as I needed, and once left unattended long enough, the installation process began. However, after some time the computer restarted along
 with the startup noise, only to shut off and repeat over and over. I caught it at the login screen and went ahead and entered the password. No sooner had the desktop shown than the dreaded BSoD returned. It gave the same "BAD_POOL_HEADER" error message, and
 subsequently did the same thing each time I attempted a normal boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to boot successfully in safe mode (the computer works fine and hasn't crashed yet; I'm currently in safe mode with networking), and through that I ran a Check Disk; the chkdsk took around three or so hours to complete, and reported no bad sectors,
 but did say something about free space being allocated as something else, but I didn't get a chance to fully read that before it restarted and the BSoD process began again. I subsequently ran the memory diagnostic tool, and while it didn't indicate any memory
 issues while in the blue screen, I read that the official results would be listed after the computer had booted again. However, as the computer crashes immediately after normal booting, I never saw any report on the status of the memory. I found a back way
 to access the results, but the instructions didn't work for me, and I assumed that it was because I'm in safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I tried a system restore to the most recent (and only) restore point I had, but that didn't change anything. The error code information that I was given is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;BCCode:<span> </span>19<br />
&nbsp; BCP1:<span> </span>0000000000000020<br />

&nbsp; BCP3:<span> </span>FFFFFA8008FAF4A0<br />
&nbsp; BCP4:<span> </span>0000000004020008<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:<span> </span>6_1_7601<br />
&nbsp; Service Pack:<span> </span>1_0<br />
&nbsp; Product:<span> </span>768_1<br />
</p>
<p>DMP file on OneDrive:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/u/s!ArlgNoFKc4wXfTJcOnxAvtMarvU</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've seen and read so far, it seems the issue might be with either the RAM or a driver, however I have no idea how to properly check either of those things, in safe mode or not. I'd really like to be able to figure out what exactly is causing these
 problems before I consult with any compute repair business, and, if possible, fix the issue myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all information/help that you can provide on this issue would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>The quality of Skype. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justsomeguy23  say:</h3>
<h2>            The quality of Skype.</h2>
                    <p>(I can only choose Skype for Windows, but this is Windows, iOS and Android.)<br />
<br />
Ever since Microsoft bought Skype, it's quality has been deteriorating.<br />
<br />
I all to often cannot get messages across to contacts and vice versa.<br />
<br />
But these last years is has gotten TOO bad. I get angry complaints from customers because I didn't get all the messages.. some I did, but not all. Skype does not just sync up the missing messages once services are restored or whatever is happening.<br />
<br />
I can't use Skype anymore because it simply doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Scenario: I'm sitting at home, besides another person, and want to send this person a link. This often does not work, and I have to email it like an insane person.<br />
<br />
We can communicate with 40 years old junk beyond our solar system, but your billion dollar project can't even get a message to the person next to me.<br />
<br />
The dissapointment infuriates me to the core. As a developer I'm ashamed that a project this big can be this bad. It disgusts me.<br />
</p>
<p>So I want to have a discussion about the quality of Skype. What is going on? What are you doing to fix this? Why is it so hard?</p>

</p><p>One of the factors contributing to&nbsp;issues in&nbsp;<em>Instant Messaging</em> is the

<p>This is exactly what is so horribly annoying about Skype. It's the way you ignore the problems. Bugs are completely OK, as long as you respect the users and don't treat them with such disrespect as saying that it's the internet connection and other vague
 unhelpful garbage.<br />
It's not the connection that's the problem.<br />
For instance, I just installed fresh windows 10 on a new desktop computer, open up Skype and only receive a fraction of the messages I should be getting.&nbsp;<br />
They appear perfectly on my mobile and my 7 year old laptop. But not on the fresh install. (Google WiFi on all devices, all perfect 100/30mbit connection.)<br />
This problem is completely random usually. Messages just don't sync correctly.<br />
No other service I have has this problem. Hangout, Facebook, EMAILS, Slack, you name it.<br />
<br />
I'll repeat, because you'll ignore what I just said. This problem randomly appears across devices. Galaxy to Galaxy, Galaxy to PC, Laptop to Galaxy.. it's nothing to do with the devices. This has been a problem for years but it has steadily gotten far worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now it has reached a point where it's all a god damned mess.<br />
<br />
Please treat this with some respect and actually answer my questions please.<br />

<p>
</p><p>We have identified the root cause of the issue and we released a fix recently with many customers reporting that all is now back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do apologize for the recent inconveniences caused as a result of the move to the new Skype but rest assured, we are working flat out to ensure Skype remains the go to communications tool for all Skype lovers out there.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>You may refer to the following article and try the steps provided and check if it helps:</p>
<p>You cannot install some updates or programs</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/822798</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p><span>You may try performing a clean boot. </span><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and see if you are able to install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click <b>Start</b>. Click <b>Run</b>, type “<b>msconfig.exe</b>” (without quotes), and then press
<b>Enter</b> to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. On the <b>General tab</b>, click <b>Selective Startup</b>, and then <b>
click to clear the Load startup items </b>check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the <b>Services tab</b>, click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box, and then click
<b>Disable all.</b> Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in a clean boot state then you can find the cause for the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following article to do the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Perform a clean startup to determine whether background programs are interfering with your game or program</a></span></p>

<b>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</b><br />
<br />
If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
If you continue to get BSOD here are some more things you may want to consider.<br />
<br />
This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that it is driver related (rare).<br />
<br />
<b><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</b> <br />
<b>Synopsis:</b><br />
<br />
A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.
<br />
<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</b><br />
<br />
1) Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked. Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable ways.<br />
<br />
2) Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.<br />
&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.<br />
<br />
3) Update all hardware-related drivers: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.
<br />
It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.<br />
<br />
4) Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions. <br />
Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.<br />
<br />
5) Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).
<br />
At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.<br />
<br />
6) Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components which can be put through their paces artificially.
<br />
The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s). <br />
For the RAM, use the in-built memory diagnostics (run MDSCHED) or the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing.<br />
For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".
<br />
Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee that the RAM is
 free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.<br />
<br />
7) As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates, or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows
 7 disc.<br />
Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps. <br />
If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether the machine
 is still free from 0x124 crashes. <br />
Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.<br />
<br />
If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.
<br />
Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:<br />
<br />
8) Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine. <br />
Reseat all connectors and memory modules. <br />
Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.<br />
<br />
9) If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.
<br />
Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.<br />
<br />
<b>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's
 hardware.</b><br />
<br />

            <span>For Surface Go, we recommend using a charger that provides 15 watts and above. If you use a charger that’s less than 12 watts, your battery might not charge if you’re doing things on your Surface that use more power (for example, watching videos
 or something similar). In this case, your battery level would go down. Please refer to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface battery won’t charge or Surface won’t run on battery</a>. &nbsp;

<p>Hey there Neon! I understand you are having some trouble downloading game updates. When you say every game, about how many games have you had trouble updating recently? Also, you were able to successfully update the console again, but still cannot update
 games, correct?<br />
<br />
First, how are you connected to the network? If you aren't already, try connecting the console directly to the modem with an ethernet cable. Then try connecting to LIVE and updating the games. You may need to clear the system cache again (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a>).
 Let us know if that helps. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Rate Neon! There is a possibility it is a connection issue, but can you first try updating using a USB or CD. To help you if it is a network issue, can you tell us a bit more about your set up? Is UPnP enabled? Do you get a NAT error of any sort when
 you run a connection test? When you run that connection test, can you press "Y" for more information and provide us with the X/Y/Z codes? Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thumbnails are being set depending on what program are you using to open the said file and on what kind of file it is. Currently, you may only enable or disable Thumbnail view for a file or folder in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this by right-clicking on the folder for which you want to enable the Thumbnail view, and click
<strong>Properties</strong>. Then click to select the <strong>Enable Thumbnail View</strong> or click to de-select it, and then click
<strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there are other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Mail app - insert hyperlink or picture</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using&nbsp;the Mail App daily (and love it!), but I can't figure out how to do two things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to insert a <a href="http://This-Is-a-HyperLink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hyperlink</a> or a picture into the body of an email in the Mail App? If not, are there any plans to add this functionality anytime soon?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>You can&nbsp;copy and paste a link or picture into a mail message - for example, you can switch to IE and copy the URL in the address bar (Ctrl+C), then switch to the Mail app and type Ctrl+V. If you want to use touch - tap and hold the address bar in IE until
 a box appears, then tap Copy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 problems, taskbar and updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sara kaczmarek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 problems, taskbar and updates</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I have a Dell N5050 laptop, 64-bit operating system. Since I have upgraded the taskbar on the bottom of my screen will disappear then reappear and all the programs pinned to the taskbar reload from the sides
 to the center. &nbsp;When it does this everything else freezes, so if I am typing nothing shows up during the time that the taskbar acts up. Even afterwards, I have to reclick the window I have open and replace my cursor before I can finish typing. It does this
 about every 30-60 seconds. When it happens the CPU jumps from 2% to 45%. How do I fix this problem so it doesn't keep glitching?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I go to update and security it says 3 updates are available,&nbsp;Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3173428),&nbsp;Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3172985), and&nbsp;Security Update for Adobe Flash
 Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3174060). However, then it says&nbsp;Battery Saver is turned on, so we've paused downloads. We'll start downloading again when Battery Saver is turned off, but I have gone to battery saver and it says
 it's currently turned off. The updates still will not download, though. How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h3> toller67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed Installation of SQL Server 2012</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install SQL Server 2012. I downloaded SQLEXPRADV_x64_ENU.exe and tried to run it. It goes through the mothins of opening the file and then I'm offered the choice of a new install or an upgrade to a previous version. I select the new install.
 The program starts to run and then stops with an error message of </p>
<p>
</p><p>"SQL Server Setup has encountered the following error:</p>
<p>Failed to retriever data for this request ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I OK it and get the following message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Check online for a solution ...</p>
<p>Close the program"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking online for a solution yields nothing. So, I close the program but not before I call up the option "View problem details." This is what is listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;Description:<br />

&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1033<br />
<br />
On the SQL Server "forum" they were (are) stumped but one person suggested that I might need to load .Net Framework 3.5.1. So I downloaded that file (dotnetfx35setup) and tried to run that. Lo and behold ... nothing happens. When I check the control panel,
 Microsoft .net framework 3.5.1 isn't listed so I guess that didn't run either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new Dell XPS 8700 (less than a month old). What can I do? Tonight I saw something that hintgs that I need .net framework 2. However, in kivght of every other attempt failing, I'm reluctant to try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!!!</p>

<p><span><span>Hello linabx,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Where
 did you find the modifying the ‘xorg.conf’ would fix the mouse issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Was
 the mouse working fine before?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Have
 you checked if it is working on a different computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows does not allow modifying the ‘xorg.conf’ if the mouse is not working properly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you follow the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the mouse is working on a different computer. In few cases the issue could be related to hardware and mouse being defective. I suggest that
 you connect the mouse to a different computer and check if it works fine.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Reinstall the drivers for your mouse:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Make sure that you download the latest driver for your
 touchpad and then uninstall the drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Start and type ‘Device Manager’.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Bscsisda.sys Error when UltraSD card is inserted in Windows10 Laptop</h2>
                    Hello, So I have an UltraSD card that cannot be detected on my Windows10 laptop. I want to recover my old files but can't seem to recover using data recovery software since, as mentioned, my SD card cannot be detected on the PC. I already tried updating
 my SD card driver (Broadcom SD Host Controller) but after a few minutes when my SD is inserted on my laptop's SD card slot it gets the bscsisda.sys error (blue screen of death). I badly want to recover my files so bad, it would be nice if I can ask help from
 you guys. Thank you.

            Hi Ray,<br />
<br />
The SYS files such as bscsisda.sys are third-party device drivers or critical system files that come as part of the Windows operating system. This allows the computer or hardware to communicate with the operating system or programs.<br />
<br />
SYS file errors are typically caused by corrupted device driver files, or actual faulty device or hardware.<br />
<br />
I've read somewhere that due to the importance of .sys in the functionality of host controller and other Windows functions, any damage or corruption to the said file can create critical system errors. This is the reason why you're getting the stop error: blue
 screen whenever you try to connect your SD card after you've updated the driver.<br />
<br />
You may try to use another computer and see if it can detect the SD card.<br />
Also, if you haven't tried to use an external card reader, check if that would help as a workaround.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ultimately, if the above workaround didn't sort it, you'd need to contact your local technician to recover the contents of your SD card.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let me know if you have other concerns.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you restart the computer in Safe Mode you could see if the error still occurs.</p>

            Hi there, first of all, thank you for replying and extending your help. I can't seem to understand the .dmp file since it's in random symbols, I think it's because i just opened it using notepad. Thank you and I hope to hear from you soon.

            Thank you so much for replying and extending your help, it's much appreciated. Well, last time I tried using a different laptop and the SD card still won't read. Do you have any suggestions beside calling a technician for the job. I am very much interested
 in learning how to handle these sorts of problems since a lot of my customers also seek help when it comes to data recovery. Thank you and have a good one.

<p>You need a debugger to read them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One you could try is the WinDbg Preview which is available from the Windows Store:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you able to provide a .dmp file via OneDrive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure to copy the .dmp file to another location prior to uploading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what computer do you have (make/model)?</p>
