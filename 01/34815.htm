    <title>Sudden appearance of yellow swirly arrows overlay icons in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> catrobson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sudden appearance of yellow swirly arrows overlay icons in Windows 7 Explorer</h2>
                    Today, nearly all my files and folders have a yellow swirly arrow overlay icon. I can't find this icon referred to anywhere online. Also, nearly all my files and folder have switched to "Read Only." I've changed them all back, but the yellow arrow icon
 remains so it doesn't appear to be related.

</div>
<div>Does anyone have experience with these issues?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<h3> thomas dangremond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nondestructive Reinstall Win 7</h2>
                    <div>&nbsp;I am trying to do a Nondestructive reinstall of Win7 Ultimate.&nbsp; I am using the downloaded Win 7 Ultimate 64Bt, X17-59465. ISO file from 6/12 and it seems to run ok.&nbsp; But, I keep getting
<u>blocked at the compatibility check</u>.&nbsp; I have uninstalled, deleted the driver, cleaned the Registry, &amp; restarted many times, but I can't get past the compatibility check.&nbsp; The Compatibility Report reads
<i>"The following issues are preventing Windows from upgrading.&nbsp; Cancel the upgrade, complete each task, and then restart the upgrade to continue.&nbsp; An error prevented a required compliance check from completing. &nbsp; Cancel the installation and try upgrading again.
 Upgrading Windows will affect the following devices and/or programs: These devices might not work properly after the upgrade.&nbsp; Before upgrading, we recommend updating the drivers for these devices.&nbsp; Cancel the upgrade, open Control Panel and search for "update
 device drivers", or go to the device manufacturer's website to search for updated drivers. &nbsp; Imaging devices: EPSON Perfection 2400".</i> &nbsp; I have uninstalled the driver, and got a "new" driver from MS.&nbsp; But I can't find anything in the Device Manager. &nbsp; I
 have also tried running the Win 7 install in Compatibility mode as Vista SP2,&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; Any suggestions for getting the reinstall past the compatibility check?<br />

<p>I've just got help from a lovely lady in Philippines. Don't know if it'll work. We'll see in a couple of days, when the fatidic installation is supposed to take place.</p>
<p>The key is in the Windows update settings. My system is Windows 8.1; I assume it will work with other OS.</p>
<p>-Go to 'Start', then 'Search'. Type 'PC settings'. </p>
<p>-On the left, at the bottom, go to 'Update and recovery'. </p>
<p>-On the right, click on 'Choose how updates get installed'. Then, 'Important updates'.
</p>
<p>-In the dropdown menu choose 'Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them'.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>Good luck to us all.</p>

            <p>Figured that out after my post and did the same thing in Windows 7 and it stops the update from automatically downloading; so that nonsense is fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also hid the "GWX - Get Windows Icon" on the taskbar. That was annoying popping up every time I booted up.&nbsp; But it seems to be fixed since I chose Hide Icon and Notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still&nbsp;mad that there's no way to rid my laptop permanently of anything Windows 10 related and had to resort to software kludging my settings!&nbsp;</p>

            I did the same thing and it worked for a short time, but I kept getting the update showing up as a download and it would download without giving me the option to start it. &nbsp;Then I had to click stop. &nbsp;Now it does not even show up, it just says important
 download. &nbsp;When I check other downloads to get for Windows 8.1, I get Windows 10 download first so I cannot get other updates without downloading Windows 10. &nbsp;Windows 10 is &nbsp;incompatible with my computer. &nbsp;I do not want it. &nbsp;How can I stop it permanently?

            A friend told me that even though both she and I have my Windows 7 working that Windows 10 is still in there and on her computer also. &nbsp;She downloads the updates, but says they only go to Windows 10. &nbsp;She wants them so that when Windows 10 gets all fixed
 up, she will have it free along with all the updates. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm still thinking on that...!

            I have tried everything, but unless Microsoft allows , it will continue to try downloading win 10.&nbsp; It also blocks you from updating other software.&nbsp; It SUCKS!

            <p><span>Totally agree. I have complained to the Competition and Markets Authority in UK regarding the misleading nature of Microsoft's
 offer to upgrade for free to Windows 10, and to the fact that we are now forced to the upgrade if we want our PCs to receive and install updates for all Microsoft products (OS, Office, etc.) and other non-Microsoft sofware.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It may be possible to compel Microsoft into fair trade practices, at least on this issue, if a seizable number of us engage in
 political action by contacting our representatives (MPs in UK, Congressperson in USA, and so on).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have attached the content of my notification form to CMA below (please nothe the legislation mentioned only apply to UK), in
 case it can be of help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>===</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUE</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-Microsoft offered me a free upgrade to their new operative system (OS) Windows 10 (W10) in July 2015.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-I initially accepted the offer by getting their Windows 10 app, which told me when I could begin the process of upgrading to W10. The app also told me that I could choose when to make the
 actual upgrade by selecting a day and time.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-When the launch of this new OS took place this month, W10 was downloaded on my PC –not fully installed, only downloaded; that is, the upgrade to W10 has not taken place yet.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-My plan was to schedule the upgrade in 2016, when the expected ‘teething problems’ had been resolved.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-The app then gave me only the next three days to schedule the upgrade. I postponed to the last day and proceeded to contact Microsoft’s support team (at my own telephone expense) to arrange
 for a later upgrade.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-I was advised to modify the settings of ‘Windows Update’ so that I could reject the upgrade. This modification states: ‘Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install
 them’. Please note that W10 is already downloaded, but I do not wish to install (upgrade to) it.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-I was told they could not help me further, as there is not an option to schedule the upgrade beyond three days. This conversation with a member of Microsoft’s support team took place on
 the 6<sup>th</sup> August 2015.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-Since then, Microsoft has been pushing the upgrade to W10 by bombarding my PC with notifications and reschedules for the upgrade every time I start my computer. If I ignore them, the countdown
 for the upgrade (15 minutes) begins automatically.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-Additionally, Microsoft has made upgrading to W10 the unavoidable step prior to download any other update of their software (all updates to my current OS Windows 8.1, all security updates,
 and all Microsoft software updates, like Office). Hence, my current licensed PC is being left out of the updates needed to keep it safe and operational. The modification to the ‘Windows Update’ setting mentioned above has been the means by which Microsoft
 is withholding all updates; please note that such modification was the only way to stop the unwanted upgrade, according to Microsoft’s support team.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-Moreover, other software in my PC (which does not belong to Microsoft) cannot be updated.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-I have sought further help from Microsoft’s support team unsuccessfully. I have reviewed internet forums and reached the conclusion that this situation is happening all over the world: consumers
 are forced to accept a product (albeit free) they do not want, or otherwise suffer the consequences of their rejection by enduring the problems associated to software obsolescence –as software is prevented from being updated.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-I believe this practice to force Microsoft users into upgrading to W10, and penalising consumers by upholding all necessary software updates if they do not wish to upgrade to W10, is in
 contravention to the ‘Right to reject’ in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-Furthermore, I believe Microsoft is in breach of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, which states that ‘goods must be as described, of satisfactory quality&nbsp;and fit for purpose’, since there was
 not an accurate explanation of the time scale and the implications of the upgrade, thus misleading the consumer: 1) into believing there was an ample period of time to schedule the upgrade; 2) by not declaring that once the download had taken place, there
 was no option to change your mind and reject the upgrade; 3) and by not warning the consumer that all updates will be withhold by Microsoft until the upgrade to W10 had taken place.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>-Lastly, my PC, which cannot download and install updates for its software, has been left vulnerable to attack. Therefore, my privacy and personal data is at risk, protected only by my antivirus
 software. I am not cognizant of specific legislation to protect me from this threat (‘domestic purposes’ are not included within the Data Protection Act 1998), but I thought it relevant to let you know.
</span></p>

<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>I truly hope I have given you all the necessary information to address this problem. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need further clarification and/or information.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Thank you. </span>

            <p>On my Win 7 X64 system, I received and inadvertently installed an update to Windows Update which began launching the "Upgrade to Windows 10" flag.&nbsp; The upgrade instructions for that update had a caveat which I unfortunately ignored.&nbsp; Once that update was
 installed, windows update no longer offers the "hide this update" option which was included in the standard update management interface for Windows 7.&nbsp; I believe this update came out back in April or May, long before Win 10 was released.&nbsp; THEY KNEW THAT THEY
 PLANNED TO TRAP THE MAJORITY OF USERS of earlier versions of Windows into migrating to the new code.&nbsp; I strongly suspect that coming up sometime in 2016/17 you will see Microsoft attempt to migrate all of their product line to the Office 360 subscription model
 so that your system will simply be "renting" the code from Microsoft for everything it is capable of doing, and if you stop paying rent, they plan to cut you off...</p>

 back to regular Skype; However, we have recently discovered that you can no longer register a new Skype account with a work or school email address. We cannot find resolution to either one of our problems. How do we resolve?</p>

            That is not what I am looking for I think. According to information for fixing the Virtual Device Driver format in Registry is Invalid there may also be a problem in the command.com file. It is recommended to check if there is an error with the file. I
 guess what I can not find is the root.

            Hi Ruth
<br />
<br />The best thing to do is to download and install the version of Realtek for your device form the support page on the Manufacturers website
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty finding that drive, what is the Make and exact Model No.of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<h2>            Blending Music in Live Movie Maker</h2>
                    <div>On movie maker you could blend two songs together.&nbsp; As one song was ending, you could start the other song.&nbsp; It made for a nice transition, but you cannot do that with Live Movie Maker, any suggestions if this is possible.&nbsp; I loved that feature.&nbsp;

            It sounds like the .mswmm file extension isn't set to open WMM 6.0, but might be set to open in Windows Live Movie Maker. &nbsp;You could right-click on the .mswmm file, chose "Open with..." and pick WMM 6.0 in C:\Program Files\Movie Maker.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Memory Diagnostics usually stalls when it detects an issue with the hardware. Although it takes only a few minutes for each progression of 1% up to 21%, the indicator may remain on 21% for hours. This may not necessarily mean that it froze, and the
 test may complete successfully. We suggest you rerun the test overnight, and give it ample time to complete. We'd like to know if you overclocked the RAM. If so, set it to default and run the tests individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the status of the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Chris, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling the lock screen in Windows 10 can be facilitated by performing changes in the registry of your device as well as editing user account settings. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The edition, version, and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li><li>If your device is managed by a domain or an organization. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest approach would be to remove the existing password that your account is using. If you're using a local account, you can perform the steps posted under the To remove an existing password from a local account section of this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14064/windows-8-sign-in-to-windows-without-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. If you're using a Microsoft account, you'd need to switch to a local account to facilitate your request. The link will also provide the steps to complete this.</p>

    <title>GTA V Replacement Disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mangerman360  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA V Replacement Disc</h2>
                    
<p>Not sure if anyone can advise, but if not I'm still having a moan, my son moved the xbox whilst playing GTA V, this resulted in the circle scratch, so I went onto Rockstars support website and asked for the process for getting a paid replacement, they don't
 have that facility apparently, they only take back non damaged discs within 90 days, why someone would return a disc that;'s not damaged seems ridiculous.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas, a multi million selling game franchise and they expect me to buy it again, when a simple disc swap for a nominal fee should be easy enough to do such as Microsoft offer.</p>

<p>Not happy with them and their "support" guy was absolutely useless...</p>

<p>Microsoft do have a service like this, but it is only for their own published games. &nbsp;The only thing you can do is try to get the disc repaired. Most game stores have a machine that can buff the scratch out. &nbsp;But it doesn't always work, as it depends on
 how deep the scratch is.</p>

<p>The answer to your question about why Rockstar would expect you to buy a new copy is quite simply because the damage is your fault. &nbsp;I'm sure Rockstar would've replaced the disc if it was faulty but that isn't the issue here. &nbsp;What happened was user error
 and as such the only one responsible is you and your son. &nbsp;The Xbox 360 manual very clearly states not to move the console while it is in use.<br />
<br />
I know this is not the answer you probably wanted to hear but it's the truth. &nbsp;Children under 13 must be monitored at all time while using the Xbox per your agreement with Microsoft and--as an adult--you should have known to at least peruse the safety warnings
 about the console which would have notified you about the risks involved in shifting a device that has a laser and a disc moving at high speeds during operation.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, I will bear in mind your signature with my reply. Yes it was my fault but I am not asking Rockstar for a free replacement, just because an accident occoured does not mean that I should have to buy a new game, that's not customer service,
 that's money grabbing. I work in the software industry, albeit not in games, but our customers can buy media cheap if they are correctly licensed, in case of an event such &nbsp;as this, I know Games are different, but Microsoft, as do many other companies, have
 a replacement program so I'm not asking for something out of the ordinary here, and can you honestly say Rockstars policy is fair? I can send a disc back to prove it's damaged and all they need to do is supply me with another disc, no doubt costing them pennies,
 then charge me £6-£10 and they have a happy customer and a damn fine profit. But it seems that profit is not enough for them. So thanks for pointing out it was my fault, I know that. Last rockstar game I'll be buying, and they wonder why software piracy is
 rife</p>

<p>As someone who works in game retail, I can assure you that this policy is widespread - There are vast numbers of customers who regularly damage their discs in the way that has occured in your situation, and no retailer/company will replace a disc that has
 been broken subsequent to purchase for a discounted price - unless you take out an accidental warranty on the disc, as various companies offer.
</p>
<p>Whilst it may be difficulty to stomach, the answer is that the damage is nothing to do with the company that made/provided the game to you, therefore they are completely void of any responsibility of said damage - and with all due respect, expecting them
 to reduce their profit margin by providing you a discounted replacement is unreasonable. Replacement programmes only exist when the customer has a faulty product or they take out an accidental warranty.</p>

<p>Do I personally agree with Rockstar's policy? &nbsp;Not in the slightest but we do live in the world of free-market capitalism and as such they can get away with it. &nbsp;As you said, the company sells an insanely large number of copies and--relatively speaking--releases
 very few games per generation. &nbsp;As such they know that their titles will be in demand and that they can set whatever price they wish.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth I wasn't trying to upset you but one should know better than to move a system when in use.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>We are testing the online Skype for business capabilities, that is why I started a trial O365 Enterprise E3 today. Unfortunately I do not find any way to add a SIP URI for Conferencing service (same as Conferencing - Dial-in Access Number - SIP URI in the
 control panel of the on-premise S4B).</p>
<p>Can I define a common conferencing SIP URI in S4B Online?</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />

<p>Hi Laci,</p>
<p>This feature is only available in on-premises servers as you know. It’s not feasible to set up an SIP URI for Skype for Business Online conference in Office 365.</p>
<p>Thanks for your understanding.&nbsp;</p>

            Password Box stopped working for everyone who upgraded to Firefox 40 recently, not just people using Windows 10 (I'm still on 8.1).&nbsp; Firefox stopped supporting widgets and password box used widgets.&nbsp; Password Box has started working again with FF 40.0.2
 so maybe Mozilla has relented, at least temporarily.

<div>Hi Ashwee37,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which is the edition of Windows installed on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We did check for the compatibility of Sim Ant with Windows 7 and found that the game is not compatible. Check this link for more information:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=sim ant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=sim%20ant</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The workaround for this game is to use it on Windows XP mode. Windows XP Mode runs some older productivity programs that might not run on Windows 7.
<br />
Download Windows XP Mode: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            My computer&#39;s sound has had a red x by it on and off for the last month saying that no audio output device is installed.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Code 45 Audio Output</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lenovo yoga pro 3. My computer's sound has had a red x by it on and off for the last month saying that no audio output device is installed. When I click on playback devices, it says that no audio devices are installed. When I try to troubleshoot,
 it says to restart the computer. When I restart, the problem is not resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the device manager to check the status on the sound. In order to view both audio inputs and outputs and sound, video and game controllers, I have to view hidden devices. I tried to update the device driver software as well as searched for additional
 software. These options say that everything is up to date. My computer currently lists Conexant Smart Audio HD as the potential device. When I check the properties on this, it lists code 45. I am supposed to reconnect the device to the computer, but I have
 no clue how to do this. I tried to add legacy hardware and tried updating again, but nothing works. Every time it says that there is no driver function associated with adding anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried going to the lenovo site, the realtek did not work properly and the other download option for a sound driver would not download. I looked up my update history and it doesn't seem like anything would have affected the sound. Therefore I do not
 believe that a recovery would not be that beneficial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey there UKlilMiss1976.<br /><br />Make sure that the region of your son's account and Xbox One are set to your physical locale. It's possible that your Xbox One is set to a different time zone which would lead to the timer resetting at different intervals. Keep us in the loop if that isn't the case :)</p>

            <p>Hey there!<br /><br />Apologies for the delay in response. This particular issue is super odd, so we can further narrow it down can you clarify if your Xbox One is set to Instant On or Energy Saving?</p>

<h2>            White dash at the top left of boot screen</h2>
                    <p>On the boot up screen that says Starting Up in Windows 7 I have a white dash at the top left of the screen, seems to blink 3 times then is solid, I can boot in to&nbsp;Windows fine, but I would like to know if there is a reason why this has just appeared since
 yesterday, It happens everytime I switch on the PC and also when I restart it?</p>
<p>I have done a repair on the mbr and done a full reload of Windows from a clean install, the only thing I have noticed is my numlock on my keyboard</p>
<p>comes on when I first switch the PC on, but thurns off again by the time the PC has booted to the desktop (numlock is enabled in bios) not sure</p>
<p>if this could lead to the white dash at the top left of the screen at the (Starting Windows screen during boot)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to get rid of it, or is it a sign of a problem on its way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all the latest Windows updates,&nbsp;drivers etc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks..</p>

            <p>I've managed to sort this strange problem out, there was a setting in the bios called Windows Boot Manager, I have disabled that (probably a bios update enabled that) and now everything is working fine..</p>
<p>With Windows Boot Manager enabled in the bios, when i was re-installing windows it created 3 partitions on each of the hard drives i have in my system, one partition&nbsp;called MSR Reserved (does not create this partition now)
</p>
<p>This really look like a graphics card or memory error when i was having problems, I'll have to do some research on the MSR partition and find out what &nbsp;the Windows Boot Manager does in the bios.</p>
