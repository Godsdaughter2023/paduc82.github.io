<p><span>Hi purebarnsley,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do you get
 any error message after inserting the disk into the CD/DVD drive?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does the DVD
 drive get detected in Windows Explorer (<strong>Computer)</strong>as a<strong> </strong>
removable drive? </span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does the issue
 occur with a particular disk or all the disks in general?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does the disk
 play fine on another computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What’s the
 make and model of your computer/disk drive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to try and check if other disk/s (CD/DVDs) play fine without any issues. Also check if the disk you’re trying to play works fine on a different computer
 with a CD/DVD drive, if feasible. Also check for any scratches which might be preventing the disc from getting detected.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, check for the status of the CD/DVD drive in Device Manager.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click<strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>device manager </strong>in the <strong>Start</strong>search box and hit Enter.<br />
2. Expand <strong>DVD/CD-ROM drives</strong>.<br />
3. Right-click the device and select <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
4. Under <strong>General </strong>tab, check for the status of the device under <strong>
Device status</strong>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Does it show any error message/code associated with the Unknown Device? If yes, let us know the exact error message.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>In the mean time, follow the steps mentioned below to remove and reinstall the existing drivers for the DVD drive and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong><span>Collapse this
 imageExpand this ima</span>, and then click<strong>Control Panel</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>System and Security</strong>, click
<strong>System</strong>, and then click<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click <strong>System</strong>, and then click<strong>Device Manager</strong>.<span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, expand<strong>DVD/CD-ROM drives</strong>,
 right-click the CD and DVD devices, and then click<strong>Uninstall</strong>. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove
 the device, click<strong>OK</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>Have you tried working through <a href="http://xbx.lv/dFEETV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this guide</a>? And to be clear, was your console sent back from a repair center having been serviced? If the repair was completed, was it paid for, or covered under warranty? If it was paid for,
 your new warranty should still be active. <br />
<br />
If that guide doesn't resolve the issue, you'll want to set up a repair <a href="http://xbx.lv/alhhR6%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Never Ending Green Screen on launch of XBOX app on Windows 10... help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not able to launch the Windows 10 XBOX app on my computer to play my XBOX One games. It was working perfectly this morning. I went to try to launch the app, it shows the version number at the top right of the screen, disappears and just displays a green
 screen forever inside the app. I shut it down and tried again and same thing. I've restarted my computer and it still didn't fix the issue. Anyone else know the remedy to fix this issue or experienced it before? I have the latest updates for Windows 10. I've
 included some screenshots below to help assist. Thanks!</p>
<p>Version appears at top right corner for 1 second then disappears:&nbsp;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/v4bvbjm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/v4bvbjm.jpg</a></p>

<p>hej, I did have this issues also and there were issues with removing this app :(. After several times I re-login as a admin and I added a new profile.</p>
<p>Admin profile is hidden in windows 10 so before do it you have to unhide it.</p>
<p>1. uninstall xbox&nbsp; &amp; reinstall again ( available from market )</p>
<p>2. login admin profile.</p>
<p>3. remove your old profile, create a new one.</p>
<p>backup your app data and user folder first ( to restore eg steam or game saves )</p>
<p>Today I do not have any issues with a new profile , xbox app can start streaming. the only one issue that I have I cannot power on xbox console but I think this is another problem with windows and xbox</p>

<p>Hello there <strong>VipeNess</strong>! I got the same exact problem you are having and my best suggestion is for you to
 of your Xbox App. Just a disclaimer though this is a pretty advance step and would require windows power shell. If you are not confident or familiar with coding please consult someone who does or have MS or Xbox support assist you.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Before doing anything, consider creating a manual Restore Point so that you can roll back if anything bad happens.
</li><li>Although you can remove almost all of the preinstalled apps, some mandatory apps like
<a href="http://www.bellacor.com/productdetail/craftmade-crlk-ao-cortana-athenian-obol-eight-inch-light-kit-1626799.htm?partId=cjDataFeed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Cortana</span></a>, Edge browser, Contact support, Feedback, etc. cannot be removed.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Here are the steps:</strong></p>
<p>1. Make sure to close your Xbox App.</p>
<p>2. Press your <strong>Window Key + R</strong>. Then Type <strong>PowerShell</strong> and hit Enter.</p>
<p>3. Once you see Power Shell Interface: Copy and paste or Type: <strong>Get-AppxPackage *xbox*</strong></p>
<p>4. After you hit Enter you will find a load of stuff Show up. Ignore fore now. The previous step/command tries to re-download or resync your Xbox App.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>5. Try to Re-launch the Xbox App see if it now resynchronizes and works.</p>
<p><strong>IF YES</strong>: Close the Power shell and your all good.</p>
<p><strong>IF NOT:</strong> Proceed with Step no. 6.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Exit the Xbox App. Then Go back to Powershell to copy and paste this command to uninstall the Xbox App&nbsp;(If you have no coding experience, I would highly suggest copy and pasting the commands):&nbsp;<strong>Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp* | Remove-AppxPackage</strong></p>
<p>7. Press your Windows key and you will find that the Xbox App tile is no longer there. However you may still find the Xbox App on your Most Used app just a little to the left. Since you already have downloaded a copy of the app previously you should be able
 to click and launch that tile to see if the App can now synchronize your profile.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You might be asked to sign back in. In my case it was automatic.</p>
<p>Please let us know if it works or if you have further questions as&nbsp;I have worked with fellow ambassadors in trying to figure this one out.</p>
<p>Kindly give us&nbsp;Like on the Thumbs up Icon below if this works for you.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Special&nbsp;thanks&nbsp;for the help of<strong> WPAK </strong>and<strong> EvilManicBoss<br />

<h2>            PS&#47;2 mouse driver is missing while</h2>
                    hello<br />
This issue is addressed to microsoft technical people only,<br />
<br />
PS/2 mouse driver is missing while PS/2 keyboard is working,<br />
<br />
when plugging mouse to PS/2 port , mouse is not working,<br />
when plugging keyboard to PS/2 port , keyboard is working,<br />
I tried setting ease of access mouse, uninstall mouse driver then restart, problem still exists,<br />
<br />
I think there is a bug in windows, please i am asking microsoft to resolve this issue in the near future<br />
KB updates, just for your information unplug keyboard from USB port and reconnect to PS/2 or Viceversa,<br />
keyboard is working just fine, that's why i think it's a bug.

<h2>            &#34;Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media&#34;</h2>
                    I have two computers running Windows 7. When I insert a USB flash memory device it loads fine. However, when I select "Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media" I select my device, and it says it is ok to remove it. However my device is still flashing (which
 it stops flashing with Windows XP) and when I remove it I get a audio signal that the device was removed (which I don't with XP). Is it being "safely being removed"?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes you should be fine.&nbsp; If Windows say's it's OK to remove it all of your files / information that you were saving to it have been flushed to it.&nbsp; The audio singal you hear is just part of the theme, asthetics if you like and the flashing isn't a problem too.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

    <title>How do I enable the Power Icon&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I enable the Power Icon&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When I installed Windows 7 last weekend, there was a power icon in the system tray that I unintentionally disabled.&nbsp; How do I get it back?&nbsp; There is no entry for Power when I click customize on the systray so I can't enable it through the UI.&nbsp; I also looked
 in the registry to verify that&nbsp;the icon was not disabled there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The UPS shows up in the Device Manager and Powercfg correctly identifies it (APC ES550).&nbsp;&nbsp; The battery is obviously working because I can unplug the UPS and the machine continues to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be nice though, to be able to see the battery status.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've read a number of messages from people complaining about the power icon but I'd be happy just to see it.&nbsp; What's the secret here?</p>

<p>Hey there Patric!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to play Metal Gear. </p>
<p>If you haven't yet, you might want to try the other troubleshooting steps outlined in our

                    I'm using&nbsp;Bluetooth earbuds but don't want my Windows 10&nbsp;PC to be seen/discoverable by other devices. In my Bluetooth Settings the&nbsp;option to "allow Bluetooth devices to see the name of this PC" is NOT checked but I can still find my PC name using other
 devices and attempt to pair them. If I turn Bluetooth off my PC can't be seen but is there a way to&nbsp;have Bluetooth on&nbsp;but not have my PC seen by other devices?

    <title>Gamertag banned - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ascetic harlot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag banned</h2>
                    <p>So, I&nbsp;have been an Xbox customer since the release of the very first Xbox, which I&nbsp;still have. Just recently my gamertag was banned. I&nbsp;don't ever trash talk in games. I&nbsp;am not disrespectful. I&nbsp;do not cheat or mod. My reputation is flawless. I&nbsp;simply play to enjoy time with friends and to build my stream and social media sites up. The tag that was banned I've had for almost 5 years and I&nbsp;have it attached to many things that I&nbsp;have worked extremely hard on, Twitch, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube...&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Xbox enforcement team told me that my tag was banned because it was in violation of the "code of conduct". I&nbsp;submitted a review for the ban, but I&nbsp;know for a fact that even though I&nbsp;have been a customer and fan of Xbox since the day it was created, that I&nbsp;am a nobody and my review will just be swept under the rug. I&nbsp;am hoping with making this post that someone out there can help me get my gamertag back.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My tag WAS Ascetic Harlot. If people would take the time to actually understand the meaning of my tag you would see no issues with it. The first word of the tag is "Ascetic" which is&nbsp;characterized by or suggesting the practice of severe self-discipline and abstention from all forms of indulgence, typically for religious reasons. The second part of the tag is <strong>[</strong><strong>Mod Removed]</strong>. &nbsp;Now when you put the two together it is describing an abstinent <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;see nothing offensive, disrespectful, sexual, degrading or any other Xbox code of conduct violation in that tag. Saying that "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>" is a violating word is discriminatory because judging someone because of the way that they live (promiscuous) their life is like judging someone for being gay, straight, religious, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So now, after almost 5 years my tag gets randomly banned because of ignorance and laziness to actually research the tags meaning and on top of that I&nbsp;have to pay $10 to change it from a ridiculous Xbox generated tag. If you are going to have a Code of Conduct then I&nbsp;feel that you should be a little more timely in when you wanna take something away from someone. You have given me almost 5 years with that tag. I&nbsp;have created a small fan base and have established myself in the gaming world as Ascetic <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>, and now you want to say I'm in violation and take my tag away from me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;From someone who has supported this company from day one, I&nbsp;am genuinely hurt.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am asking you to please give me my gamertag back. If you cannot do this and still feel that someone who&nbsp;abstains from a promiscuous life is offensive and violating your CoC then I&nbsp;will go elsewhere. Either to PC or Playstation.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Ascetic <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>

            <p>If you have already submitted a case review you have done all you can. There is no other way to appeal to the enforcement team. Regardless of how long you had the GT if the enforcement team rules that it violates the Code of Conduct then the FNC is applied. You will find that the same rules apply to most platforms you choose to play on.</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3&#58; Achievements Not Unlocking</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a few threads on this and tried all 'tricks in the book' to fix the problem, but I still can't get the following achievements to unlock:</p><p><br /></p>

<p>-&nbsp;Exhibition Expert (Stuck at 94%) - All 63 exhibitions have been completed</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Like a Boss (Stuck at 87%) - All Festival sites are fully upgraded (level 5) and I can no longer earn fans</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Backpacker (Stuck at 69%) - All 13 beauty spots have been discovered</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Welcome to your Horizon (Stuck at 0%) - Should have unlocked after winning the first showcase...</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Stay on Target (Stuck at 0%) - I have completed multiple Danger Signs with 3 stars. The requirement for this states 'Get 3 Stars on a Danger Sign.' To me that means 1...</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Racers Paradise (Stuck at 0%) - I have opened and fully upgraded this Festival Site...</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Drive to the Music You Love (Stuck at 0%) - All radio stations have been signed and unlocked...</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I don't want to start this game all over again, I've spent hours working toward fulfilling the requirements to unlock these achievements. I have tried the following:</p>

<p>- Restarting the game<br />- Reinstalling the game<br />- Checked online connectivity (always been connected by ethernet, connection speed = 150mbps)&nbsp;<br />- I've always been online when I've played this game<br />- The last achievement to unlock is 'Stay Connected' - this was today at 21:10, I should have had the other achievements unlocked before this one<br />- gone to the extreme - a full factory reset of my XB1S..still hasn't fixed it<br />- I've tried doing a showcase again, any of the PR stunts, an exhibition, nothing is unlocking them!!!</p>

                    I recently reinstalled Windows 10, then installed classic shell to get the start menu I used to have and that someone else had set up for me. I failed in my attempt to get things set up, but now the Windows start menu has disappeared and I can't even use

    <title>Ctrl&#43;S not working in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ctrl&#43;S not working in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I encountered the following problem: Ctrl+S combination won't work in any application, specifically MS Office, Notepad, Notepad++ and others. Not only nothing is saved, but when I try to shortcut any command to Ctrl+S in Word for example, the
 field doesn't recognize the buttons and stays empty. Using onscreen keyboard doesn't work, however booting in Safe Mode solves the problem, so I guess the problem is some of my silent applications which recognizes the command. However, I haven't detected any
 change when pressing Ctrl+S and I have no idea what might be responsible. Any suggestions about how to narrow down the criminal would be highly appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running&nbsp;Windows 8 Pro 64-bit on a Dell Latitude E5530 with all drivers installed. I use Comodo Firewall + avast! Free for security, Launchy, Skype and muTorrent are my other start-up programs. However, stopping any of these doesn't solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Searching the internet turned out useless, except for a thread which gave me the idea of booting into Safe Mode. I hope the tech guys might have some useful experience or at least provide some insights on how to proceed with troubleshooting.</div>

            <p>Hi Estor,</p>
<p>
I just got fed up with CTRL-S not working on my PC also. After some digging and trying, I found that Skype had 'hijacked' CTRL-S. So as long as Skype was started, even if only in the background, it absorbed the key press and nothing obvious seemed to happen.<br />
<br />
To reset: Skype / Tools / Options / Advanced / Hotkeys / Uncheck "Take a snapshot during video calls"<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you!<br />
<br />

<h2>            usbstore.inf file is missing or old</h2>
                    <p>In trying to install a HP C310 all in one printer I get this halt in the software install process. It says it's on the original installation disc which isn't available as&nbsp;it came&nbsp; installed&nbsp;with this&nbsp;computer which was a used computer.. I asked on the web
 and one person posted the&nbsp; usbstore.inf for download and was told to save with notepad and copy to the Windows INF folder. In looking for this path I discovered there is no folder by that name on this computer. I am hesitent to place this file directly into&nbsp;the
 Windows folder. This computer has Windows XP Professional with service pak 2 installed. HP is absolutely no help even thouth the printer is new.</p>
<p>The printer can be used, but without the software installed scanning is impossible as well as the wireless capabilitysa. II can come up with an intallation disc, but&nbsp;how would I get this file into the existing windows file and If it is on the installation
 disc why did'nt install in the first place? Any help would be appreciated as this is an older gentleman without much money.</p>

            <p>The download software from HP has the same issue. The install is looking for a file usbstor.inf and
</p>
<p>it is supposed to be located in a INF folder under the above file name. There is no INF folder in the Windows folder nor is there a file by that name. The error says it is found on the Windows installation disc. I have searced the installation disc and there
 is not a file even remotely close let alone a folder called INF asI indicated in my original post. Any other&nbsp;sugestions &nbsp;on how I can solve this issue?

            <p>I found the problem. The INF folder is in the Windows directory but was hidden. I did find the usbstor.inf file there. So I assumed the file was outdated. I renamed the existing file as usbstorOld</p>

    <title>L6V-00001 Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse USB Receiver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahjeremy  say:</h3>
<h2>            L6V-00001 Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse USB Receiver</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Team,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wish to report an incident that my newly purchase (40 Days Old) L6V-00001 Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse cannot be used anymore last night.<br />
<br />
I understood that it was partially my negligence that the Mouse was broke, due to the mainly USB Receiver fell apart and its internal board slightly dented.</p>
<p>The USB Receiver was as usual, attached to my laptop USB Port, facing upwards in my Laptop Bag. My laptop bag somehow dropped from my sofa to the floor, causing the incident. The mouse was perfectly fine but couldn't be use without a working USB Receiver.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first receive the newly purchase Mouse, I was dumb-founded by the design of the USB Receiver. It is so accident-prone due to its thin-plastic casing and yet about 2cm long. When plug to a USB Device, it looks like a pointing ear and an inflexible
 pointing ear. I couldn't return it due to Sales Term &amp; Conditions, and I never thought it takes only 40 days in my life to experience such unfortunate event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had contacted Microsoft via Chat as well as my Local Distributor, Malaysia for any possibility an answer, replacement part. No avail.<br />
All said Microsoft does not have such part for purchase separately.&nbsp; End of story. Understandable.</p>
<p>Also, they couldn't guarantee that a re-purchase would not minimize this incident probability.<br />
<br />
It was my saddest moment in my life (so far) with Microsoft Products, from Windows, Office, Windows Phone and Peripherals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also writing this so someone in Microsoft can seriously re-look at this product flaw - the 2CM Long USB Receiver.</p>
<p>Come'on even Logitech can squeeze into tiny Receiver. Why not Microsoft.</p>

            I got this expensive mouse, and 2 days later the usb receiver was broke into 3 parts. I've had nano sized usb receivers that have lasted years. This one is junk. It should be recalled and redesigned.

            Same here, I think I won't buy a MS hardware product again. I'm going to file a complaint because in EU by law a company has to provide spare components during 5 years.

<p>Hello Microsoft Team,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wish to report an incident that my newly purchase (40 Days Old) L6V-00001 Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse cannot be used anymore last night.<br />
<br />
I understood that it was partially my negligence that the Mouse was broke, due to the mainly USB Receiver fell apart and its internal board slightly dented.</p>
<p>The USB Receiver was as usual, attached to my laptop USB Port, facing upwards in my Laptop Bag. My laptop bag somehow dropped from my sofa to the floor, causing the incident. The mouse was perfectly fine but couldn't be use without a working USB Receiver.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first receive the newly purchase Mouse, I was dumb-founded by the design of the USB Receiver. It is so accident-prone due to its thin-plastic casing and yet about 2cm long. When plug to a USB Device, it looks like a pointing ear and an inflexible
 pointing ear. I couldn't return it due to Sales Term &amp; Conditions, and I never thought it takes only 40 days in my life to experience such unfortunate event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had contacted Microsoft via Chat as well as my Local Distributor, Malaysia for any possibility an answer, replacement part. No avail.<br />
All said Microsoft does not have such part for purchase separately.&nbsp; End of story. Understandable.</p>
<p>Also, they couldn't guarantee that a re-purchase would not minimize this incident probability.<br />
<br />
It was my saddest moment in my life (so far) with Microsoft Products, from Windows, Office, Windows Phone and Peripherals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also writing this so someone in Microsoft can seriously re-look at this product flaw - the 2CM Long USB Receiver.</p>
<p>Come'on even Logitech can squeeze into tiny Receiver. Why not Microsoft.</p>
</blockquote>
Same here, just one day after i got this perfect looking mice. A little negligence that I put my laptop into my bag without unplug the mice receiver. Tragedy done. I really hope that Microsoft can pay attention to solve old customer's issue. Not just to pleasure
 new customer and&nbsp;attract them to buy your products. It is more important to let customer trust you.
