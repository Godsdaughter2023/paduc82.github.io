<h2>            Microsoft Edge will not download anything&#33;</h2>
                    I've had Microsoft Edge for a while now but all of a sudden, it doesn't want to download anything! I've tried to fix it multiple ways and I've looked at other posts but nothing seems to work! I'm kind of getting annoyed because sometimes, it says I'm not
 connected to the internet, or videos stop playing for some reason. I don't know if it's my computer, internet, or Edge, or all of them. I'm wondering if anyone else has figured out a different way to fix this. I can't even open my downloads folder. Edge just
 closes without warning and nothing comes up after that. Can anyone help?

            <p>found the answer, don't know why it changed but after&nbsp;some update or after using Malwarebytes, it seem to lock abunch of folders (plex, chrome, edge, and more) in appdata for the current user. I was able to solve the problem by going to "c:/users/yourusername/appdata/local/"
 then take ownership of the Microsoft folder and the microsoftedge folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having the issue of edge not downloading anything and the procedure above worked fine. if you are unsure how to take ownership of those folders or any others then you are in luck. you can do a search on google or bing to find the tool for "take ownership"
 just remember to backup your registry&nbsp;first</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck!!!.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The way to get rid of any application is to use the Control Panel applet, Programs and Features.&nbsp; Never try just deleting from the Program Files folder because you'll only remove a fraction of the application and parts will remain in places like the registry,
 the Windows folder, drivers, and other places.&nbsp; This can cause untold grief to you, so avoid doing it by all means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you can't uninstall it from the Programs and Features applet, you can at least prevent it from starting by running MSCONFIG.&nbsp; To do that click Start and type MSCONFIG in the search box.&nbsp; Then click MSCONFIG.EXE in programs list to start it.&nbsp; Then click
 the Startup tab.&nbsp; Look for the entry that starts this program and uncheck it.&nbsp; Click OK and reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Themes and Colors</h2>
                    <p>I just wanted to have a simple windows basic theme (without the aero special effects) using the basic Windows 7 theme.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, I don't really like the pale blue windows colors, and I would also prefer to have the active window a different color, or shade, from the inactive windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can change the theme colors if I select a Windows aero theme, or if I select the Windows Classic theme.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However it does not seem possible to change the colors using the non-aero, Windows basic theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I missing a setting here?<span>&nbsp;

            You haven't given us any info to work with. However, I'd suggest you go into the BIOS and set it to assign IRQs for all devices.
<div><br />
<div>If your graphics card is not being found, make sure it is firmly seated in its slot and than any power cables required for it are fully seated as well.</div>

            What card is this? Windows7 should automatically recognise that new card was inserted and look for correct driver. After installation of this driver IRQ will be assigned by OS. Go to "Device Manager" and check "Display Adapter" (3rd or 4th from the top
 of the list) and check properties. It should say you something if there is a problem. You can try to update driver from there.
<br />
Of course, if such driver is available from Windows Update or manufacturer of this video card. It is hard to say more at the moment without knowing more from&nbsp; you.<br />

            <p>That circle means "working in background" and means that some other program is busy (or has requested to the system to inform you that it is busy).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only way to stop it is to find the program causing it and end the program (with Task Manager for example).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you aren't sure what program is busy, try disabling all Startup programs to rule them out.&nbsp;You can do this by pressing Windows+R to show the Run box, typing
<strong>msconfig</strong> and using the Startup tab to disable apps from loading.</p>

            Shawn, thank you for the response. &nbsp;&nbsp; As I had not been able to solve this irksome problem I turned off the circle.&nbsp; I have now tried to turn it back on by changing the pointer settings and the circle does not come on.&nbsp; I'm not totally sure that the settings
 are exactly the same as before as I was more keen on making the circle disappear than noting the settings.<br />
<br />
After I manage to get the busy circle appear I will disable all the programmes in start up and add them back one by one until find the problem one.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The 'busy circle' problem only occurred when I installed some updates after being away for several days.&nbsp; Is it likely that one of the updates caused the problem?&nbsp;
<br />

            <p>It's unlikely but certainly a possibility.&nbsp; Typically that busy indicator is specific to whatever program you're pointer is on top of (for example, Excel could be busy calculating and if you move your pointer elsewhere the circle would disappear).&nbsp; But it
 is also possible for the system to globally be busy and it will remain everywhere until the running operation completes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One thing that can help track it down is Task Manager.&nbsp; When the problem occurs, press Ctrl-Shift-Escape to open the Task Manager, and on the details tab, look for any program that is using a lot of CPU %.&nbsp; That can indicate which program is busy and offer
 clues as to what it is doing.</p>

Shawn, I can't get the busy circle to appear which is puzzling me.&nbsp; I have checked to see if there have been any automatic updates since the one on 17th January that might have corrected the problem but there have been none.&nbsp; The only changes have been my fiddling
 with the mouse settings.&nbsp; I have not noticed any slow down in my system doing any of my browsing or TV Player activities.<br />
<br />
I checked Task Manager and ordered CPU so I could see the biggest users at the top. Firefox, Chrome and Task Manager are using 2%, 1% &amp; 1% respectively, all others are showing 0%.&nbsp; System Idle is showing 89-99% approx. when I include All Users.&nbsp; I'm very pleased
 that you replied to my question but as I can't replicate the problem I don't think you should waste any more time on this.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your help.

<h2>            How do I change the media player popup settings in windows 10&#63;</h2>

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a good idea to set a keyboard shortcut for the for this really convenient volume bar. Unfortunately, to make on regular keyboards is still impossible. The sound adjustment bar popup is actually for the system/speaker volume, and is intended for the keyboards
 that have this <em>media control functionality</em> or with <strong>FN key</strong> that is common with laptop computers.&nbsp; It's also beyond Microsoft's recommendable applications that can create a hot key for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is good example of a desktop keyboard that has the FN key:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc26db99-c6ee-4668-b8ec-0606505cbe65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc26db99-c6ee-4668-b8ec-0606505cbe65" /></a></p>
<p>FN key is normally located on the left corner of your desktop keyboard. Sometimes, it is also located at the right hand side, together with the right Alt and Ctrl keys, just right before the arrow keys and the numerical keypad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should there be any more questions regarding this query, please feel free to chime us back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

    <title>On the Surface, how do I turn off &#34;natural scrolling&#34;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidluma125  say:</h3>
<h2>            On the Surface, how do I turn off &#34;natural scrolling&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    On the surface, when you use the Touch Cover and you use the trackpad to scroll with two fingers, you push up to go down and pull down to go up, as opposed to the standard scroll up to go up, scroll down to go down. On the mac this is called "natural scrolling"
 however I can't find the settings to turn it off on the RT version of windows running on the Surface. Can somebody tell me where to find these settings?

            <p>The inverted scrolling is currently the only setting. This is a highly requested feature and will probably be updated soon. Being able to disable the track pad when the mouse is present is also another similar feature that is highly requested.

<h3> bob dog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop w&#47;Dual Monitors - Open Windows Get Shifted Around</h2>
                    I'm using Remote Desktop to connect from one dual-monitor system at home to another dual-monitor system at work with an identical monitor configuration (2 1920x1080 monitors).&nbsp; I use the "mstsc /span" feature to connect full-screen. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The problem is that even though the screens should map to each other exactly, every time I connect, all of the open windows on the remote computer get shifted around the screen in a big way.&nbsp; At work, I keep lots of windows open and I like them laid out in
 a certain way, but when I get home and remote desktop to work, the layout gets scrozzled and I have to waste time moving everything back.&nbsp; When I get back to work the next day, the layout is scrozzled there, and I have to repeat the process.&nbsp; Very annoying!<br />
<br />
The home computer is an XP system and the work computer is a Windows 7 system, for what it's worth.<br />
<br />
Do you know why this happens, and is there a way to prevent it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>When connecting via remote desktop, the windows will not always be in the same spot due to how it works. Its default by design in Windows.</p>

<p>Hi PETERS10,</p>
<p>You may try enabling built in user account and check if you are able to access it.<br />
Try changing the user account type to administrator from built in user account and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>In Windows Vista, the built-in administrator account is disabled by default. In previous versions of Windows, an Administrator account was automatically created during Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) with a blank password.</p>
<p>An Administrator account with a blank password is a security risk. To better protect the system, the built-in Administrator account is disabled by default in all clean installations and upgrades of Windows Vista.</p>
<p>HOW TO: Enable the build-in Administrator account in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555910" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555910</a></p>
<p>You may also try restoring your computer to an earlier state.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions below to restore your computer to an earlier state.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.
<br />
2.&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
3.&nbsp;In the System Restore dialog box, click next. <br />
4.&nbsp;In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created at least one week before the current date, and then click next.</p>
<p>Note: If you do not find a restore point that is at least one week old, select the earliest restore point that is available.
<br />
5.&nbsp;Click Finish.<br />
6.&nbsp;The computer restarts. The system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in when the restore point was created.</p>
<p>Check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>If you are still getting the same error message then you may have to create a new user account from the built in user account.</p>
<p>You may refer the link below for more information.</p>

            Have you checked if your processor is&nbsp;capable of hardware virtualization, with AMD-V™ or Intel® VT
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/support/configure-bios.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
turned on</a> in the BIOS?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To determine whether your PC works with Windows XP Mode:
<p>Step 1. Does my PC have a CPU with support for hardware virtualization?</p>
<p><strong>For Intel processors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Download, install and run the <a href="http://www.intel.com/support/processors/tools/piu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel Processor Identification Utility</a> .</p>
</li><li>
<p>Navigate to the CPU Technologies tab and read the value in the "Intel Virtualization Technology" field.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the value is No then your CPU does not support hardware virtualization.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If the value is Yes then the CPU supports hardware virtualization. Go on to step 2 below.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
For AMD processors: </strong><br />
<a href="http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/dynamicDetails.aspx?ListID=c5cd2c08-1432-4756-aafa-4d9dc646342f&amp;ItemID=172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AMD Virtualization Compatibility Check Utility</a></p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<br />
Step 2. Does my PC BIOS support hardware virtualization, and is it turned on?
<ul>
<li>
<p>Instructions to turn on hardware virtualization in your PC BIOS are specific to OEM models. It is important that after changing your BIOS settings the PC is completely shut down at the power switch before restarting so that the new BIOS settings can take
 place.<br />

<h2>            Parental Control</h2>
                    
<p>My son is unable to go on xbox live becuase he has to agree to new t&amp;c but it asks for parental approval and i beleive my account has been deleted as i never used it. I spent over 2hrs on line to an ambassaodr about this the other week only to be told after
 trying several things, that there was no mre they could do and the only option would be for him to re-create a new profile. this is not accecptable as he will lose all his downloads he has paid for and he still has 7 mths of his gold membership left. There
 are only 2 email addresses i use and it does not recognise either. When i tried to re-create from the email i thought it would have been on WLID it says that my email address is in use but it will not let me link to reset password etc. it then comes up and
 says email address not valid? I have recreated my account on the other email address but there is no way i can now link this to my sons account so that i can accept his parental approval. I can rmeeber the gamertag i was origianlly given when i created the
 account, meeklemming101. I feel i am being passed from pillar to post as i have just been on the WLID forum and told i need to get back to you about this. My son has already been without xbox live for 4 days now and i do not think it is fair he is paying for
 a service that he now, can not access. His gamertag is sphericsnakepit. I have tried calling 08004699269 but this is constantly engaged. please can someone help or i will looking to get a full refund on all of his download purchases and reimbursement for his
 gild membership if the parental control password can not be reset so we can access his account or have to re-crate a new gamertag/account for him.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This is not something that Xbox Support can help you with. This is a Microsoft Account issue. If you are unable to
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset the password</a></strong>, or
<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fill out the Microsoft Account recovery form</a></strong>, then your only option is to

 able to login to your account, or change information to a valid account.<br />
<br />
As far as getting a refund for your sons downloadable content and gold membership, that's simply not possible. Any downloadable content purchased is not refundable, as far as gold memberships are concerned they have a very short time period where you can refund
 the payment at a prorated cost. If you wish to speak with a phone agent you will need to use the request a call function by clicking this link

<h3> . banana bread .  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Other&#39; files taking up storage space</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so I have a Windows 10 laptop with 29.1 gigabytes on the C drive. Now, sometimes when I go to settings, system, storage, and see how much space's taken up by the system files, sometimes it'll say about 17 GB while other times it'll say 19 GB. Because
 the system files take up&nbsp;<em>so</em> much space, every GB of space counts, which leads me to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1156fc1b-2b8f-450c-a691-f92f2dbca7de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1156fc1b-2b8f-450c-a691-f92f2dbca7de?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><em>That. </em>I want <em>that</em> gone, yet every-time I try to, I'm greeted with a page that lists 10 small files that take up ranging from 76 KB to 26.3 MB as shown here.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f230799-d047-404b-a44c-2b7fd239e0a5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f230799-d047-404b-a44c-2b7fd239e0a5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that all adds up to almost 3 GB of space taken up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, what are these hidden files that're taking up so much space? Why are they not being shown so I can delete them? Also, if anyone can help me stop the system from taking up 17 GB to 19 GB and then back, that would be nice.</p>

            Hi 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. You will need to analyze space on your computer with a file analyzer. This will give you idea which folder/files are occupying space. I am not able to answer which are these files, as per your picture those folders seem to be valid.
<br />
<br />You can analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one and is a Microsoft Store app.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/treesize-free/9nblggh40881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/treesize-free...</a>
<br />
<br />To GAIN SPACE on COMPUTER
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; Free up space now  &gt; Remove files
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Click on Windows Start icon on left bottom &gt; Windows Administrative tools &gt; Disk cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />4. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB (29.1GB usable) of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you 10GB more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Performance issues with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading my PC to windows 10, I am experiencing a performance issue on my computer. I used to have Windows 8.1 and on that OS, my PC was completely fine. The issues that I am currently experiencing are, screen resolution, video graphics, and processor.
 I am a Video editor and this issues that I am currently having is setting me back. I tried go to the Recovery system and planned to "Go back to Windows 8.1", and it says that it's only &nbsp;available after a month of upgrading to windows 10. I can't wait that
 long if I'm still going to experience the same problem for a month. So I clicked on "get started" and it gave me an error saying "The files we need to take you back to previous windows were removed from this PC". Like what? How am I going to do my everyday
 routine if I can't do anything on windows 10 and can't even go back to it. This is just plain out ridiculous, the only way to fix this problem now is to either fix the problems with the upcoming updates, or allow us to switch back to windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have nothing against with the new Windows 10, I think it's a beautiful redesign of the previous windows. I'm just having a performance issues with my PC. So can anyone help me on how to switch back to windows 8.1?</p>

            <p>OUCH! The only file to get back as far as I know is Windows.Old. Your experience re returning to previous OS is a show stopper that MSFT needs to handle! I know I definitely considered this before upgrading, but I also created a System Image should Microsoft's
 backup not work. I'd be interested to know the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as performance, you need to list the details of system (processor, memory, video cards, etc.) and things running that aren't slow and specifically application (s) that are slow. According to MSFT, this W10 is supposed to take less resources! (that
 will be the day). I'll check in later.</p>

            Coming from Windows 7 to Windows 10, the performance lag that I'm seeing seems to be related to the constant updating of applications, i.e.; live tiles.&nbsp; Rather than launching a single application and having most of the system resources available, Windows
 10 keeps shifting resources to the live tiles to keep them current.&nbsp; This is <strong>
not </strong>a useful feature for me and I would suggest that MS give users the option to disable it.&nbsp;

    <title>Four Steps To Cure 95&#37; of Computer Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Four Steps To Cure 95&#37; of Computer Problems</h2>
                    <p>Here are four steps every computer user can take that will cure 95% of the problems people commonly experience with Windows, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
1- Backup<br />
2- Clean install<br />
3- Protect against attack<br />
4- Understand how to use a computer the right way<br />
<br />
Most of the other 5% of the problems you may experience come from software bugs, both known and unknown. Those are inevitable in anything created by human beings. I'll describe the four steps below, but I can only give an overview here. There are many more
 details that you can learn about on the internet.<br />
<br />
<strong>Backup</strong><br />
<br />
There are basically two types of backup: an image backup and a folder-and-file backup. For simplicity I'll call these an image and a backup. An image is a copy of everything on a partition, including the metadata that describes the partition in technical terms.
 A backup is a copy of individual folders and files.<br />
<br />
When you make an image of your hard drive, you are making an exact copy of that hard drive. Think about what that means: Let's say I conduct an experiment on my computer, and the experiment doesn't work out too well. Now my computer is having a 'bad trip' (if
 you're old enough to remember what that means.) What do I do now?<br />
<br />
It's no problem - I simply restore the image that my imaging program makes automatically overnight and in a matter of minutes my computer has been transported back in time to when everything was working well. Thus, an image is ideal for restoring your computer
 to the way it used to be.<br />
<br />
A backup is ideal for making a copy of your personal data, like your critical financial records, or the irreplaceable videos of your children's first steps, or their precious childhood pictures, or that novel you've spent years working on.<br />
<br />
Images and backups can be combined in advanced techniques that are beyond the scope of this post. The point is: When you have a backup, you have the security of knowing that you won't lose anything, no matter what happens to your computer. And not only will
 you not lose anything, you can easily put everything back to the way it was before.
<em>That's</em> peace of mind.<br />
<br />
Imagine never having to re-install Windows? After you install Windows for the first time, and after running Microsoft Update until your computer is completely up to date, make an image of your hard drive. From now on, instead of re-installing Windows, which
 can take hours, all you have to do is restore your image, which takes just a few minutes and you'll have a completely installed copy of Windows ready to go.<br />
<br />
<strong>Clean install</strong><br />
<br />
No savvy computer user wants to upgrade their computer to a new version of Windows. Smart computer users will do a clean install, which is computer-speak for a fresh start. A clean install means erasing your hard drive and starting all over again from the beginning.
 It's a total do-over.<br />
<br />
[Note: You don't have to actually erase your hard drive to do a clean install. The installer breaks all connections to whatever was already on the hard drive, so it's as though whatever was on the hard drive previously has been erased.]<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when you upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, you carry with it all the problems, all the mistakes and all the bad decisions you've made - those you know about and those you don't yet know about - and bring them to Windows
 10. It's like bringing all the emotional baggage from your old relationships to your new relationship. Who wants that?<br />
<br />
A clean install carries none of that baggage. Instead, you get a fresh start with a brand new, squeaky clean copy of the operating system. No sins of the past to haunt you. And don't think that savvy computer users are free of sin; it's just that their sins
 are more advanced.<br />
<br />
So if a clean install is so great, why do people upgrade to new versions of Windows? Because it's easier. Doing a clean install the right way requires a good deal of technical knowledge that most people don't have. But there's nothing standing in the way of
 learning all that technical knowledge. It ain't rocket science. All it takes is a commitment to learn and an investment in time. It's an investment that pays off wonderfully when the end result is a computer that
<em>zings</em>. And the internet has piles of resources to help you.<br />
<br />
If Microsoft is to be believed, Windows 10 is the last version of Windows. Does that mean no more clean installs? Not exactly. Windows 10 is due to receive two major upgrades each year. Each major upgrade is, essentially, a new version of Windows although the
 changes are not as dramatic as they used to be. It's fine to simply upgrade your computer to these new versions, but every few years you'll probably want to do a clean install.<br />
<br />
<strong>Protect against attack</strong><br />
<br />
From the very beginning of the personal computer industry there have been bad guys who were out to cause trouble for computer users. As time has gone by, the bad guys have gotten increasingly sophisticated. Today the techniques they employ are absolutely stunning
 in their complexity and their ingenuity. Your computer could be completely compromised (<em>pwned</em> in computer-speak) and you'll never know.<br />
<br />
There is no way to prevent a computer from being attacked. That is not possible. The best that anyone can do is to deter an attack by making it so difficult and inconvenient for an attacker that they don't bother trying.<br />
<br />
To this end there are best practices that have been designed into operating systems over the years, and every computer user should take advantage of them for increased protection. These include:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>password-protecting all user accounts, including online accounts, with long, uncrackable passwords (and using a password manager to organize them)</li><li>two factor authentication (abbreviated as 2FA)</li><li>doing day-to-day computing from a Standard User account (the principle of least privileges) and using an Administrator account only for tasks that require Administrator permissions</li><li>file and folder access controls</li><li>keeping the operating system and applications up to date</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The number one defense against attack, by far, is you and me. Computer users need to educate themselves about the risks they face, to be able to recognize an attack when it's about to happen and back away before it hits. We have to be aware and skeptical
 of unusual things that may be happening on our computers. And we need to stay current with the latest threats to our security so we'll know how best to defend our computers.<br />
<br />
The second line of defense against attack is software, to protect our computers against threats we don't know about or don't understand. Every computer needs to have anti-virus software (anti-malware is a more accurate name) that scans the computer constantly
 for threats, and a firewall that watches all data coming into and going out of the computer.<br />
<br />
Hackers <em>love</em> users who ignore the rules and otherwise don't take steps to protect themselves. Don't be a sucker ... instead, make the hacker's life suck.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Understand how to use a computer the right way</strong><br />
<br />
No one said using a computer was easy. There's a lot to learn, and not everyone is a 'computer person.' Nevertheless, it's very important to learn how to use a computer correctly.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the internet is a fabulous source of information offered at every level from dummy to expert and in many formats such as tutorials, video, blogs, etc. Just about everything you need to know to operate a computer successfully is out there on the
 internet. And if the internet doesn't suit you, there are still excellent books to read and courses to take. But we have to take the initiative to learn; we have to make the effort.<br />
<br />
Reasonable people can disagree, strongly, about how Windows was designed. However, and like all software, Windows works the way it was coded to work, not the way we wish it would work, so if you want to succeed with Windows you have to understand how Microsoft
 designed it to be used.<br />
<br />
If you make changes to Windows that work against its design, to make it work the way you think it should work, you may or may not succeed in the short run but you will definitely suffer in the long run when a future update stumbles over a configuration it was
 not expecting to see and your computer stops working properly or stops working altogether.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The key to productive learning on the internet is formulating the right search term. The right search term opens doors to relevent search results, but the wrong search term leads to dead ends. Unfortunately, only experience will help you craft good search terms.
 You also have to develop a discerning eye to separate the good information from the junk that also fills the internet. This too takes practice. Here are some of the ways I know I'm reading the right information on the internet:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the author is a well-known and well-regarded professional</li><li>the author doesn't write with an attitude</li><li>the information can be corroborated from other equally well-known and well-regarded sources<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Like it or not, technology doesn't stand still. It changes rapidly and we have to keep up with those changes.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
For years I was making a mess of things on my computer. I've done just about every wrong thing that's possible to do on a computer, and several things previously thought to be impossible. Finally, I got fed up with constantly struggling while the 'smart' computer
 users were so successful and doing such interesting things with their computers. Why not me? So I resolved to learn what the 'smart' computer users knew that I didn't. (A lot.)<br />
<br />
Looking back, these are the four techniques that worked best for me. I won't claim that I never have problems, but even so I am a confident and proficient computer user. You should be, too.<br />
<br />
These are not the only techniques that will solve 95% of your problems with a computer. You probably have your own great ideas, and you should post them here.<br />

<h2>            Serious Network Issues Involving Xbox360</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, sorry if this topic has been beaten to death but I am extremely frustrated.
</p>
<p>I have a new 4gb Xbox Slim with a Netgear WNR2000v2.<b> I cannot stay connected to Xbox Live and at times cannot connect period.
</b>I have another gaming console that is extremely similar that works 100% fine with absolutely NO problems.</p>
<p>I have called Xbox support about 6 times about connecting to Xbox live.</p>
<p>I have</p>
<ul>
<li>Bought a new wireless router </li><li>Adjusted my Port Triggering Manually </li><li>Set static IP addresses and manual information </li><li>Connected via ethernet cable and had no issues </li><li>Made sure all of my router's settings are suitable for XBL including the MTU set properly and DHCP enabled
</li><li>I've gone through all of the troubleshooting for network issues and still cannot resolve this issue.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I for some reason cannot run both systems at the same time, the Xbox360 is the one with the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do? Does anyone have any suggestions on what to do with my router? I'm really sorry if this has been said and done before in another thread.</p>
<p>Help!</p>

<p>Ok its best to tackle this one in stages as it could be a few things. First up your router (and firmware) is live certified meaning you don't need to forward any ports or anything like that and by doing that it can actually cause more issues. So the first
 thing I would do is:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Take note of any settings you want to keep on the router like your wireless SSID, encryption passphrase etc etc. PPPoE information
</li><li>Go into the router settings and choose to "Reset to Factory defaults" <span>
</li><li>After the router is factory reset, login to it again and ensure UPnP is enabled
</li><li>Set your Xbox IP address to auto (not static/manual) </li><li>Power off and on the router </li><li>Power off and on the Xbox </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is the best set-up for your router so try that and see how that works out first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After factory restoring my router's settings to default and making sure my Xbox was set to automatic I have successfully connected to Xbox live. So far it's been about 10 minutes, I put a netflix movie on to make sure its using internet access constantly
 and I haven't been signed out yet.</p>
<p>So far i'm signed into both online network services and no issues. I know I had both consoles working fine when I bought this router, but I had difficulty staying in xbox parties and chats. I got an error that said something like d0000034. This issue had
 happened in the past though and i'm not sure if it will happen again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Sanket,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For a better understanding of the issue</span>, <span>I would need more information from your end.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue occur only when browsing Internet?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons.</span></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;D<span>ue to corrupt System Files.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Due to conflict between third party applications.</span></p>
<p>Let's try few steps to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong> <span><br />
I would suggest you to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if<br />
it helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘<strong>Windows + W’ </strong>key on the <strong>keyboard</strong>.<br />
<br />
b) Type <strong>troubleshooter </strong>in the <strong>search box </strong>and then press
<strong>enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
c) Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on <strong>view all </strong>and select
<strong>System<br />
Maintenance</strong>.<br />
<br />
d) Click <strong>next </strong>and follow the <strong>on-screen instructions</strong>.</span></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices other<br />
than mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.<span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span><br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to boot the computer to safe mode and check. If the issue does not occur in Safe mode, set the computer in a clean boot state and check if it helps.</span><strong><span><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to refer the article and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</a></span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
</span><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode perform a clean boot and check.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows&nbsp;</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> </span><span>After<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to
</span>the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span><br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to run System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
SFC scan would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q</strong>” to open <strong>Charms Bar.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the <strong>left pane</strong>, <strong>right click </strong>on the “<strong>cmd</strong>” option and select “<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type <span>“<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span>” without quotes and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>If I try to delete the Ghost folder I get the message &#34;Could not - Microsoft Community</title>

                    <p>Original title: Ghost Folder(s) in Download Directory</p>
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, after doing some downloads, I have moved the contents of the folder created in "Download" to another directory. In several cases it has left behind a "Ghost Folder". If I try to delete the folder I get the message "Could not
 find this file. This is no longer located in C:\Users\(My name)\Downloads. Verify the item's location and try again." Restarts, restores, etc do not clear the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;I use cmd with admin permissions to bring up the directory, the file is listed as being there but using&nbsp;"rmdir" to delete it also dumps an error stating the folder is not in that location. I preformed an error check on my C drive and no errors were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know have 3 of these folders and it is getting annoying!</p>

            <p>Hi Pratiksha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I rebooted the PC into Safe mode and tried to delete the folders - all 3 of them - using both the file explorer and cmd (DOS) using rmdir /s /q . Same as before with same error messages saying that the file/folder does not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have been using Windows - and before it existed, DOS - since it was first out, I tend to leave the view hidden folders/files/drives on anyway. There is nothing odd there and nothing else visible. If I click on the folders in question, it says "This
 folder is empty".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said I have been using Windows a long time and have tried almost every version (some very much worse than others!) and I have never come across this before. So my supposition is that it is very much a Windows 10 specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further ideas please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike Sharpe</p>

<h2>            Problems with Microsoft Photos Companion</h2>
                    Transferring photos from my phone (iPhone 7) to my laptop (Dell Microsoft Windows 10) via Photos Companion used to work fine.&nbsp; But lately, as I have attempted to transfer, I get the error message "Something went wrong&nbsp; Be sure that your computer and mobile
 device are connected to the same Wi-Fi network."&nbsp; I have confirmed several times that they are indeed connected to the same network, but I keep getting the same error message.

            Hi Timothy
<br />
<br />Please keep in mind, the Photos Companion app is really a Garage project and its not really well maintained as other commercial Microsoft Apps.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you switch back to using OneDrive to sync and upload your iPhone camera roll instead and report any bugs you find in the companion app.

<p>Are you still able to boot Windows? I don't understand how turning off your PC improperly could wipe out your entire Documents folder directory. Are you sure you are logged into your account on the machine?</p>

    <title>Taskbar icons switched themselves to generic icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tboden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar icons switched themselves to generic icons</h2>
                    Suddenly the icons for Windows Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) changed from the usual "logo" icons to a generic document-type icon in my taskbar. Further, my desktop icons for those programs no longer have a "shortcut" tab when I display the properties.
 (In fact, although the desktop icon still shows the usual artwork, the icon displayed in the properties dialogue box is generic.) Skype has also been similarly affected. No other icons have been affected in the taskbar nor on the desktop.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />
