<h2>            Windows Activation</h2>
                    When we <strong>Activate Windows</strong>, it collects some information about our motherboard, processor, etc and our&nbsp;<strong>IP address</strong>. Can anyone tell me what IP address does it collect?
<strong>Public IP</strong> or <strong>Private IP</strong>?

            Recording the IP address as part of the activation process would be pointless as this can change constantly. The Activation process looks for things that are expected to be static, i.e. your MAC address, CPU Serial No. etc.

<p>Dileep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are the only one who is saying that the IP address is collected.&nbsp; It would make no sense whatsoever for MS to record an IP address.&nbsp; It would be useless information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As pestell explained above, you are probably getting confused with a MAC address which is a unique serial number of a network adapter, something that does help to identify the computer being activated</p>

<p>No you cannot trace a Windows 10 user even if you knew their activation data . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 generates a dynamic IP address every time it is connected to the Internet, some users do use a Static IP address, but this is rare . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you knew the MAC address of the PC, that MAC address only travels to the nearest Internet Router and is then lost and so cannot be traced . . .</p>

<p>In a normal domestic network the computers IP address will be meaningless, my address is currently 192.168.0.33 and there are probably thousands with the same address.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft's Privacy statement&nbsp; declares that the basic data collection does not include anything that could identify the individual user of a specific computer, it would be extremely dangerous for their credibility&nbsp; if they should do otherwise.</p>

<h2>            Skype 8.11 privacy settings</h2>
                    I just upgraded to skype for linux version 8.11.0.4 and it appears that the privacy settings menu is gone. Also, it appears that the option to delete contacts (without blocking them) is gone as well. Is this a bug, or have these features been removed from
 skype?

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, privacy settings is currently not available in the new Skype. With regards to deleting/removing a contact, you can do it without blocking the contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the contact, and select <strong>View profile</strong>.</li><li>Select<strong> Delete contact</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Delete</strong> again to confirm the deletion of the contact.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />

<p>First of all, maybe do some research before calling it a joke. The blu ray issue can be fixed with a setting. Please use the search tool and you will find your answer to that. Party chat I will admit needs a bit of tweaking but still works. So the system
 is fine it sounds like user error mostly. The game installs from disc take me less than 30 minutes which is totally acceptable. If yours is slow, again check the support forums and they have tips to speed that up. As for the wheel, I don't have any experience
 with that so I can't comment. Maybe do some research before dropping 400 bones on a peripheral for 1 game. Lastly you cannot advertise you are selling on the forum. I suggest editing your post to take that part out or you could get reported.</p>

<p>As the other reply said, search the forums about the lip sync issue.&nbsp; Surprisingly its not the Xbox at fault this time, its either you or your TV.&nbsp; Just go into the Blu Ray settings and untick an option called 24hz playback (or something like that)&nbsp; Basically
 if you TV is incapable of playing then you will get lip sync issues.</p>
<p>Regarding the games taking forever too install, that is just the way that Microsoft chose to handle updates and installs at the same time.&nbsp; Basically the Xbox One downloads the update, starts to install the game once the download is finished, then updates
 the game (or something like that) its not actually the game taking forever to install.</p>
<p>Regarding the steering wheel, cant really blame Microsoft&nbsp; for the quality of it, I mean its a third party steering wheel, they had very little too do with it.&nbsp; Maybe next time read some reviews or something before dropping $400 on a peripheral?</p>
<p>As for the other two complaints, ye those are valid, but its like every system at launch/shortly after, its unfinished and needs updating.&nbsp; Especially as Microsoft had to practically rewrite their entire OS after the DRM issue after last years E3.</p>

<p>yes it is Microsofts fault, they are the ones that make it so hard for &nbsp;third party companies to make a wheel, not to mention they are suppost to do quality control on the things used with their consoles, all im saying is they really made it a hassle with
 this one and that the overall feel is terrible, I feel like I just paid 500 for console along with 60 for game 400 for wheel, bought a playseat to throw the whole thing together and it just feels like im testing their crappy software out</p>

<p>They haven't made it "hard" for 3rd parties to make peripherals. There's a lot of new technology with the new controllers and the 3rd parties haven't had chance to catch up with yet and develop to be the best they can be. Give it a year when everyone has
 had time to develop their accessories, the market will be booming with great stuff from both Microsoft and 3rd parties.</p>

<p>The Thrustmaster TX is getting plenty of bad reviews, Amazon is full of "dead out of the box" reviews. The issue is more than likely with&nbsp;your wheel, InsideSimRacing gave the wheel good reviews but theirs worked.<br />
<br />
I will agree that MS has shown no love to 3rd party wheels. The 360 only had one high end wheel (Fanatec) and it's not compatible with the One.</p>

<p>Sound very negative and the company that made the wheel put it at 300 dollars to sell. Well u can always sell your Xboxone and get Ps4 that has knack and indies, Killzone and be bored with nothing to do.</p>

<h2>            After latest W10 update, wireless keyboard does not work when trying to sign into account</h2>
                    <p>Good day Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just completed latest W10 update. Immediately after the update, when the account sign in page appeared I was able to type in my&nbsp;PIN. I use a wireless keyboard. However, on subsequent restarts, I can't use the keyboard. I had to use the onscreen keyboard
 to type the PIN to sign into my account.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that some of the updates for
<strong>Windows 10</strong> did not install correctly on your computer. If this is the case, you may experience challenges on your computer such as this. We suggest that you try to update the driver for your wireless keyboard and see if the issue persists:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Start.</strong></p>
<p>2. Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> and press
<strong>Enter.</strong></p>
<p>3. Select the category of the device you are trying to update.</p>
<p>4. Right-click on the name of the driver and select
<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to be connected to the Internet so that the computer will be able to find the latest drivers for your device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If updating the driver for your wireless keyboard did not resolve the issue, let us go ahead and uninstall/reinstall it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Select the category of the device you are trying to update.</p>
<p>4. Right-click on the name of the driver.</p>
<p>5. This time, select <strong>
Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Follow the on-screen steps to confirm the removal of the driver.</p>
<p>7. Reboot your computer and <strong>
Windows</strong> will automatically try to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 very slow to save files</h2>
                    <p>I have nearly the same problem as shown in&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-save-as-hanging-slow-when-selecting/afbe14a5-d2eb-457c-9fd9-5f89fa49588b</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to save a file, there is a long 10-15 second delay before the file browser shows a file location. This occurs on ALL applications. It started in December 2017. I have not been able to determine if a Windows update did this or what happened. Every
 time I want to save a file or load a file, the file browser opens with a "Working on it...." message that lasts for several seconds before it continues to work normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a one user, one computer system. I am logged in as administrator. This can not be traced to any specific software. It occurs for every program and started doing this since December 2017.</p>

<p>Hi Jerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have been caused by multiple programs that are running at the same time, low disk space, or etc. For us to isolate the issue, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is your computer slow upon startup?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to your PC settings prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/13443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">build number and version of your Windows</a></strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you perform the following methods given on this article to

<p>It is not slow to startup. I have not made any recent changes to this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs even when there is only one small program running. The problem is not limited to one specific program but occurs with everything. Even Notepad is affected by this slow ability to save or open files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home, Version 1709 Build 16299.192. All programs run without slowdown or difficulty. Opening File Explorer or trying to save or open a file from any program runs into a long delay. Opening File explorer from the taskbar may take up
 to 30 seconds. Trying to save a file or load a file from a program opens the File explorer window with a "Working on it..." message for up to 15 seconds before it will actually allow files to be saved or loaded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is sufficient free drive space available (240 GB free on 1TB drive). All routine Windows Updates and self-maintenance (such as defragmenting) have been successfully performed by Windows properly. There is plenty of RAM (12GB) on this Intel I7 Quad
 system. I am the only user. It is not networked or shared. The problem exists even when taken offline (disconnected from Ethernet, no WiFi is used)</p>

<p>This is an example screenshot. I blurred out two locations in the Quick access list for privacy. This shows how Notepad's Save action is affected by the 15 second delay before being useful issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening the Browse to upload this photo took 15 seconds to respond as well. Even Microsoft Edge is affected by this long delay in using the File Browser or File Explorer screens.&nbsp;</p>

            My money would be on the Fall Creators Update&nbsp;Version 1709 Build 16299.192&nbsp; It nailed all of my MS Office 2016 products with major degraded performance (read as slow) in addition to a number of other programs but not all.&nbsp; If you want to waste some major
 time, take a look at reverting back to Version 1703 (uninstall the Version 1709 Build 16299.192)&nbsp; I had to give up after spending four days attempting to resolve the problem and ended up blocking the Version 1709 update.&nbsp; My backup images allowed me to switch
 between Version 1703 and 1709 although it took me a few days to come to this conclusion). Hopefully Microsoft will have fixed all of the 1709 problems which are always associated with security issues.&nbsp; For me it is the known bug (Microsoft Common Issues listing
 for Version 1709) for the Antivirus API feature of the Fall Creators Update (Version 1709).&nbsp; But of course this is a big guess on my part but spending 4 days of debugging was my limit although I le

            I'm have the very same problem for 2-3 months now. Win 10 64 Gigs Ram, the fastest SSDs on the market, and it takes 15 seconds to save any kind of file, from complex down to simple text file. It is like that hard drives are completely asleep and need to
 wake up. I have spent 6k on this windows machine, and it is performing like its 1999.

<p>I have the same problem as described by the others. I'm using a Surface Pro 3 with Win 10. It was very fast until 2 or 3 months ago. There is plenty of disk space (50% free). But now it takes 10 to 15 seconds, and sometimes longer to save a file. This happens
 primarily when I rename a file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, I've worked it out. QuickAccess and Cortana are the guilty programmes. Removed all the folders I don't save to often in QuickAccess and replaced them with the one I do, things moved a bit faster. I then disabled cortana as it's something I will never
 use, everything is now up to speed.</p>

<h2>            Deleted Snipping Tool</h2>
                    
<p>January 14, 2009 I had my desktop re-booted by Microsoft, the Snipping tool was pinned to the Start Menu,</p>
<p>after the re-boot the Snipping Tool had been deleted from the Start Menu,&nbsp;to date&nbsp;I have been unable to locate</p>
<p>the Snipping Tool in any of the programmes or sub-programmes.&nbsp; I have damaged optical nerves and I found
</p>
<p>the Snipping Tool to be most handy to view, print (such things as bus schedules, entertainment programmes),</p>
<p>to&nbsp;accommodate my eye problems.&nbsp; How do I re-install the Snipping Tool back into my programmes and Start

<div>I am assuming that you have tried searching for the snipping tool by typing <span style="font-weight: bold">
snip</span> into the Start Menu search box. If not, please try that first. Otherwise, you should be able to locate the Snipping tool in your system32 folder.</div>
<div>Here's how:</div>
<div>1. Open Windows Explorer (Start&gt;Computer)</div>
<div>2. Double-Click on the "C" drive (or the drive where your operating system is installed, if not the C drive).</div>
<div>3. Double-Click on the "Windows" Folder. You may be notified that the files in this folder are essential system files and should not be altered or deleted. Proceed anyway.</div>
<div>4. Scroll down and find the folder labeled "System32". Double Click on it.</div>
<div>5. Arrange the files alphabetically by name and scroll down to the "s" section. You are looking for a file called "SnippingTool.exe". Once you've found it, right-click on it and choose "Pin to Start Menu" or "Add to Quick Launch" as desired. This will
 create a new shortcut to the tool in your start menu or on your quick launch bar. Or, if you prefer, you can choose "Send To" and then "Desktop (create shortcut)" from the right-click menu instead. This will create a snipping tool shortcut on your desktop.
 Under no circumstances should you delete or move the "SnippingTool.exe" file from the System32 folder, however.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please let us know if this solves your issue.</div>

            Hi danicafuensalida 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should restore/reset your computer using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer if you can't do this on your existing computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Note - You will get the option to keep your files during reset. But it will remove third party apps including Microsoft Office which will need to be reinstalled. Default Windows 10 apps will be automatically installed. But non-defaults Windows 10 apps will need to be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi danicafuensalida 
<br />
<br />If that reset was successfully, you should just see the login screen, since you are getting that screen, that means the reset operation basically failed . . .
<br />
<br />Try running the Reset again  from that Windows Recovery Environment you are in (if the Reset option is available)
<br />
<br />If that is not available or fails the second time around, your best and probably only option is to clean install Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />You will need access to a working PC to create the bootable installation media . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h3> dennissmiley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samba&#58; File to Large for Filesystem When Renaming Files - How do I fix this&#63;</h2>
                    First, I have just today finished creating a share consolidation service. The problem, was I had (estimated) 50+ SMB shares floating out there on the network. These were the server shares, nothing to do with clients on the network acting in a peer to peer
 fashon.<br />
<br />
Here is some info on how it was created:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://smileynetmainblog.blogspot.com/2018/04/new-high-level-cloud-sharing-service.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://smileynetmainblog.blogspot.co...g-service.html</span></a><br />

<br />
<a href="http://smileynetmain.createaforum.com/troubleshooting/problems-connecting-to-windows-10-share(s)/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://smileynetmain.createaforum.co...s-10-share(s)/</span></a><br />
<br />
So, there you have it. This is how it was created and some of the steps I took.<br />
<br />
To repeat here briefly, it is a service for consolidation of drives.<br />
<br />
1) I share the drives the way you normally would.<br />
2) I use a samba server, and create part of a folder structure.<br />
3) I fill in that folder structure, by using autofs to create and mount the shares into the appropriate place on that folder structure. Note that they are not mounted all the time, just when needed.<br />
4) I use samba to share the folder structure as a share<br />
<br />
*** Some changes needed to be made to Windows 10 server/clients to allow them to host shares for this setup.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
So there you have it! That's what this service is!<br />
<br />
So the problem? The moment I tried to start to use it for real work, it so far failed. In Windows 10, there is a function for creating a new file/folder. If I remember correctly, these are customizable templates, but we're not worried about that. You could
 say to create a libreoffice text document. Or you could say to create a new folder.<br />
<br />
In any case, when you create it, Windows will give it a default name, because every file/folder on the system, must have a name. You can't have 2 files/folders with the same name in the same place. The customary thing to do, when using this, is to create the
 file, and then immediately rename it, before possibly, adding it's contents.<br />
<br />
Well, it let's me create it, and even delete it if I want, so I know it's not a permission problem. But when I go to rename it, it complains that the file is too large for the underlying file system.<br />
<br />
But it's one file or folder! I checked the space in the underlying filesystem, and in this particular one, there is around 500GB of free space left!<br />
<br />
The workaround is to move or create the file somewhere locally, and then move it to/back to the share. Then it lets me. But who wants to do that all the time? For a few files, it was fine, but for every little thing?<br />
<br />
I rebooted the client machine once, and it fixed nothing. Please help

            I realized now, as I tested things deeper, that it is "definitely" a Windows 10 client problem. I have a Windows XP app server, and I was able to work with it there. I also have android devices with andsmb, and it works there too. So it's just a Windows
 10 client problem. The server is working. I'll troubleshoot a little more, and then if I don't solve it now, I'll repost as you suggest.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>WLTRAY.exe is a
</span></strong><span>wireless configuration tool, wltray.exe runs in the system tray and provides you with additional configuration options for your wireless networks. It allows you to prioritize known networks, as well as set auto connect or disconnect
 settings based on speed and availability. If this process is installed but not running, your wireless network adapter will not work properly. This process is distributed with Dell notebooks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these methods and check:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to reinstall the network adapter drivers from manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you face the similar issue in Safe Mode with networking, if not you can try putting your computer in a Clean Boot state in normal mode and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Follow the Microsoft KB article to perform clean boot on the computer:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section<strong> “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong>
 to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></span></p>

<h3> hgyeri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails will not print</h2>
                    I have two problems:<br />
<br />
I am not able to print my emails or the attachments in the emails.&nbsp; The printer works otherwise, printing from the internet, etc.&nbsp; I have looked at my settings and they are fine.&nbsp; Firewall is not blocking printer. I have gone through the Dell tutorial for printers
 and followed the steps.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Earthlink said it is not their problem.<br />
<br />
The second problem is I have noticed that sometimes I get emails that are dropped.&nbsp; I don't know where they go.&nbsp; They are not in my junk email or my delted file.&nbsp; I have "Show all Messages" checked so that is not the issue.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can you help?

<p>Hi Hgyeri,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Do you have EarthLink configured in outlook or Windows mail?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you get any error message when trying to print?<br />
•&nbsp;When did the issue start?<br />
•&nbsp;Was there any changes done prior to this issue?<br />
•&nbsp;Does the same happen with the webmail/Internet Explorer?<br />
•&nbsp;What did you mean by saying “I get emails that are dropped”?</p>
<p>Check if you are able to download and save the attachment on to the desktop and print.<br />

            I have Windows Mail.<br />
Yes the message I get is "Communication not available - printer cannot communicate with printer".<br />
I don't believe there had been any changes<br />
I don't use web mail.&nbsp; I do not get any error message when I use the Internet<br />
It just seems when I get an email I'll leave in my inbox and I'll come back maybe a week later or so and it's not there<br />
<br />
I have tried eveything to get my printer to work printing email, I cannot print word documents either.&nbsp; Someone suggested that I need to update the latest firmware on my printer.&nbsp; Not sure about that.<br />
<br />
Not sure where the attachment is that you are referring to.

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>These are some of the improvements offered in Windows 10:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Customizable Start experience.</li><li>Refreshed icons and graphics</li><li>Integration with Microsoft's digital assistant - Cortana, can be used for finding and retrieving information on the Internet and your PC, such as files. You can also use it to control applications such as the Music Player and prepare an email message or
 track a package. </li><li>Task View for managing applications using multiple desktops.</li><li>Modern apps can now be windowed and behave just like desktop apps.</li><li>Notification Center for centralized management of notifications and quick access to PC settings.</li><li>Universal applications that work not only on your Windows 10 PC, but also your mobile phone running Windows 10 and also XBOX One.</li><li>XBOX App for Streaming of live games to a PC or Tablet</li><li>Touch optimized Office applications (Word, Excel, Outlook, OneNote and PowerPoint). Providing the power of Office on devices with touch support. Users can edit, prepare documents, spreadsheets and presentations with full document fidelity regardless of
 device. </li><li>Continuum Mode - if you own a 2 in 1 form factor that works both as a laptop and tablet, you can easily let Windows 10 decide the best environment for you. Once detached into Tablet mode for instance, you can work in a more touch optimized user interface.
 Users will also be able to remotely use Windows 10 Mobile apps on their Windows PCs.</li><li>Microsoft Edge&nbsp;- Windows 10 will include a next generation web browser called Edge that support advances in Windows 10 such as Cortana for finding information on the web, Annotation, PDF support, superior reading experience.</li><li>Music and playlist integration in OneDrive.</li><li>Unified messaging using Skype Integration</li><li>Windows Hello and Passport for personalized authentication without the use of passwords.
</li><li>Device Guard for protecting devices against malicious applications.</li><li>Support for media formats such as FLAC and MKV</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Not necessarily:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan.

In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox.

<h2>            Download and Documents folders merged</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to change the default user locations for my downloads, videos, documents and etc folders from the C to the D drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While doing so, somehow, I merged the documents and downloads folder into one even though they still show separately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I click on "This PC" and the folders show up, I right click, go to properties, locations, I change the location for the downloads folder and the change also applies to the documents folder too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I restore them to being separate?</p>

<h2>            dnsapi.dll&#58; Norton says outbound traffic detected</h2>
                    Norton security software wants to run Power Eraser because it reports "outbound traffic detected." &nbsp;I run the Power Eraser, but Norton says it cannot fix the problem. &nbsp;Norton appears to identify dnsapi.dll as the source. &nbsp;I'm not sure if Norton is unnecessarily
 sensitive, or if the dnsapi.dll file might be infected.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are facing in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Dnsapi.dll error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's try the below steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform a </span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span> and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><span>to disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow:<span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"> </span></span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> </span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong> </span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> I also suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC scan (System file checker) scan.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>

<h2>            Watch Live Stream TV on my laptop</h2>
                    <p>I want to watch live TV on my computer. I do so using my DirecTV account however I am having problems doing similar with my Cox TV Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to download the app so I contacted Microsoft for recommendations. The nice gentleman told me that I needed Windows 10 to do so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I down loaded Win 10 and LOVE IT! It works so much better for me than Win 8.1 however I still can not get the "Cox TV Connect" app either from Microsoft Apps or Google Apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In closing, again, no issues with DirecTV signing on and watching TV live if a WIFI signal is present. Why can't I download the app needed to watch Cox TV?</p>

<h2>            Party&#47;game Invites</h2>
                    I am not getting any party or game invite notifications through my xbox. I will get party invites through the app but my Xbox won’t show my invites and my game invites won’t go through either. If any one knows how to fix this please let me know.

            <p>Hi Carol,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for showing interest on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to have patience till the installation process completes, as it may take time for the installation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: it is not recommended to stop the installation process until it completes. It may cause serious problems like
 boot failure/blue screen of death.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Windows 10 installation fails then, I would recommend you to download and upgrade the Windows 10 through Windows 10 ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft article to <strong>download Windows 10 Insider Preview ISO</strong> and check if it helps.</p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Reference</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">: Refer to the following response created by Bennet Martin on
