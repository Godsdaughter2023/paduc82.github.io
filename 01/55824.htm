<h2>            Launch OSK in Modern user-interface using mouse only &#40;no swiping up, no touch screen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have <strong>HP Pavilion dv6</strong> originally have <em>Windows Vista</em>, upgraded to
<em>Windows 7 Ultimate</em>, and <strong><em>willing to upgrade to Windows 8.1 Pro N</em></strong><br />
Some of its <strong>keys are not working</strong> <strong>(ZXCVM,&lt;.&gt;/?;)</strong>&nbsp;since something happened when I'm still in<em> Windows 7</em>.
</p>
<p>So since then I'm <strong>using OSK and physical keyboard</strong> when working in text.
</p>
<p>I used<em> Windows 8</em> recently in a desktop and found out <strong>OSK works only in Desktop</strong> and
<strong>not in Metro environment (unless you have touch screen and doesn't have keyboard plugged in)</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to use the <strong>Metro OSK (the black keyboard)</strong> so when I'm typing here in my Laptop, I can work ordinarily. But I think that's not possible.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Please help/advice</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>ASAP</u></strong><br />
<strong>Thank you!</strong> </p>

<h2>            Cannot delete a file even though I&#39;m administrator, can&#39;t change permissions, can&#39;t use command line prompts</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to delete a png file I just downloaded from my email that I sent to myself. I am the only user on my computer, and I am the administrator. It won't delete. I've tried using every method I know, including command line prompts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"rmdir "D:\All Stories\Abnormal Geometry\Unsized Pages\4.04.png" /s"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"SET DIRECTORY_NAME="D:\All Stories\Abnormal Geometry\Unsized Pages\4.04.png"<br />
TAKEOWN /f %DIRECTORY_NAME% /r /d y<br />
ICACLS %DIRECTORY_NAME% /grant administrators:F /t<br />
PAUSE"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"DEL "D:\All Stories\Abnormal Geometry\Unsized Pages\4.04.png""</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these say that Access is denied. If I go to permissions and try to change the ownership there, this happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the pictures aren't showing, then I'll try to explain it. At every level, the properties tab either says "You must have Read permissions to view the properties of this object" or "You do not have permission to view or edit this object's permission settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, I'm the only user and administrator on my computer, and this is my file that I emailed to myself.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do. I still can't delete the file. Can anyone tell me how to delete it, or even better, how this happens and how I can avoid it in the future? This isn't even the first time this happened, but before, the first command line prompt
 always worked. </p>

            Hi McKee,<br />
<br />
We see here that you're unable to delete a file using the Administrator account on your Windows 10 device. To answer your query, we recommend that you boot your computer in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>, then check if you can delete the file. We would like to know as well what troubleshooting steps have
 you tried so far to fix this issue.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your reply.

            <p>I tend to not like to reboot my computer in safe mode, because I've lost data too many times, so is there any alternative?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to trying command line prompts and changing permissions, I've tried outright deleting it, signing in to a secondary account, moving it to a folder and deleting the folder... None of these have worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the original file deleted itself after some time. I have no idea why. But the same problem is happening again with another file. The thing is, the file worked fine until it suddenly "glitched" and didn't allow me to change it or use it anywhere.
 It's an image, but shows the default image icon in icon view instead of the actual image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this isn't even the first time, or the second time. It would really be great if I knew what was causing the issue. I'm an illustrator, so this is very inconvenient.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior happens when an important system file is corrupted or missing from the Windows system. We highly suggest running the System File Checker (SFC) tool to repair or replace the corrupted and missing system files. To do so, enter this line on the
 Command Prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>sfc /scannow</em></p>

            It looks like a problem is more with the system then with the file itself. If moderators solution of using System File Checker did not work, you can try booting your PC by using USB drive with other OS on (Ubuntu Linux for example). It&nbsp;should allow you
 to delete the file. Also, you can check this&nbsp;tutorial: <a href="https://www.visitormaker.com/it-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Professionnal Edition (version 6.1, build 7600). It includes Windows Media Player version 12.0.7600.16415. But after I install a third-party codec package, I meet a problem with a notice "Windows Media Player encountered a problem
 while playing the file.". I do not know why that problem happens and the file I am trying to open is a video include in folder "Sample Videos" (Wildlife.wmv file). I think the third-party codec might cause that problem, and I uninstalled it, but it can't fix.
 Before installing that codec, my WMP work well... How can I fix that problem? The web page along with this problem has nothing to help me.

            Finally, I have found the resolution for my issue. Just do as that page says:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947541/en-us#LetMeFixItMyself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947541/en-us#LetMeFixItMyself</a> . Now my WMP works well again (Not neccesary to do step 4-9, because I think they are for WMP 11, not for WMP 12 - and I only do first 3 steps, in step 3, 'and then click OK' is referred to 'and
 then press Enter button'). About dowmload file 
'Fix this problem' , do not try it if you are using WMP 12, it is designed for WMP 11.<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Do not install any third-party codec that you do not know any thing about them like me. It can make you meet some big problem. I suggest to use K-Lite Mega Codec Pack, which I am using now to play .mkh and .flv files. Have fun with it.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 File Explorer Not Respondingn, Freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexflorin89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Explorer Not Respondingn, Freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is as it follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 on a new SSD last week.</p>
<p>It was a clean install.</p>
<p>I kept my old 1Tb HDD also whit Windows 10 installed on it for backup(in case the SSD will have problems).</p>
<p>Some time after the install I noticed when accessing a folder on my HDD that it takes a log time for Explorer to load, didn't pay attention to it and I closed it.</p>
<p>I installed a few programs and a game.</p>
<p>The game is installed on my HDD and after I started playing I noticed some flickering and artifacts and the game would freeze, I would not be able to close the game I had to Restart my PC. I thought it was a GPU driver problem but it's not.</p>
<p>After the restart I got blocked at the BIOS page where it detects my hardware, it stayed there for minutes until I force closed my PC and started it again after which it ran normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My initial tough is that my graphics drivers are the problem but installing an older version(after I completely deleted the old version) did nothing to solve the problem.</p>
<p>After that I updated Windows 10 to the last build whit the Insider Program but nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my PC works partially, when I try to access a folder on my HDD(it will probably happen on the SSD as well only it takes longer), it can happen at the first or 3rd try or whatever it's random but Explorer will freeze and I get the not responding message.
 When this happens it takes like 10 minutes at leas to recover and will happen again right after that. If I restart my PC I will get block at the BIOS page where it detect my hardware, I have to completely close my PC and start if after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I check my HDD and it's health is at 100%, the SSD is the same so I'm quite confident it's not a hardware problem, also Windows 10 installed om my HDD works without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please help me whit a solution?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

            Hi Alex,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for&nbsp;sharing your concern&nbsp;in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per the above query :<br />
1.&nbsp;File explorer is not responding and freezes at times.<br />
2.&nbsp;The game you installed, flickers and also freezes.<br />
3.&nbsp;The issue occurs even after updating to the recent insider preview build.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please provide us the below information to assist you better.<br />
1.&nbsp;What is the make model of&nbsp; your PC ?<br />
2.&nbsp;Which insider preview&nbsp;build&nbsp;you have updated&nbsp; to ?<br />
3.&nbsp;Does the issue occur on Local account or Microsoft account ?<br />
4.&nbsp;Do you see/get any error message or code ?</div>
<div>5. Which game are you referring to ?</div>
<div>6. Is the issue specific to that game ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may also want to update the MB chipset drivers from the OEM/manufacturer website to check if that helps.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Install any pending Windows updates on the&nbsp;PC to check if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might be&nbsp;causing due to any system file corruption, outdated or corrupted drivers or due to any third party software conflict.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lets follow the below method and see if this helps.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1 :</strong> Clean boot.<br />
Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</div>

<h2>            Random disconnects to xbox live while play  COD. </h2>
                    
<p>It just kicks me out of the game and says I'm disconnected from xbox live and need to connect. &nbsp;I reconnect and it will happen again in a couple minutes. This happen at least once a week where I cannot stay connected and it happens for hours. It is not my
 internet cause I have no issues with any thing else running off of the router. I have tried using wifi and wired connection and it doesn't seem to matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same issue. &nbsp;Xbox was rock solid until this week and now it randomly disconnects from Live. &nbsp;With Borderlands Pre-Sequel it will drop after 5-20 minutes, while with Brothers in Arms it drops as soon as the title screen appears. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes I can play with no issues for a week but no more than that and most of the &nbsp;times it occurs daily and multiple times to the point I just shut the console down. I have went through everything and the bottom line
 is the issue is on Microsoft's end but they always blame it on the ISP or your router. My son's friend brought his PS4 over last week and let him use it and there have been NO ISSUES. &nbsp;Bottom line the network is now garbage and probably has to do with them
 trying to force everyone to buy ONE now instead of waiting. &nbsp;I have news, if this keeps up I'm getting the PS4 if they don't correct it. &nbsp;Just tired of it......</p>

<p>happened 6 more times on the 28th, also happened 2 times on the 29th but I gave up as it would take me several minutes to login to xbox live and then onto COD. After the second time I would try to find a game and it would never connect me to a game. &nbsp; It
 also happened 3 times today so I gave up again and logged of. </p>

<p>i am having the same issue except its not like once or twice a day more like once or twice a hour i just ran a speed test on my wireless laptop as soon as i got kicked off this time and the results make me highly doubt its connection related. i have also
 streamed a movie on my laptop during this wirelessly without lag and my xbox disconnects still it is wired so thats not it. i have tried all the quick fixes of clearing my cache and redownloading my profile, resetting my xboxs connections, adding security
 proofs. no luck yet could use help</p>

<p>Just purchased Advanced Warfare and guess what disconnected again over and over. &nbsp;It will let me connect, search a game, get put in a lobby and then just get pulled from the lobby, then thrown into another just to be pulled from that one and so on and so
 on.... AHHHHHHH!!!!! &nbsp;I'm also having the connection issue happening frequently now. Happens daily. Sometimes happens once or twice an hour and sometimes happens repeatedly to the point I just turn it off. &nbsp;Please remind me what I pay $50/year for and $60-$100
 for games with multiplayer when I CAN"T PLAY Them online!!! </p>

<p>its disgusting too calling xbox live support is a joke cause they say its our connection or were doing something wrong cause they wont admit theres a problem they arnt willing to fix cause theyre too lazy and they dont acknowledge us on forums the post will
 go inactive after weeks then if we post again they ask us to create a whole new post saying the same thing so they can do nothing yet we pay 60$a year for this</p>

<p>It's almost as if the company expects us to keep paying for products that aren't up to modern standards. These problems aren't limited to xbox live, they're embedded in the culture of Microsoft. I wonder how long it will take for them to die off as a cash
 cow. </p>
<p>Do PS4s have issues this frequently? If not, switching will probably save a lot of grief in the long run.

<h2>            Windows 10 Internet Explorer 11 crashing on startup due to Logitech Webcam incompatibility</h2>
                    <p>Just posting this for information in case anyone else runs into the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home Edition - Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) crashes upon startup without ever displaying the UI or an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Application Event Log contains an APPCRASH error with faulting application as iexplore.exe, faulting module of ntdll.dll, exception code 0xc0000005. Not much help at all.</p>
<p>When the PC is started in Safe Mode, IE 11 starts as expected which led me to investigate the installed drivers.</p>
<p>Through process of elimination I determined that the cause is a process called LVPrcSrv.exe which is part of the drivers supplied with an old Logitech Quickcam Pro 9000 webcam and is initiated upon startup. Terminating that process via Task Manager allows
 IE 11 to start. Restarting it causes IE11 to fail. I have uninstalled the Logitech software to eliminate the problem, but now don't have a working webcam.</p>
<p />

<p>After reading the above, I deleted the Logitech software for the camera I quit using a while ago and IE-11 now launches correctly.</p>

            <p>You may have a miss match of file types, the pictures are in different formats. One way I was able to correct this was to move all the pictures I was going to use in a project to a folder I create on the Desktop, actually 2 folders say a 1 and a 2. 1st folder
 is where I move all of the pictures and audio and video what ever the file then I open the program I use to convert my files, I use AVS4YOU I got the life time, anyway. Once the&nbsp;Converter is open I open !st folder and drag and drop by clicking the first file
 picture/audio/etc. and&nbsp;hold down the shift key and click the last&nbsp;file and while holding down the shift key I grab the first file and drag all to the Converter. Once there convert them to a format your slideshow creator recognizes and you should be good to
 go.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>

                    I am not sure what all this does, but I only have Vista Home Premium and I am wondering if I upgrade to Ultimate, if IIS will come with it.&nbsp; I have new software that I need to install that requires the IIS.<br />

Install Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0<br />
&nbsp;Applies to: Home Premium, Business, Enterprise, Ultimate.</p>
<p>Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 is not installed by default when you install Windows. To install it with the default settings, which will serve only static content such as HTML files and bitmap (.bmp) files, follow the first procedure below. If you
 want your web server to serve dynamic content—for example, executable (.exe) files or server-side include (.ssi) files—follow the second procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To install IIS with default settings <br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Click the Start button , click Control Panel, ‌ click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp; In the list of Windows features, select Internet Information Services, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;To install IIS to serve dynamic content <br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Click the Start button , click Control Panel, ‌ click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp; In the list of Windows features, click the plus sign (+) next to Internet Information Services, click the plus sign (+) next to World Wide Web Services, click the plus sign (+) next to Application Development Features, select the dynamic content features
 you want to install, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1e62706b-ef53-4ecd-a217-0e7bcf82009b1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1e62706b-ef53-4ecd-a217-0e7bcf82009b1033.mspx</a><br />
Turn Windows features on or off</p>
<p>Some programs and features that are included with Windows, such as Internet Information Services, must be turned on before you can use them. Certain other features are turned on by default, but you can turn them off if you don’t use them.</p>
<p>In earlier versions of Windows, to turn a feature off you had to uninstall it completely from your computer. In this version of Windows, the features remain stored on your hard disk, so you can turn them back on if you want to. Turning off a feature does
 not uninstall the feature, and it does not reduce the amount of hard disk space used by Windows features.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Click the Start button , click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; To turn a Windows feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a Windows feature off, clear the check box.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Some Windows features are grouped together in folders, and some folders contain subfolders with additional features. If a check box is partially checked or appears dark, then some of the items inside the folder are turned on and some are turned off. To view
 the contents of a folder, double-click it.<br />

    <title>Headset Adapter didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t fit &#61; Broken Port on the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adventivecube3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headset Adapter didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t fit &#61; Broken Port on the Controller</h2>
                    
<p>So I just bought the Xbox One headset adapter. It wouldn't plug into the controller port easily it seemed liked it was slightly misaligned.&nbsp;I applied more pressure to it with slight rocking motion&nbsp;and it broke the port (the one built in the controller).&nbsp;
 The port receptor is now "loose"&nbsp;and it rattles as it moves up in down in it's little area that is made available inside the&nbsp;controller.</p>

<p>I'm waiting for the Support Chat contact me, but 20 minutes is too long to not get bored so I thought I would share this with everyone.</p>

<p>Really sucks as I have a day one console and hope they can replace it with the same controller while hopefully doing something for my troubles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem. &nbsp;I normally use a second normal controller, &nbsp;which doesn't have a problem, but it doesn't fit &nbsp;my Day One controller. This is the first time my DO controller has been used too. &nbsp;Was trying not to use it but have been having

<p>I didn't pay much attention to this thread because I did not have the problem. &nbsp;My adapter fit perfectly on all three of my controllers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That changed yesterday. I purchased a second adapter so I wouldn't have to swap the adapter between the two controllers I use most often. &nbsp;This new adapter would not fit into any of my controllers.</p>
<p>I placed them side by side and saw that the new one had the connector angled 'down' slightly so that it would not accurately engage the socket on the controller. &nbsp;I pushed the connector upward with slight pressure and attempted again. &nbsp;The fit was perfect.</p>
<p>It is my belief from this experience that the quality control is lacking somewhere and the connector on the adapter is being pressured out of alignment.</p>

<p>Looks like there are quality control issues with the adapter and controllers. If the adapter fits in one controller but not another, the controller could be at fault. Equally, if the adapter doesn't fit in multiple controllers, it's likely to be a controller
 issue. &nbsp;TBH my second controller feels slightly misaligned, like it's flexing, and it squeaks like a boss. Very annoying.</p>

<p>Hi BG Azid, </p>
<p>Sorry you're having problems with audio through your controller. This thread is pretty old, and it looks like the OP has their answer. So the community can best assist with your exact issue I would suggest creating a new thread of your own.

<h2>            Skype for Business reply behaivior</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put a sent message can be seen on the receivers&nbsp;moblile device or the PC, this we know.&nbsp; However when that person replies, the reply is ONLY seen on the device that the original message was sent from.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:&nbsp; I send a Skype Message from my
 computer and leave my desk to go to a meeting.&nbsp; The person replies that the meeting was cancelled, but the reply can only be seen on the PC not the mobile device.&nbsp; This is a problem as you can understand.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; We have tested this with another phone. So the problem is not based on the mobile device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- We have duplicated this on entirely different accounts and devices.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is the normal behairvior?&nbsp; Or, can it be changed with a server setting?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hello Marty,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks for your detailed description which makes your symptom much clear to us. I did a test on our side and here are the results:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. When sending a message from a computer, the response will show both on your computer and mobile only if you close the conversation window on your computer and keep SFB running on the background. This will
 open a new conversation window on your computer. In other words, if you keep the conversation window open, the response will only appear on your computer.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>As you are facing issues with high system memory usage on your PC, we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that there might be a third party application/ software using the Windows Services causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try few of the troubleshooting steps below and check if it helps to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 1: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to

<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Chkdsk: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The
<strong>Chkdsk</strong> (Check Disc) scan will try to identify and repair bad sectors found on the hard drive. Any data present on these sectors might be lost in the process. The computer can also go into a no boot state. Proceed at your own risk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<strong>X&nbsp;</strong>keys on the keyboard, click&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong>&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type the following command, and then press&nbsp;<strong>ENTER</strong>:&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clean Boot</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> to

            I use Symantec Endpoint protection and had to update. That said, just after the anniversary update windows defender was monopolizing the disk drive for a good five minutes where any other task was impossible. Disk activity then returned to normal.

    <title>Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t obtain Ip Address from router or Modem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t obtain Ip Address from router or Modem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I live in PA, USA and I cannot connect to X-Box Live. I have the same Router and same Xbox 360 only I now have a new television. When I first turned on the X-Box the update screen loaded and never completed, saying it cannot complete the update. From
 that point on I have suffered from loss of connection. My computer and internet work fine, just not with my X-Box. My X-Box also acknowledges the Network cable but simply cannot obtain any IP information.</p>
<p>In response to this I jumped on the forums and began running through the troubleshooting options. I believe i have successfully completed the steps multiple times. I've been at it for 5-6 or more grueling&nbsp; hours.</p>
<p>I've restarted all components, manually entered IP addresses, alternate Mac addresses, and even called my ISP to manually enter both Primary and Secondary DNS server information. I have had verification, visual and on-line trouble shoot chat, that my DHCP
 settings are active. I have reset my router, bought new cables, restored system defaults, set my system to automatically receive information, and done more connectivity testing than any man should. I'm out of options.</p>
<p>The router I'm using is a Verizon FiOS Model #: MI424WR for Verizon FiOS</p>
<p>Any help would be amazing. Thanks.</p>

<p><span>What does Test Xbox Live Connection report?</span></p>
<p><span>If it does NOT find an explicit problem, I would suggest Resetting the Factory (Network) Settings. Tap on the silver Guide button again, go two clicks to the right, choose Settings, System
 Settings, Network Settings, then choose your connection (WIRED if Ethernet, otherwise the SSID of your WiFi connection), then Configure Network. Copy down the settings for IP (auto/manual, IP address, subnet mask and gateway) as well as DNS (auto/manual, primary
 DNS server, secondary DNS server), then go one click right to Additional settings. If anything is _not_ blank or Not Set, make a note of those settings as well, then go to the bottom and choose Restore to Factory Defaults and confirm. Then power down the console,
 wait 8 secs or more, power back up and reconnect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, clear the system cache (it's just game updates plus other temporary files, nothing that's at all important to anyone) by:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Tap the silver Xbox Guide button on the controller, go right 2 clicks to Settings, pick System Settings.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select Storage (or Memory).</span></p>
<p><span>3) Move over any hard drive or memory unit (not the Cloud) &amp; press (Y) on your controller &amp; pick Clear System Cache.</span></p>
<p><span>4) When asked to confirm storage device maintenance, choose Yes. Try again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't fix it, most likely there's a port blocked... ports can be blocked in your router, modem, or at your ISP. Since the Xbox 360 uses different ports than PCs &amp; Macs use, you can't
 see the effect of a port blockage except on the Xbox. A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing a port blockage:
<br />
1) turn off the Xbox then<br />
2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).
<br />
3) unplug power from the modem. <br />
4) Wait at least 30 secs then replug the modem (or gateway) power. <br />
5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem (or gateway) which says ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that light says
 it's ready, skip step 6.<br />
6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.<br />
7) Turn on the Xbox.&nbsp; For more background on Ports, see <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Are you saying that your console never actually completed the required system update that's needed for LIVE?&nbsp;This more than likely means that a corrupt/failed system update is the cause of your XBOX 360's connection issues.<br />
<br />
Please try the following:<br />
<strong><br />
Remove&nbsp;<span>System</span>&nbsp;<span>Update</span>:</strong></p>
<p>Turn off your console. Then press and hold the sync button (the small one you use to connect new wireless controllers) next to the Memory Unit slots (old XBOX 360) or USB Slots (new XBOX 360 S).</p>
<p>With that sync button held down, press the console's power button to turn it on. Hold down the sync button until the dashboard (hopefully) starts up completely.</p>
<p>Now delete any incomplete&nbsp;<span>update</span>&nbsp;files by going all the way right to the&nbsp;<span>system</span>&nbsp;settings hub, there go to the&nbsp;<span>System</span>&nbsp;tile in the upper left and choose Storage.</p>
<p>On your controller, press the following button sequence:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the left bumper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the right bumper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the X button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the left bumper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the right bumper.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the X button.<br />
<br />
After you've turned the console on again, try and update the console using a USB Flash Drive by manually downloading the update from this site
<strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how that worked out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks everyone. I was on forums and live chats all day using great suggestions. I appreciate it. The problem was solved in the last hours with a phone call to the connectivity dept. His second question "which port is the Ethernet cable plugged into". I
 have a two in one Modem Router and had my Ethernet cable plugged into the WAN port instead of the LAN port. Fixed. That simple. So again, thanks. I had a bad case of the dumb;p</p>

            <p>Depending on your PC hardware, you'll see benefits from upgrading to Windows 10. DirectX12 is the next generation API, replacing the 5 year-old DirectX 11 from Windows 7. Microsoft is promising more direct access to hardware, thus faster game rendering.

<h2>            Automatic Repair fails, impossible to refresh or restore</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a PC with windows 8.1 installed (8 OEM, upgraded to 8.1 via the store).</p>
<p>When I turn it on it starts the automatic repair procedure, but it fails. I've kept trying lots of times, but everytime it fails, the srttrail.txt file say it could not find the problem (actually one time it said damaged registry, rollback failed error 0x2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>System refresh doesn't work, it says there was a problem (it does not explain which kind of error).
</p>
<p>I cannot do a System Restore because there are not restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that having upgraded windows 8 from the store it's normal that system refresh is not working. I tried booting with a 8.1 DVD downloaded from microsoft site and trying to refresh with it with no success, there was an error (it doesn't give any hint
 about what kind of error occurred).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't installed anything on my PC before this error (maybe some automatic windows updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem this summer, and I ended formatting, reinstalling 8, upgrading it from the store to 8.1 and reinstalling all my software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some way to repair my windows without starting from scratch?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, is there some way to use my windows 8 key to install windows 7?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Ste,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not worry, I will assist you with the issue. It could be due corrupt system files or software issue. I understand that you have tried system refresh and restore, still it does not work. I suggest you to try Automatic repair by going to Windows recovery
 environment using a Windows 8.1 CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to the suggestions made by Karthik Vengaloor replied on May 3, 2013.</p>
