            <p>If the original Windows 7 license is an OEM license that came with the previous computer, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you will have to purchase a new full version Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

</p><p>OEM (original equipment manufacturer) is the copy of Windows 7 that came preinstalled when you bought the computer and, as others have noted, cannot be transferred to another computer, whether by installation or by moving the hard drive. &nbsp;That means that
 the upgrade to Windows 10 also cannot be moved either. &nbsp;Both are tied to the mobo. &nbsp;If Windows 7 came on your computer, it is OEM.</p>

            <p>As Greg says, "retail" is not necessarily transferrable. &nbsp;It says "retail" because it
<em>might </em>be transferrable. &nbsp;Greg gives the conditions under which it would be transferable, namely if the underlying license is transferrable. &nbsp;Perhaps the term "standalone licenses" best describes a license that can be transferred. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 freebie is an upgrade to the base license. &nbsp;It is not itself a standalone license. &nbsp;However, if the base license is standalone then the two licenses together are transferrable. &nbsp;Your base license is not a standalone license so the Windows
 10 upgrade is not either. &nbsp;If you had upgraded a copy of Windows that was standalone (you bought it in a store) to Windows 10 then both could be transferred together.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backgound</strong>: &nbsp;In the past, there were two retail consumer licenses: &nbsp;Full Package Product, and Upgrade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "full" license was independent (standalone), i.e., did not require a previous version of Windows in order to install it. &nbsp;The box had printed on it "For a new computer or a computer without an operating system." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade licenses did require a previous version of Windows. &nbsp;The Upgrade box was labelled "Upgrade for users of (list of operating systems)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does not have retail Upgrade boxes. &nbsp;Only FPP. &nbsp;The retail upgrade license is no more. &nbsp;(The retail prices of Windows 10 Home and Pro are equivalent to the Upgrade prices for previous versions of Windows, however, so Microsoft played nice with
 pricing.)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why I can't transfer my OEM license</strong>: &nbsp;OEM licenses are not tranferrable because of support. &nbsp;In order for the OEM to to be able to install Windows on the computer you bought, the OEM paid a royalty to Microsoft that is a fraction of a copy's
 retail price. &nbsp;To get such a low price from Microsoft, Microsoft requires the OEM to assume all support for your Windows. &nbsp;But the OEM cannot be expected to support your copy of Windows on any other computer but the one he sold you. &nbsp;HP is not about to support
 your copy of Windows on any computer of your choice, like a Dell, Gateway, etc., so the OEM is within his rights not to give you a transfer rights.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 pro... Cannot get DHCP after joining company Domain</h2>
                    
<p>We've recently acquired a Laptop with Windows 7 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>After deploying all standard applications to the laptop, we noticed that it was no longer getting an address from the domain DHCP server and receiving "unidentified Network" message when looking at the network card.</p>
<p>We tried the following as per many other similar post:</p>
<ul>
<li>rebuild the IP stack </li><li>update the NIC driver </li><li>reinstall the NIC </li><li>disable IPv6 </li><li>update all patches on all DC's </li><li>Remove computer from domain </li><li>Remove every application one by one </li><li>disable the firewall </li><li>remove any policies and modify existing GPO </li><li>modify registry as per some other posts </li><li>restore to previous states of the laptop </li><li>modify routes </li><li>etc, etc, etc... </li></ul>
<p>After more than 8 hours of troubleshooting, we gave up and decided to do a factory restore. NOTE that the laptop did get DHCP from the network prior ot joining it to the domain... we were able to download all updates, applications and join it to the corporate
 domain.</p>
<p>Now again today, we are not able to get DHCP after joining the laptop to the domain. Here are is exactly what we did today:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restore Laptop to factory default - Windows 7 64Bit </li><li>Login as default user with administrator priv (as per setup) after reboot </li><li>Get DHCP address after reboot??&nbsp;&nbsp; YES!!!&nbsp; 10.100.2.2 with Subnet and DNS</li><li>Run Windows Update </li><li>Reboot </li><li>Activate hidden administrator account </li><li>Assign Password </li><li>Reboot </li><li>Login as local Administrator user </li><li>Join Network Domain with domain administrator account. Add Adminstrator user to local&nbsp;admin group.&nbsp;Success!</li><li>Reboot </li><li>Login as Domain Administrator account </li><li>Verify DHCP - yes!&nbsp; 10.100.2.2.&nbsp; </li><li>Verify Internet access and domain access. Success! </li><li>Try ipconfig /release.. success!&nbsp; Try ipconfig /renew... success.&nbsp; IP 10.100.2.2</li><li>force GP update&nbsp;&nbsp; gpupdate /force </li><li>success! </li><li>Reboot </li><li>Login as Domain Administrator account </li><li>Verify DHCP - yes!&nbsp; 10.100.2.2.&nbsp; </li><li>Try ipconfig /relea
<p>Anyone have any ideas??? I'm about ready to give up and load XP Pro on the system.</p>
<p>I do appricate any help at all.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Unable to find recovery environment&#34; while trying to reset the operating system on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My Nextbook Flex computer with windows ten has had a virus for a while now. It cut off my access to Microsoft edge and now I can't connect to the Internet at all regardless of brower. I have some sort of Chinese Antivirus program I didn't even install always
 running and inrerfering and I can't uninstall it. Several apps have stopped opening, and I can't access the Windows store. I've tried a couple weeks to reset it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I needed recovery media. I couldn't create it off of that computer; it told me there were files missing. So I made a recovery drive out of a flash drive using a different pc with Windows ten. (Using the settings and such)</p>
<p>But I still can't reset. If I go to settings&gt;update and security&gt;recovery, and click reset this PC, it tells me it can't find the recovery environment (if it even stays open that long and doesn't crash.) Even though the recovery USB is there and I even if
 I restart with it in the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't even reset from pressing shift while restarting on the login screen. If I select troubleshoot, it takes me directly to advanced options. And if I tell it to use the recovery media (the option next to troubleshoot), it tells me my PC needs to be repaired
 and that it can't find the recovery media. I'm so frustrated. I can't afford to take it to a shop. Does anyone know other ways to factory reset or to get it to recognize the recovery media?</p>

</p><p>3) No, I'm pretty sure it didn't come with a trial. Security options related things always pointed me towards Windows Defender. (On an unrelated note I've learned from this horrible mess and actually purchased McAfee for my new laptop, but haven't installed
 it on this nextbook because of the issues with Internet access.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) No, I've never run a Norton or McAfee removal tool.</p>

            <p>The recovery media problem might be related to the other problems you are having.&nbsp; When you made a recovery drive did you try unchecking the box to transfer system files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the path to your recovery tools image has been corrupted some of the recovery options will not work and the recovery drive will not be created.&nbsp; You can check the path by typing the command below in an
<strong>administrative </strong>command prompt.&nbsp; Copy and paste the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reagentc /info</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Chinese Anti-virus you say is installed by you do not know where it came from?&nbsp; It wasn't and OEM install that came with the system?&nbsp; If you can't find out what it is, you may have a virus instead..&nbsp; Maybe if Defender will even run it will find something,
 unless it is being blocked.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard layouts - how to prevent default ones from auto-adding themselves</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>firstly, I'd like to apologize if my english fails at some point, since I maybe won't be able to describe my problem perfectly, even though I will do my best to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I've created one custom layout for English (USA) keyboard and removed the default one. Secondly, I added Slovak keyboard layout (it is QWERTZ by default so I chose QWERTY version. Everything worked just fine until the latest major update (I think it
 was the November one, I'm not sure though). After that update, there are not only the keyboard layouts I chose, but also the default ones (see the image below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b7b9cf4-7d86-43f8-8824-d27cb7958814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b7b9cf4-7d86-43f8-8824-d27cb7958814" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The SLK-SKQ and ENG (English-french) ones are the ones I want to have there, however, for some unknown reason, there are also these two (SLK-SK and ENG-US) added. They aren't added there when I start Windows, they just appear there after some time. When
 I go to "language preferences" (I hope it is called that way - anyway, I mean the icon of gear at the bottom of the image) and to each language, I see only the ones I had chosen before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That wouldn't be as much of a problem since when I Alt+Shift, it chooses languages from the two I chose. However, sometimes, absolutely randomly, it changes it to one of those two that I don't want. I guess the problem would go away if they weren't there
 at all. So, my question to you, fellow Windows users, is there any way to fix this permanently? I even tried to add those two I didn't want and delete it - that makes the problem go away, but only until the next start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice will be helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Probably not random, if you think about the keystrokes you just used, especially if you haven't disabled some of the default Hotkey combinations.&nbsp; Unfortunately Search Settings is not aware of the options, so you would have to know that they are there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 See if you can start from here:</p>
<p>Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region\Language\Advanced settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there is a button under <em>Switching input methods</em> labeled&nbsp;<em>Change language bar hotkeys</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to disable some defaults in there.&nbsp; I find using Win+Spacebar or Win+Shift+Spacebar to be all that I need and disabling the others helps me
 avoid "surprises".&nbsp; YMMV.</p>

    <title>No Bass in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mmcdonald0822  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Bass in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have recently bought a new laptop, a Toshiba Satellite C55D-A, and it came installed with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have been having problems with the volume quality, mainly that there seems to be virtually no bass or low-end frequencies whenever I listen to music,
 regardless of the program (iTunes, Windows Media Player, QuickTime, YouTube). &nbsp;This is not a problem with the speakers, but with the computer's playback itself. &nbsp;I tried plugging a pair of headphones in, which usually play bass very well, and I could not hear
 it. &nbsp;I tried several other pairs of headphones also and there was no bass. &nbsp;I tried plugging an auxiliary cord from my laptop to a very good pair of speakers, and even with a sub-woofer turned on the sound was very tinny and there was no low-end. &nbsp;I tried
 going to Speaker Properties&gt;Enhancements and adjust the EQ, but that did not work. &nbsp;I also tried going to Speaker Properties&gt;Advanced and adjust the Default Format, but that also did nothing. &nbsp;The Controller information says I have Realtek High Definition
 Audio and the Device Status says that "The device is working properly." &nbsp;It also said that my software is up to date. &nbsp;I did not have this issue on my old laptop which also ran on Windows 8.1, and would really like to get this issue resolved because I am a
 bass player and the lack of low-end makes it rather difficult to practice.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I found a more permanent solution. Uninstall the Toshiba audio enhancement program fro the control panel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to disable the sound enhancements if I ever changed the song manually in my music player, and now I dont have to.

<h2>            Why does Windows 10 freeze my computer with every program I try to run, or even just sitting and not running any programs&#63;</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 over Windows 7 and immediately began having problems.&nbsp; Within a short while of using any program the computer would completely lockup.&nbsp; Nothing would unlock it.&nbsp; CTRL-ALT-DEL didn't work and ALT-F4 went to a black screen and locked
 up computer.&nbsp; Only thing to do was shut computer off.&nbsp; Set computer to Sleep as well and this feature didn't work either.&nbsp; Tried to Recover Windows 7 and that screwed everything up - nothing worked right afterwards.&nbsp; Had to strip all hard drives and reinstall
 Windows 7.&nbsp; Then Windows 10.&nbsp; Norton 360 was added and Firefox and Acronis For backups.&nbsp; But now I'm having the same problems.&nbsp; The programs will not start.&nbsp; If I try to start one the Start Button won't open up and CTRL-ALT-DEL won't work either.&nbsp; Only way
 to shut things down is to turn computer off again.&nbsp; Windows 10 is worst version of Windows I've ever used, and I've used them all.

<h2>            ads on games</h2>
                    The ads during MS games are a bother but not too bad, excepts when they fail to run properly and you get a repeat of the same ad time and again. The ad in question is the one for Microsoft casual games where a number of idiotic face painted adults are
 going bananas over solving a game. It does not start properly and pauses during the run of the ad and eventually times out and you are redirected to the game. It is a BIG time waste. This has been going on for some time and I don't see any other ads. Has anybody
 else encountered this ?

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered many issues with Microsoft Casual Games and ads in general.. I had experienced the same ad looping twice or three times in a row, before going back to where I was, but that was, admittedly, a long while ago! My best advice, would be to
 post on their community/support page, so someone from the team can better assist:</p>

            Hi Art.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is believed to be caused by the recent Cumulative Update for Version 1709:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4074588/windows-10-update-kb4074588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/407458...</a>.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to recover from both Windows and in Repair Mode that uses different drivers and should work if Windows won't.
<br />
<br />There is a fix released from Microsoft here to apply if you're able:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4091240/usb-devices-may-stop-working-after-installing-the-february-13-2018-upd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409124...</a>
<br />
<br />You can try uninstalling it at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You might also be able to get back before it via System Restore:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if it reinstalls and causes the same problems, uninstall it again and block it using Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can perform these operations in Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you can't get into Safe Mode try Advanced Startup Options by whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> 
<br />
<br />If no other method works it may be necessary to create  Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Boot mode uses different drivers so mouse and keyboard should work.
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  
<br />
<br />If System Restore fails access the Command Prompt to try Option Five here to unlock F8 Advanced Boot Options in Windows 10 to reach Safe Modes:    <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span>Still unable to boot system and am down to the “Create windows 10 installation media on another PC” and don’t see how that will work either unless I load it from my cd drive. Think

            Hi again -
<br />
<br />As I wrote in my first post, the Repair or Boot mode uses different drivers, so booting the media precisely as I wrote out for you should work with the mouse and keyboard.

<p>Not sure where I am going wrong, but it isn't working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Recovery USB flash drive in and pressing F2 or F12 (cant remember) on my Dell XPS 8300 desktop computer I come to a screen that wants me to select a keyboard layout from a list of countries with U.S. at the top of the list.&nbsp; I am unable to highlight
 and select it.&nbsp; Simply pressing enter/return doesn't work either.&nbsp; I have no action from my mouse either.&nbsp; No pointer or anything.&nbsp; And I don't have a touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second option.&nbsp; Take Recovery USB media out.&nbsp; Do two hard resets holding for 5 seconds when computer is trying to load windows and I get a message Preparing Automatic Repair, followed by the Automatic Repair screen which has two options.&nbsp; Restart and Advanced
 Options.&nbsp; I can't select either as I cant get any response from my keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I thought preparing installation media from another PC might work, but am afraid it will reinstall windows and get rid of all my data in the process.&nbsp; Am trying to avoid that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it sound like I am missing a step or something?</p>

            Do you have another mouse and keyboard to try?
<br />
<br />This has worked for everyone else with the issue caused by Cumulative Updates but you said you had Reset so had you even started receiving Windows Updates yet?  Maybe this is a different issue resulting from the Reset alone.
<br />
<br />I'd also try resetting the UEFI or BIOS Setup:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />While there check for any mouse or keyboard settings to toggle to try to get them working.

<p>I tried my keyboard on my tablet and it worked fine.&nbsp; It plugs into the USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I hold down F2 while booting it takes me into Aptio Setup Utility and In the Main screen the only thing I can select is system date or time, which are correct by the way.&nbsp; Everything else is just information, and there is no access to mouse or
 keyboard on any of the other screens that I could see (Advanced - CPU and Graphics configuration, System configuration- disabled USB controller and re-enabled it.&nbsp; Enabled Powershare in S4/S5 state. Disabled Keyboard Error Report and re-enabled it.)&nbsp; However,
 the keyboard was working to make these changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse is a USB wired type, but I also have a wireless with a USB receiver.&nbsp; Neither work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was having issues with Office 365 which I got support for, but there were issues they said they couldn't resolve without a PC reset, so that is why I did the RESET.&nbsp; I switched from Office 365 Home Premium to Office 365 Business edition and have had
 lots of problems with licensing conflicts etc.&nbsp; Was hoping the RESET would clear things up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is set for automatic updates, so would have had the latest Windows 10 updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11:37 p.m. here so am going to have to give up for tonight.&nbsp; If you think of anything else I could try, please let me know.</p>

<p>Well, had to try burn the windows.iso file again without the verify option and it successfully completed with no error msg.&nbsp; Too tired to continue working on it tonight, so will have the DVD available in the morning if that is the way to go.&nbsp; Hopefully it
 would give me some options before proceeding with an installation and over writing everything.</p>

            Hi Art,
<br />
<br />Windows Update KB4074588 has caused a problem with your USB Ports (Hub Drivers), you mosue and keyboard are fine . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you cannot get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - ommand Prompt
<br />
<br />Copy the command below (depends on your system). then in the Command window, right click to paste, then hit Enter to run the command
<br />
<br />For 32bit Systems:
<br />
<br />dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />For 64bit Systems:
<br />
<br />dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />
<br />Close Command and Restart your System
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you can get into Windows:
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt as Admin and copy the command below (depends on your system). then in the Command window, right click to paste, then hit Enter to run the command
<br />
<br />For 32bit Systems:
<br />
<br />dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />For 64bit Systems:
<br />
<br />dism.exe /image:c:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17
<br />
<br />
<br />Close Command and Restart your System
<br />
<br />You must then stop this update from installing again:
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it:

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Bombarder777,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry you're having issues getting your game data to sync. I would suggest you go to the last console you played Minecraft on that's pending a sync. Open the game, and then allow it to sync data. After that exit the game. Then go to your other console
 and see if the data syncs correctly. if it does not then I would suggest trying a hard reset on the console that is having issues syncing your minecraft data. To do this, with the console on, hold the power button down for 5-10 seconds until it quickly shuts
 off. Then turn it back on, and follow the previous steps to open and sync data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If you still cannot sync after that, you have an option to use the latest save from your console you're trying to open Minecraft on. If you cannot get it to sync at all, then I would suggest using the last save from that console. NOTE: You will lose some
 saved data by doing this.</p>

<p>I tried this i set my console so it will not turn off by itself opened minecraft and left it open all night. The next day i closed minecraft signed out and went to my other console and it still says your other console is taking a long time to sync. So i
 tried loading the old data and that worked but it is missing a lot of stuff. The problem is now i have different versions of levels on both xboxs and niether one of them will still sync to the cloud. It doesnt matter what one i go to they both say your other
 xbox is taking a long time to sync. I have tried deleteing everything off &nbsp;one console, saves the game and profiles, and it still will not work. Any other thoughts on how to fix this?

<p>Hi Bombarder777, </p>
<p>Try doing the following. Start the Xbox that is not having issues. Go to settings&gt;network&gt;Advanced Settings&gt; Alternate MAC address &gt; Clear. Start Minecraft. Open your world and save it. Then go to your other Xbox. Go to settings&gt;network&gt;Advanced Settings&gt;
 Alternate MAC address &gt; Clear. Now try to open your Minecraft worlds. </p>

<p>This did not work either. I tried starting on one and that didnt work so i started on the other one first and still had no luck. I wish they would just let us put them on a usb drive like the good old days or make it so we can actually see if it is uploading
 and when it finishes because this syncing in the background is obviously not working. I have read hundreds of posts about syncing problems and none of them have been solved. Im at a loss. Starting to think i should have bought 2 PS4's instead. I havent owned
 a playstation since the very first one. But if this is the future of xbox im not sure i want to be a part of it.</p>

<p>So i can sync my saves from either console now but my daughter can only sync saves from one console. Good news because im now half way there. Bad news because it wants to sync her old saves over her new ones. Not sute if clearing mac address helped because
 i had only been trying her saves when i was doing that. &nbsp;Any thoughts on this? I now i could probably use the old saves and it might fix it but she has a lot of time into one level that would be lost completely.</p>

<p>So after months of waiting the new xbox experience is out and my saves will still not sync. I was hoping the new experience meant they were actually fixing some of the current issues along with updating to windows 10 Does this mean they are never planning
 on fixing this.</p>

<h2>            Voice chat audio no longer comes through Default communication device &#40;mic works fine&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I play games I like the voice chat to go through my Razer Kraken headset and the actual game sound come through my speakers. This has worked fine ever since I bought the headset. Now for some reason the voice chat audio comes through the speakers and
 not the headset. I have defaulted the communication device to the headset in the playback devices but the sound still goes through the speakers. I've updated all drivers and re-booted the computer. I dont know why it all the sudden no longer works like it
 used to. Please help.</p>

<h3> elizabethread  say:</h3>
<h2>            Card Reader error &#34;Unresponsive&#34;</h2>
                    <p>12 hours of very patient effort over three days has yielded no resolution to this: the Realtek card (SD) reader that came in my Windows 8 stopped working when I updated to Windows 8.1. As suggested I uninstalled the existing Realtek Card Reader Driver and
 used multiple avenues to install the new recommended Realtek Card Reader Driver. InstallShield Wizard has installed it from the downloaded and saved file; it has been scanned for errors - none found. This is the third time through&nbsp;this process with a lot of
 peripheral checks, including a consultation with a reputable local repair service.&nbsp; Here is what happens: the audible sound indicate that the card reader has been hooked up to the USB. The file opens to the viewing options, but no pictures come in. Any clicks
 or commands produce nothing except a message that the card reader is "Unresponsive". I cannot then close the screen or attain safe mode for removal of the card from the USB. This forces shutting off the computer and removing the card reader unsafely. I have
 done troubleshooting&nbsp;and tried to see if my security settings&nbsp;are to blame. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing?</p>

</p><p>This issue might occur if the SD card reader drive is not compatible with Windows 8.1. Also, outdated chipset driver might also cause such issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, if the driver was working on Windows 8, then, try installing the driver in Windows 8 compatibility mode and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the methods listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps to install the driver for card in Windows 8 compatibility mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the folder that has the .exe file for the driver. Right Click on the setup file and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box which states “<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>”.</li><li>Select the Windows 8 from the drop down list. Click on <strong>Apply </strong>
and then on <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the driver.
</li></ul>
<p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Download and install the latest chipset driver for the laptop for Windows 8.1 from the manufacturer's website of the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>

            <p>What model computer and what type of card reader--internal or external? You say it came in your computer but then you mention attaching it to a usb port which means it is external, not part of the computer. Try a diff usb port and a diff sd card and try
 the reader on another computer. The card reader might have failed or the sd card is damaged and cannot be read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not need to use the Safely Remove command for a card reader. Just make sure you wait a few minutes after using it before removing the sd card to make sure the computer is not still writing to the card</p>

    <title>How do you get the Windows Fax and Scan program to work in windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnheinz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you get the Windows Fax and Scan program to work in windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If this program worked it would be great for sending messages to my doctor's office, as they don't have internet and insist on fax communications. They wanted me to fax them the insurance 160 page .pdf of the accepted generic drugs they will cover paying
 for. I am hoping to be able to get insulin that costs considerably less than $387/month, and the generic document lists quite a few.</p>
<p>Any attempt to activate/set up the Fax and Scan it hangs up at installing a modem and stops dead. There does not appear to be any way to tell if the "modem" it needs is a software device in the windows code, or might be some physical device I need to add
 to the system, and it won't tell me. I had thought the ATT u-verse broadband modem/router might work for this, but it doesn't seem to find it. The ATT device also provides my landline phone service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back when I had windows 98 I had found a freeware program that worked perfectly, but that is gone now.
</p>
<p>I have a Dell Optiplex 360 computer.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>Läuft leider nicht auf der 360 und wird auch kein Update mehr dafür geben da der Support schon vor langer Zeit eingestellt wurde.</p>
<p>Einfachste Lösung ist sich in bei ebay eine gebrauchte Xbox 1 kaufen und damit ohne irgendwelche Probleme spielen.</p>

<p>[quote user="BlackXero92"]...<br />
Einige alte xBox spiele funktionieren ja auf der xBox 360 aber jetzt frage ich mich, warum Sudeki welches von den Microsoft game studios ist nicht laufen will [/quote]</p>
<p>Die Kurze Erklärung, dass es nicht läuft, haben Dir ja schon andere gegeben.</p>
<p>Die Lange Erklärung, warum das nicht läuft ist folgende: Die alte Xbox 1 hatte einen komplett anderen Hardwareaufbau (Intel Pentium Celeron Prozessor in der Xbox 1, IBM PowerPC Prozessor mit 3 Kernen in der Xbox 360, nVidia Graifk
 in der Xbox 1, ATI Grafik in der 360).</p>
<p>Da die 360 Hardware eben nicht die Maschinensprache der alten Konsole versteht, wurde für viele Spiele ein Emulator geschrieben (ein Programm, was so tut als sei es eine Xbox 1). Das Problem ist aber, dass dieser Emulator nicht
 100%ig genau wie die Xbox 1 reagiert, und viele Spiele zur Geschwindigkeitssteigerung versteckte Tricks und Kniffe verwendet haben, die auf dem Emulator nicht nachzubilden waren.</p>
<p>Daher gibt es eben Xbox 1 Spiele, die auf der Xbox 360 nur mit Fehlern oder eben garnicht funktionieren. Und daran wird sich leider auch nichts mehr ändern.

<p>Kann man wohl nichts machen, da ich mir gerade eine neue xBox 360 S kaufen musste.</p>

            Hello, my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I would like to contribute to resolving this issue with your game performance. 
<br />To cover the basic points first:
<br />1. Please run Nvidia's driver update utility to ensure your video card has the latest drivers available.
<br />2. Please also be sure that in the Nvidia Game Experience program you have installed any profiles that match the name of your game. 
<br />3. Please then run Windows Update to ensure that your entire system has the latest drivers. 
<br />4.  After restarting where appropriate, the next time you play your PC game please make sure that Window's Game Mode is enabled by doing these steps:
<br />1. open Settings Panel and go to the Gaming section. 
<br />2. On the left-hand side, you will see the Game Mode option. 
<br />3. Click on it and toggle the button to enable Game Mode right away. 
<br />
<br />Note: After enabling Game Mode from Settings Panel, you need to activate it in the individual game. 
<br />
<br />4. Each time after this you want to enable Game Mode you can use the keyboard shortcut "Windows Key+G" 
<br />
<br />I hope the above solution resolves the issue and if it doesn't please let me know       
        </p>

            Hello again, 
<br />There is no clear cut answer as this could be a software and hardware issue. 
<br />
<br />1. If you haven't already done so, you should be running games from the SSD, and not the HD as there's a large difference in bandwidth and read/write times between the two devices. 
<br />2. Unless you've done this within the past week, you should clean the intake and outtake fans on your device to ensure that your unit isn't choking the CPU due to temperatures getting too high. 
<br />3. Your GPU and CPU Temps are a little high, but during graphical intense games, that is not unusual. So if you can, you should adjust your cooling fan speeds to as high as possible when you intend to play games. Sadly, depending on the unit, this will have the consequence of excessive noise. 
<br />4. Below is an article from PC Gamer on one of the games you mentioned that walks through each setting, how changing that one setting affects performance and then compares several different FPS results on different configurations when that setting is changed, please note the disclaimer below this line before proceeding to the link:
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<br /><code><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-benchmarks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcgamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-bench...</a></code>
<br />
<br />5. Now, please make sure that your Windows pagefile is moved to the HDD (by default it lives on the same drive Windows is installed on). The pagefile serves as virtual memory and therefore uses a lot of input and output commands, taking up available resources and bandwidth. 
<br />
<br />Please follow these steps to move the pagefile:
<br />
<br />1. Right Click  "Computer" then Choose "Properties"
<br />
<br />2. Click "Advanced System Settings"
<br />
<br />3. In the "Performance" Tab,  Click "Settings"
<br />
<br />4. Then in "Advanced Settings" Tab, select "Virtual Memory" and Click "Change"
<br />
<br />5. Uncheck "Automatically manage page file"
<br />
<br />6. Click on the disk you want the pagefile to live on, remember, it would be best to have it live on the HDD to improve the SSD's transfer performance. 
<br />
<br />7. In regards to size, a pagefile should be AT LEAST twice the size of installed memory. So in your case, you should set the page file to at least 16 GB and set it to live on the HDD. 
<br />
<br />After you've completed steps 1-4 and step 5 and tried some of the games, let me know if this improves performance.

            Hello, I was just checking and I'm glad my colleagues were able to move this solution along. 
<br />May I also suggest helping safeguard your information in the future that you make use of a backup program that automatically backups essential documents.
<br />Below is a link to an article that summarizes several backup programs and ranks them in a top ten format.

<p>
</p><p>I am running Win 7 pro and I changed the settings for update to 'download but wait for my approval to install' a month ago. However, Windows is STILL automatically installing updates. I just watched it do it again, last night. I have run full diags on my
 system. Full scan With Kaspersky hunting for virii, rootkits, etc. I also ran a full scan with IOBit looking for the same things. According to my update settings, it still shows that it needs my approval but, it is still installing updates automatically.
</p>
<p>Something is really wrong here and I am getting fed up. Maybe it's time to check out the Penguin.

            Being that&nbsp;you have chosen the option&nbsp;"'download but wait for my approval to install',&nbsp;apparently it will download the updates. As for me, I noticed while it is downloading my&nbsp;streaming video of movies begin to pause and/or the audio doesn't match the
 video streaming. Therefore I chose, "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them."

            Thanks Noel. Yes again her also but this time I did not loose any work. I checked the update settings and they had switched over to auto check and download. I work a lot with maps and way points and usually I loose the way points but that is frustrating
 and lots of work down the drain. Grrrrr...

            <p>After spending 1 1/2 hours or a little more with tech support trying to get rid of GWX and all its associated entries via remote session, I found out that yes indeed, Microsoft, not a Trojan, not a virus, can check things in Windows Update and change them
 from "recommended" to "important" so the blanket blame on customers is not acceptable, I've never come across anyone saying Windows Update had changed user selections - until now.&nbsp; They said it was an error, but also say they're going to "do it again" though
 I don't remember the timeline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blame it on the customer.&nbsp; The same game continues.&nbsp; If Microsoft is so large how about staffing support sites with employees?&nbsp; I see lots of cut-and-paste answers here - dragging customers through troubleshooting steps that are ridiculous with the complaints
 we have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two KB's that seemed to be the most important to keep away from the system (I think there are more than this but these two are evidently the worst, the tech got rid of them and advised me to hide them if they pop up again) are KB3035583 and KB2952664.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this is resolved - but customer preferences mean nothing.&nbsp; I can't afford a new computer, nor do I have any illusions that the "other" computer will run the software I want to run... but this messing with settings&nbsp;is wrong on many fronts.&nbsp;
 It must be the "new direction" and I keep hearing single users mean nothing, it's big business/enterprise that means everything to Microsoft.&nbsp; Gotta chase that bottom line... please the stakeholders and all that.</p>

            <p>I did a search for the offenders and was a bit daunted at the results. </p>
<p>There are about 120 instances of KB2952664 in the Microsoft directory, as well as 43 for the other one....</p>
<p>So I just kill them all? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'm going to change the DL option to NO and pick up DL's when I am online and have the time. Frankly, this is total Horse ****. It is causing problems with my system and I'm getting really fed up. I am seriously thinking it's time to go with the
 'Penguin' and configure a Red Hat PC. It's no wonder that Linux has become the fasting growing OS over the last year, with this kind of Predatory behavior from Microsoft.

<p>Answer-by-number:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What was your Automatic Updates (AU) setting before you changed it to "Download but notify?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you reset Windows Update components after you changed the AU setting <em>

<p>
</p><p>4. Have you hidden KB2952664, <em>et al.</em>?</p>

</p><p>6. Do you have backups of ALL the changes&nbsp;"IObit" (e.g., Advanced SystemCare) &amp; any/all other registry cleaners have&nbsp;EVER made to the computer? [2]</p>
<p>
</p><p>=====================================================<br />
[1] By default, any changes made to your AU settings will NOT&nbsp;be applied to&nbsp;updates already in the installation "queue."&nbsp;As far as&nbsp;AU is concerned, you've already Approved those updates.</p>
<p>[2] Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

<br />
<br />If you open file explorer and cannot see it at your left with a letter assigned, try this.

<br />
<br />If that doesn't try that SD in another computer to see if the SD is fine.

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If your iPhone is being detected and set up properly in Vista it should show in the Device Manager under Portable Devices as an iPhone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am providing you a link where you can download and install the Microsoft mobile Device Center v6.1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once you have this downloaded and installed Vista should be able to recognize and properly setup your iPhone.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is the link:</span></span></p>

<p><span>Follow the instructions provided in this article to install the software.<span>&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Make a Restore Point<br />
<br />
How to Create a System Restore Point in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76332-system-restore-point-create.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76332-system-restore-point-create.html</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - click in the blank area - then VIEW - Show Hidden Devices<br />
<br />
now look everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers for your device (may not find ANY) and if you find<br />
it RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL them all. The Device is&nbsp;your&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;or similar.<br />
<br />
now go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING in the category but the category itself.<br />
<br />
APPLY/OK<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
This will refresh the USB stack and hopefully allow the device to install. (You may need a powered hub)<br />
<br />
Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310575</span></a><br />
<br />
Here is a utility to help but do the above 1st.<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently connected to your computer, as well as all USB devices that you previously used. Run it Options and check the 1st three choices to see if any are there.<br />

            Did you also&nbsp;do the same procedure as above with the Camera under Imaging in Device Manager?<br />
<br />
Check with your phone's maker as they probably have had this issue come up many times.

            I have exactly the same problem! Itunes only synching FROM the computer to the iPhone there is nowhere where you can apply the opposite, i.e. import photos/videos from your iPhone TO the computer! Previously did the Microsoft dialog box recognising the
 portable device pop up and asking whether to import the pictures, but not any more. I have no idea now how to import my pictures From my iPhone TO the computer? Did you finally find a solution? I would be so grateful if you share it as all my holidays videos
 are stuck in the iPhone now...

http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/10/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-computer/</a>
<p><strong>MY PROBLEM with the below answer is however: </strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Microsoft does not give me a pop-up asking me to import photos, so what to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Microsoft does not recognise&nbsp;the USB of the iPhone that&nbsp;it is&nbsp;connected to the computer as an external device.&nbsp;So no&nbsp;iPhone is visible in "My Computer".&nbsp;The device&nbsp;is only visible but not manageable in the Devices &amp; Printers. Any
 advice to&nbsp;transfer my holiday pictures and videos on the iPhone to the computer is much appreciated!! Thanks.</p>
Transfer Photos from iPhone to PC
<p>On a Windows PC the easiest way to get pictures from your iPhone is to just use Windows Explorer, but there’s two ways to go about this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin your iPhone to the computer without <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2010/07/10/transfer-photos-from-iphone-to-computer/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>iTunes</span></a>
 running </li><li>Wait for a popup asking you what you want to do with the device <strong><u>--&gt; MS does not give me a pop-up!!</u></strong>
</li><li>Select “View Content” </li><li>Find your photos through the folders that are displayed </li><li>Copy in Windows as usual</li></ul>
<p>If your iPhone is already plugged into your PC, you can try this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plugin your iPhone to your PC </li><li>Open “My Computer” </li><li>Find your iPhone, it will appear as any other camera would<strong><u> --&gt; No, MS does not recognise&nbsp;the USB that&nbsp;is connected to the computer as an external device. No iPhone is visible in My Computer</u>. It is only visible but not manageable in the Devices
 &amp; Printers.</strong> </li><li>Open iPhone to find your Photos </li><li>Select the pictures you want to copy to your computer and copy/paste them into the desired location on your PC</li></ul>
<p>The Windows approach treats the iPhone more like a file system, but if you feel like it you can also use your favorite photo importing application to pull the pictures from the device as well</p>

<p>Well, it is Halloween.&nbsp; Maybe it's possessed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is Windows running normally (other than the beeping)?</p>
<p>Is there any pattern to the beeping?</p>

            Hi Iann, my name is Max and I'm a Microsoft independent advisor.
<br />
<br />I suggest you follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open Settings
<br />Then go to Accounts - Sign-in Options
<br />Select ‘sign in with a local account’
<br />(if you have the latest versions of Windows 10, you will find it in the Your Info Settings Page)
<br />Enter your old password but leave the new password box blank
<br />Close Settings
<br />
<br />After that:
<br />
<br />Hit the Start Button, type netplwiz and click Enter
<br />In the dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a username and password to use this computer box'
<br />
<br />Press OK.

            Hi  Iann, please follow these steps and your PC will boot to your Desktop, without the need for a password:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and leave the new password box blank 
<br />Close the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type netplwiz and hit Enter 
<br />In the resulting dialog, uncheck the option 'Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer box' 
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>
