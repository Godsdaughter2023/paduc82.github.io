<h2>            Remote Desktop screen resolution issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi all. I am having some grief when using remote desktop. To try and explain my issue, first I need to explain how I do things :).</p>
<p>I use a laptop, HP Elitebook 8530w, with Windows 7 Enterprise x64 with SP1.</p>
<p>At work I have a docking and two monitors connected running the recommended resolution of 1600x1200</p>
<p>When I leave the office, I put the computer in sleep mode and then wake it up when I get home if I need to do some more work. Then I put it in sleep mode again until the next morning when I wake it up in the office in the docking.</p>
<p>The resolution on the laptop's screen is 1680x1050.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my issue is. When I do a remote desktop to a server I like to blow it up to full screen, so if I have had a full screen session to a server when working from home on the 1680x1050 resolution (display settings in mstsc is set to full screen) and then
 open a session to the server (or any other server) when I get in to work I cannot get the rdp session to display in full screen. Checking the settings in mstsc, it is still set to full screen, but after checking the setting it works... so somewhere something
 is cached...</p>
<p>Hope I was able to explain myself good enough.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community site. Your Windows question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better
 suited for the IT Pro audience on TechNet. Please post your question in the Remote Desktop Services (Terminal Services) forum.</p>

    <title>Cannot install Windows 10 &#40;error 0x80300024&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot install Windows 10 &#40;error 0x80300024&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Alienware 17 R4. Windows tried to download and install an update without my permission (it's set to do Insider fast ring, but it's supposed to notify me about updates so I can actually close everything first, which it skipped this time) which caused
 my computer to freeze up. Since I couldn't do anything and it wasn't stopping after a few minutes, I force shut it down by holding the power button. It then got stuck in an infinite boot loop when I tried to start it again.</p>
<p>So I wanted to do a clean install of Windows to fix it. Set up the installation media on a usb drive using Microsoft's own tool, set laptop to boot from it. It'll load up but when I try to select my SDD to install it on there (which I completely wiped first),
 it says, "We couldn't install Windows in the location you chose. Please check your media drive. Here's more info about what happened:
<strong>0x80300024</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SSD is fine according to the Alienware utility, whatever it's called, that checks for hardware problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only "answers" I can find for the error say to disconnect any extra drives so only the one you want for the OS is there. I have a second drive, but both of them are built in and I don't have a small enough screwdriver to open my laptop to remove one.
 I tried using diskpart from cmd line to deactivate the HDD but the only relevant command that'll do anything is 'offline', which doesn't disconnect the drive or fix the error (I tried 'remove', but it just keeps saying no drive is selected no matter how many
 times I select the drive or rephrase the command)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help. I really need to reinstall Windows.</p>

    <title>Why does my network type always say &#34;limited&#34; or &#34;no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerbaughmanxl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my network type always say &#34;limited&#34; or &#34;no internet access&#34; when I turn on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have windows8 and att DSL for connection.&nbsp; I have my SSI and Key password already set in so I connect automaticly when I turn on the computer. Upon turning on the computer the connection is there with an "!" in a little yellow triangle. It then says
 "limited"&nbsp;where it normally reads "connected" when putting the mouse over the service or connection&nbsp;bars. When I open "network and sharing" window it tells me that my "Access type" is "no internet access" opposed to reading&nbsp;"internet" when it is connected
 and working properly. Its just a pain to disconnect and reconnect every time I log back on. I'd appreciate the help. No matter if I reconfigure or reset the router the problem reappears the next time the computer is turned on.

<h3> davejyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 creators update error 0x8007001f</h2>
                    <p>I am having issues updating my HP Elite 8300.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 Pro 64 working on this machine, and had no issues upgrading to it.&nbsp; However I am trying to update to Creator's Upgrade, and keep getting the error message "unable to update - - error 0x8007001f.
 &nbsp; I have read through multiple posts, and tried almost everything suggested.&nbsp; Here's what I have tried -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Used upgrade assistant to update PC.&nbsp; It gets to around 80%, then shuts down, stating the installation cannot continue, citing error code 0x8007001f</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Downloaded the ISO, and tried to install it there - I get the message "unable to determine if there is enough disk space to install Windows 10"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Downloaded it onto a flash drive - same results</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Enabled the Administrator account, and tried these again - same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I know my unit is compatible as I have 3 of these towers that are virtually identical.&nbsp; They all have the same processor, hard drive, and, although they have different video cards, both the cards are Windows 10 compatible. &nbsp; The other 2 updated to creator's
 update with no issues (heck, I just got hru updating a Dell laptop and a Lenovo ThinkPad to creator's update with no issues at all). &nbsp; I can't figure out why this is being so obtuse.&nbsp; I ensured that I installed the latest software from Windows, Intel, and
 HP before attempting to do the upgrade, too (I didn't have to do that on the others?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost all of the posts I have read have either not found an answer, or have found an answer that I have tried with no success. &nbsp;</p>

<p>With the help of some HP techs, I was able to solve the problem - however I don't know if this will work for anyone -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had to update the BIOS to the latest version - this required me to download and install a "forced update" BIOS upgrade for my PC, as it wouldn't do a "manual" or "automatic" bios upgrade without showing errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that was done, I did a clean install of Windows 7, then went straight into an "update" to Windows 10 Creator's upgrade - Lo &amp; Behold it worked - it is now running creator's upgrade with no issues - but I did have to do a clean install.</p>

            Not really sure what you mean by configure your calendar to your Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I did it a long time ago and now all of a sudden it stopped working.&nbsp; No events will come on at all.&nbsp; I uninstalled, reinstalled, etc. so now I just have my basic calendar
 listed - not sure that is correct even.&nbsp; Before the calendar worked with my ipad, iphone and my pc and now my ipad and iphone work but not my pc.<br />

I went and added a new user account and the mail and calendar DID work.&nbsp; So what do I need to do to get it to work with my "first" account?&nbsp; Or if I make a new user what will I lose, etc. if I add a new user and then get rid of old user?<br />

            I have a similar problem. My calendar keeps cycling between updating calendar and calendar is up to date. This does not stop, but continues without any progress. I have deleted Mail and reinstalled, and repaired without improvement.<br />
I can access my hotmail account using live mail on my other computers without an issue.
<br />
I have not changed anything on this laptop - and the problem started only a few days ago.<br />
Using Windows 7/64bit.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the information that you have provided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that you are running any type of Firewall or you have add-ons installed on your default browser which affects the performance of your Windows Live Mail on your first or primary user account.&nbsp;Kindly check if you have any type of Firewall, Proxy
 clients or Antivirus that would act as a firewall on your computer and also check your browser add-ons.&nbsp;Please disable it and check if it will make any improvements on your Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you will delete your first user account, there's a possibility that you will lose all the data that was saved on that user account and you will be unable to access those information if you start using the new user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Ramad, thank you for your suggestions<br />
<br />
I did turn of my Norton 360/firewall and disabled all add-ons. And no improvement. still cycling through calendar updating/updated notices.
<br />
Please note that my outlook.com account is working fine in both Firefox and IE ...this has always been the case. It is only when using Live Mail to access my hotmail account that I get this problem. And only recently on this one laptop.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to delete the live mail program from this computer and clear its registry without closing the account, so that a clean install can be made? Seems when I delete the account and reinstall it, it is as if everything was there....as I do not have
 to set up a new account or connect to my primary account. <br />
The last time I deleted the program I did a registry cleanup and reset up Window Live mail. but stilll the same problem.<br />
<br />
thanks <br />
<br />

            I shut off my McAfee for a period of time and restarted Live Mail/Calendar and still the calendar just keeps flashing.&nbsp; Not sure what browser add on I should check on - since my mail/calendar is Live Mail why would a browser affect it - if so I need help

We're sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused. I'll see what I can do to help you. What I can suggest is that you try uninstalling/re-installing Windows Live Mail. However, you may need to back-up your emails first prior to uninstalling.</p>
<p><br />
The steps in this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>will guide you on how to back-up your e-mails. After doing so, download the program again
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;install it back. You can then proceed on setting up your account in it.<br />

<p>Original title: Windows Live Mail Calendar Updating</p>

<p><br />
Your problem description is not exactly an example of crystal clarity. If I were to guess at what you mean, I'd say you're seeing&nbsp;oscillating messages&nbsp;at the right-hand end of&nbsp;the status bar, and it sometimes says
<em>Updating calendar. </em>I would expect you also to see send/receive error messages - do you?<br />
<br />
This behaviour is&nbsp;one symptom of DeltaSync error 0x8DE20003 caused by a rogue entry in the registry. This is easy enough to check if you're careful and you're using Windows 7 or 8 - you haven't told us which. Follow the instructions on this page:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2842520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Live Mail Error: 0x8DE20003 or Server Error: 3204</a>. On Windows 7, use the
<em>Fix it myself </em>instructions to locate the registry key involved; if you see any entry where the value in the
<em>Name</em> column starts with SSL, delete it as instructed. Then reboot the computer, launch Windows Live Mail and see whether the error has gone away.</p>

<h2>            abort a backup</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 and I ran a backup Backup and restore (Windows 7). It has been more than 48 hours and it is only 5% complete. I now have a black screen and can only access my computer through "task manager" when I do a reboot. How do I cancel the backup
 and restore the display.

    <title>Vista &#47; Windows 7 Will Not Play Audio CD - Tried MANY Fixes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vista &#47; Windows 7 Will Not Play Audio CD - Tried MANY Fixes</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have an HP DV1156CL Notebook Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Intel 1.7Ghz Processor - 2GB Ram</p>
<p>&nbsp;It has a Pioneer DVR-K14&nbsp; DVD/CDROM</p>
The laptop runs perfect, with no errors or problems.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I re-format the hard drive and install Windows XP Pro, everything works as normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I re-format the hard drive and install Windows Vista OR Windows 7,&nbsp; then everything works, EXCEPT: Windows Media Player will not play a standard, commercial, Audio CD. (Data CD's read ok, DVD's read and play ok)</p>
<p>&nbsp; It sometimes plays a CD song for second or two, then it gives the error "Windows Media Player has encountered a problem and cannot play the file. The 'Web Help' Button brings me to the error "C00D11B1"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here's what I tried so far, using Vista and Windows 7:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Fresh install of Vista Ultimate, fresh install of Windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Installed ALL Vista updates, Installed ALL Windows 7 updates</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Enabled '24 Bit Audio' inside Windows Media Player options</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Checked for 'Upper' and 'Lower' CD/DVD Filters in registry - there are no references to filters there.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Turned off all 'network settings' inside Windows Media Player options</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Enabled 'Error Correction' inside Windows Media Player options</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Deleted and then re-installed the sound card drivers and Pioneer CD/DVD drive within the Vista/Windows 7 Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Removed old sound card driver, installed alternate sound card driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Ran 'SFC /SCANNOW' - No errors found.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Installed 'Microsoftfix50200.msi' - this worked for one CD song, then I tried to 'rip' the song, then the same old error came back. Tried re-installing the 'fix' - same old error again...</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Re-registered the 'quartz'dll' file</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Installed the Windows Media Player update: KB941651</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Installed the Full K-Lite Codec pack</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Executed the 'DRM' fix described in this forum</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So, this is a software issue for sure, as the same Audio CD's play perfect in the same machine running Windows XP. ( And.. Audio CD's play perfect within Vista and Windows 7 using 'other software' besides Microsoft Media Player. )</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have now spent over 20 hours trying to get this computer to play standard audio CD's in Vista and Windows 7&nbsp; Media Players.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is there anything else I should try?&nbsp; This is very upsetting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;No, I was not able to figure it out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This laptop was for a friend who needed it for school, so I ran out of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I had to give up on Vista&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows 7 and go with Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;From searching other forums, I have the feeling that&nbsp;Vista&nbsp;and Windows 7 have a problem with the Pioneer drive that is in the laptop.</p>
<p>Oh well, good luck to you.&nbsp; If you find the answer, please re-post.</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!!!</p>

 are the file types of the audio file that are not playing?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you disable “exclusive mode” for audio playback and check if it works</span></p>

 the speaker icon in the notification area, which is located on the right side of the taskbar, and select &nbsp;<strong>Playback Devices</strong> or &nbsp;<strong>Recording Devices</strong>.

    <title>Windows 10 &#34;password incorrect&#34; error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kdb8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;password incorrect&#34; error</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from 8 (I let Microsoft push the update, I did not do it on my own). &nbsp;The first day it worked fine, then the second day I try to log in and it tells me my password is incorrect and to go to the website to reset. &nbsp;I did
 this several times and it still says my password is incorrect. &nbsp;I can see the password on the screen and there are no typos; I can use other computers to login fine. &nbsp;It does not give me the option to load a different account. &nbsp;I've seen posts where other
 users are having this same problem, but mine seems to be a bit worse: &nbsp;whenever I try to restore to factory settings or any of the other repair options, it appears to work at first, but then it just goes to a black screen (I can see the mouse when I move it,
 but nothing else ever happens). &nbsp;I've tried booting in safe mode, but this too requires a password. &nbsp;I've tried pretty much every repair/restore option available on the troubleshooting menu tha

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your interest on windows 10 and also trying troubleshooting steps to fix issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I understand the inconvenience you faced. I certainly help you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to Reset password and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/sign-in-cant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/sign-in-cant</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If issue still persist so I would suggest you to follow the below steps to fix issue.</p>
<p>
1. Use the power button on the sign-in screen to Shift+Restart. This will take you to the recovery boot menu.
<br />
2. Click Troubleshoot, Advanced options, Startup settings. When given the choice of startup options, try booting the PC in Safe Mode with Command Prompt. If you can’t get there, skip to the next major step.
<br />
3 .If you can get to a CMD window, enable the built-in administrator account:<br />
net user administrator /active:yes<br />
Note: If this fails, check to see if there is a different language in use and use the correct “Administrator” name from the list here.
<br />
4. Then restart and sign-in as the Administrator account. <br />
5. Once in the Administrator account, open Regedit and go to the following key:<br />
HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\StoredIdentities <br />
Save a backup of the key: Export the StoredIdentities key to a .REG file on the desktop.
<br />
Then continue with step 4 below. <br />
5. Use boot media to access the recovery command prompt. <br />
6. Start Regedit. <br />
7. Select the HKEY_USERS key. <br />
8. Click File, Load Hive. and go up in the file system to This PC. Then browse to this file and then click Open:<br />
C:\Windows\System32\config\DEFAULT <br />
9. When prompted, name it “def” <br />
10. Select this key:<br />
HKEY_USERS\def\Software\Microsoft\IdentityCRL\StoredIdentities <br />
11.Save a backup of the key: Export the StoredIdentities key to a .REG file on the C:\ drive.
<br />
Find the subkey under StoredIdentities that matches the name of the Microsoft Account.
<br />
Delete the key. <br />
12. If you loaded the offline registry hive, go back up in the tree on the left and select “def”. Then click File, Unload hive. This option will only be available if “def” is selected.
<br />
Restart the PC and test sign-in. <br />
Once done, you may need to Verify the account in Settings, Accounts in order for it to be fully usable in Windows again.
<br />
If you used the built-in Administrator account to resolve the issue, please return it to the default disabled state to help keep&nbsp;your PC secure.
</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Note: Please follow the same steps and type net user administrator /active: no to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done.</p>

            As I stated in my original problem, when I try to boot in safe mode and access the command prompt, the screen acts like it's doing something at first, then goes to a black screen with the mouse visible but no other action taking place. &nbsp;I've let it run
 continuously all night to ensure that it is not just taking a really long time to load.

<p>
</p><p>I even tried changing my password (on another comp). Still says incorrect. I tried my old windows 7 log in password. Doesn't recognize it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without accepting the password, I can't go any further!!!</p>
<p>Why doesn't it accept?</p>
<p>

</p><p>I even made a new account at Microsoft in another comp. But my comp doesn't even allow me to change users or another account!</p>
<p>It shows only one account, where it refuses to accept its password!!!!!</p>

            I Don't know why I tried this, but it worked for me! I had exactly the same issue, every time I entered my password it was rejected as incorrect, even though I knew it was correct.&nbsp; I then got to wondering if there was something wrong with my keyboard
 - wireless HP one - so I Tried the virtual keyboard, found at the bottom right of the screen under accessibility.&nbsp; Low &amp; behold it works, so every time I want to login to my pc I have to go through the hassle of opening the virtual keyboard and typing in there.&nbsp;
 looking on the positive side - always look for positives - if someone try's to break into my pc its another layer of security perhaps?&nbsp; hope that helps...

            <p>Hi Preeti,</p>
<p>Having spent hours, trying every password I've ever used,&nbsp; changed my password using another computer&nbsp; -&nbsp; all to o avail&nbsp; -&nbsp; I tried to use your method and everywhere I went,&nbsp; it needed my password which it then rejected&nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp;again, nothing worked.&nbsp; I switched
 keyboards and&nbsp;tried telling&nbsp;the system I was using both UK and US keyboards&nbsp; -&nbsp; again no joy.&nbsp; This was an upgrade from Windows 7 so I don't have a boot media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't ask my why I tried this but I selected 'On screen keyboard' (Icon bottom right hand corner, second from right),&nbsp; entered my password using the on screen keyboard&nbsp; - &nbsp;it was accepted and Windows 10 was up and running !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My password has seven lower case letters one upper case letter and two digits&nbsp; -&nbsp; I don't want to have to use this entry method every time so have you any suggestions&nbsp;for making Windows 10 recognize my keyboard ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This was a "Me too" but I've managed tocrack it.</p>
<p>Hold down the Fn key whilst you ar enter your password (probably just for the small case letters).</p>
<p>Some idiot at MS has set the Fn key as 'On' as you are signing on.</p>
<p>As an 'Insider' I've reported this but got no acknowledgement from MS.</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

<div>
<p>I have had the same Desktop computer with Windows 10. &nbsp;Since&nbsp;an update, when the Desktop&nbsp;computer wakes from sleep it will work for approx 5 minutes and then programs will freeze. &nbsp;The Microsoft Mouse will not move and Microsoft
 Keyboard will not respond. &nbsp;No BSOD or restart. Requires a hard restart. &nbsp;Happens 100% of the time when waking from sleep.&nbsp; Reloaded MS&nbsp;Mouse and Keyboard Center, Video drivers, DISM and SFC commands show no problems.&nbsp; Leaving a mouse hovering will cause active
 mouse and "no sleep function" which is fine but Desktop computer runs 24 hours per day.&nbsp; This is a very active issue on World Wide Web, but no solution will work on my Desktop computer.</p>

            Hi Bry.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />Since this happens always and only after Sleep we need to troubleshoot Sleep first: 
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.  The BIOS version is particularly important.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br /> --------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

You missed my point. i should not have to change keyboard configuration in the middle of a document when I switch from say French to English directions for students. Previously I just used the ALTkey. Your reply wasNOT helpful.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Many of the files sfc can't fix are not important.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
put the command from below (copy and paste it) into that box and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
<span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt <br />
<br />
that creates the sfcdetails.txt file in the folder you are in when you run it.<br />
<br />
So if you are in C:\Windows\System32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then you will need to look in that folder for the file.<br />
</span><br />
How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker (SFC.exe) program
<br />
generates in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><br />
<br />
That creates sfcdetails.txt&nbsp; in C:\Windows\System32&nbsp;&nbsp; find it and you can post the errors into a message
<br />
here. NOTE :&nbsp;there probably are duplicates so please only post each section of errors once.<br />
<br />
You can read the log/txt files easier if you&nbsp;right click on Notepad or Wordpad then RUN AS ADMIN - then
<br />
you can navigate to sfcdetails.txt ( in C:\Windows\System32 ) or cbs.log ( in C:\Windows\Logs ) as needed.
<br />
(You may need to search for sfcdetails.txt if it was not created in the default folders.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<h2>            Choose the program you want to use to open this file-Lenovo Laptop Disabled</h2>
                    <p>I have a lenovo 3000 N200 laptop that I recieved from a friend and I cannot open anything at all (so much for a friend, right?). Anytime I attempt to open Internet Explorer I get a pop-up saying "Choose the program you want to use to open this file" and&nbsp;after
 selecting the&nbsp;appropriate program nothing happens. After playing with this problem I now see that by right-clicking on the program I can select "Run as administrator" and I am able to use the internet. I am aware that lenovo has a care button which should
 allow you to reset the system but it's not working the way I'd hoped. I can install Rescue and Recovery but of course I still can't open any programs. I get another error message that says "can't find C:\Windows\System32\msdt.exe"...even though I was able
 to find it through WIndows Explorer. I'm extremely lost with this issue, I simply just want to reset the entire laptop to its orginal-fresh-out-the-box settings. Can you help?</p>

<h2>            Star Club Klondike Moves Solve Challenge &#40;Hard I&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>While playing the final Moves Solve Challenge in the "Hard I" Klondike collection of the Star Club, I discovered a bug in the software. The challenge is to solve the deck in "no more than 110 moves", but when I solved the deck in exactly 110 moves, the challenge
 was marked as incomplete. I figured out a solution that only required 109 moves, but the other solution should still result in a completed challenge.</p>

<p>I encountered the exact same problem today in the first game of Klondike Hard II. I had to solve the game in a maximum of 100 steps. Twice I solved the game in exactly 100 steps, but the game says that I failed.</p>
<p>So either the challenge should say "Under 100 steps" or the game has a bug.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 microphone issues &#40;boost missing&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, hope you can help me out here. I've upgraded Win 7 to Win 8 recently, however my mic is really really low when it comes to recording. Apparently the mic Boost slider is completely missing in the settings (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/Qs7w2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pic</a>&nbsp;here&nbsp;http://i.imgur.com/Qs7w2.jpg),
 which is a bit strange and according to my research there are quite a few people out there with the same problem. Could you advise please?</p>
<p>By the way the problem affects both of my mics (g930 and Samson), so i'm thinking it either a Microsoft issue or a problem with the Realtek drivers (installed the latest available for the EX58-UD5 motherboard...).</p>
<p>Help me out?</p>

            Just an update on the situation and new issues:
<div><br />
<div>- After reading around I've uninstalled the USB controllers (both mics are USB), did a restart and reinstalled the motherboard drivers. If you're going to do this, keep in mind that you can disable you mouse and keyboard in the process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once this was done the mic became a lot louder, however:</div>
<div><br />
<div>- The boost slider is still missing for both USB mics (it appears for the 3.5" mic though).</div>
<div>- The microphone now only responds to changes between the 90-100 levels, where it's too loud (!?)</div>
<div>- If the levels are below 90 it's too quiet and nothing can be heard.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Within Photoshop, you should just be able to take the .PSD formatted image by selecting File &gt; Save As &gt; and in the drop-down for the various formats, select what you'd like.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>my USB stops to work just few seconds after I login into the Windows 10. No USB devices works (headset, mouse, keyboard). It works few seconds after login and then it stops. When I lock the screen (window + l), it starts to work for few seconds and it stops
 again, after login it works for few seconds and stops again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled USB selective suspend setting, I have disabled an option "Allow computer to turn off this device to save power". Nothing helps me to fix the issue.</p>
<p>

<h3> silven88  say:</h3>
<h2>            iaStora.sys BSOD, minidump and MSinfo32</h2>
                    In the past 3 days I've suddenly started getting BSOD, 4 in total now.<br />
<br />
I'll typically either be playing a video game or browsing the web in Chrome.<br />
<br />
The BSOD states the following:<br />
<br />
Stop code: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL<br />
What failed: iaStora.sys<br />
<br />
My research has led me to a bunch of stuff mentioning Intels Rapid Storage Technology. I haven't messed with or updated any drivers relating to this since I received the laptop in January of 2016. MSI's website lists the same drivers that were available for
 download when I first got the system (published in 2015).<br />
<br />
I'm running 2 Samsung SSD's in Raid 0, so it's my understanding that I need this driver(s). Some of the posts I've read have mentioned removing the driver resolves the problem, but if I'm not mistaken, that would mean no more RAID setup, correct? If so, this
 is not an option for me. The machine was custom built with this purpose in mind.<br />
<br />
Below is my zip with minidumps and MSinfo32. Please let me know if you need more information, and thank you in advance.<br />

<h3> michaelgat  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows 10, is there a way to change the default behavior when opening the on-screen keyboard using a pen&#63;</h2>
                    When opening the on-screen keyboard with the pen, or after recently using the pen, the default option is for the handwriting one to come up. I want the normal on-screen qwerty keyboard without having to switch back to it every time I try to enter text.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, is there a way to change which type of keyboard pops up by default (based on or regardless of input method) or to disable the handwriting option altogether?

            I've suggested/reported this several times. Someone has emailed me directly that how it is is how it is! If a pen is used as a pointer/clicker it is assumed, incorrectly, that one is using handwriting with it. Someone at MS isn't getting this.
