            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that whenever you try to open League of Legends you get a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to outdated display drivers or some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need some information.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Do you get any error message or error code?</li></ol>
<p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I suggest you to perform <strong>clean boot </strong>and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://mail.agent.cvgs.net/owa/redir.aspx?C=b4GN3-2XIk6wBOn12ogaAZWNuGrgONIIXgTTbLzaD6JTtCXZV0bwPkHgv-9759MR-Qvd7c-ekm0.&amp;URL=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2fkb%2f929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You
 may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform
 a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I would suggest you to update the display drivers from computer manufacturer website and check if it helps.</strong></p>
<p>For reference: </p>

</p><p>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you try to create a new App password or even turn off two-step verification just to see if that works?</p>
<p>To create new one:</p>
<p>1.Sign in to your Microsoft account. </p>
<p>2.Under Password and security info, tap or click Edit security info. </p>
<p>If you're prompted for a security proof, enter it and tap or click Submit. </p>
<p>3.Under App passwords, tap or click Create a new app password. </p>
<p>A new app password is generated and appears on your screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4.When you’re prompted for your Microsoft account password on your Xbox console, enter the app password that you created online.

<h2>            Touch Screen Not Working on my Alll-in-one Desktop Windows 8</h2>
                    Hello
<div>I have an Acer Aspire z5610. I installed Windows 8 on it but I can't seem to get the touch screen working, and I could not find a touch screen driver or application on the Acer website. I am not sure if the driver is installed or not, but either way the
 touch screen does not work at all. I also could not find any settings for the touchscreen in the control panel</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help</div>
<div>I really want to get it to work</div>
                </div>

They may delegate that to Microsoft.</p>

Do you know who the manufacturer of your Touch screen is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, use Device Manager View, Show Hidden Devices&nbsp; to see if you can find some more details about your (unused?) device.</p>

            This is an all-in-one machine as mentioned in my first post, and it has a touch display. This is an Acer Asprie z5610 as mentioned in in my first post. I have installed all Windows updates that were available.
<div><br />
<div>I am not sure what that link is for. It just says 'Thankyou for visiting Microsoft Update Catalogue'</div>
<div><br />
<div>In device manager, I am only missing a driver for my TV card, and there is one USB device which has an&nbsp;exclamation&nbsp;mark signifying an issue with the device. But I am not sure what to do.</div>

That does not say who made the Touch screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. it could be some company like NextWindow.</p>

Manufacturers delegate some of the driver updates to Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then if you think that you aren't being offered the correct drivers via Windows Updates you could either go to the catalog and try to download something that looks compatible or you can try finding
 a driver directly from the device manufacturer (and in the case of NextWindow don't get your hopes up too high.&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The catalog site requires an add-on be used.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you had the add-on you would see the catalog opened with the search for&nbsp; touch 8 done for you.&nbsp;&nbsp; But without knowing the manufacturer there is nothing else that I could do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That could be your (uninstalled) Touch screen driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Properties, Details, etc. to find out more.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I suspect you might get more informed help from Acer forums.<br />

<h2>            &#34;long format&#34; for date and time does not work&#47;show</h2>
                    I did few hours of research on the internet about this issue and seems the windows 8 does not show the long format for day and time. The way i want it is to show in taskbar (toolbar) something like this:&nbsp;
<div>Saturday, January 18, 2014; 14:52:23.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want the name of the day, followed by month, date, year; then hour, min, sec in 24H format.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additionally i played around with the time &amp; date format in control panel (Date &amp; Time Setting and Customize Format box), changed the format from short to long but again, even when i click save or apply, no change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So my questions is why there is even such confusing section when the "long" format doesnt work???</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Wasted many hours to find out LONG Time format doesnt work :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>By the way, i there gonna be fix to this issue?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example, if a program (such as Word) had an "insert the current date using the system's long date format style" option, then your options would take effect.&nbsp; But the program has to ask for it, your options don't just force it to happen automatically.</p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click

    <title>Not enough space &#47; Windows 10 update &#47; new laptop &#47; error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindyannette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not enough space &#47; Windows 10 update &#47; new laptop &#47; error number 0X80070070</h2>
                    I just purchased an Acer Spin with 4GB ram and 32GB flash. It has Windows 10 Home installed and works great. However, there's an update alert that's telling me I need to update my current windows home ed. I attempted to update, but after 2 hours, it stated
 unable to update due to insufficient space needed. I have tried several times and get the same notice and error&nbsp;0X80070070. How can I update if there's not enough memory? How can I bypass this update (stop getting the pop up alerts)? and should I bypass it
 and&nbsp;ignore it?&nbsp;why would a Company sell a computer if it wasn't built to allow&nbsp;updates? am I missing something? All help is appreciated. I'm considering in returning the laptop if it does not allow a needed update but if the update can be ignored, I'd like
 to keep it,&nbsp;using the version of Windows 10 that&nbsp;I have. Thanks in advance.&nbsp; ---Cindy

    <title>Why can&#39;t I open winrar files on mapped drive with windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjb-722  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why  can&#39;t I open winrar files on mapped drive with windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Windows 8, my NAS box is not visible in Explorer, I can get to it by running the IP address and I can open files on each folder including archived WinRAR files, but as soon as I map the drive I get the message: "ERROR&nbsp; cannot open file L:\\calibre.rar"
 This happens with EVERY winrar file on the mapped drive, I can open them direct from the folder, but not after the drive has been mapped, I am also unable to change any attributes or security settings, it just tells me "Access Denied", I have access to files
 on the&nbsp;other mapped drives that are not a zipped archive.</p>
<p>This has only happened since upgrading to Windows 8, it works fine in Windows 7 and everything before that. I have the Administrator account and have turned off UAC (which to my way of thinking is completely pointless anyway)&nbsp;and cannot see any way around
 it. For the time being I have removed the drive with Windows 8 and re-fitted my Windows 7 drive until I have a solution, I really can't be doing with things that don't work where there seems to be no logic.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had the same or similar problems with mapped drives and archived Winrar files?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
As I understand you are unable to open .rar files stored on a network location, form your windows 8 computer, and you are facing the error, 'ERROR cannot open file L:\\calibre.rar' . Is this correct?</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to boot into the Windows 8 drive and uninstall WinRar completely and try to use the windows default zip software and check.</p>
<p><br />
You may also reinstall WinRar's current version (32 bit / 64 bit) respectively and try accessing the files.<br />
Also make sure that the files when being access from Windows 7 no changes or modification are made to the permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Compress and uncompress files (zip files)</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for that Shylesh B but what doesn't make sense is the I can open any of the arcjived files in Win 8 Explorer&nbsp;straight off the NAS with WinRar but it is when I map the drive and try to open the same file(s) from the mapping that Windowa 8 gives
 me the error.</p>
<p>I have 4 mappings from the same NAS one with Music, works fine, one with iTunes, works fine, one with films, works fine the only one that doesn't work is the mapped drive that has archived Winrar files, but as I have said, these will work when accessed directly
 on the NAS, mapping a drive with archived files seems to be the problem.</p>

<h2>            GT Racing 2 keeps closing itself after the GAMELOFT start screen.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10. I wanted to check out GT Racing 2 and I installed it. Every time I click on it it shows this screen below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfb0d68f-7f44-45b9-80fd-4b078bfe3541?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfb0d68f-7f44-45b9-80fd-4b078bfe3541?upload=true" /></a>After
 this screen is displayed for about 20 seconds, the program shuts down. I have reset it in App Settings, Re-installed it, and restarted my PC but it still has the same issue.</p>

<h3> expertbigwheelpilot2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open more than 15 files at a time &#40;about 200&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have discovered that in the last two months I have files lurking on my HD that are corrupted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The only way I know to find the corrupted files is to open every file on my computer by file type.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I find a corrupted file I replace it from a backup.<span>&nbsp; </span>
The problem is I have over 10,000 .mht files. 4000 .doc files, 1400 .pdf files, 1300 .txt files, etc.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If I can open 200 or 400 at a time I can go through all these files quite quickly and win8 allows all open files from one application to close instantly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would open a file window, put *.mht in a search and highlight 200 files and right click and open.
</span></p>

<p><span>The problem is win8 only allows opening 15 files at a time.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there a way to open 200 or 400 files at a time and close instantly and go on the the next 2-400 in Windows 8 professional?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a i7 haswell 15GB memory and 2GB video card mid-tower case.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That should be enough horse power to open 200 or 400 files at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the help.</span></p>

<h3> scottgus1  say:</h3>
<h2>            add words to text suggestions on windows 10 tablet</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 Home on a Dell Venue 8 Pro touchscreen tablet. (I suppose this would apply to any Windows 10 PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type on the onscreen touch keyboard accessed via the keyboard icon on the taskbar, words will appear at the top of the keyboard suggesting completions of what I'm typing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df70b448-ff18-40aa-bba7-eedb30a2e11b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df70b448-ff18-40aa-bba7-eedb30a2e11b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I add industry-specific words to the suggestions that don't appear now?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I "weight" certain longer words I type a lot to appear at the beginning of the list when I've only typed the first letter?</p>

            <p>You have some limitation on managing them, they are smart so depending on your typing they will get updated. In addition, you may right click on a word (if it is incorrect) and add it to dictionary.</p>
<p>Further more, you may open start and search for Feedback and open Feedback App and then submit a suggestion about what you want to see and how you want this to be improved.</p>

<h2>            No more internet access after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Made upgrades from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro (64 bits) on 2 desktop computers. The one&nbsp;is working, but on the Dell&nbsp;desktop I cannot more access the internet, not wifi, not the direct connection to the modem. I ran the troubleshooting. Windows
 10 network diagnostic tool tells: "there might be a problem with the driver for the wireless network connection adapter". Wireless network connection status tells: "not connected, media state enabled". Broadcom802.11n Network adapter properties say: "this
 device is working properly". Device driver says: "Update driver software - Broadcom 802.11n Network adapter. The best driver software for your device is already installed. Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date."</p>
<p>I am stuck, where more must I check, or what is wrong? </p>

<p>
</p><p>For a month after you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10, or for&nbsp;10 days after updating to the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, you’ll be able to go back to your previous version of Windows. After this you will not have option to Go back to your previous Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is already after a month and trying to roll back you will not have that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting the PC will reset the current settings and retain the Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post to us if you have any further queries in Windows to help you better.</p>

            <span>Hi,</span>
<p><span><br />
Welcome to Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
This definitely sounds like a Hardware issue, possible RAM issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Bad or corrupt Driver for a piece of hardware could be the issue.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the troubleshooting steps that you may try.<br />
<br />
1). <strong>Stop errors in Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008: “Stop: 0x00000018” or “STOP: 0x000000C2”<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/967776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/967776</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>2).Put your computer in clean boot state and check which third party software is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; a).Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click &nbsp;Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; b). On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; c). Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; d). Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click&nbsp; Disable All.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; e). Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; f). When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; g). After the computer starts, whether the problem is resolved.<br />
<br />
If the issue is resolved follow&nbsp; the article mentioned below:<br />

<h3> peter.worcester  say:</h3>
<h2>            NEED HELP with XB1 X and headset &#40;wireless TB 800TX&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Currently my XBOX ONE X is using just HDMI into my TV with audio going to my Home Theatre system sounds great but the problem is that leaves me without a headset &amp; mic.&nbsp;</p><p>(Also using ARC - CEC so it’s as easy os a single click )</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I can’t find any info on how to stop audio from the HDMI out and re-route only audio, using&nbsp;optical cable&nbsp;&nbsp;to my Turtle Beach 800TCX wireless headset.</p><p>I see the audio&nbsp; settings &nbsp;but I don’t know what type of encoding and audio out, &nbsp;PCM is gone and&nbsp;&nbsp;the setting&nbsp;needed to stop audio out from the HDMI cable and use optical audio out to my headset is no where to ben found easily, I’ m surer it;’s there but where?<br /></p><p><br /></p>







<p>There are two groups of settings, 1 for the encoding in HDMI and that can be stopped, the other set is the optical out but I only see MS SONIC,&nbsp;&nbsp;DOLBY ATMOS, &nbsp;DOLBY PRO&nbsp;LOGIC and no SURROUND&nbsp;5.1 or 7.1 ONLY&nbsp;compressed &nbsp;stereo.&nbsp;That didn’t work and trying &nbsp;all the combinations could damage the hardware.</p><p>I would like to find&nbsp;&nbsp;the proper method to stop or ‘mute’ the HDMI audio and then use the Optical out (just like the old XB 1 S) but with the right format.</p><p>SOME&nbsp;OUT&nbsp;THERE must know the right settings, My concern is that ARC - CEC is still a little flaky depending on the mfg. When I first set it up I&nbsp;then had 3 video HDMI channels and ARC -&nbsp;CEC wasn’t happy and I had to reconfigure it, it’s supposed to handle infinite &nbsp;but each mfg uses a different channel for the ARC CEC channel.</p>

<p>On a separate subject &nbsp;Ghost Recon Wild&nbsp;lands on &nbsp;a 65” OLED LG 4K UHD and HDR,. and Enclave 7.1 HT&nbsp;is&nbsp; ABSO-FREAKING_LUTELY&nbsp;AMAZING ! &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p><p>My son &nbsp;walked in the room and stared at it,&nbsp;&nbsp;jaw on the floor, and asked “What Movie is this ?” Then saw a controller in my han and almost passed out.&nbsp;</p><p>It is SO SO&nbsp;SO&nbsp;&nbsp;Different I&nbsp;was completely disoriented for a good hour and am still in AWE at the 4K HDR output. (the Home Theatre&nbsp;is killer) &nbsp;but 4v4 w/&nbsp;o mic, not so much,</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>I take it you mean the Turtle Beach 800X? Never heard of the 800TCX, I personally use the 800X. Anyway, how is the base for your headset set up? Is the optical cable coming from your Xbox straight to your base or is the optical cable coming from your TV to the base? If you have the base coming straight from your Xbox, then go to audio settings on your xbox and make sure optical is on and set to bitstream out, then on bitstream format make sure it's set to Dolby Digital. If you have the base coming from your TV, set HDMI audio to bitstream out. Then look at your audio settings on your TV, change the format for your optical audio output to Dolby Digital.&nbsp;</p>

            I think you are saying that you have an album wrap file. You need that program to 'extract' the songs from the mp3 file.

    <title>Elite Controller is garbage and pays for it&#63; We do. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diarhea5uitcase  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite Controller is garbage and pays for it&#63; We do.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;  I bought an elite controller not even 7 months ago the right 
bumper broke. Its hanging by sliver of plastic. I thought to myself, 
thats cool, I'm sure a $150 controller will have a 1 year warranty and 
if not, microsoft usually stands behind their products anyhow. Boy was I
 wrong. Not only does your new $150 controller NOT have a warranty 
longer than 3 months, but they wont even service the controller if the 
bumpers break. The only thing covered are the machined, solid aluminum 
pieces that cant break anyhow (d-pad, paddle triggers, and thumbsticks)!
  Imagine that... the cheapest quality components in the elite 
controller are the very thing they wont fix. Whats worse, is that their 
way of resolving the issue is to guide you over the the xbox store to 
BUY ANOTHER SHODDY CONTROLLER THAT WILL JUST BREAK IN ANOTHER 5-7 MONTHS
 (after the new warranty is gone, mind you). This isnt a standard 
"business practice," its a scam and a slap to the face to the people who
 devoutly stand behind xbox and play on their platform. People are 
willing to pay a whopping $150 for a controller if that controller is 
quality. Thats why I got one. I expected it to not only work, but to 
outlast the generic, basic controllers that are included with the xbox. 
These controllers arent quality and the skimpy 3 month warranty and lack
 of service options prove my point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp; I have read on 
several other forums, thread after thread, of the exact same issue 
happening from regular usage from tons of different people. All having 
the same issue of a failing bumper component (the right and left bumpers
 are just a single piece of cheap plastic that spans across the entire 
controller). Guess what? All of these people have went round and round 
with microsoft in hopes to get these controllers fixed and got the shaft
 instead. I dont get it,   Instead of doing a recall and fixing the 
garbage bumper system, MS is letting them fly off the shelves hoping 
they last just long enough so that they dont have to honor any kind of 
warranty and then not even offer a way to repair the $3 part that is 
problematic and consistently breaks on so many of their controllers. 
Instead, they milk the consumer for another $150 for a controller that 
is MAYBE worth half of that.</p>





<p>&nbsp; I get that 
Microsoft needs to make money. Every business that wants to stay in 
business needs to. But when a company starts bidding out jobs to get the
 lowest cost for a product to sell, they need to stand by that product 
when it falls apart because it was made with inferior parts. This should
 HARDLY fall on the consumer. Especially when the product is made with 
shoddy craftsmanship and sold at a premier price point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
</p>



<p>&nbsp;
 I will not buy another elite controller until mine gets replaced or 
repaired free of charge (which probably means that I will NEVER buy 
another since we all know what their warranty and service looks like). 
And now, I'm actually considering going over to  playstation as soon as my family's two Xbox One's fail. I hate when people get screwed over by big companies like this and especially hate it when I'm one of said people.</p>



<p>&nbsp;
 My advice?&nbsp; Dont support this type of business practice by buying an 
elite controller. And, if you HAVE to have one, buy it straight from 
best buy or walmart and tack on the 2 year warranty they offer for $10. 
At least with them, they'll replace it when it fails (and it will fail 
way sooner than you think it should). If i could do it again, I would do it like that. But since I'm already out $150, I def will not be giving MS another $150 even though having an extra 2 yr warranty would make it worth it. I'm not giving MS any more money to distribute garbage to their consumer. It isnt right and they shouldnt be rewarded for putting garbage like this on the shelves without at least standing behind their products with a reasonable warranty or affordable service options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I'm curious to see the numbers...&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; How many other people have had their elite controllers fail under a year? Under 6 months? If you have, leave a quick response stating what failed on the controller and roughly when it did after the purchase.

<p>&nbsp;  You are trolling. You just repeated the same thing I said about the hindsight thing. Thats why I said it. Because if I could do it differently, I would. You added nothing to this thread other than your Kardashians drama. Not helpful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;  &nbsp; I have had good success with my generic controllers as well,
 which is why I never looked into the problems of the elite controller. I
 doubt you would have looked into it either since you are convinced that
 your microsoft products are "built to last." So get off your high-horse already. After it did break, I started looking into it and then found that I'm not an isolated case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
 The whole reason I even took the time to write my Wall of Text, was to 
INFORM people who are on the fence about buying one. I wish this 
information was readily available for me and my family before the 
controller was purchased in the first place. I'm hoping to save others 
from the same frustration and headaches that I have had to go through 
due to this ordeal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So maybe instead of trashing on this thread because you're not affected, you should spread the word to actually help out the community instead. If you REALLY disagree still, then I hope all of your microsoft products fail shortly after the warranty expires and then you go through the same crap I and others had to. And when it does happen, I hope you think back to the time where you were a turd of a human being to a total stranger that went through a similar problem.

</p><p>Microsoft even sells a brand new xbox 1 kinect cheaper the the elite controller! The elite controller is overpriced, fact. All the materials don't cost that much. and they only offer a 90 day warranty for it if youre an american. however if your a nz or australian citizen our governments consumer laws provide a 12 month warranty. microsoft is an american company but they have offices in nz and australia and thus fall under the jurisdiction of these countries too. the law is above any contract. it also mentions this in theor twrms of service. if you live outside the us the laws of your country apply. many companies try to minimize your legal rights. but some laws from some governments dont allow contracts to do that and their legal rights override the contract.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Multiple Duplicate Folders under This PC in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grant klokeid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Duplicate Folders under This PC in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>After I installed OneDrive when I open up File Explorer (Windows Explorer); on the left side I now see:</p>
<p>1 "OneDrive" with appropriate folders underneath.&nbsp; That is good. </p>
<p>2. Underneath OneDrive is "This PC" with similar folders underneath, also good so far.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. And below that is my "C:" drive. Standard stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the folders I moved to OneDrive is my Documents (C:\Users\Grant\Documents). If memory serves me correctly I just dragged and dropped the folder into OneDrive folder in File Explorer.&nbsp; As a result If you look at C:\Users\Grant\Documents it is now empty
 but the content can now be found at&nbsp;C:\Users\OneDrive\Grant\Documents. So now the "Documents" folder is underneath "OneDrive" not "This PC". This is all makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the strange part. When looking at the left side of File Explorer I quite often see multiple duplicate folders named "Documents" that are under "This PC". If I click on any of them they are duplicates of the same folder under "OneDrive".&nbsp; This problem
 is more of an nuisance than anything else. The number of Documents Folders underneath "This PC" folder varies from one (this is what should be there) to about 8 folders. The are all named "Documents" and with same content and green checkmark as found under
 "OneDrive/Documents".</p>
<p>If I click on "This PC" on the left side of the windows, on the right side of the window it always shows only one "Documents" folder.&nbsp; So the duplicate files only occurs on the left side of the File Explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get rid of these duplicate folders on the left side of the File Explorer windows underneath "This PC"?&nbsp; Rather vebose post but wanted to make it clear.</p>

            <p>Hi Grant,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that you are getting multiple duplicate folders for Documents in the left&nbsp;pane of&nbsp;File Explorer. I will surely help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to exit OneDrive from Task Manager and System Tray, this will stop OneDrive Syncing.&nbsp;Now backup the contents of the Documents folder and delete the duplicate folders. Restart the computer and open OneDrive to start Syncing again. Now drag and
 drop the Documents folder to OneDrive and check if you face any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>To exit OneDrive from Task Manager&nbsp;follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. <strong>Right-click </strong>on <strong>Task Bar.</strong></p>
<p>b. Click on <strong>Task Manager.</strong></p>
<p>c. Under <strong>Processes</strong>, right-click on <strong>OneDrive </strong>
and click on <strong>End Task.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>To exit OneDrive from System Tray follow these steps.</p>
<p>a. <strong>Right-click </strong>on <strong>OneDrive </strong>icon in <strong>System Tray.</strong></p>
<p>b. Click on <strong>Exit</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of the issue so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>OK. Followed instructions best I could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I exited OneDrive by following Step 1 above. I right-clicked on I think Microsoft OneDrive and clicked on End Task. Good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I started to do Step 2 but as I was looking in System Tray I saw OneDrive icon disappear. I suspect that is because of what I did in Step 1. As a result I believe Step 2 is not necessary because the computer did it itself. I opened up File Explorer and
 confirmed I still had multiple Document folder on the left pane under "This PC".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now I need to copy the "Documents" folder. Which one?&nbsp; I have two?</p>
<p>C:\Users\Grant\Documents - this one is empty.</p>
<p>C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\Documents - this is the one I believe you want me to back up. It contains everything that Microsoft OneDrive has stored on the cloud.</p>
<p>So I copied the contents of C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\Documents to C:\Users\Grant\Temp Documents. I closed and then reopened File Explorer and I no longer have multiple Document folders under "This PC". Remember the problem I originally had was multiple Document
 folders under "This PC" intermittently.&nbsp; As a result I can't delete the multiple Document folders because they currently don't exist.&nbsp; I guess I will maintain current configuration for a while to see if they show up. Meanwhile I have a duplicate of my OneDrive
 files and OneDrive is turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attached is an image of File Explorer showing the problem of multiple Document folders under This PC.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe1d8021-2aa8-4048-a3ed-f8fa5cbf6db7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe1d8021-2aa8-4048-a3ed-f8fa5cbf6db7" /></a></p>

            Update.&nbsp; After the next time I rebooted my computer, Microsoft OneDrive started up and is now maintaining sync of C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\ with the cloud. Working as expected as before. Still have not see duplicate Documents folders yet but has not been
 very long. Remember I have a stale copy of what what in C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\Documents stored on my computer.&nbsp; The longer I wait for my duplicate Document folders to show up the staler it becomes. And if I do get duplicate folders and I start deleting them
 my fear is I may end up deleting my updated content in C:\Users\Grant\OneDrive\Documents.&nbsp; Chance I will have to take. Either that or I can make an updated backup. Will see how long it takes before duplicate Documents folders show up.<br />

            <p>I did the same thing as you, I put all of my documents in OneDrive and my Documents folder under This PC points to that location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed the same behavior whenever I change anything and OneDrive syncs, it keeps creating more instances of the same folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I close File Explorer and reopen it, the duplicates go away, but I'm looking for a solution to prevent it from happening at all.</p>

            That works for me.&nbsp; Though to not have the problem if the first place would be preferable. Windows Explorer use to have Refresh up in the menu but I can't see to find it anymore with Windows 10. I just have to remember F5. Thanks for the tip.

<p>Changing the location of My Documents folder to a sub-folder of OneDrive creates this issue.</p>

            I've just been on to Microsoft Tech Support and they had no idea about this issue.&nbsp; Suggested that I post the problem here but many of you have beaten me to it :-)&nbsp; A fix would be nice, rather than seeing a huge list of redundant document folders accumulating.
