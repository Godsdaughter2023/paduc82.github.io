<h2>            Microsoft Edge is locking up</h2>
                    <p>When I use Edge and get on a website for about 30 minutes or so, Edge locks up and the only way for me to get back into the internet is to sign out, sign in and hit edge in the taskbar.&nbsp; If I don't do that hitting the the Edge taskbar icon gets me a screen
 in blank Blue?&nbsp; Is there a setting or something to fix this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This started when Microsoft updated my computer and entered Cortana&gt;&nbsp; Please help.</p>

            Hi, Craig,
<br />
<br />Have you tried running System Restore in Safe Mode?
<br />
<br />Press Winkey + R to open Run Box
<br />Type Msconfig &gt; Press Enter or Ok
<br />
<br />
<br />Click the Boot tab and then check the “Safe Boot” option
<br />Check Network Option
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />It will be necessary to re-open Msconfig Utility to Uncheck the Boot Tab options in order to boot Windows Normally. 
<br />Click Apply, Ok
<br />Reboot the computer.       
        </p>

            I believe it requires Network option when Running.
<br />
<br />Plus, I'd advise checking your Start Up items and uncheck the unnecessary ones.
<br />
<br />Cortana Search &gt; Type Control Panel
<br />Select Programs &amp; Features &gt; Uninstall Programs
<br />Left Menu Select Turn Windows Features On or Off
<br />Uncheck Remote Differential Compression API Support (See description here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Differential_Compression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Differenti...</a>)
<br />
<br />If you don't need it uncheck &gt; Click Ok
<br />It does slow down the system.

<p>That did not work.&nbsp; I tried doing system restore in safe mode and when I clicked create a restore point to get into system restore it just went to system properties with no option to do a restore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, in safe mode the boot time was the normal 12 seconds.&nbsp; I get the feeling that something is trying to load that was not there before causing a 90 second boot time.&nbsp; Any ideas what program might be doing that?</p>

<h2>            Please help me, Two programs of windows conflicting, One Computer</h2>
                    <p>My mother board recently crashed and I had to replace it. When I did the guy at Micro Center said I would have to install Windows on a new hard drive or I would risk wiping my old hard drive and losing everything. So I installed a new windows program on
 to my new mother board/hard drive then after I got it up and running, I installed my old Hard drive (which has a different windows program/key) on it. Ever since then my computer has been telling me that I am not running a genuine Windows and running extremely
 slow. "This copy of Windows is not genuine" I believe this is because of having the two windows programs... what should I do?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>Processor: AMD Phenom(tm) II X6 1045T Processor 2,70 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 16GB</p>
<p>System type: 64-bit&nbsp; Op System</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also another issue I am having is I put my computer in "Performance mode" while downloading an certain EA Star Wars game (legally) so that my computer wont "sleep" but two hours later its asleep and I check and its back in "Basic Mode" Very frustrating.</p>

<strong>pro </strong>and some time later to Windows 10 <strong>pro</strong>. Today I revealed (in Settings) that "Windows is not activated" (error code 0xC004C003). When I ran Troubleshoot I've got the message: "We found a Windows 10 Home digital license for
 this device running Windows 10 pro. To activate using this digital license, you need to install Windows 10 Home". Could you please explain why did this happen suddenly and how can I&nbsp;<span>install Windows 10 Home if I have no Windows 10 installer (only
 Windows 8.1 installer)? P.S. I didn't change any hardware on my laptop.</span>

            Below is the excerpt from Microsoft Chat Support about activation issue being faced by people. I will suggest that you should wait for a day or two.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has just released an Emerging issue announcement about current activation issue related to Pro edition recently. This happens in Japan, Korea, American and many other countries.I am very sorry to inform you that there is a temporary issue with Microsoft's activation server at the moment and some customers might experience this issue where Windows is displayed as not activated.
<br />Our engineers are working tirelessly to resolve this issue and it is expected to be corrected within one to two business days

<p><span>Hello STEMBOB,</span> </p>
<p><span>I would like to attempt running a chkdsk from within the WINRE command prompt:</span>
</p>
<p><span>1. Tap F8 during startup to get to the Startup Options menu. </span></p>
<p><span>2. Choose Repair Windows. </span></p>
<p><span>3. After choosing the location and logging on, click on the Command Prompt option.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. Type the following command followed by the ENTER key: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>CHKDSK C: /F</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>5. Let CHKDSK run to completion. It may take some time so be patient and do not restart the computer while it is running.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. When CHKDSK has completed, restart and see if we can get into normal and/or safe mode.

==============================================<br />
This is not tech support...but I will try to offer some useful info.<br />
<br />
Correct...Movie Maker 2012 is not included with the Windows 8 operating <br />
system but you can install it as a component of Windows Essentials.<br />
<br />
See the following link if you would like to install the current version<br />
of Movie Maker for Windows 8:<br />
<br />
Get Movie Maker<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-movie-maker-download</a><br />
<br />
Also...Windows 8 does not have Video DVD Burning capabilities...<br />
you will need to acquire DVD Authoring software from the net.<br />
Windows Vista and 7 included DVD Maker..Windows .8 does not.<br />
<br />
FWIW...Movie Maker 2.6 is an old version that was designed to run <br />
on Vista systems that were unable to run the more demanding Vista <br />
Movie Maker version 6.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>You need that transmitter for the mouse to work unfortunately. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's a Microsoft mouse, buying another type may only work with the mouse it came with which means your only option is to buy another Intellimouse I'm afraid. But they cost next to nothing these days.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But either Intellimouse will work with the single transmitter so if one packs up, you'll still have the other one.</p>

            <p>Hello Idango,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to ask you:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></span></li><li><span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any software or hardware changes prior to this issue?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Since it is giving the errors after reinstalling Windows. I would suggest you to visit the support website of the computer manufacturer&nbsp;and download the driver for graphics card
 and install it manually.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may also download the drivers from AMD's support website and check if it helps. If the issue still persists, I would advice you to get a diagnostics done on the computer to
 check for the hardware.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To download drivers from AMD's support website, click on the link below and look for the graphic card model.</span></span></p>

            I v HP Pavillion g7-2376sr.With AMD Radeon HD 7670M.<br />
Last time it was working fine is about a week before.About hardware,the week before issue came,i v changed thermal compound on video chip and processor,but it worked fine,then after starting my game,blue screen came out and VGA drivers were deleted by themselves,which
 i noticed after getting low fps in the games.I m not newbee in disassembling and &nbsp;assembling laptops and PCs,so i guess nothing wrong in hardware.Any software changes weren't made by me.<br />
You didn't understand me correctly about OS reinstalling: after i got the problem,i reinstalled it and it didn't help,that s what i mean.<br />
After all of this i made recovery,reinstalled my chipset driver,updated windows through "Windows Update" and still gets error while installing VGA drivers,from amd web-page,same from HP site. I tried to install it by command prompt and nothing,error just comes
 out all the time.I also made System test,and it says everything is OK.<br />
So i m in despair right now :(<br />
Any suggestions what it could be?<br />

    <title>Windows Vista freezes every 1-2 hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sakis_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista freezes every 1-2 hours</h2>
                    Hello everyone! I would appreciate a little help with some significant problems I have been facing during the last week.<br />
<br />
Details about my system:<br />
-- Model: Compaq Presario C700<br />
-- OS: Windows Vista Home Premium SP1<br />
-- Antivirus/Firewall: Norton 360 4.0<br />
(Note: I have been using Microsoft security Essentials AV until a two days ago with Windows Firewall)<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
-- Since last week, whenever I tried to start my Vista in normal mode, any program open about 1-2 hours after starting Vista freezes (becomes unresponsive), forcing me to reboot the PC. The same thing happens in safe mode (either with networking or not), especially
 while I am running a full Antivirus scan.<br />
-- Another problem is that I cannot back relatively large files up (100MB+) because the system will freeze while moving them to my USB drive. This means that such files are trapped in the PC.<br />
<br />
Recent changes:<br />
I have not really made any significant changes since the problem started. The previous day, I had only installed the new version of Skype and some Microsoft updates (I think there were 2 updates related to MS Office and 2-3 updates for Vista starting with KB).
 Then, I left the PC on for the night and when I tried to use it the next day, it was frozen. I rebooted however there was no improvement after Windows restarted.<br />
<br />
What I have done so far:<br />
-- Restored system to the pre-installation status of the Microsoft updates and Skype - Did not help.<br />
-- Repair PC at start-up (F8 when Windows start etc - Did not help)<br />
-- Quick scan with Microsoft Security Essentials (no errors found - full scan would stall).<br />
-- Quick and full scans with Malwarebytes (a few errors found, all fixed however the problems persist).<br />
-- Quick and full scans with Norton 360 4.0 (4-5 errors found, mostly low risk tracking cookies, all fixed).<br />
-- Registry cleanup (several errors found, all fixed, however problems persist).<br />
-- I followed a link to this thread here: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/88d130af-1aaf-4e82-8d85-3cbf72500a2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaperformance/thread/88d130af-1aaf-4e82-8d85-3cbf72500a2a</a> since the user who posted it seems to be facing similar problems. I then followed Mark Ferguson's advice and although there seems to be no issue
 with the video adapter, I noticed an exclamation mark on one of the network adapters, the 6OT4 Adapter. I double clicked on it and there was an error message: Cannot start device (code 10). I tried to update it (it said I have the latest version) and also
 clicked on "check for solutions" (no help there either).<br />
-- On msconfig, I have also noticed that several of the Microsoft Services have stopped working (53 in total, however I can recognize some and tell for sure that I have deactivated them myself, such as the Parental Control and Windows Defender which I know
 that Norton 360 deactivated). I am not into PCs that much, so I am not sure if this is common or a Windows error that requires me to look into. Unfortunately, the names of these services are in Greek with elaborate terms, so I am not that sure how they are
 properly translated in English. If this is an issue that requires me to look into though, I can give it a try and post here a rough translation for those services.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would really appreciate it if anyone could help me solve the problems with my PC issues since I urgently need my files and my computer. Thanks to anyone who can help!

<p>Yeah, I was trying to uninstall Skype in safe mode, I guess that explains it then.. lol.. However, the problem is that since the PC freezes less than 5 minutes after startup in normal mode, I cannot uninstall it from there either..</p>
<p>As for tunnel.sys, I uninstalled it and then rebooted in safe modeas you advised. The problem is that I cannot find 6to4 adapter in the device manager any more (and the problem with Windows freezing still persists in normal mode).</p>
<p>As for the recovery tool in my PC, I am not sure. If there should be one, where can I check if it is available on my PC?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>for example i have got vaio, in my start menu where i have list of programs installed on my computer there is a program called vaio recovery tool. I used that to create my recovery cd.</p>
<p>Now, if you have vaio, you should have something like this, otherwise look for a program from manufacturer for recovery in start menu where you have all programs listed. what is your computer make and model?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>ask ur manufacturer for recovery cd or ask them how can you recover your system?? do they provide any support on that? some manufacturers will send you recovery cd but u have to pay. these days no computer has recovery cd instead manufacturer provide a software
 in your pc to create recovery cds yourself and also there is a partition in your harddrive that these files are stored and you should be able to access them when you require!</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>also you can try this: right click on my computer, go to propertise then click on advanced systems settings then click on settings for startup and recovery in advanced tab then make sure both check boxes are checked and 30 seconds for each then click ok
 then restart to normal mode then let it freeze then turn the computer off then turn it back on, then it should normally give u recovery or repair options.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>this is just an idea if u want u can try:</p>
<p>when you unistall the the driver, before u restart go back to msconfig then enable all startup and services then restart to normal mode see if it make a difference?</p>
<p>if it didnot go back disable all startup items only then retry (unistall the driver again then reboot to normal)</p>
<p>if that did not then disable some non windows serivices see if that solve the problem?</p>
<p>OR</p>

<blockquote>I scheduled avast to perform scan at startup, it all started well, then froze during the scan (before Windows loaded).
<br />
<br />
As for uninstalling, I am afraid that this is impossible now.. When I log in to Windows, everything will stop and start again continuously, I don't even have the time to move a file from desktop to the recycle bin before it will stop the process and start again..
 To post this message, I had to use my sister's PC. :(<br />
<br />
I doubt this is due to the avast scan though. The only thing that I seem to be able to make work during this continuous stop/start process is the task manager (only in safe mode), however I had not been able to stop it by turning off some processes there..<br />
<br />
Any help please? If not as regards fixing this issue (the "flash" effect now so that I can regain control of the PC at least..), I would really appreciate a little help as regards how I may transfer a few files to a USB stick without having to log in to Windows?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot!</blockquote>

<p>Brother, o Dirt 3 é um game de rally que possui várias modalidades, sendo o mais visado o de tomada de tempo.</p>
<p>Cara, os gráficos são ótimos, a jogabilidade é muito boa. Ainda temos novos itens adicionais como um multiplayer slplitscreen, que é um modo de jogo em que a tela fica dividida pra duas pessoas.
</p>
<p>Bem, também tem um novo modo de corrida na neve, muito show. </p>
<p>Um Contra....A tela de loading é meio demoradinha, daí tu fica vendo seu carro em milhões de ângulos.</p>
<p>Brother eu tenho o 2 no PC, e vou comprá-lo para console.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen STOP message for &#34;CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED&#34; &#34;STOP&#58; 0x0000005A&#34;.</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Blue Screen STOP message for "CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED" "STOP: 0x0000005A". Can't advance to SAFE MODE - F8 will not work. HELP!!</p>
<p>Hi there.&nbsp; For the past 3 1/2 hours I have been trying to solve this problem.&nbsp; It is happening frequently.&nbsp; This is a new computer and the Windows 7 premium came pre-installed by Gateway, with no CD included. In this last instance the blue screen appeared
 after an unexpected power outage. I have googled and searched in the Microsoft website for that specific error message and the only exact match response was for Vista system- Blue Screen STOP message for "CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED"&nbsp; "STOP: 0x0000005A".&nbsp; After
 reading some other blue screen threads there was one that mentioned the Vista solution would apply to Windows 7 as well.&nbsp; Well the solution to this issue is to begin with SAFE MODE.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have restarted the computer many times and always pressing
 and holding or tapping repeatedly the "F8" key and it goes back to the memory dump black screen and from there to the blue screen with the message above.&nbsp; So it is a no win situation- can't get my computer to react to the F8 command after I turn on [before
 the windows logo].&nbsp; The 2 options are F12 to change boot options or "Del" enter to exit.&nbsp; for the last one there are many options coming up but nothing related to disable the automatic restart or any other option related to starting in safe mode. Can someone
 help me please??&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi newlou,</span></p>
<p><span>You have already tried to get into safe mode and you are not able to get “Advanced Startup Options” itself. Also, you don’t have Windows 7 installation
 disc with you. We do not have many options left. However, you can try steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Unplug all the external devices (except mouse and keyboard and then try to boot and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Restore BIOS defaults and then try to boot in safe mode and check if it helps. If you are not sure on how to restore BIOS defaults then, I would
 suggest you to get in touch with Gateway for help.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BIOS: frequently asked questions</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Disclaimer:</span></em></strong><em><span>Be
 careful when changing BIOS settings. The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.<br />
Updating BIOS should only be done if necessary (to solve a compatibility problem, for example). It can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</span></em></p>
<p><span>If nothing works then, I would suggest you to get in touch with Gateway for further support.</span></p>

            <p>It seems obvious that the problem is not on your computer but in the sound system.&nbsp; Go over the entire sound system and remove and re-plug each connector.&nbsp; If that does not solve the problem, you likely have a defect somewhere.&nbsp; It could be as simple as
 a wire with a broken connection inside that you can not see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make certain, you have the right connector in the right port on your computer.&nbsp; Typically the wire from the speakers has a green end on it and that goes into the port with the green circle around it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, buy yourself a new set.&nbsp; Not terribly expensive.&nbsp; Unless you want to listen to symphonies on it, you do not need anything much more than pretty basic hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also check with friends and relatives, they frequently have extra sound systems.</p>

            <p>i don't think there is any problem with the speakers because whenever i connect them to my mobile , they work . but when i connect them to my pc they don't.</p>
<p>i connected them in every of the 3 ports at the back of my pc but it does not work</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for replying.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This could be due to incompatibility with Windows 10.</div>
<p>
</p><div>&nbsp;I would suggest you ensure to set the <strong>internal speaker </strong>as default to check if that helps.</div>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also ensure to download the updated audio software and install it to check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><div>&nbsp;<span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run the Hardware troubleshooter and check, if it works.</span></span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;a. Press Windows key + W to search Settings.<br />
&nbsp;b. Type “Troubleshoot” without quotes and click on Troubleshooting in the results displayed on the left side of the screen.<br />
&nbsp;c. In the new window, click Hardware and Sound.<br />
&nbsp;d. In the list of options, click on Hardware and Devices.<br />
&nbsp;e. Click Next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span><span> </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><div>I would also&nbsp;suggest you to install the latest sound drivers from the computer manufacturer's support website and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persists, install the same driver in compatibility mode for previous version of Windows.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</div>
<div>b. Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode for: box. </div>
<div>c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</div>
<div>d. Try installing the driver and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t type password to log into windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Hoping for some help as I can't access my computer. After doing a system restart I found my Sony laptop keyboard has been disabled. I tried a wifi keyboard which allows me to use the mouse but not the keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating, I'm also angry that I am being forced to use a password in the first place because I don't need one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 years ago I made several attempts to upgrade my computer to windows 8.1 from windows 8. The attempts were unsuccessful and created a malfunction. Windows now keeps asking for me to activate my account but the link does not work. I don't know if this is
 related to the new issue of the disabled keyboards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this can be resolved ASAP</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Ava</p>

<p>Hi Avacreates,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may opt to use the On-screen keyboard (OSK), an Ease of Access tool built-in to Windows, if you are unable to use the physical keyboard of your system. You don’t need a touchscreen to use the OSK. The OSK displays a visual keyboard with all the standard
 keys. Select keys using the mouse or another pointing device, or use a physical single key or group of keys to cycle through the keys on the screen. Refer to this support article to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10762/windows-use-on-screen-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After gaining access back to your system, I recommend that you check for updated drivers to address your malfunctioning keyboard. Follow the instructions provided in this support article to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15046/windows-8-download-install-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install drivers in Windows 8.1</a>. If the issue persists, this may be related to a hardware failure, check with the manufacturer of the device for possible support options regarding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            BSOD&#58; 0x0000000a</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
It's my first BSOD upon a clean installation I made of Windows 7 RTM months ago. It worked well except for today. I left the computer turned on and when I returned to home, a beautiful BSOD appeared. PC is configured to sleep when is idle for two hours but
 as BSOD occured, it didn't slept. I tried to sleep it manually to see if BSOD occurs but not.<br />
The only problem I had with hardware is that my video card is defective, it give artifacts. I'll change this card later, but computer worked without BSOD and with this crappy video card without problems (excepts for artifacts in some games) and I think that
 artifacts can cause TDR problem but not BSOD... The card is the fault as I tested it in other PC and the result was the same artifacts.<br />
So far I suspect from: video card caused the BSOD (I think that artifacts problems aren't related but maybe...), Catalyst 10.1 drivers or C1E option in BIOS.<br />
I tested processor using Prime95 and no errors for 16 hours. RAM test using built-in tool is passed. Recently I finished Dark Void game without problem.<br />
The only things that changed in my computer before the first BSOD were the installation of Catalyst 10.1 and the option C1E in BIOS that I turned on. I turned it off to see if that solves the problem.<br />
Now the favor I want to ask for. Is there anybody that can analyze my dmp file? That will make me very happy :-)<br />
<strong><br />
The link to the BSOD is: <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/342648076/MEMORY.rar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Finally I get rid of the BSOD simply updating from Catalyst 10.1 to Catalyst 10.1 hotfix while I was waiting for Catalyst 10.2. Apparently 10.1 installed bad or got corrupted although registry said it was installed successfully. No more BSOD from the day I
 posted and installed the hot fix. Anyway C1E is disabled as I'm using Cool'n'Quiet.
<br />
A thing I noted when I installed Catalyst 10.1 (the one that cause problem) is that when it started to install GPU driver, Windows played about 7 times the sound that you listen when you plug a USB device. I install Catalyst every month and normally you should
 listen only 2 times that sound, the first when it uninstall the old driver and the second when the new driver is installed.<br />

            Hi jadraker,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
What happened when you disabled C1E option in BIOS? Did you get any blue screen after that?<br />
<br />
Most of the BSOD’s are because of defective hardware’s or corrupt drivers.<br />
<br />
I’d suggest you to update the drivers for all the hardware devices of your computer. And also replace you video card since it is defective.
<p>You may also check if the issue persists in safe mode and post back with the status so, that we can help you better.</p>
<p>To use a Safe mode option, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the arrow keys to choose Safe Mode in Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-safe-mode</a><br />
<strong><br />
You may try performing hardware clean boot and check.<br />
<br />
</strong>Here’s the procedure to do it:</p>
<p>1. Go to Start and type device manager in the start search field.<br />
2. Type device manager and select device manager from the programs list.<br />
3. Right Click on Sound Card, Video Adapter, and Network Adapter one by one and click disable.<br />
4. Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>If this fixes your problem, enable to hardware devices one at time to find the exact device causing this problem.
<br />
<br />
After you found the device that causing the problem you can resolve by installing last driver or replacing the device.</p>
<p>You may also temporarily disable security software’s and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.<br />

<h2>            Problem downloading apps from the app store. - Error code 0x80070422</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I'm facing some problems downloading apps from the App Store in Windows 10, build 14393.</p>
<p>Basically, everytime I try to download an app, any app, after it says "Starting download...", it says "Acquiring license" for a split second then "Error, see details". If I click on the "Error, see details" message, it says "Turn on Windows Update so store
 can show you the stuff that works the best on your device" and the error code is 0x80070422.</p>
<p>Things I tried to do:</p>
<p>Enabled/Disabled Windows Update in services.msc several times</p>
<p>Reseted Store cache</p>
<p>Signed in/out of my account</p>
<p>Disabled/Enabled Firewall</p>
<p>Used the Apps Troubleshooter</p>
<p>And several other things</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloading apps works fine on my other PC, with the same Microsoft account. Any ideas what I should do to fix this? Thanks.</p>
<p />

<h2>            WOW&#47;Graphics error &#34;display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered&#34;</h2>
                    Please help. On the following computer, I am having terrible crashing issues while playing WOW. The WOW critical error states:"not enough memory to process command - 11,538 bytes requested"
<br />
<br />
When running 3D Mark Vantage&nbsp;I can reproduce the "display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered"<br />
<br />
Processor Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 920 @ 2.67GHz<br />
Component Details<br />
Graphics NVIDIA GeForce GTX 295<br />
Gaming graphics 4095 MB Total available graphics memory<br />
Primary hard disk 53GB Free (140GB Total)<br />
Vista Ultamate 64 bit version with service pac 2<br />
<br />
Forums are full of posters stating that this is a Vista / Nvidea incompatability issue that has been around for years and that the problem is not being addressed. I have tried everything&nbsp;I can think of, from checking RAM to downloading new drivers, to deleting
 WOW junk folders.&nbsp;I have reseated everything, run every diagnostic tool on the plane, downloaded patches, checked for&nbsp;viruses and still no help.<br />
<br />
I am currently able to play WOW on the lowest graphics settings and avoidance of major cities. With this level of equipment, its a shame, I really should be able to do more.<br />
<br />
Has anyone got any suggestions of what I can do at this point?<br />

            Ok, I did a bunch of research on this issue.&nbsp; The problem lies with Blizzard, for the most part.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is a 32bit game.&nbsp; Because it is strictly 32bit, it only has access to 2gig of memory.&nbsp; Windows controls the other 2gig of addressable space.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Most game developers flag their games before compile time to use larger amounts of memory.&nbsp; Blizzard doesn't do this, because their anti-cheat system, and third party tools rely on the 32bit addressing, and 64bit addressing would mean they would all have to
 be rewritten.<br />
<br />
What is happening in the game is that your large memory footprint of your graphics card is mapped into the game.&nbsp; Typically this is when your settings are high, because it uses the most memory, which would explain why the game is playable when you use minimal
 settings.&nbsp; Because your particular graphic card setup uses nearly 2 gig of RAM itself, you quickly force the game to run out of memory space that is addressable.<br />
<br />
To fix this, you may be able to play at reduced settings.&nbsp; Lowering your resolution is typically the best way to restrict memory usage, since it exponentially increases RAM use when you increase resolution.&nbsp; You will likely have to play around with various
 settings.&nbsp; You can open up Task Manager and monitor your WoW game's usage of memory to see where the sweet spot is on keeping your memory under control.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will have to make the hard choice of eventually enabling extended memory access.&nbsp; As more and more people buy advanced hardware such as yours, this problem will become more and more common.&nbsp;
<br />

<p>Google 'Hide Windows Updates in Windows 10'</p>
<p>Download the troubleshooter from Microsoft 'wushowhide.diagcab'</p>
<p>Select the update that's giving the problem and run the troubleshooter</p>

<h2>            How do I permanently purge my Windows 7 of &#34;Update for Microsoft Windows &#40;KB2952664&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I've reverted back to Windows 7 from the Windows 10 update.&nbsp; I deleted update KB3035583, which installs the windows update signup and reminder program, so now I've eliminated the little window gizmo at the lower right of the screen.&nbsp; It has seemingly been

 and it's back at the top of the list of installed updates.&nbsp; I suspect that it is responsible for the apparently permanent nag on the Update screen to download the Windows 10 update.&nbsp; How do I permanently purge my system of this stuff?

            I haven't yet updated to W10 (still have W7 x64 Pro), but I am having this same issue. No matter what I do I cannot get rid of&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB2952664. As a result, my Windows Update just constantly
 says Windows 10 is ready for me, and <strong>it will not check for updates to Windows 7 anymore,
</strong>as long as that Windows 10 update is sitting on deck. So for the past few weeks my Windows 7 is running without being able to get any critical W7 updates. **** Microsoft?!</span>

            <p>I do not think you need to worry about KB2952664.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want Win10:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have advised my clients to do what I have dreaded doing for years -- turn off Automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is compounded by an incessant drive by Microsoft to install Windows 10 on your computer with out your permission.&nbsp; They keep re-installing KB3035583 (that is the enabler) on
 your computer, even if you uninstall it.&nbsp; The result is the huge download and then constant nags without an apparent way to say no.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I have advised my clients to shut down WU.&nbsp; Once a month on the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to turn on WU and then to reject specific updates like KB3035583.&nbsp;
 After updating, they will turn automatic updates off again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file. Even if you do not, it may be on your computer by now anyway/&nbsp;
 Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is likely Win10 has already downloaded to your PC.&nbsp; If you are using windows 7, and have
<strong><span>not</span></strong> installed win10 and do not want it, here is a procedure that I have used many times and it works.</span><span>&nbsp;

<p>To Canadian Tech, thank you for the response.&nbsp; And to you and any others interested:<br />
<br />
As I indicated in my original post, I had W10 downloaded and installed, but after playing with it for a couple days decided that it wanted to know too much about me, it "lost" my Microsoft games (but I could "buy them back " at the Windows store), and by the
 time I got it set up the way I use a computer, it looked and acted (so far as I could tell) much like my original Windows 7 setup.&nbsp; Since basic support for W7 is scheduled to last another 4+ years, I undertook to revert back to my W7 installation.&nbsp; Although
 it took some work to discover how to do it, it did work and I got back to W7, essentially intact.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I had some irritating leftover echos of W10, as I've indicated in my original post.&nbsp; I think I've more or less solved my problems, and in much the same way as Canadian Tech, though yours seems to have been written from the viewpoint of avoiding
 the "upgrade" in the first place.<br />
<br />
Back running W7 Sp1, I found that these "echos" are 3 Windows update files:&nbsp; the KB2952664 and&nbsp;&nbsp; KB3035583, both mentioned by Canadian Tech, and one without an obvious KB number entitled "Upgrade to Windows 10".&nbsp; KB2952664 seems to be permanently embedded in
 my system, but with the other two files gone, seems to be innocuous, again as mentioned by Canadian Tech.<br />
<br />
To do at least some of the following procedure you will need to have Administrator privileges.&nbsp; Also, I don't know how the locations of some of the items I recommend that you "select" or "click on" may vary depending on how you have your visuals set up.&nbsp; You
 should probably do two or three complete "dry runs" through the procedure first before actually changing anything just to make sure you can find everything.&nbsp; And, all I can say is that this worked on my computer, I can't guarantee it will work on any other
 computer. <br />
<br />
Apparently, the "Upgrade to W10" update file was deleted from my computer by the rollback process from W10 to W7, but it still sits in the list of Window update files at Microsoft, ready and more than willing to down-load into your machine, so you need to be
 careful "not to encourage it". &nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Open the Control Panel, then open "Windows Update".&nbsp; If the "Upgrade to Windows 10" blurb is still showing in this page, for heavens sake STAY AWAY FROM THE "Get Started" button.<br />
<br />
2. Select "Change Settings".<br />
<br />
This next step is, I think (and Canadian Tech apparently agrees), necessary to keep from being "reinfected" by W10 stuff.&nbsp; But rather than turning WU fully off, I did the following:<br />
<br />
3. Under "Important Updates, select "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them."<br />
<br />
4. Go back to the "Windows Update" page and in the lower left corner, click on "Installed Updates".&nbsp; It may take some seconds for the list to show up.<br />
<br />
5. In the list of updates scroll down under the MS Windows section to "Update for MS Windows (KB3035583)".&nbsp; Right click on it and left click on "Uninstall".&nbsp; (Update KB2952664 will be in the list also, but it reappears every time I've uninstalled it and it
 seems not to have any effect on the system, so don't bother with it.)<br />
<br />
6. Go back to the "Windows Update" page and if the "Update for Windows 10" blurb is showing, click on "Show all available updates" outside the blurb at its lower left.&nbsp; If the blurb is not there, then inside the regular update box, click on "## -------- updates
 are available".<br />
<br />
7. In the resulting section that lists the available updates for Windows 7 should be a preselected line "Upgrade to Windows 10".&nbsp; Unselect that line by clicking on the checkmark in the square at the beginning of the line.&nbsp; Then right click on the line and in
 the resulting popup box, left click on "Hide Update".&nbsp; There should also be a preselected line for KB3035583 in the list of updates.&nbsp; Do the same unselection and "Hide Update" steps on this line as described previously.<br />
<br />
8. Go back to the "Windows Update" page.&nbsp; Note that the "Update for Windows 10" blurb, if there previously, should now be replaced by the regular Windows Update box.&nbsp; Click on the "## ------- updates are available" line.<br />
<br />
9. Both of the "hidden" updates should be absent from the listing of available updates.<br />
<br />
10. Close the Control Panel.<br />
<br />
This procedure worked on my computer, BUT, TO KEEP MY MICROSOFT OPERATING SYSTEM AND SOFTWARE UP TO DATE, "SECURE", AND "UNCONTAMINATED" BY POTENTIAL WINDOWS 10 STUFF, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO THOROUGHLY INSPECT EVERY NEW MS WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM UPDATE FILE
 BEFORE ALLOWING IT TO DOWNLOAD.&nbsp; This proviso doesn't apply to non-operating system updates or security updates (I hope).&nbsp; I hope that this will not be necessary indefinitely, perhaps no more than the "free" year.<br />
<br />
As Canadian Tech strongly implies, it is very important to keep your system up to date, so if you do follow the above procedure, DO NOT ignore the updates.<br />
<br />

            <p>Thank you very much Bill.&nbsp; This is likely to come in handy.&nbsp; I have so far been able to stave off W10 from my 150 client computers.&nbsp; I made it clear to my clients (who receive my service gratis) that if they chose W10, they are then on their own because
 I have no intent to ever support W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent them many detailed sets of instructions on how to avoid getting trapped by W10.&nbsp; I have remotely carried out these steps for many of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, someone (most are pretty normal quite innocent non-computer people) somehow gets trapped into this malware, this may prove very handy in helping them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, my impression is that the back to 7 button in 10 ends up creating a morass of issues.&nbsp; I would really appreciate an equally detailed account of how you did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing about Windows Update.&nbsp; I have it set to never because the danger of a Microsoft infection is much greater than the many other attempts.&nbsp; I will still require my clients to do updates, but it will now be completely their responsibility to ensure
 the wrong ones (which I will list monthly) not be installed and right ones are.</p>

            <p>I found out how to revert back from Windows 10 on one of the Microsoft forum groups, under Windows 10 I think.&nbsp; Anyway, I've copied over the precise website address below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/can-i-revert-back-to-windows-7-or-8/8f204f5d-4d91-4c62-9ff8-d3f55c102cc5?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall that I had any particular problems with the reversion itself with respect to the condition of Windows 7 afterwards except that a few of my settings had been changed, my desktop arrangement was all disturbed, and, of course, the garbage that
 was left over from Windows 10.&nbsp; Everything but the W10 stuff was easily put right, and after I was apparently able to get rid of those leftovers, I heaved a sigh of relief and counted myself lucky (although I have to admit I'm sort of waiting for the other

<h2>            Windows 10 laptop does not start properly on first boot, need to restart my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss on this one. Everything about Windows 10 is working fine, except when I do a cold boot after being shut down. Every evening before bed I shut the computer down completely. Each day since upgrading, on my first attempt to power on, I get stuck
 at the Blue Windows logo, and the spinning dots stop after about 5-10 seconds, and nothing happens. I can't click anything or use the keyboard. I have to hold my power button, shut down, and the start it back up, and everything works fine from that point onwards.
 It's just the *first* boot each day that seems to have this issue. Really bizarre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my Bios, and downloaded all the latest drivers to everything I have...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is the Dell Inspiron 13 7000</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to know more about your concern, so kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Are there any external devices connected to your laptop?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>When you turn on or restart your device, it runs through a <strong>POST (Power On Self Test)</strong> routine. It will determine if all the system's hardware is working properly before loading the operating system. Meanwhile, if there's any external devices,
 disks, or USB devices connected to your laptop, we suggest that you disconnect or remove them. Reboot your PC, and see if it helps. We also recommend that you run the
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool to scan for possible file corruptions, and restore it. Here's how:
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated prompt. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X</strong>, and then right-click on
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>. </li><li>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>Enter</strong>:
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>sfc /scannow </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span><span>Note: The scan may take some time, so please be patient. Windows will repair any corrupted or missing files that are found.
</span></span>The scan results will be shown after this process is finished. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for additional information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward to your response. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 8, 8.1 and 10 have a new feature called Fast Startup. It can sometimes cause problems like you mention as well as others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to tell if this is the problem is to turn it off and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature only works when you do a SHUTDOWN and then Boot.</p>
<p>It doesn't effect a RESTART.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn it off or on...</p>
<p>Go to Control panel...Power Options, and select Choose What the Power Buttons Do on the left.</p>
<p>Then select Change Settings That Are Currently Unavailable near the top center of screen...</p>
<p>Lower down on the window, uncheck Fast Startup.</p>
<p>This may or may not help your problem, but is easy to check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual cause of your problem is probably a driver that is not working properly with Fast Startup... The difficult part is determining which one..</p>
