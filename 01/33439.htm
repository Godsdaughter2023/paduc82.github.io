    <title>Gamer profile issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zombe respnse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamer profile issue</h2>
                    <p>So I've tried many of times to play MX vs ATV Reflex on my Xbox and every time</p><p>I get to the main menu it says I need to be signed in with a gamer profile. I've tried signing and signing back in but it does not work. I also made another profile and it says the same thing. I know my regular profile is a gamer one because I have Xbox live. I can't play the career without this fixed and it's really frustrating to me because I love this game.</p>

<h2>            You tube video sound sputters and slows down</h2>
                    
<p>Sound cut out and online program slow down</p>
<p>Since I installed Windows 7 64 bit OS, I've now (in the past few days) suddenly encounted sound sputtering and when I watch a YT video, it jerks, sound sputters, and slows down. Yes, I've already tried the 'disable enhancements' routine, deleted both audiodg.exe
 and WUDFhost.ext files from taskmaster.&nbsp; Still not completely fixed.&nbsp; I left task master open while I ran some online videos on YouTube. Something is grabbing 100% of my CPU and I can't see what it is.&nbsp; I have a HP workstation with two 3.2Ghz dual core processors
 with 8gb of ram, and feel my computer should be doing much better than what I see.&nbsp; Anyone out there have a different solution?&nbsp; John</p>

<p>The symptoms and diagnosis you have provided is similar to what happened to Max Payne 2 in around 2012. After successful installation and many hours of use, the application suddenly would not launch after clicking on the icon. The user tries the usual diagnostics;
 clean the disk, troubleshoot comparability in windows, run application as an administrator, ... checked Data Execution Prevention ... nothing works ever after.</p>
<p>It appears only the disk based versions of these games have been affected, indicating that each program executable installation and .NET framework are uncorrupted. The disk based installations included anti-piracy software called DRM (Digital Rights Management),
 that was designed to protect the software under licence from being copied freely by naughty people.
</p>
<p>However, it turns out that the DRM anti-piracy software, that was used to detect genuine versions, is now in conflict with the computer's operating system, and wont allow the user to launch the application. Well, Max Payne 2 discs used Direct 2 Drive DRM
 software, while Civ 3 uses SafeDisc (SECDRV.SYS) , so it follows that lots of softwares reliant on either Direct 2 Drive or SafeDisc would be showing the same application launch symptoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way of switching off the DRM feature as it is embedded in the program. Back in 2012 Max Payne user community suggested turning to piracy and using the nocd crack, although this is still illegal, in 2012, if you do not own the software, even if
 the software is more than five or ten years old. There was no claim ever made in public as to why a perfectly legitimate and fully operational installation of MaxPayne2 would stop working.</p>
<p>Many people have cited this problem with their secdrv.sys DRM based game applications. From Civilisation 3, SIMS 2, Command &amp; Conquor, and so on. The game once worked, and now has stopped working from launch. All these problems have all occurred since 9th
 September 2015, which is the date Microsoft issued new updates for its Windows 7, Windows 8/8.1, and Windows 10 operating systems. It appears that Microsoft Security Update KB3083324 is depreciating the DRM based games without the users knowing about it, and
 causing confusion on the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft has come clean about this by</p>
<ol>
<li>announcing the security flaw in 7 November 2007, and releasing a patch in the same year, for Windows 7 systems. (see Wikipedia article "SafeDrive").</li><li>Providing a security bulletin&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS15-097</a>&nbsp;in September 2015.</li></ol>
<strong>Security Update for Windows (KB3083324) </strong>installed on the machine in question.&nbsp;</p>
 try and launch your game application and see if it launches.</p>
 problems by removing updates</a>.</p>
<strong>Windows Update </strong>and have not yet decided to go ahead and install this update then you have three options:</p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">What happens if I want to run my DRM-based application &amp; receive fixes to security vulnerabilities from Microsoft?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dual Boot</strong> your computer operating system (7/8/10) with Windows Vista, and install the DRM-based game application on Windows Vista, and continue to receive security updates on the current actively supported operating systems in the Microsoft
 Lifecycle, as both the 2007 and 2015 security patches where never made available on Vista machines.</li><li><strong>Dual Boot</strong> your computer operating system (7/8/10) with Linux Wine (or other Virtual Machine alternatives), and see if your DRM-enabled game is supported on their database.&nbsp;</li></ol>

    <title>MDT 2013 Update 1 - Image Capture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liam1086  say:</h3>
<h2>            MDT 2013 Update 1 - Image Capture</h2>
                    <p>I've recently configured MDT 2013 Update 1. Installing an OS (Windows 7) with the relevant applications has been a breeze, I have then done a bit of customising and wanting to capture this machine as a WIM. This is where I hit problems. I strive for that
 white background and I'm really stumped on a few errors I'm getting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process I follow is browse to \\servername\deploymentshare$\scripts whilst logged into the OS and run the litetouch.wsf script to launch the wizard, I then go through the process of adding in the capture directory and name of the WIM on the task sequence,
 the machine Sysprep's and boots into Windows PE and starts to capture the machine, it even uploads into \\servername\deploymentshare$\captures which isn't then the final summary pops up with a yellow background to tell me there has been a few errors. They
 are below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ERROR - rule Priority key not set in section [Settings]</strong></p>
<p><strong>ERROR processing Ini settings. &nbsp;No further processing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZTI ERROR - Non-zero return code by ZTIGather, rc = 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>FAILURE ( 5206 ): The Deployment Wizard was cancelled or did not complete successfully. &nbsp;The deployment will not proceed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is my customsettings.ini:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I can't see much wrong with that ini file, however, I also can't see why the task sequence would be finishing with errors. Does anyone have any advice on this, or has had the same problem when capturing?
</p>

<h2>            Wireless keyboard and mouse not working right since windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    The keyboard works most of the time but lags and the mouse is not working at all. I have read a bunch of these forums and I don't understand how Microsoft has not put out a patch and fixed this problem. It either has to do with the Bluetooth setting, drivers
 or how they suspended USB devices to save energy. This problem is getting really annoying and I also updated my mobo and all windows updates as well. Any help please.&nbsp;

<p>.avi you will need to download the optional media update, you'll be prompted to download it when attempting to play a .avi while connected to LIVE. You'll then been able to stream or play them off a drive (provided it is FAT32) connected to your 360.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>With .mkv you will need Windows 7 and the DIVX codec pack and you'll only be able to Stream the files from your PC.</p>

<p>I would, just convert the Matroska.mkv file, into a .wmv or .avi file &amp; play it on your console.. There is no need to stream it or have your computer on, all the time etc.. Plus, you need atleast DivX to even understand Matroska Codecs etc..
</p>
<p>Just convert it &amp; be done with it...</p>

<p>Well if you want to convert .mkv then I'd recommend <a href="http://xenonmkv.ev98.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
XenonMKV</a>. It takes in the .mkv and spits out a .mp4 file the 360 will play happily.<br />
<br />
I tend to forget that not everyone keeps there PC on 24/7 as I do, so that's why I tend to default to streaming options. If you wanted to do that and aren't running Windows 7 then you could go with a streaming program like PS3 Media Server (despite the name
 it works fine with the 360). This transcodes the video on the fly, which does reduce the quality but it remains quite watchable.<br />
<br />
Nano has me beat on converting a .pdf into a video file. I'm not even sure how that would work to be honest and wouldn't make for a pleasant reading experience.<br />
<br />
Going back to the PC options. If your PC has Vista or Windows 7 with Media Centre then you could use the plug-in which allows you to use a browser, that way you could view the files online. That's not something I've ever tried though.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How can I send sound to multiple output devices &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windows8tabletpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I send  sound to multiple output devices &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Our family want to Skype at a relative in another city (the other party).&nbsp; We only want to have one person in our family speaking (using a headset) to the other party at a time, but we all want to be able to hear the other party speaking (naturally we can
 hear whoever in our own family is speaking as we are all in the same room).&nbsp; </p>
<p>We could redirect all sound to the speakers and have it up loud so the person who is speaking can hear the other party without interference from chatting among our other family members, but then we will get echo issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to be able to have our family members to be able to speak among ourselves when they are not the one speaking to the other party, and to be able to listen to the other party via the PC speakers, without being an interruption to our family member who
 is currently speaking to the other party. So we want to have the speakers quite low and allow our family member who is speaking to hear through the headphones.&nbsp; Think about the situation where the person to is speaking to the other party is hard of hearing
 and needs either headphones or a quiet environment in which to conduct a conversation, while the other members in the family would like to listen into the conversation so they can pick up the conversation where it was left off, when it is their turn to speak,
 but there will be need for the family to discuss things among themselves during the entire Skype call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically we want to have the PC's sound play through both the headset and the speakers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that this is not possible in Windows 7 without third party software utilities. I think that Windows 8 is the same in this regard, but maybe someone has found a solution ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Microsoft staff; </p>
<p>1) I am using Windows 8 Pro, desktop IE 10 and this "Details" text entry window is not warping text correctly, it is showing the horizontal scroll bar and I have to scroll the last few characters of each line in order to read what I have typed.&nbsp; This is
 very annoying.&nbsp; I have a 24" standard monitor and this "Details" text entry window seems to be fixed is size, it does not matter if I make IE full screen or reduce its window.</p>
<p>2) This posting should go under a "Windows 8", "Sound" topic but the topics that I can post under appear to be very limited, so I am posting it under Music, Photos, and Video which is not really applicable, but at least this is where sound fits in.</p>

            It is the same in win 8.&nbsp; You can however see if your sound card can "mix" or "listen to" the mic. If so you can either use 3rd party or an inexpensive cable set up to make it work.&nbsp; Google Mixing &amp; or listen to.<br />

            <p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sad that it is not possible to natively control sound out sources.&nbsp; At this time&nbsp;the computer has&nbsp;no hardware manufacturer specific Windows 8 Drivers, the computer just&nbsp;has the generic "High Definition Audio Device" driver.</p>
<p>The good news is that I have just completed a test/trail for our meeting later today, and have had no echo/feedback using the microphone of our Logitech Wireless headset with PC Speakers for audio output (and turned up quite loud too).&nbsp; I am not sure if
 the Acoustic Echo Cancellation was being performed by Windows 8, Skype, or the Logitech headset's microphone (or by all three), but the result was absolutely clear speech with no echo at all.&nbsp; Thanks to whoever is responsible.</p>

            Should you ever want to pursue this afterwards let us know.&nbsp; I have the same headset and dont need any additional noise cancelling in win 8 doing the same thing.&nbsp; The difference is aI have a sound card with a driver that supports mixing so in skype I can
 combine the mike and the sounds I am listening to for me friend to hear as well with a simple volume control in the mixer.<br />

            What I have discovered is that Skype will allow me to set the "Ring" sound to go through the PC's sound card to which my computer speakers are attached, while having the audio from my chats go through the USB headset.

<p>yeah the only way to gain achievements on that account is games you have not played yet. &nbsp;if you want to ever regain them your ONLY choice is to create a new account and DON'T cheat this time. &nbsp;FYI if you mod a score that has already been reset you will
 get that account perm banned.</p>

 me, so I think the microphone is working fine. the problem is only with Skype. What else can I do to resolve this problem?

<p>
</p><p>Can you try doing an <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA265/how-do-i-test-my-sound-is-working-in-skype-make-an-echo-test-call?q=echo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Echo test call</a> to check if the built-in microphone of your device is working properly with Skype? If you can hear the recorded message then it means that the microphone is working and is recognized by Skype so it might be an issue with the other party.
 If you do not hear your recorded message, check the audio settings of the application and make sure that the microphone listed for use is your built-in microphone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still persist, try to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12073/how-can-i-completely-uninstall-and-then-reinstall-skype-for-mac-os-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
completely uninstall</a> the Skype application from your device and then reinstall it back again. Let me know what happens after by posting back in this thread.

<p>"<span>I am trying to sync three yahoo accounts to my Outlook app on a PC and receive Error Code 0x801901f7 ."</span></p>
<p><span>I was syncing two yahoo accounts yesterday (interestingly enough, also 2/17/2018) on my new cell phone and they would not load.&nbsp; When I came back to my Lenova laptop to see what was up, both accounts that were previously synced and working
 fine showed up in the email App as available,&nbsp; but refused to sync and I received the exact same error code 0x801901f7.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Specifically, my screen said:</span></p>
<p><span>"Something went wrong</span></p>
<p><span>We're sorry, but we weren't able to do that."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I deleted both accounts on my Lenova (Windows 10 Home edition), new cell phone and old cell phone and re-added them several times (powering down and back up in between) to no avail.&nbsp; I searched the internet for information and had no luck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Today (2/18/18) I tried again.&nbsp; My new cell phone has successfully added both accounts and continues to sync successfully.&nbsp; However, the Lenova laptop only added one account that successfully "fetched" my emails, then failed to sync again.&nbsp;
 The other account when added never would "fetch."&nbsp; I've deleted both here again, and will try again tomorrow unless Microsoft can figure out what's going on.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for posting the question!&nbsp; It sounds like this is a bigger issue than one person's specific configuration and hoping there's a fix soon!</span></p>

                    &nbsp;I have two computers, both on Win 10 (with the exact same version) and as best I can tell both with the same settings. When I open the Pictures folder on my HP, there is a 5th tab at the top that says "Manage" with a "Picture Tools" tab above that in
 lime green. This is the location of "slide show" feature. On my ASUS computer this tab doesn't show. There are only the first 4 tabs, File, Home, Share, View but no "Manage" tab. Why not? What setting is different? &nbsp;

</blockquote>
<p>Thank you for the reply! On the HP computer the tab appears when I highlight Any folder in "Pictures", even if it has several layers of sub-folders in it. In other words I can have a slide show that draws from multiple folders. On the ASUS computer, the
 tab only appears when I have reached the last sub-folder and where there are only images and no more sub folders. This limits my slide show to just that one folder. Did I explain that well enough?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Picture" folder structure in both computers is the same but the slide show function with this tab isn't. I'm sure it's just a setting or something simple but I just can't find it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 24/7 Nuk3town playlist was only for the launch weekend. &nbsp;You can still play Nuk3town - it's in rotation in the "Chaos Moshpit" playlist under the Bonus section, or you can select it when playing a custom game.</p>

<p>Hi Alberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on the description that you provided, there are settings that we need to configure to resolve this concern. However, we need to do some troubleshooting steps to isolate the cause of this issue.
 Before we proceed, may we know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried extending your display via Windows Settings?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the error message that you are getting?<span style="font-weight: bold"> Note:</span> Please do not include any personal information.</li></ul>

<p><span>Hi!</span></p>
<p><span>First of all, thanks for you answer. I always use the combination keys FN + F8 to expand my desktop so I think that I’m using Windows settings but not sure… anyway I tried to do it via screen settings and tried to detect another screen without success.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I attach a screenshoot of the error message, is it in spanish but is saying “PC can’t proyect in another screen. Try to reinstal the driver or use another video car”.</span></p>
<span>I attach you another screenshoot with the screen settings, you will see that I even can’t change the resolution of the screen.</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks again. I will waiting for your answer.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Previously you said "<em>have a nvidea geforce 920mx with the drivers reinstalled aswell so I try to reinstalled and upgrade it from the nvidea web page</em>" so I thought you would know how to get back to those.&nbsp; Is that what gave you the choice of the
 Basic adapter and its driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW all I know for sure is that your next steps could be to click on that Properties button (which requires administrator authority to access), then click on the Driver tab and choose one of the options on it.&nbsp; You can find various descriptions of procedures
 which use all of them.&nbsp; I don't want to choose any particular one for you but obviously
<em>Disable Device</em> would not be helpful in this case.&nbsp; However, I will mention that one that seems to give the most user control next would be
<em>Update driver</em> and then use the <em>Browse my computer</em>... one.</p>

    <title>Multiple different BSOD when trying to play games. Updating drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple different BSOD when trying to play games. Updating drivers doesn&#39;t seem to help</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<strong>Summary:</strong></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Over the past three weeks I've been trying to play Civilizations 6 and Endless Legends that I downloaded from Steam. They repeatedly crash to desktop or blue screen of death</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- 50% of the time it just crashes to desktop, 50% results in BSOD and restarts</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- The BSODs vary; I think I've seen at least 4-6 different ones (see my dropbox folder below for WhoCrash report, System Info export, and raw dump files)</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- Crashes happen anywhere from 2-60 minutes into gaming</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- My PC is a machine a friend built and setup for me. Windows 10, ASRock Z170 Extreme7+, GTX 1080, Intel i7-6700K, 16GB RAM</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- The Windows Memory Diagnostic says I have a memory problem (screenshot:&nbsp;<a href="https://cl.ly/2i260p0K300Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cl.ly/</a>)</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- This started happening roughly the same time as I tried to install a large Windows 10 update and it failed half-way through. I resumed it after restarting and it says its up-to-date now. I don't think I was playing the games beforehand, though, so I can't
 tell if it's an issue or not</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- I've checked that Windows 10 is updated many times over the past few weeks. Oddly, it has always said it's up to date except once when it said "There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later" error code: 0x8024402f" (screenshot:&nbsp;<a href="https://cl.ly/432n2k2Y2a2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cl.ly/</a>)&nbsp;but
 it's never said that again</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- Went through every component in Device Manager and had it look for a driver update (Update driver software -&gt; Search automatically -&gt; Apply)</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- Started making sure to launch EVGA Precision X OC before gaming. I wasn't paying attention to it before, so assume it was just doing default behavior (or whatever my friend who built the PC set it to).&nbsp;Wasn't sure if it the problem might be overheating, so
 adjusted the fan curve upwards (screenshots:&nbsp;<a href="https://cl.ly/2y0e3l1X0G3C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cl.ly/2y0e3l1X0G3C</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://cl.ly/2d3y3t230S1k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cl.ly/2d3y3t230S1k</a>)
 and set it to open on bootup. Doesn't seem to have had an effect. I don't believe I'm doing any overclocking</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<div>- Lowering game settings from ultra high to medium-ish had no impact</div>
<div>
<div>- Ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic on two different days and it said both times I have a memory problem (screenshot:&nbsp;<a href="https://cl.ly/2i260p0K300Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cl.ly/</a>)</div>
<div>- Ran the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool twice, two weeks apart. The first time it passed everything, and the second time (today) it passed for everything except the CPU Frequency test (screenshot:&nbsp;<a href="https://cl.ly/2522331G3g1y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://cl.ly/</a>).
 A comment from another user with a i7-6700 suggests it might be a bug:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2953900/intel-processor-diagnostic-tool-cpu-frequency-fail.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.c</a></div>
</div>
<div>- Turned on Driver Verifier to see if that would help but didn't get any more info so turned it off today</div>
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
- When none of the above had an effect, I downloaded Driver Easy today and had it install 12 updates. The main two it caught seemed to be an Nvidia update and an audio driver</div>
