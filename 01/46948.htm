<p>Hi Adriano,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear that you're having trouble launching Forza Horizon 4 today. As our Ambassador previously stated, the issue you were having may be part of a larger issue experienced by others and may
 be for a limited time, like an <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live service alert</a> for your region. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also attempt to get the system to recognized your ownership of the game by
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
removing your profile from your Xbox</a>, then perform a physical power cycle on the console and once it restarts, finally re-add your profile to the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a physical power cycle to your console and power supply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>
Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds.
<p><strong>Important</strong> Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.
</p>
</li><li>
Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>
Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on your console to turn on the Xbox One. </li></ol>
<p>Go ahead and give this a try to see if it alleviates the issue and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>I hope this helps out!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Mouse Settings Reset in Windows 10</h2>
                    I am in Windows 10. I changed my Synaptics Mousepad settings to how I wanted, but every time that I restart my laptop the settings reset. It's pretty annoying that I have to go in and change them every time, rather than it just keeping track or setting
 as default. &nbsp;I made the settings into a Clickpad Profile on the Synaptics window, so that I don't have to re-click everything again and again. However it is pretty tedious still having to do that. What can I do, if anything, to have the settings remain set,
 even after a computer restart?

<strong>Step 3: </strong><strong>Clean Boot.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
 You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform
 a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>

            Hey there, thanks for the reply! Although unfortunately, it seems that either you are, hopefully, just a bot simply following a coded procedure by replying aimlessly to new forum posts, or you are a real employee, and have seemed to do the very minimum
 by failing to read my problem, and giving me an unhelpful answer. If you would have read my issue, you would have known that it is talking about the included touch mousepad, AKA Synaptics, and not a third-party plugged-in mouse. Therefore I either would've
 gotten a useful answer out of a Microsoft employee that's getting paid probably close to 5 times as much as I am by doing literally nothing at their computer desk, or if there is no solution, at least wouldn't have wasted my time by having to read your BS
 and then type this up. Please someone real reply with a real answer. Thank you.

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the </span>Synaptics software from the Add or Remove Program list. In addition to that also try the below steps and check if it helps to rectify any faults in the configuration/ system files.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disable-Enable the device</span></span></li></ul>
<p>a. Press Windows <strong>key + X </strong>and click on <strong>Control Panel.</strong><br />
b. Click on <strong>Mouse. <br />
</strong></p>
<div>
<p>c. On the Device Settings tab of the Mouse Properties screen, click the <strong>
Disable </strong>button to turn off the <strong>Touchpad</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Restart the system and enable.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Uninstall the&nbsp;drivers from Device Manager</span></li></ul>

<p><span>d. Restart the computer, if prompted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: Drivers should get installed after restarting the computer. If it does not, you would have to install the latest driver from manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<h2>            Clave Dark Souls&#58; Prepare to Die Edition</h2>
                    
<p>Buenas,</p>
<p>Hace poco compré el juego Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition en formato físico. He introducido la clave en steam y me ha añadido el juego a mi biblioteca. El problema radica en que al entrar en el juego y poner la clave para Games for Windows - Live, me
 dice que la clave ya está vinculada a otra cuenta. ¿Cómo es posible?</p>
<p>Me gustaría poder solucionarlo lo antes posible, ya que solo puedo jugar de forma online y he pagado por un producto que lo incluía.</p>
<p>Ya he intentado canjear el código (por si acaso) y no me lo reconoce.</p>
<p>Espero que me puedan ayudar.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not seem to recognize gamepad&#47;game controller &#40;Fang&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to install an USB gamepad/controller (Fang by Ideazon/Steelseries) and getting Windows 7 x64 to recognize it as such.&nbsp; I connected the gamepad to my laptop, and then I ran the Windows 7 x64 drivers software that I just downloaded from the maker's
 website (i.e. http://www.steelseries.com/download).&nbsp; Everything seemed to be in order.&nbsp; After the installation process, there's a green-lit ZEngine icon in my system tray, and key presses on the game pad are recognized keystrokes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is that I don't seem to have a recognized "gamepad" or "game controller" (I'm trying to play a PC game that requires one to be hooked up).&nbsp; Under Hardware and Sound &gt; Devices and Printers, I see it listed as "ZBoard USB Gaming Device" and looking
 under General properties, it's category is Keyboard (under Hardware, the device drivers are of type Keyboards, or Human Interface Devices..).&nbsp; When I open the "Game Controllers" settings menu, there are none listed.&nbsp; When I open up Steam and look under System
 Information, it lists "Game Controller: None detected".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this made sense.&nbsp; I'd just like the gamepad to start being recognized as such.&nbsp; I think this is a pretty mainstream gamepad, so I don't know if there's something I did wrong.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>When I did chat support he told me that my key is only good for upgrading windows from 7 to 10 so without the original&nbsp;7 key (which I don't have) I'm out of luck but if I could get a 7 key I could upgrade.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>When I called on the phone they told me I needed to buy windows 10 and upgrading wouldn't work.</span></span></p>

<p>If you have already upgraded a machine from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (during the free upgrade period July 2015 to July 2016)&nbsp; there is a good chance you cannot use the same key to install on a new machine. The digital licence you received on the first machine
 is tied to the first machine and cannot be transferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm the type of licence (OEM or retail) and if you are trying to use this licence for the first time or if it was previously used to upgrade to Windows 10 on another machine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;product key is usually located on the COA sticker attached to the bottom of your laptop or in the battery compartment. In some rare cases it can also be found in the memory compartment. For tower systems, look at the top or the side of the system
 unit.&nbsp;It looks like the following:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker is damaged or letters or not legible, you will have to consider the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Use a digital camera to capture a picture of the COA then enlarge it on your computer.</li></ul>

                    <p>When I enlarge the photos from my files to view them and click the arrows to change them the photos quite literally move or scroll across the screen to bring the next photo into view. As a photographer I am prone to analyzing many photos in a sequence and

<p>Being on skype, you need to hit CTRL+F, or just click on the search input field on the left side above your contacts list.
</p>
<p>That will land you on the general search functionality of skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type your intended text there, then hit enter. Then below the searching input field you'll see "Results" section that has on the right side a selector (by default is selected "Best match"). Click on that one and select "Messages".&nbsp; Then if you got a valid
 result for your search you can filter down the result by choosing "All vs Current" from the right side of the "Messages" canvas.&nbsp; "All" refers to all your messages, and "Current" refers to the currently opened conversation.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The Update may have been incidental to the problem however you can check that by removing<br />
the update. (If it was a driver update then it quite likely is the problem.)<br />
<br />
Set Updates to NOT Download automatically - Control Panel - Windows Updates - on left side<br />
change Settings - tick Check for updates but let me chose whether to download&nbsp; - OK - you<br />
can change it back to Automatic later. Or you can Right Click and HIDE it - then if needed you<br />
can unHIDE it to install.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates - lower left Installed Updates - Uninstall or Change<br />
<br />
Or <br />
<br />
Remove an update<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-us/help/182043da-fc3e-4220-afbc-d9b09f2b2a1a1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-us/help/182043da-fc3e-4220-afbc-d9b09f2b2a1a1033.mspx</span></a><br />

<p>That could be drivers&nbsp;although antivirus/antispyware/security programs and other hardware<br />
are also probable causes. Updating the major drivers and BIOS&nbsp;would be the best plan of<br />
attack. If needed also try uninstalling your antivirus/security as a test.<br />

<br />
Run the Driver Verifier to see if that determines the cause (good idea to update BIOS and all major<br />
drivers so see the next section for those methods).<br />

<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>How to find phantom user account to delete it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edbattle  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to find phantom user account to delete it</h2>
                    <p>When I turn on the PC every day, the W10 login screen defaults to a 'phantom'&nbsp;login with the correct user name, but lacking a usable password option. Whatever password it wants, I don't have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then click on a second option which is the same correct user name, but is actually my MS account, with my Outlook.com email address, password and PIN. I can then proceed to login. It's my correct Administrator account with all related information running
 perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find the alternate 'phantom' user account that the computer initially defaults to every day, and which doesn't work. When I search for it, the 'phantom' account&nbsp;doesn't pop up as a Guest or Administrator account under User Accounts, so I can't remove
 it. It's in there somewhere, but how to find it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>A fix would be gratefully appreciated, as it adds unnecessary steps every time I logon to my computer.</p>

    <title>Mail App will not sync with Gmail account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail App will not sync with Gmail account</h2>
                    Yesterday setup my Windows 8 upgrade on my HP laptop that was running Windows 7. Initially it worked well.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This morning I tried to send an email that had 3 pictures attached. Since that point, I cannot get the mail app to send any messages and it will not sync with Gmail. Sent items just pile up in the outbox. I've tried adjusting the account settings to update
 every 15 minutes and even manually. But when I try to sync, it just says "syncing" in the upper right and never completes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Surface Book 2&#58; Rubber strips</h2>
                    There are two narrow rubber strips on the underside of the case to provide slip resistance. Both are brittle and come loose. How can I get a replacement? Microsoft Support: Buy a new case! For a part that doesn't cost 50 cents. Who knows advice?

            Thank you very much for your kind answer and your help. Unfortunately I live in Switzerland. Telephone support from Microsoft offered me the only solution to buy a new case for $600. Unfortunately there are no Microsoft stores in Europe. So I hoped someone
 could send me two rubber strips like that.

<h2>            recurrent unexpected shutdown&#58;of Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7&nbsp; unexpectedly shuts down, shortly after&nbsp;startup, sometimes three times a day, sometimes once&nbsp;in 4 days, if it runs for 5 mins. it will not shut down untill at least the next startup !&nbsp;, has been doing this since installation ( about a mont ago
 ), the last bugcheck message from the action centre reads: </p>
<p>Problem: Windows Stopped working&nbsp; 24/07/2011 5:06pm</p>
<p>Description<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x0000008e (0xc0000046, 0x83488990, 0xb47a71d8, 0x00000000). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 072411-26676-01.</p>
<p>Windows shut down unexpectedly&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24/07/2011 5:07pm</p>
<p>I have since turned off the error monitoring to see if this makes any difference ( have done this out of sheer frustration !&nbsp;), have already tried disabling various non critical startup entries, am using the latest manufacturer drivers for windows 7.</p>
<p>I have windows XP installed on another hard drive ( dual boot ), no problems, so does not seem to be hardware related.</p>
<p>System Hardware incudes: Gigabyte GA-870A-UD3 mainboard, AMD Phenom II&nbsp;x6 1055T 2.8GHz Processor, 4Gb Kingston, or Corsair.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may be preferable to use the one from Leadtek but the one offered by Windows Update may&nbsp;be the same as a basic driver from Leadtek.</p>
<p>If you don't install the WinFast PVR2 software then the ULCDRHlp.sys should not get active.</p>

    <title>So confused about how Family Plan going away will affect us&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tolliosaurus  say:</h3>
<h2>            So confused about how Family Plan going away will affect us&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have spent over an hour and a half trying to read other threads to get a clear answer, but now I need to get on with my day - a 90 minute effort is too much. My apologies if a clear answer exists somewhere in this forum; but obviously it's not&nbsp;very easy
 to find.</p>
<p>We only have 1 Xbox&nbsp;360 console. We do not have multiple boxes in our home like most of the other gamers posting on this topic. There are 5 of us in our family. Back in 2010, we created a Family Account that my husband or I would use and three individual
 accounts for our children to play online with their friends and have the ability to have their own statistics, gamertags, etc.</p>
<p>The Family Plan at $99 made it possible for us to enjoy Xbox - as we could never afford to purchase a $60 Gold membership for each gamer. Now they have taken that away. (...and btw, I never did get an email ALL YEAR about this! - and yes my email is the
 main account holder's email AND my Microsoft Account's email login - but NO email came to tell me this was going to happen.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot for the life of me figure out if this now means I have to purchase $240 worth of Gold memberships for my kids to continue to play as they always have. We are not financially in a position to upgrade to the new Xbox One, so that creates a problem....I
 think....because I'm also not clear on how an Xbox One would allow our family to not have to pay for 4 separate memberships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need a clear answer to my questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>If we have only a single XBOX 360 console, will we have to pay 4 x $60 for my children to continue with their present gaming privileges?<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; </li><li>What happens to their accounts,&nbsp;gamertags and all of their data, progress, etc. when their individual Gold Live expires in April of 2014, but our main parent account is still active on our Xbox 360?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Since we are not in a position to pay $500 or a new Xbox One console, it's truly not a realistic option for us. But I do need to understand things in relation to the Xbox One for future options. I can't find out how an Xbox&nbsp;Live Free membership differs from
 an Xbox Live Gold membership. There is no easy, clear way to get that answered on Xbox.com - they compare ONLY a 360 Gold account with a One Gold account and do not provide the "COMPLETE" details of what a free account cannot do that a gold account can so
 that I can make an educated decision.<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>What is the difference between a free account and a gold account on the 360? </li><li>what is the difference between a free account and a gold account on the Xbox One?
</li><li>How does a free account on an Xbox One console (connected to a different paid gold membership) differ from an individual 360 Gold account?<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>If we have only a single Xbox One console - and do not keep the 360 console (would have to sell it to buy the One) - what would I need to do to our memberships, before they expire in April of 2014, so that all three of my children can continue without a
 break to their privileges on the Xbox One? </li></ol>
<ol>
<li>Do we just renew the main Parent Account at the Live Gold price and then let our children's memberships default back to Free?&nbsp;
</li><li>If so - how will that impact what they can do on the Xbox One console versus what they can presently do on the 360 with their own Gold memberships?
</li></ol>
<p>Please understand when you answer that while many of you will just want to tell us to do option #6, it's the easiest, it truly is not within our means right now and won't be until at least next summer at the soonest. My kids' Gold memberships expire before
 then and they will only have the 360.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>1. As of right now yes, you'd have to pay for all 4 on the 360.</p>
<p>2. Everything should stay the same, the only thing that will change is the fact that they won't be able to play online and won't be able to access things like Netflix.</p>
<p>3. Answered in question 2</p>
<p>4. Same as on the 360</p>
<p>5. Well, I'm not positive on this but I heard you only need one account on the Xbox One and then all the other accounts could access xbox Live.</p>
<p>6. Well on the xbox one there are these family settings, I'm not entirely sure how it works but I think as long as the adult account in the family has gold, all the sub accounts will have gold. So basically if you add all of your kids' accounts to the family
 and have your account as the parent account and you renew gold on it they should all have gold.</p>
<p>Not all of that may be entirely accurate ^^</p>

<p>Thank you B4RevenantGamer.</p>
<p>I did read all the help pages - every single one of them - for both Xbox 360 and Xbox One. However, I had not seen the "add-family-member" under Xbox One - so thanks for that link!</p>
<p>It looks like a phone call to customer support is the only way to get positive answers to a couple of these. I don't like that a family on a single Xbox 360 is now screwed - ROYALLY!!! &nbsp;Any way you look at it, my kids are going to be VERY hurt come April
 2014. It is a very mean thing for Microsoft to have done to us, and I will NOT forget this. It deeply hurts families who are financially hurting and not as fortunate as others to force them to pay a lot more money for what they have had all along - 4x more
 to be exact. And the alternative is 2x more expensive than that!!! Does Microsoft truly believe most of America is wealthy???? Last I checked, they are NOT!</p>
<p>Microsoft: &nbsp;You have sealed a decision in my mind that I have been grappling with this past year. &nbsp;I may not be able to completely cancel and change to Playstation or some other platform, because all of my kids' friends are on Xbox, but I CAN refuse to ever
 purchase or use another Microsoft product again - primarily your PC operating systems and software. I am now done with this company from every other angle and as soon as my kids no longer need Xbox, I am done with that too. You have permanently lost all of
 my business. I believe you to be mean, selfish and not family friendly. I do not support companies like that.</p>

<p>I agree completely. I can't believe Microsoft thinks its reasonable that every family member sharing the same Xbox should have to buy gold on each account. Reminds me why I like Sony so much more. They don't look for every possible avenue to rip you off.
 Microsoft I am incredibly disappointed I ever bothered to do business with you. From now on ill stick to PlayStation.</p>

<p>Yes, Microsoft products will be banned in my house forever also. I've been loyal for as long as I can remember. So much for that! We will purchase a PlayStation, and goodbye to Microsoft! I understand that my actions alone won't matter to them in the big
 picture, but that's OK, I'm fine with &nbsp;that! They can have everybody else's money, not mine. I'm upset that I paid $60 to renew my Gold membership, THEN I find out that my family also has to pay! &nbsp;I am considering just pitching them in the garbage to make
 sure that no purchases are made from these Consol's ever again. As far as my kids having all their friends on Xbox....they'll be OK. This is not a good reason to support this company.

<p>On the 360 all gamertags (avatars,users) need their own gold for online game play. 1,3,or 12 month options. on the One only one gamertag needs a membership and then up to nine additional family members will get free Gold on the console, only on that console.
 The difference between a silver (free) gamertag and a gold (paid) membership is that the gold member can use the online features on the console, so a silver free account is still able to play games that have offline modes which most do. I would use the free
 silver on your accounts for a while and see how it suits the family, take that no cost time to save some funds, I recommend the One as an investment in the future, Three kids using the kinect feature is well worth a video for the memory's. One is the future
 and even worth the wait while saving up the funds. You are welcome to message me direct for any further confusion you may have.</p>

<p>Another consideration, the paid gold account will be able to use that paid membership on either console, even both consoles at the same time. So really a single paid membership is valid as a single on the 360 and can have a family of 10 at the same time
 on the One, all for the single cost of one membership, I have both consoles. I dont see reason to drop my 360 yet and game on both systems every day.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You are posting in the Vista Forums even though you mention Windows 7 so it would<br />
be best, in the future, to post in the correct forum.<br />
<br />
Answers - Windows Forums<br />

=================================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can<br />
download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<h2>            Error code in Windows 8.1 os, occurs spontaneously,</h2>
                    <p>I am getting an error code 0xa 0000001 which has occurred perhaps half a dozen times spontaneously. The blue screen has a sad face, says it is an unexpected problem, is collecting information, counts down till it has 100% of what it needs then shuts down
 and reboots without incident.&nbsp; I read one response that had to do with a mini dump file and I did find several of those in my windows files. There was one for today exactly when this happened, but I cannot open the dmp file and don't know what to do with it.</p>
<p>I do graphics work so often have applications open when this happens- and it slams them shut, so it's very annoying.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I saw a reference to AMD card, drivers? I do my windows updates manually. Do I need to do a driver update perhaps?</p>
<p>Would appreciate some guidance. </p>

<p>Hello Cindy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are correct. Since you manually update your operating system, you need to update your drivers as well. We suggest setting your computer to automatically update your drivers. To do so, kindly follow the workaround from the article
<strong>Download and install drivers in Windows 8.1 </strong>on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15046/windows-8-download-install-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Hi Ernie,</p>
<p>Ok, I was able to find the device manager and the AMD driver tab.&nbsp; After I clicked on update driver, it came back and told me that Windows determines I have the latest driver already.&nbsp; So pray tell, where do I go from here?&nbsp; I am a little hesitant to let
 windows do ANY automatic updates. A couple of computers ago (and quite a few years) I ended up spending several hours one week with Microsoft advanced technical support who fixed the many problems going on, which they said were from automatic updates installing,
 causing some file corruption or something. It's way above my head. That guy said to always do the windows updates manually, one at a time to avoid a repeat of that problem. I have diligently followed his advice-for the past 10 years?</p>
<p>I appreciate your input here, please let me know if there is anything else to address with this error message. Thanks cindy</p>
<p>PS, I will go to the link you have in your response and see if it will install a driver for something else. Thanks~ cindy</p>

<p>Hi again Ernie,</p>
<p>OK, so I went back to the device manager and checked the drivers for every item there (and there were MANY).&nbsp; The only one that it found an update for was Qualcomm Atheros Wireless Network Adapter, and it downloaded and installed that, then put me right
 back on the internet. Could that have caused my previous described problem?</p>
<p>The other thing of note is, there were several things in the Device Manager list that said there was not a driver installed. Then when I clicked on the events tab it said the driver was configured, some said driver name: machine inf, and several of them
 had the same date: 1/16/2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly enough, when I still clicked on update driver for the ones that said they did not have a driver installed, then I still got the statement after it looked online for an update that Windows determined the driver
 had up to date software.&nbsp; ???</p>
<p>Here are the things that behaved in this way:</p>
<p>Direct memory access controller</p>
<p>High precision event timer</p>
<p>Numeric data processor</p>
<p>Programmable interrupt controller properties</p>
<p>System speaker properties</p>
<p>System timer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't have any idea if any of that is significant to you, just wanted to give you all the puzzle pieces.&nbsp; This is all way over my head :)&nbsp; Thanks again for your input~ cindy</p>

<p>We appreciate your spontaneous reply. The main cause of error 0xa0000001 of Windows 8 is related to the Device Manager. It's usually started when you manually update your Windows version and then unable to update the software from your Device Manager. If
 you are using an old version of driver on your computer, it may be not compatible with your Operating System. The best way to resolve the issue is to update all of your drivers to ensure it's compatible with your Windows version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to the list of drivers that having an issue from your Device Manager, we recommend running
<br />
<strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong>. This will check the latest version of drivers on your computer or if there's any missing updates on your computer. To do so, follow the steps on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Kindly download and run the troubleshooter for Windows 7 and Windows 8 on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers that you are having an issue. Kindly follow the troubleshooting steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Click the driver that you are having an issue.</li><li>Right-click and then select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Driver</strong> &gt; <strong>Uninstall</strong> &gt; <strong>OK</strong>. (The process will be the same when installing the driver back, instead of showing uninstall it will be changed to
<strong>Install</strong>). Here's the sample screenshot below: <br />
