<h2>            Toshiba Satellite C55 Freezes&#47;Unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just today I installed windows 10 to my laptop and after getting home from work I opened it and it at first was unresponsive on my desktop and then turned black a minute later. I tried all the usual steps to see if it was just slowly running, but it was
 unresponsive. I tried a hard reset but all it did was load up to the screen where I login to the laptop but freeze there and then turn black. The time would still change but my mouse, keys, etc did not do anything. I really need my laptop to work since I just
 started school and if I could even find a way to set it back 24 hours before I installed 10 would be helpful. At this point 10 is unappealing until the all clear is given.</p>

            So with that link I followed the directions for getting into safe mode (via black screen before login advice) and my computer got as far as the automatic repair screen. Problem is that it is still unresponsive and won't let me click or navigate with my
 keys.&nbsp;

            Hi,

This error is usually aroused by some unknown fault happening to system, which could be hardware or software problem

<p style="color: rgba(43, 43, 156, 1)">What causes this Windows Error?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">There might be various reasons for getting the error on Windows-based computer, and this part only lists several common causes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer is not able to process certain files or settings required by Windows installation CDs. The installation disk might be damaged or has incorrect permission.</li><li>The application can't locate required files to finish the process, which can be due to errors in registry settings or essential registry files are corrupted or missing.</li><li>Deleted files remain on computer, but system is unable to read them, or computer user try to delete or move certain files stored on a specific folder, which is not allowed by system.</li><li>The built-in SATA driver are incorrectly recognized during the installation process, for instance, BOIS on your computer is set with RAID Aotudetect/AHCI.</li><li>Computer infects virus or malware which may block any operations to your PC. It's known to all that whenever you check email, browse webpages, download files, install software, etc. your computer is likely to be exposed to virus, spyware, adware, etc. Once
 virus gets into your computer, it may steal your information, erase files, attack system files, etc.</li></ul>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(43, 43, 156, 1)">How to tackle the issue?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 1: Preventive solution</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">The error might be given rise because of reasons such as corrupted ISO file, faulty CD/DVD drive (e.g. writing process is flowed), corrupted USB drive, overlocked system, etc. Thus you can try a new USB drive
 with latest ISO file. If you prefer to CD, then install Windows with a CD which is burned with a copy of Windows and MS products together with legitimate license key. It's suggested to burn data to CDs at quite low speed, because the faster the write speed,
 the more likely to meet errors during the process.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Besides, the disc you select to burn data should be in good quality, low-quality or older discs tend to be more buggy. A damaged disc can cause many problem including prevent normal read or write operations.
 If the operating system ISO is burned to a disc which has quality problem, for example, scratches, not only 0x80070570 error but also other Windows errors won't be avoided.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 2: Retry Windows installation</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">If the CD or USB drive used to install system are out of problem, you can retry the installation. It'll be better to use latest ISO and update BIOS to the latest version. Before starting the process, please
 move all unnecessary hardware from computer such as Network cards, printer, Microphone, external disk drives, etc. in order to prevent errors caused by hardware conflicts and incompatibility.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Click Install Now button placed on the installation wizard and it'll start to install Windows. If you still get the error before the process is done, click cancel installation. Once the installation wizard
 attempts to roll back installation, click Install Now again. Computer will run the installation again without rebooting.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 3: Run chkdsk in Windows RE</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">To try this method, you need to restart computer and boot with installation disc. The following part is step-by-step guide:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Put the installation disc to computer optical drive and restart computer. If you are prompted to press certain key to run Windows from installation, then press it.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose appropriate language settings. Next, select "Repair my computer" option is the disc being used is not a system repair disc.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Select the installation that needs repairing and click "Next", after which the menu will show "System Recovery Option".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Click "System Recovery Option" two times to open "Command Prompt" where you should type chkdsk/f/r and press Enter. Wait for a while until the disk check process completes and select Y
 to restart computer.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 4: Change BIOS settings</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">In a small number of cases, the error is caused by improper settings in BIOS, which is not difficult to change these settings.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Boot computer into BIOS. When computer is booting to system, you can see prompt information on screen, which tells you can enter BIOS by pressing certain key from keyboard, such as F2.
 Different computer may require different key to enter BIOS, please read information carefully and press correct key.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to Drives option and select SATA option. Change "RAID Auto detect-AHCI" to "RAID Auto detect-ATA" and save changes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Exit BIOS and try installing Windows again.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 5: Clean registry</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Registry is the very place that stores settings, options, entries for hardware, software and files, and it makes sure system run normally. Thus if these files get damaged or corrupted, system registry won't
 be able to work smoothly. Moreover, registry consists of some unwanted files or leftover software entries which can also prevent system from smoothly working. Once something goes wrong, not only 0x80070570 occurs, but also other errors will appear.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">To cast off the error you need to try cleaning system registry which is actually one of the most common solutions recommended by technicians. Cleaning of the registry can be done manually as well as by some
 third-party tools. There are quite a few such programs that can clean registry easily. Manual cleaning can be a little complex to those who possess inadequate computer knowledge, for it involves many professional operations. If you want to give it a shot on
 your own, be sure to make a backup for existing registry before making changes in Registry Editor.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">A while ago, Microsoft released a cumulative update for Windows 10, but a few users couldn't complete the updates and met error "Some update files are missing or have problems. We'll try to download the update
 again later. Error code: (0x80070570)".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Many users have no idea what does the problem mean or how to fix it. So far, Microsoft has not yet provided an effective solution, thus users have to fix it on their own. Since this update is a cumulative one,
 it contains bug fixes and performance improvement for system, all Windows 10 users should install these updates.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">If the update error happens to your computer as well, you can try the following method to repair it, which only requires a few clicks of mouse button.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 1</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to My Computer and open C drive. Next navigate the following path: C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 2</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a great number of folders in Download folder where you should look for a folder named "a39ba752a8aa7203217c758502d7fddd".</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 3</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Delete this folder. To delete the folder you should log in computer with administrator account.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)"><span>Step 4</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart computer and launch Windows Update to retry installing available updates.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">When you delete a file or folder off computer or copy files to USB drive, you may get the error message: "Error 0x80070570: The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable". This error blocks you from fulfilling
 many tasks. This error is usually aroused by some unknown fault happening to system, which could be hardware or software problem. This issue should be tackled as soon as possible before it brings more serious problems.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 1: Scan virus.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">If you failed to delete files from computer and encounter the error, system setting must have been changed by virus or malware which is known to steal information, remove files, modify system settings, damage
<p style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">To scan and remove virus, you can enable Firewall or install other anti-virus programs. If you have had them installed in your PC, you should update them to the latest version and enable the real-time protection.</p>
<br />
<p style="color: rgba(254, 1, 172, 1)">Method 2: Check drivers and install driver updates.</p>

<h2>            New XBOX 1S won&#39;t update right out of the box</h2>
                    Have a brand new XBOX 1S and no matter what we've tried, it will not update. We've tried it wirelessly as well as through a USB flash drive multiple times.&nbsp; XBOX support says it might be due to an XBOX live outage, but the home page doesn't say that problems
 with Live should affect updates.&nbsp; I'm ready to send this thing back.&nbsp; Any help?

<p>Carrie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it happened to 2 different Xboxes it has nothing to do with the console. Your console is needs several settings from your router that a lot of items in your house don't use. If one of these settings is not being detected by your Xbox it could be a variety
 of issues from Wireless interference to a simple reboot of your router for 5 min. I'm including a link with several solutions you can use to help you figure it out.

    <title>Not printing in colour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sylviapowers1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not printing in colour</h2>
                    <p>My 2 months old HP laptop will not print in colour to my HP Envy4527 wireless printer. &nbsp; When I had a Lenova laptop previously it printed colour perfectly well to this printer. &nbsp; The printer does a copy of a colour picture perfectly and I have the proper
 HP print cartridges installed just 2 weeks ago. &nbsp; So it is not the printer which is at fault but the operating system of Windows 10 to blame. &nbsp; I have spent hours trying everything I know, and what others have recommended to try, even going back to the technology
 chaps at John Lewis where laptop was purchased. &nbsp; But no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what can Microsoft offer in the way of advice and help ?</p>

            Hi Sylvia.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Printer troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Type Prnters in Start Search, open Printers and Scanners, choose Printer, then Manage, then Printer Properties.  Check all tabs that Grayscale is not chosen.
<br />
<br />If this fails Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.       
        </p>

<p>I tried every setting available, my conclusion is that buying a Kinect for the purpose of streaming is not a sound investment. No matter what I do to correct the situation, either game sound or my voice is silenced, I simply cannot use Kinect on it's own
 to stream on Twitch. Is there an app that could balance this, because the sound mixer in the xbox settings did not do any improvement. Wish Kinect streaming was not just a scam to sell the sensor, but this is the most likely reasoning now.</p>

<p>The only way I found so far is HORRIBLE... Cranking the TV sound so high the faulty kinect sensor has no choice to hear it, but it makes game sounds "watery" and quite feed-backy.</p>

            i had the same problem I tried the little thing that avg had to remove it but it didn't work but I managed to remove it at the by uninstall not remove it by registry. what I did (Firefox) was enable it and restart to have it work then I clicked on the
 down arrow on avg at the left side, it'll give you&nbsp;junk about rate, this and that. at the bottom or so, it should say remove or hide: click it then a window open to say to 'hide and disable it (recommended)' or 'uninstall'. click uninstall and restart. you
 may get a open browser saying 'sorry to see you leave'. by startup of firefox it should be gone. it worked for me when AVG was clueless about it. I hope it works for you

<h2>            Windows Defender System Tray Icon</h2>
                    <p>Currently, I have the Windows Defender System Tray icon with an exclamation point on it ---</p>
<p>When I open the program to see what actions are needed, there are none to be acted upon ---</p>
<p>So I should get the green checkmark when I restart, but still, the exclamation point is still there ---</p>
<p>Is there any way I can reset the parameters to default and get the green check mark back, as it was there before ---</p>
<p>I am currently using Avast Software, which is protecting my system as a firewall, and maybe this problem is being blocked by this?</p>
<p>Just a little problem which was not a problem before, even when Avast was installed, I still got a green checkmark ---</p>
<p>Any response would be appreciated in this matter ---&nbsp; Thank You, JK</p>

            Hi JeffreyKeegan1 ... yes you are correct in assuming Avast is causing issues.
<br />Defender does not work with other solutions.
<br />I would disable it fully.
<br />To do that go to search and type services.msc and open it.
<br />Go to Windows Firewall and double click it to open it.
<br />Select it to stop it and then set it to disabled.
<br />If that still does not work then follow the suggestions in the link to disable via registry.

            Windows defender is part of the OS &amp; should be run at&nbsp; least once a week.Windows update keeps its version up to date,but to reset/fix,open control panel/open defender/go to Help tab.select check for updates,then run a quick scan...Also,defender &amp; youre
 anti virus &amp; others need internet access,open firewall/exceptions/edit...One can/could stop defender in OSservices by opening cmd/in cmd type: services.msc&nbsp; in msc scroll to the service,double click,set to disable or manual start,exit when thru,restart pc...

            <p>Having the same problem....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the USB device works on every other Windows 10 machine I've tried.</p>
<p>Yes, it used to work on this machine... that is until I selected "safely eject this device"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever I insert it asks to "Please insert a disk into [drive letter]". &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling the device, uninstalling all the USB hubs, USB device scrubbers, Updating USB drivers, hubs, resetting the hubs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who would think that "safely" ejecting a device would break it!!! &nbsp;To add insult on to injury my device is a USB 2.0 device and the port is a USB 3.0 port. &nbsp; Windows troubleshoot reports the problem is because its a USB 2.0 device and to try a USB 2.0 port.
 &nbsp; Hello, already tired that and the USB 3.0 driver is backwards capable no to mention it was working! &nbsp;Thanks for nothing!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry extremely frustrated right now!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like windows has cached something about this device incorrectly and I can't seem to clear that cache. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>ReadyBoost and TaskManager&#39;s Memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vylyntyne  say:</h3>
<h2>            ReadyBoost and TaskManager&#39;s Memory</h2>
                    I recently learnt about ReadyBoost to help boost the RAM on my netbook. The poor thing only has 1 GB of RAM. I first used a 2 GB SD card to boost the RAM, and not noticing any improvement, I added an extra 8 GB as a USB stick. But, the netbook still starts
 to malfunction if I try to use more than three programs at once. I checked the TaskManager and it tells me that the computer only has 1 GB of memory. I am not sure if Task Manager has missed the memo, or why exactly ReadyBoost doesn't seem to be working. Any
 help would be much appreciated.

            <p>Windows 7 Starter can only run three programs at any one time. It is in the 'design' of the Starter edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want more, you can use the option of the Windows Anytime upgrade.. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.. but, you will need to replace the 1gb RAM with a 2gb Module, so it could work out to be $$$..

            Thanks, I read about Starter only allowing three programs to run at once, but I had understood that they removed that part of the design. And I don't think I can replace the 1 GB RAM with anything, according to others with the same computer, the memory
 is grafted to the motherboard. &gt;_&lt; I just can't win.

            Hi, thanks for the link. It was quite informative, though despite the fact that my extra drives were shown to have Readyboost Cache files, the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Performance Monitor
</strong><span>provided no information on Readyboost, merely gave me a star and some underscores, leading me to think, that some wires have been crossed, and it just refuses to work. Guess I'll have to learn patience.</span>

<p>This is not the same as adding RAM which, as you have pointed out, is nailed to the motherboard of the Asus.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Sometimes I accidently hit it when I'm trying to use shift to capitalize a letter and it's really annoying.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In my "Action Centre", when I'm not even logged into the account, I've been getting this message about outdated my Hotmail settings for the last month or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it has something to do with MS ID as you suggest, for I get a panel, asking me to give my password to my Hotmail account, the user already displayed in the message, but requiring my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I input my password, I get the message "Not yet synced", and sometimes, "We can find nothing here", with the words INBOX displayed in top left hand corner of the panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm up a gum tree, Kenn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Windows 10 is driving me crazy.</p>

<h2>            Read RAW file system &#42;WITHOUT&#42; formatting or converting to NTFS</h2>
                    <p>I have a partition of my primary HDD, and it uses the RAW file system. I would like to be able to read and write files on it from my windows OS. Formatting it or changing the file system is not an option, as Chrome OS is set up to dual boot and that is the
 partition that it uses, and changing it to NTFS may ruin the installation of Chrome OS (I used
<a href="http://www.neverware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CloudReady</a>&nbsp;for the Chrome OS dual boot). Is there some sort of program or something that I can install to access the partition?</p>

Abraham<span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with&nbsp;accessing the RAID files in Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This &nbsp;issue occurs as
</span>RAW drive is a hard drive partition which has not been formatted with the file system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To assist you better, please provided us the information below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>When you say that&nbsp;"to be able to read and write files on it from my windows OS", is the Windows 10 installed in a different partition on the hard drive?</li><li>Are you able to access the partition of Windows 10 files from Chrome OS?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to check if you are able to access the file inside the partition through Disk Management.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>
Windows Key&nbsp;+ R Key</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Then type "<strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong>" without the quotes in the run box and hit on
<strong>Enter Key</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In the <strong>
Disk Management&nbsp;Window</strong>, right click on the partition box.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;Then click on
<strong>Open </strong>or <strong>Explore </strong>to check if you are&nbsp;able to access the files and folders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>If you are not able to access the partition files, then I&nbsp;recommend you to search for a third Data recovery software&nbsp;to access the files and folders in your favorite search engine.</p>

            <p>The windows OS is installed on the same Hard Disk but on a different partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chrome OS doesnt support the reading of other partitions on the same hard drive, so I cannot access my windows files from chrome. However during the installation Chrome OS process, when I get to try the OS without installing it (i.e. it is booted from my
 USB) I am able to view all my windows files since it is on a separate hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the chrome partitions on disk managment and even on My Computer. However when I try to open it, it returns the error that the disk must be formatted due to corruption or an unrecognised file system.</p>
<p>

                    My problem is that Whenever I try to play a game on Steam. It always says Failed to create Direct 3D device, You need pixel shader 2.0 at least to run this program etc. Then I looked into the Device manager, I see something wrong. Under other devices,
 SM Bus Controller has a black exclamation mark inside a yellow triangle. Can someone please help me. I have no idea what my hardware is except that it is 64 bit, and I don't know what to do. Can someone guide me step by step and help me to get windows working
 properly. I am running windows professional service pack 1.

            <p>Post your system specifications, or brand and <em>full </em>model number of you machine, if using DELL, etc,
</p>
<p>and the name of the game you are having problems with, and we may be able to offer more information,</p>
or suggestions, but...<br />
<p>
</p><p>- There should be no connection between no being able to run a game from Steam and the SM Bus Controller.</p>
<p>SM Bus is the <em>System Management Controller</em>, which runs from a chip on your machines motherboard.</p>
<p>A clean install of Windows requires you to also install various drivers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Have you downloaded and installed the motherboard drivers ( chipset, audio, USB, etc. ) from mfg&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">of your motherboard's, or machine if using an HP, DELL, or other branded PC,&nbsp; web site ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Shader 2.0 is a very old Shader version. Shader 3.0 was introduced in '04, so there is a small possibility that</p>
<p>your graphics processor my not be able to use Shader 2.0, but I somehow doubt this.
</p>
<p>The 'failed to create D3D device' error would be more likely due to not having installed the drivers for
</p>
<p>your graphics processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you machine has a dedicated graphics processor also visit the mfg's web site for current graphics drivers.</p>
<p>If your machine uses integrated graphics such as <em>Intel HD</em> graphics the graphics drivers will be found with the
</p>
<p>motherboard driver downloads.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 start up issues</h2>
                    I got Windows 10 just a few weeks ago and upon the inital instillation things worked out quite fine. However, recently I have noticed that I can not use the start menu button either by clicking it with the mouse, nor can i use the keyboard. My only way
 to use it it by right clicking the button and I only do that to shut off my PC. I'm sure that my issue is not an isolated one but I want to now if there is a way to fix this. Is there an update on the way to give me back my start button? Also I can not use
 the keys on the right side of the bar. Please tell me how to fix this

<h2>            USB keyboard &#38; Mouse Error &#34;Windows cannot start this hardware device - code 19&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - USB keyboard &amp; Mouse issue</p>
<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8 64 bit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem: Logitech wireless keyboard &amp; mouse (S520)&nbsp;is not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 week ago I was trying my HDD on the different USB ports in my PC. I have disconnected wireless receiver for keyboard and mouse and reconnected. Since then it stopped working.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the device manager it has a yellow exlamation mark against HID keyboard and mouse. I tried them uninstalling and installing again, disabled and enabled, does not make any difference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go in properties by right click, Status is <strong>"Windows cannot start this hardware device Code 19"</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried googling this error but i found the solution is only for CD/DVD issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have uninstalled USB Root Hub which does not made any change in the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have rebooted severl times and disconnected power from PC and rebooted aswell.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>currently I am operating my PC from iPad using Splashtop application. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really hoping someone to help me. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t log on, keep flashing on spinning circle</h2>
                    <p>I have problem with my PC. My pc is acer 4752 running on windows 10. </p>
<p>Last night when i was working with my Ms. Excel 2013, my PC suddenly restarted. When it came to booting, it didn't show the usual way how i see windows 10 booting progress. After the windows logo showed up, the spinning circle came afterward. I never saw
 this from the first time i used windows 10. Then here comes the culprit that didn't let me log on. The spinning circle followed by continuously flashing screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didnt install third party apps recently. I only installed ms office 2013, photoshop, adobes, smadsv av, gom player, minitab, chrome, and no games. That's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had seen plenty same questions in various forum website. Some answers might be helpful for particular persons but not for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally logged into safe mode, and the spinning circle in flashing screen is not fixed. It appeared again and still i can't log on into my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited for one hour hoping for miracles suddenly sneak into my pc and show me log on view. Lol. But, nahh</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried EVERY startup settings in troubleshooting advanced options, but i got no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to press ctrl alt del, then my pc showed me runtime error in Program: C:\Windows\system32\logonUI.exe</p>
<p><br />
Dont tell me to reset my pc because i have important files and works in my desktop and download folder.<br />
</p>
<p>Dont tell me to update the driver or other things that can only be done when pc already logged on, because i cant even figured out how on earth i can logged into my pc</p>
<p>
Does anybody know what is happening to my pc, and give me bold solution HOW TO FIX THIS? :(
</p><p>
</p><p>Please :( I have deadline for &nbsp;tomorrow :"(</p>
<p>Any suggestion's welcomed :")</p>

<p>Hi Derndt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the Forums!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when trying to play online with Red Dead Redemption 2 but it will not sign in the Xbox Live account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend going to System, Settings, Network, Network Settings, then Test Multiplayer connection. What does it say about the network? You mentioned trying two different networks. Does it let you sign in another account instead? Are you able to try&nbsp;a
 wired connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try checking out our&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/unable-to-connect-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"I've connected my Xbox One to Xbox Live before, but I can't connect now"</a>&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>

            <p>Click on the "Store" icon and then click on your user account icon at the top of the screen.&nbsp; Then, select "My Library" and all the Metro UI apps that you had should be there.&nbsp; Once you buy an app, it is yours forever to include any apps that where free
 at the time.</p>

 a free program).</p>

            <p>Dear James </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your guidance, but I need the list of third party apps that came pre-installed on the SP4 as my library is full of apps as I use Windows Phones too, so all my purchases show there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can remember was that it came with the full version of Drawboard PDF, but I forgot the rest of the apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help with the list of third party apps that came pre-installed on the SP4
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With best regards </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fab</p>

            <p>Microsoft does not pre-install 3rd party apps on these machines.&nbsp; Your recovery will have everything that came with the machine originally unless the factory and put a few apps on them after the fact when the machines came off the assembly line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The factory has done this and there is no "list".&nbsp; Not all machines got extra apps installed onto them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had used Drawboard PDF and it wasn't a trial version, it is yours and it is listed in your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has a policy of "signature" with all their systems.&nbsp; That means you get the operating system and the trial offer for Office 365 and that is it!&nbsp; Nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you used any Metro UI apps that store data, go to <a href="http://www.ondrive.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ondrive.com</a> and you will find sub-folders with those apps' names to where the data for those apps are stored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, there is NO LIST of any 3rd party apps because there was none to begin with.</p>

            <p>James, there where pre-installed third party apps on the SP4. I am very sure about this and also the drawboard pdf site says so at least for their app</p>

            <p>Chances are, it was a pre-install from the factory.&nbsp; Drawboard PDF "used to be" a free app but not anymore.&nbsp; The makers of it changed it over to a commercial "paid" app.&nbsp; If you had it before, it is in your library.&nbsp; If it is not in the library, you will
 have to buy it.&nbsp; I am on my Surface RT right now and it came with it as well.&nbsp; But, did a restore on it several months ago and it was gone.&nbsp; Checked the Store and found that it switched over to be a "paid app" and if I want it I have to buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does include that goofy Candy Crush Soda Saga app now along with the system but some of the other apps that used to be pinned to the main menu vanished because there where complaints from people about Microsoft putting "advertisements" onto the
 system, so, the system has been trimmed down to only have the basics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The factory did put a few apps on some systems and they did that on their own (probably for testing and accidently left them on).&nbsp; Those apps are not in the image file and there is no list of them because not all machines got them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your library in the "Store" will maintain all the apps that you owned to include the free ones.&nbsp; Once you buy an app, it is your forever but you have to manually download it from the Store to restore it on the machine.&nbsp; Apple does the same thing in macOS
 and iOS as well with the App Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The makers of Drawboard PDF saw that their app was a big hit and changed it from "FREE" to "PAID" which means you have to buy it now.&nbsp; They do have a trial offer for it but once you buy it, it is yours and it will be added to your library for future re-installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, there is no list.&nbsp; The system only has the operating system and the trial offer for Office 365.&nbsp; The rest, you have to go to the Store app to manually retrieve.</p>

            <p>Hi James </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted the CEO of Drawboard PDF who stated the following</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">"<span>This is a problem with Microsoft&nbsp;<span>Surface</span>&nbsp;not saying you own the app within the store (it’s a limitation of their preinstall system). In response, Drawboard has&nbsp;<span>added logic</span>&nbsp;into the app so that if
 you download the ‘trial’ from the Store, our app will detect you’re on a&nbsp;<span>Surface</span>&nbsp;Pro 4 and not require you to pay for it."</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>So it is supposed to work just fine by downloading the trial and it will automatically convert into the full version. I will know in a weeks time.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Where there any other third party apps that came pre-installed with the Surface Pro 4 apart from Drawboard PDF?</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>With best regards to all </span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Fab</span></p>

            <p>That is good to hear from Drawboard PDF.&nbsp; I have heard of a 'mixed bag' of apps that came installed in all Surface tablets over the past couple of years.&nbsp; If you reimage the system, a person would find only the operating system, a few apps added such as
 "Candy Crush", and Office 365 trial and should be nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very most important part in regards to any Windows computer is to use it logged in with your Microsoft Account because all of your apps that you buy and install via the Store are stored in a hidden folder of your user account on the tablet and those
 apps are "cataloged" with your online account which is stored in a secure sub-system of OneDrive.&nbsp; That includes the themes you use on the tablet along with other things associated with you Microsoft Account ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way, when you buy an app, it is yours forever and if you had to reimage the machine for some reason, you can always go to the Store app and go to "My Library" and redownload all of the apps you bought.&nbsp; The same goes with all the music, movies/videos/TV
 shows you buy as well.&nbsp; If you use any Apple devices, it is the same process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system itself will have some added apps which are included to include 3D Builder in case you want to play around with a 3D printer in the future and Microsoft is currently working on a paint program to replace "Paint" called "Paint 3D" which is totally
 weird but seems to work.&nbsp; Skype is included with the system as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had, had any other commercial 3rd party apps installed before (when you got the tablet), chances are that somebody at the factory installed them to test the tablet out and accidently left the app on the machine.&nbsp; Those apps would not be associated
 with your account unless you launched them and if they did, they would catalog in your "My Library".&nbsp; That is the repository of all the apps you own.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to add speakers to the laptop's audio output. If you are using the small speakers that were included with the computer</span><span>, you will not get the best performance available. Newer speakers offer more options for optimizing
 sound output.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
Also purchase a set with a subwoofer if you would like entertainment-quality sound at home or in your office.</p>

    <title>Recurring audio distortion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lavatsunami  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurring audio distortion</h2>
                    <p>Everytime I start up my PC, the audio is distorted, sounds like a crunchy incomprehensible version of the sound that should be playing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I know how to fix this:</p>
<p>by going to Sound-&gt; Properties (of my Playback device) -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Then 'testing' a different Default Format sample rate and bit depth, and switching back to the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER I was wondering if anyone knew a way so that I didn't have to go through this 'test' process EVERY TIME I started my PC to get clean audio again! It has gotten a little frustrating after a few months!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regardless of the sample rate and bit depth I choose as default, the problem keeps occurring. The same is true for whichever default playback device I choose (external/internal soundcard/speakers etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your fantastic future help (hopefully!) xoxo</p>
