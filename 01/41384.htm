<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t buy avatar items with MS prepaid</h2>
                    
<p>I can't buy avatar items with my $25 prepaid Microsoft gift card.</p>
<p>I literally just bought a $25 prepaid Microsoft card so that I can buy items in the avatar store, but it will not let me.It only gives me the option to purchase through a credit card, which I don't want to do now after I just bought this prepaid card. What
 a waste of my money!!!</p>
<p>Why? It doesn't make sense. There was never an easily visible warning anywhere on this site or on Xbox that says you can not purchase avatar items with prepaid MS cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If somebody from Xbox Live support team could help me out with this issue, that'd be great. I just want a couple things from the avatar store and I want the amount spent deducted from my prepaid MS dollars.</p>
<p>Please, please, please help me! I can't return this card and I already redeemed the code...&nbsp;</p>
<p>:(</p>

            <p>Hey there, Gzge! For information on how we run our forums, please check out the links in my signature. There is no need to bump your posts more than once within a 24 hour period. We do not work weekends, and we work oldest to newest. Your other posts have been deleted because of this.</p>
<p>Now that we're past that, the Avatar Store is not designed to work with currency. It used to work with the prepaid points, but once that system was retired in 2013, purchasing Avatar items and Xbox 360 items on the website had to be with a credit or debit card. If you purchase them on the Xbox 360 console, then you should be able to use your Currency. However, purchases for Avatar items on the Xbox One and on the website will need to be completed with a credit/debit card. Thanks for understanding!</p>

<p>Actually, I have also tried using compatibility troubleshooter but I did not get any help even after restoring it to Windows XP (Service pack 3) mode.</p>
<p>Note:- It worked on my previous laptop with Windows 10 Home (64-bit)</p>

<h3> ognipas530  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Beeps frequently when watching videos</h2>
                    <p>hi, I bought an Xbox One a bit over a year ago. About six months in, it started to make a very loud, annoying beep, quite often. It seems to happen specifically when I am streaming video (Netflix, HBO, Sling Cable, etc). It does not happen when I am playing games.</p><p><br /></p><p>Does anybody have any idea what would cause this and/or how to fix it, if it is fixable?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>At this rate, updating to a One S would not be the end of the world, but would like to postpone doing that for a little while if possible.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you in advance for any information you may be able to share!</p>

            <p>Hey there OGnIPAs530,</p><p><br /></p><p>Sorry to hear about this Beeping noise, can you describe it a bit for us? Does it seem like it's coming from the console or the audio from the TV? If you purchased it brand new and it's only 6 months old, it's very likely that it's still under warranty. So you may want to check in on that, but let us know the details so we can get a better idea!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>This issue is install-specific and not generalized.&nbsp; I've dealt with it several dozen times in Windows 10 and every one was resolved, but most had different solutions, most prominent of which was assuring install integrity and then letting time settle it

<h2>            TV volume &#38;amp&#59; power on&#47;off control w&#47; Xbox One Media Remote &#40;No Kinect, No Cable&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to use my Xbox One Media Remote to control my TV volume (and to power on/off my TV) but I don't have Kinect and my TV isn't plugged into cable or anything. Basically I just want to use my TV for playing games, streaming Netflix, and watching
 movies. If I could get my Xbox One Media Remote to control my TV power on/off and the volume then that would be great for movies and Netflix (it's also why I bought the remote in the first place, seeing as how it has volume up/down buttons on it I figured
 it could). Does anyone know how to do this? Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well without Kinect that's going to be tough as that is the IR blaster (it talks to your devices). However, not all options are closed. In the back of the XBOX is an IR out for people who keep their console in a cabinet, you need to buy an IR extension cable
 as they explain here <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/live-tv/use-external-ir-with-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../use-external-ir-with-xbox-one</a> then in theory you could achieve your goals. Once you've done that, go through the power/devices setup to configure the remote and xbox to talk to your TV.</p>
<p>Or as an alternative you could by an all-in-one remote that controls both your TV and XBOX. I know these remotes have learning capabilities.
</p>
<p>Good luck! </p>

<p>This is a *REALLY* stupid problem to have, but it is a problem, nonetheless. So unless I buy a Kinect or an IR extension cable, to poke it's head out, then there is NO way in which I can control my TV's volume. If this has changed, feel free to let me know,
 but this is not acceptable. </p>

    <title>Skype 8 loss of capabilities - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype 8 loss of capabilities</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know why Skype 8 is so useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No longer can I have a split window, with all my contacts in one window, and all my current chats with my team in multiple other windows. Now there is a tedious back arrow scheme to get you back to contacts. All my working context is gone, and I can have
 only one chat open at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I double click on an image, instead of opening in my image viewer (ACD), now the image opens in the chat window and I lose context totally, and can no longer discuss the image with my co-workers. The loss of this capability alone has set me looking
 for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know why Microsoft insist on updating the user interface to be ever more useless. Why not update just the back end to improve security etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume Microsoft wants us to stop using Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have found that a portable version of 7 still works fine. This guy has link to a downloader:<br />
https://www.winytips.com/download-skype-portable-run-without-installation/<br />
<br />
I suggest that Microsoft forget the ill-advised transition to 8, and allow 7 to continue operating.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Bart,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the trouble you have been experiencing.
<br />
<br />Skype 8.36 does have split view, see steps to enable it. 
<br />
<br />Other areas of Skype, you will need to send in feedback to the engineers to have it improved. 
<br />
<br />See steps how to enable Split mode and send in Feedback about the areas you would like to see improved.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52df54f0-4802-437e-a427-5398d7074313?upload=true" />

<p>Thanks Andre for the fast reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However in my version of Skype 8.36.0.52, which claims to be the latest, there is is no entry for 'Enable Split View Mode' under 'Help and Feedback'. Just 'Sign Out'. I can find no option for Split View anywhere in the user interface.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Can you press Alt on your keyboard then look through the View menu if its there?

<p>Hi Andre,<br />
I'm running it on Win 7 x64, though we have some laptops with Win 10. We have a couple of engineering programs that don't like running on Win 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll stay using the portable version of Skype version 7 until it is no longer supported, and then figure out what to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other capabilities that have also disappeared (such as file drag and drop into and out of chat windows), translation,&nbsp; Favorites first, a contacts centric approach (in the Desktop version anyway), so there seems no good reason to downgrade to 8
 until we have to.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your valued concerns about Skype Bart. I do encourage you report these issues to the engineers so the product can be better improved. The Skype engineers are listening and they are working hard to rapidly restore a lot of requested functionality.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>I find that hard to believe!&nbsp; Every step along the Skype path has been one of decreasing functionality (remember when you could share a chunk of screen with your co-workers - long gone!), increasing wasted space and bloated formatting (remember when you
 could have a tiny little window with a full chat in it). I do not understand how engineers working on the Skype app could possibly imagine that removing these features, to much back lash from the community, would be the right thing to do. They are not listening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah well, such is the life cycle of hubris. Somewhere, there will be another Estonian programmer or the like making a brilliant little program for us to replace Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest and help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bart</p>

    <title>Cumulative Update for IE11 Win 7 64-bit KB 3058515 - working for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hazel0206  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cumulative Update for IE11 Win 7 64-bit KB 3058515 - working for everyone now&#63;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(88, 88, 88, 1)">I really appreciate all the commentary on the various IE 11 update versions.</span>
<div>The cumulative security update for IE 11 that has not worked for months for me finally worked today, and I am wondering: how is it for other users? what was the real issue, please, Microsoft, if in fact it is now working?</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I had passed on agreeing to the EULA for Skype. Because of what happened with the latest IE 11 updates, I wonder if my neoSkype aversion might have been a factor. I didn't see that mentioned in the other forum entries on this IE 11 update.</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(MS from the cloud makes me uneasy, even though I appreciate that all the update traffic to local machines eats up a lot of network bandwidth, and having infinite ways to set up the OS and apps between users and OEMs and apps probably violates
 some assumptions made by MSoft. On top of that, the original EULA for Skype was such a hodgepodge of "if this, then that; if this, then that, and oh, by the way, x, y z, aa, bb, cc,..." that I could not make heads or tails of where I fell, free Euro version
 versus MSoft version. I once used Skype when it first came out years and several batches of hardware ago, but not since. I may not be alone in that.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Today I had most of the big recent load of MS patches install without issues, though it took awhile and I had to run some MSoft utilities (FixIt, Updater utility). I found a recommendtion from a MSoftie to try resetting Windows Update, and I did
 that. An alternate suggestion was to try installing by running msconfig and setting the system to do a clean boot. I didn't go that far, because a subsequent note from another MSoftie as of about April 20, 2015 said to hold on because the issue was being elevated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The IE cumulative security update, a few others, and an update to Win7 were still at first not working today.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Not unusual when there are a lot of updates all at once.)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>The bulk of the 30-odd updates worked, but updates for Skype, Windows7, Outlook 2013, Office 2013 and OneDrive didn't. I tried updating with all checked, and that failed.
<br />
<br />
So I installed the patches in functional groups, "Important" updates first. When one functional group succeeded (the updates to Outlook, Office, and OneDrive), Side note: I am sharing the more recent versions of Office for learning purposes. This is via a military/government
 package which permits that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I went on to the next Important update (the lone Win7 update, in my case). That succeeded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then an update to MS Essentials popped up, and I did that with success (MS Essentials is what I run - I don't have duplicates of its functionality).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note: Why security updates for MS Essentials are "Optional" I do NOT understand...but I had a hunch that it popped up because of some dependency of updates, so I did it before the last "Important" update.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then, last of all, the "Important" cumulative security update to IE (the newest IE update shown to me, KB3058515).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When the Skype window opened, I noted a "check for updates" button prominently placed. Lo and behold, there was a Skype update. I was feeling forced to install and update Skype in order to have the security update to IE and the rest of its partner
 software work, and so I reluctantly installed the Skype update, but did not log into Skype or create an account.
<br />
<br />
I dreaded this, because I am not going to like it if I have thereby initiated a need to pay Microsoft for something I do not use.
<br />
<br />
As soon as I closed Skype and opened Windows Update to try manually starting the IE update again, I found that the latest IE cumulative update was already in the midst of installing.
<span style="color: rgba(88, 88, 88, 1)">
I am recently reading that IE is less of a target currently because it has gained a reputation for releasing first and worrying about security details later, but has mostly rectified its security issues. Hope so. I still am reluctant to use IE, and really honestly
 don't like Bing, though I have tried it. I opted out of installing Bing and left IE 11 as not-the-default-browser. The latest IE update thereupon&nbsp;</span>finished and succeeded.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Figured maybe sharing this might help somebody.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Conclusion(s)? For me, two.</div>
<div>One was that MS was assuming that I would be thrilled to install Skype, and forced me to install the new Skype because it has a symbiotic relationship with the whole ecosystem of newer MS programs now. My initial refusal seems to have thrown a
 monkeywrench into the works for IE and possibly the other browsers (they have acted a bit squirrely lately). I don't favor IE on the advice of a CEH (certified ethical hacker) and system admin who also teaches networking, IT admin, and digital math as of last
 year, and this long-standing failure of a security update to IE is NOT confidence-inspiring, but I know that some workplaces rely on IE, as they only have time to cater security to one browser and are heavily invested in, and worker-conditioned to, Microsoft
 apps. I don't work there. But I may, and so I feel constrained to learn.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another conclusion was that perhaps MS and Skype developers possibly didn't have a complete enough mind-meld until after a few tries, but I can't prove it. Skype has been around a long time; MS has been around a long time. I wonder whether some
 of the parameters and inheritance on the "objects" under the hood in the two systems may have been overlooked or some unwarranted assumptions made about methods. Or maybe in integrating Skype some duplicate but contradictory objects or object characteristics
 weren't noticed or triggered at first.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Humble thoughts: I appreciate Microsoft's interest in patching security holes, but I wish there was a quieter, clearer roadmap of where they are going with development and why. Getting information piecemeal with loud graphics and ad slogans doesn't
 really inspire confidence in me. Mistakes happen; it would be reassuring to have some honesty about that. I also wish that if there really is no option to opt out of Skype or some such (because of the direction that MSoft feels compelled to go for security
 or competitive reasons, or popular demand), that were clearer as well. Crowdsourcing, reflected upon, is informative; no reflection, though, and it just looks like 'shoot at the squeaking wheel first, aim at the real goal, threat, or wider audience later.'&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            XBOX One S Mic suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    <p>My sons XBOX One S mic has suddenly packed up.&nbsp; I've tried narrowing the problem down to faulty hardware such as a broken cable or the controller but after 3 different headsets, 3 different controllers and 2 consoles, I think its fair to say the
 hardware is not to blame.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've also checked account and privacy settings thinking that it must now be something at account level propagating down to anywhere that is logged in with the affected account and all is good there too.&nbsp; To rule out the gamertag which is a restricted
 account for my son, I have tried using my own unrestricted gamertag on my own console and even I seem to have a mic problem!&nbsp; Cycling the power hasn't worked, unplugging the brick hasn't worked, completely resetting the console to manufacturer settings didn't
 resolve anything and neither has re-associating the controllers to the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test the headset itself, ive plugged the 3.5mm jack lead into my phone and been able to listen to music and record my voice via the recorder function, so something on the console (and my other console!!) has caused the mic audio input to stop...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect a dodgy update or corrupt firmware being pushed out here... any ideas?</p>

<p>G'day,</p>
<p>Have you tried Settings&gt;Kinect+Devices&gt;Devices+Accessories below Configue click the ellipsis (3 dots) and do a firmware update with a cable (usb charger cable) attached from controller to console. You may also need a headset adapter.</p>
<p>DO the update even if it reports that its up to date. Takes seconds</p>

<p>Hi XBF, as mentioned within my original diagnosis steps above, I have already carried out a soft reset and restored the XBOX account thereafter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing not done is what AquarrzSudnymm has suggested with having the controller physically connected to the console... I will have to purchase a cable tomorrow and will try it out.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi, thanks for your suggestion. &nbsp;I will get a cable tomorrow and try this out... I am quite sceptical though seeing as theres another console in the house (mine) which uses a different gamertag with its own headset and controller that i also have a mic issue
 with...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But we will see!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just realised that the controller has the alternative micro USB port at the top, which i have plenty of those cables lying around!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, ive plugged in, checked for firmware updates (none available) and the controller is running on 3.X.X.</p>
<p>i have noticed that the mic icon on the home screen remain scored out with a line across it, so its just not seeing the accessory plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am now soft resetting the console for the 2nd time but have now left the controller physically plugged in to see whether that makes any difference this time around. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Duggie,</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Sorry for the issue with your headsets. Here is a list of
 troubleshooting to try out. Some you may have done already and some you may not have. Number 9 seems to be a temporary solution to this ongoing issue with the adapter.</span></span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>1.) power cycle console</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>2.)</span></span><span><span>Go
 to settings&gt; Kinect and Devices&gt; Devices and Accessories&gt; [...]&gt; Assign controller to account&gt; Update control&gt; unassign account&gt; test headset/chat</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>3.)</span></span><span><span>Make
 sure mic is "ON" Press the home button&gt; go to the Gear on the&nbsp; </span></span><span><span>menu&gt; Audio&gt; Turn Mic off and on. OR go to settings</span></span><span><span>&gt;
 Kinect and Devices&gt; Devices and Accessories&gt; [...]&gt;</span></span><span><span>Audio&gt; Mic on&gt; Adjust volume.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>4.)</span></span><span><span>You
 can test your controller if it is broken by "Buzzing" the controller. The buzz feature is connected to the headset port, and if the controller does not buzz then the port may be damaged.
</span></span><span><span>[Turning on Vibration if it does not "Buzz"&gt; Settings&gt; Ease of Access&gt;
</span></span><span><span>Controller&gt; Vibration Settings&gt; Turn on Vibration].</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>5.)</span></span><span><span>Some
 mics are detachable and may be damaged so try testing the headset on another device to see if it works (Example: windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Test
 the Headset with Skype Test or Voice Recorder). If there is an issue with using the headset on an Xbox controller,&nbsp; you can try using a headset adaptor.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>6.) Make sure there is no Enforcement on the account.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>7.) Make sure the controller is not full of dust in the headset
 port (you can use compressed air to clear the dust).</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>8..) Make sure controller is fully charged/ change battery
 type.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>9.) Use a headset adapter or standard headphones (Main fix)</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>10) Soft or full console reset. (may not work all the time)</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Thanks,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Brad, thanks but everything mentioned has been tried. &nbsp;I urge any moderator attempting to support me to take the time to read through my diagnosis &amp; resolution steps to avoid sending me a copy and paste set of 1st tier troubleshooting steps. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands now, the console has been restored with the standard xbox headset tried and x2 different turtle beach headphones and still no luck. &nbsp;I can hear the max volume limit beep sound through the headphones when pressed on the adapter but no mic pickup
 still. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has got to be a bug, surely.</p>

<p>Hello Duggie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand if some were done that is a complete template I have compiled with all different troubleshooting steps for headset issues. You stated you tried all, have you tried a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
headset adapter</a>? This connects to the controller and the headset connects to the adapter. They have been known to work as they do not utilize the 3.5mm jack. Reason I suggest this, is it has been known to work. There are issues with the 3.5mm jack itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Hi Brad,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve tried the standard Xbox headset which plugs in via the adapter port (bypassing the 3.5mm) and whilst the dashboard shows it recognising the headset being plugged in via the top right icon showing a little image of a headset, the mic still doesnt work.
 &nbsp;Its as though the mic is completely disabled on the console...</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t set Firefox as Default Browser</h2>
                    <p>I can't seem to set Firefox as my Default Browser, for some reason. It's really getting on my nerves. I've just done a clean install of Firefox to see if that solves it, but nope. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on Windows 10 with the latest update. It's unactivated at the moment, I'm going to buy a key as soon as I can, not that it should make a difference. My PC is an i5 powered desktop with a GTX770 overclocked and 8GB RAM, if it makes a difference.
</p>

<h2>            HP Printer Wireless Scanning Application not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Laptop Model G-50-70 loaded with Windows Operating System 8.1. This laptop was procured 10 months back in October 2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I bought an HP Printer Laserjet MFP M126nw. After the drivers of the printer were loaded(from the CD provided) by the HP Engineer on the laptop, except Wireless scanning everything else was working(Wireless Printing, Copy, all functions are working).
 For Wireless scanning, there is a HP application which gets loaded on the desktop. When we click this application software, nothing happens and after 2-3 minutes we get a message that there is an error in the &nbsp;scanner communication. I got support from HP Engineer
 but was not successful. So the HP Engineer got his LAPTOP with same OS Windows 8.1 and loaded through the drivers from the same CD and everything was working absolutely fine. The HP Engineer recommended that there is a problem in the Operating system on my
 Laptop. Kindly advise what needs to be done. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Do you still get 1 months Free Gold For A New Account on New Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darky force  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do you still get 1 months Free Gold For  A New Account on New Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>Im sure this has been asked many times before, so I appolgise for that,&nbsp;but I have just created my first new account on my new xbox slim and I didnt get offered the 1 months gold for free. I have payment options linked to the acount.&nbsp; I was wondering if
 having used my old profiles on the xbox may have made a difference, or if having the dashboard beta currently on the xbox may have had an effect. Or perhaps that&nbsp;one&nbsp;of the richest companys in the world is too tight to&nbsp;give me 1 month to fully test their product.
 &nbsp;thanks to anybody who helps.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Don't believe this has anything to do with the console beta at all, that's something that's embedded in the system. If the console was new you should have received this prompt when making the account on the console. It cannot be an existing account and it has
 to be made new only on the console for the prompt to pop up. <br />
<br />
If you did not and you have not made 3 accounts that have redeemed these 1 month gold trials then you will need to contact phone support and speak with them. They should be able to see how many accounts were made on the console with your console id/serial number
 (if they can't personally they should be able to escalate it).<br />
<br />
Please reach out to them <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us#2:10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> austin2525  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX on Windows 8</h2>
                    Whenever I am trying to play a game off of steam, it always says that it is doing first-time&nbsp;start-up&nbsp;and starts to download DirectX. &nbsp;The unfortunate part is that it will never stop downloading DirectX, and no error message appears, so I never actually
 get to play the game. &nbsp;I had a similar problem while trying to install SimCity today, only this time, it is on the initial download of the actual game. &nbsp;The download gets to 25%, and I am assuming that it is for the same reason. &nbsp;If anyone is able to help,
 I would be greatly appreciative.

                    I never had a chance to make factory default disks for the Gateway NV57 notebook as the employee was in a hurry to use it.&nbsp; It is a new laptop that was purchased about 6 months ago for an employee and after a Microsoft update it would not start.&nbsp; All repair
 and recovery options fail.&nbsp; I could probably contact Gateway but I do not want the Gateway version with the extra added software, just plain Windows7(64) is best for us.&nbsp; The Windows serial is still intact on the bottom of the laptop.

</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

<h2>            Where to download Windows 7 Ultimate trial version</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
for all these days, I's running Windows 7 RC. As you all know, the RC comes to an end by June. I just want to know, whether trial version of Windows 7 ultimate will be available from Microsoft? I've seen the 90-day Enterprise version in the TechNet site.
<br />
Can someone please confirm, whether Win7 Ultimate trial download is available?<br />
Thanks.

            You can still download the Windows 7 Enterprise 90-day Trial. It is designed specifically for IT Professionals, so you must say you're an IT Professional. If you're not an IT professional you'll need to tell a little fib to download.<br />

    <title>WmiPrvSE - error opening process - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jghcts  say:</h3>
<h2>            WmiPrvSE - error opening process</h2>
                    <p>It appears that ever since I completed 15 Windows Updates(all successful) I continue to see this EXE running at the top of the list of CPU users under PROCESS EXPLORER. When I put my laptop to SLEEP after completing my work, I continue to hear audible sounds
 coming from my laptop - like those made when a usb device is removed. As a result the laptop never truly goes to sleep.</p>
<p>When I highlight the WmiPrvSE executable I see the note - error opening process.</p>
<p>So now when I want to quiesce my laptop I need to shutdown.</p>
<p>Anyone know of this issue or how to correct? Normally I have audio muted so for the first several days I didnt know there was any problem. I did continually see my battery level low and wondered why since the pc was asleep all day. In fact it was running
 WmiPrvSE constantly with high cpu(6% or so as shown in PROCEXP). Now because I have sound on/not muted - I hear the laptop making sounds over and over again as I mentioned earlier. When I open the lid, my system is up and I am at the desktop - no resume of
 Windows needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running Windows 7. Most of the 15 updates were for Office 2010. Curious - I just started a monthly trial of Office 2013 back on April 28.</p>

<p>I tried trouble shooter to no avail. Note however - I am not getting a file error/path error opening file. That is the text that gets displayed when I place cursor over task when running Process Explorer.</p>
<p>At this point I have to shutdown every time I am done else this error runs over and over for some other function using this task.</p>
<p>Anything specific I can find in Event Logs or elsewhere to gather data?</p>

<p>Ran a quick scan - no errors. Should I run full scan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading an earlier response I restarted the WMI service and restarted my pc, Then put it to sleep and the problem appeared fixed - until I started doing things and then put to sleep. The problem with the module started up again.. So I continue to shutdown
 when done.</p>

<p>So cant do anything else.</p>
<p>Where are the mainframes when you need one.</p>
<p>I suspect the file error was caused by Microsoft Update. I dont suspect any malware or virus.</p>

</p><p>Are you facing any issue with running System File checker tool (SFC /SCANNOW command)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC /SCANNOW is not a virus scan, it scans your computer for any missing or corrupt system files and replaces the incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On addition to that, you may also place the computer in clean boot state and check if issue persists.

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Clean boot</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> is the process
