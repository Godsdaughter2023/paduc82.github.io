<p>Ouch! Please don't yell at us. We can hear you if you type normally,<br />
in mixed case.</p>
<p>Visual Studio is programming software. If you don't use it, you don't<br />
need it.</p>
<p>But to be on the safe side, before deleting them, why not burn these<br />
files to a CD? That way if something later complains about their not<br />
being there, you can put them back.</p>

<h2>            windows xp computer stopped recognizing my external hard drive, doesnt recognise usb devices or memory cards, system restore wont load various probs</h2>
                    I have been running a dell dimension since new in 2006 with no probs, run my business and use as a personal pc.
<div>recently it stopped recognizing my external hard drive (western digital) which had its own backup software that seemed to work fine since new in 2008.</div>
<div>i tried upgrading the software, no difference, i then noticed usb devices playing up, errors loading drivers etc, and my memory card readers which have always been in the tower and worked fine, they stopped autoplaying any data, plus i cannot find anything
 on any drives in my computer.</div>
<div>all seems to have gone weird. the card reader lights up when a card is inserted, but cannot find it and nothing happens??</div>
<div>i use bitdefender security, and i have performed a scan in rescue mode which found nothing, today, although it did find something a few weeks ago when i first developed a problem.</div>
<div>windows updates have been constantly trying to download the same 0kb update a . net framework security update to no avail.</div>
<div>i am running service pack 3 and cannot find any other updates.</div>
<div>computer runs ok, but when i open my computer and click different drives, they used to display an error asking to insert some data mediums, but now they just open and have or say nothing.</div>
<div>my mouse and keyboard work ok.</div>
<div>any ideas much appreciated.</div>
<div>i dont know much about the operating systems on pcs but i feel i have corruption in the operating system, as i have looked at various logs which seem to have lots of errors.</div>
<div>please help?</div>
<div>cheers in advance&nbsp;</div>

            Incompatibility with Other Devices
<ul>
<li>
<div>
<div>
<p>If your USB drive is not being recognized by your computer when you plug it in, try unplugging it, and also unplugging any other USB devices that are connected. All USB devices, even those that have an external power supply, draw a portion of their power
 directly from the USB bus. If you have too many devices connected to the same USB controller, problems such as a drive not being recognized can result.</p>

            Hi
<div>thanks for your reply.</div>
<div>I have tried what you suggested and it makes no difference.</div>
<div>I have had this desktop external hard drive plugged in and working fine since 2008 when i bought it. i havent plugged anything else new in until i realized there was a problem as files were not being backed up due to error message stating "backup destination
 doesnt exist" so i tried different things.</div>
<div>the pc tower has 5 usb slots on the back and 2 on the front.</div>
<div>i have removed the external drive since i realized it doesnt work, i bought a new external drive at first thinking it was that, but same trouble with the new one, so i returned it to the shop.</div>
<div>at the moment i have the keyboard, mouse and printer plugged in so thats only 3 of 7 ports in use.</div>
<div>this is why i am baffled as to why it stopped working when nothing changed on the setup.</div>
<div>doesnt explain why my card reader has stopped working either.</div>
<div>when i open "my computer" it used to show everything instantly, but now it hangs on a blank page for about 1 minute or more before displaying the connected devices.</div>
<div>as i explained previously, when i click on any of the card reader devices, they used to say something like "please insert media" &nbsp;but now the page just opens to a blank page with no back button, so i have to press "my computer" on the left panel to get
 back again.</div>
<div>thanks again</div>
<div>i am trying to give as much detail as poss of my symptoms</div>
<div>hope this helps</div>
<div>thank you</div>

            Hi again,
<div>i have just been having a fiddle, and when i insert a flash drive full of photos in a usb, it beeps, i get the found new hardware message, it says usb mass storage device for ages, and after a few minutes it shows up as a drive in the "my computer " screen,
 however when i clickto open it, there is nothing its blank, with no back button, so i have to press the my computer link to get back, when i remove the drive it dissappears immediately, same symptom for the external hard drive.</div>
<div>with the memory card reader thats part of the tower from new and worked fine for 6 years almost, it lights up when i insert a card, but doesnt flicker as it used to , but nothing shows up when i click through all the drives on "my computer"</div>
<div>i seem to have lots off errors in the registry though warnings and yellow triangles etc</div>
<div>i can remove the mouse, keyboard and bluetooth dongle or printer just fine and replace them with no probs, (the dongle only goes in when i connect my phone) so it seems to be just memory devices or media storage devices there are issues with</div>

            Hi
<div>Thank you for your help</div>
<div>I would like to carry out the above 2 steps, but another problem i have is that i cannot use fixit at all because it always fails to download the powershell and asks me to try again later.</div>
<div>I was just reading other threads on that subject because i hope i could use fixit to tweak various bits for me.</div>
<div>i had a look at fixing it myself sections, but i am not that clued up on a pc.</div>
<div>can you suggest any way i can start using fixit please?</div>
<div>thanks again</div>

 the link, to place the computer to normal start.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you place the computer in clean boot state, then I would suggest you to runt eh fixit from those articles provided in my previous reply.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div>I &nbsp;have followed your instructions, and found as follows.</div>
<div>i restarted in clean mode, then tried the first fix you suggested, and it got further than normally, to installing, then stopped with error message "troubleshooter cannot continue because an error occurred, powershell failed to install, try again later"</div>
<div>so i removed the download, turned off firewall and antivirus software(bit defender) then tried again, same outcome.</div>
<div>so i tried the second suggestion, which was a different download with no powershell etc and it worked and completed the "fix"` however when i try plugging in memory cards and usb flash drives, the card is not recognized as the light doesnt even come on
 now, which it did when i tried yesterday, and the usb beeps, but doesnt show anything in my computer page.</div>
<div>when i tried a different usb, same but with a balloon saying found new hardware, but same nothing appears.</div>
<div>hope this helps</div>
<div>thanks again</div>

<h2>            Dual monitor screen freezing</h2>
                    Has Microsoft resolved the problem with a dual screen freezing? It did not happen until I got a new laptop with Office365. I read this has been an ongoing problem and I am looking for a permanent solution.

<div>
<div>Thank you very much for patiently waiting, Nicholas. I've checked on the xbox.com website and as it turns out, the best thing to do is for you to post at the forums at the Xbox Indie Games page. The moderators of the said page should be able
 to answer your queries on signing up for this particular program. Please click on the link below:</div>

<div>
<div>Alright, I see. I've checked on the link that you have provided me, and as I can see here, you should post questions about the program at the Xbox LIve Community Forums. It's on the lower portion of the page.</div>

<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:33:33</span></div>

<div>
<div>Yes, I understand. As specified on the page, the right place to go to right now if the Forums Page at xbox.com. Please make sure to create a thread with a title that will give the members of the community a clear idea of what your concern is.</div>

<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:35:23</span></div>

<div>
<div>"Xbox LIVE Indie Games community forums" Are inaccessible for people who are not registered as indie developers.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:35:45</span></div>

<div>
<div>The forum you linked was for consumers, I am interested in developer support.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:38:49</span></div>

<div>
<div>I understand, Nicholas. However, even I cannot get into this page you want to get into. What I suggest you to do is register for the program first and then post your questioon(s) at that particular page. Once advised with what to do, you can
 contact us back if you would ever need assistance in the charge that would be billed on your account. If the charge would appear on your account, we could do the necessary adjustments according to what would be told to us to do so.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:40:38</span></div>

<div>
<div>So you are saying that I should pay the fee and the make a post on the community forum asking to be remembered for the cost?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:42:13</span></div>

<div>
<div>Right now, Nicholas, I'm very sorry, but that's all I can recommend you to do as this is actually already outside my support scope. As you have noticed, even I cannot get into the correct page for you to be able to post the questions you need
 answered.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:45:11</span></div>

<div>
<div>That seems a ridiculous. Having to pay the fee and then ask the community to sort out me getting a refund. Are you sure this is the correct process?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:47:30</span></div>

<div>
<div>Actually, just like what I have told you earlier, it would be better if you post first at the general page at the forum. This is because we have the same people/team moderating the forums page, so they should be bale to attend to your concern.
 In that way, you will be guided properly first before signing up for the program.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:48:37</span></div>

<div>
<div>Which forum are you referring to? We have discussed 3 in this conversation.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:49:09</span></div>

<div>
<div>The Community Discussion page, Nicholas. The one below:</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:49:19</span></div>

<div>
<div>General Discussion</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:50:10</span></div>

<div>
<div>Which sub-category would you recommend?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:51:08</span></div>

<div>
<div>I'd recommend that you post at the Xbox General Discussion Page for now, Nicholas.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:52:35</span></div>

<div>
<div>But this isnt a General Xbox Issue. This is an issue with your website for developers. Not retail support. Is there an actual support link, or is everything from here left up to the community?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:54:25</span></div>

<div>
<div>For now, Nicholas, this is the only page that I'd recommend you to post at that page as you cannot yet access the support page for indie developer. &nbsp;Please click on the link below to check on discussions regarding indie developer for Xbox 360
 games.</div>

<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:54:37</span></div>

<div>
<div>Indie Developers</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:57:26</span></div>

<div>
<div>Is there actual support for intendant developers I can contact? I am not interested in a community forum.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 4:58:59</span></div>

<div>
<div>I'm very sorry, Nicholas, but as we do not have a support page for developer that I have access to aside from the one you have mentioned, which can only be accessed once you are already part of the program. Anyway, these pages at the forums are
 moderated by the same team.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 4:59:37</span></div>

<div>
<div>The same team as what?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 5:00:57</span></div>

<div>
<div>I mean, the forums, whatever page you are in, are moderated by just the same team. I believe that even the moderators for the Xbox 360 indie program page are from the same department.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 5:02:19</span></div>

<div>
<div>You believe or you know?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 5:02:46</span></div>

<div>
<div>I know this for sure, Nicholas.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 5:03:31</span></div>

<div>
<div>So you know for sure that the moderators of the Xbox 360 indie program forum and the xbox 360 general forum are the same?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 5:04:26</span></div>

<div>
<div>Yes, they are from the same support department.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>you:&nbsp;<span>at 5:04:54</span></div>

<div>
<div>So why can I not contact them directly?</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Cristina M.:&nbsp;<span>at 5:05:50</span></div>

<div>
<div>Actually, they can only be reached through the forums, even us from our department do not have a direct line to communicate with them, so for concerns like yours, the best option we give is to post at the forums.</div>

    <title>Five Surface Pro 2017 1 TB &#40;i7&#41; Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msintle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Five Surface Pro 2017 1 TB &#40;i7&#41; Problems</h2>
                    <p>I've got a 1 TB i7 Surface Pro 2017. Unfortunately, the device is plagued by problems:<br />
<br />
1. Fuzzy display. After installing an Intel GPU driver so I can set custom resolutions, and switching to 1152x768, I get this utterly ugly blurry effect in most Windows and Microsoft apps (other apps are strangely immune):<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.notebookreview.com%2fattachments%2fblurry-jpg.147864%2f" /><br />
Ready for the zinger? If you do any of the following things:<br />
<br />
a) Attach an external display in "Duplicate" mode<br />
b) Rotate the screen into any portrait mode<br />
c) Rotate the screen to reverse landscape mode<br />
<br />
The issue goes away:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.notebookreview.com%2fattachments%2fcrisp-jpg.147865%2f" /><br />
<br />
Of course, its not practical when using the tablet as a mobile notebook with the type cover and the kickstand to go into reverse landscape or something else. It's definitely not:<br />
<br />
i) A resolution issue. In any display mode other than regular landscape, the resolution is the same but the problem doesn't show.<br />
<br />
ii) A display issue. The same display can handle the output extremely crisply, in anything other than regular landscape, or when duplicating to an external display.<br />
<br />
It's a bug, Microsoft!!! How do we fix it, or work around it?<br />
<br />
I've even tried to fake Windows intro tricking that a secondary monitor is attached, so I could duplicate into it; but it appears Windows 10 has removed this capability. Guess who we have to thank for that as well - Microsoft!<br />
<br />
2. SSD defragging instead of TRIM: I use the Defragment and Optimize Drives tool to TRIM my Surface SSD. Clearly, you don't want (or need) to defrag an SSD. Unfortunately, that's exactly what this built-in system tool does, instead of trimming:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.notebookreview.com%2fattachments%2fdefrag-png.147866%2f" /><br />
Upon investigation, it appears that this may be due to the new Storage Spaces software RAID 0 on the system:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.notebookreview.com%2fattachments%2fstoragespaces-png.147867%2f" /><br />
While I appreciate having a software RAID 0 on a tablet this size, its ridiculous that Microsoft's own software does *not* recognize underlying SSD hardware and cannot TRIM the storage, instead running a defrag operation when I try to optimize.<br />
<br />
I figure the Surface Pro 4 1 TB had a single 1 TB device in it. This one has two 512 TB devices, which probably save Microsoft some money. It would have been nicer, of course, had they released a 2 TB model of the device - or even 4 TB, as you already have
 2 TB M2 form factor drives, and you could combine those for a total of 4 TB storage on a 12" tablet! That would have been something.<br />
<br />
Regardless, does anyone know how to override this Storage Spaces lock on TRIMming the underlying SSDs on this device? Any command line parameters or similar?<br />
<br />
Even Intel has supported TRIMming underlying SSDs in all their RAID arrays for multiple versions of their Rapid Storage/Matrix software already.<br />
<br />
3. Fan always on: When you set your Power Mode to Best performance:<br />

<br />
The fan is always on. This device was advertised as being cooler and quieter, thanks to the new Kaby Lake CPU. The fan is certainly not as high pitched as the previous Surface Pro devices. However, it being always-on is a brand-new nuisance, and one that defeats
 the whole purpose of the exercise of having a quieter machine.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<blockquote>4. Random CPU slowdown: Another brand-new issue, the tablet seems to slow down to a crawl apparently any time. Maybe there is a buggy power state transition or something, but its certainly abnormal. This happens when you are *active* on the device,
 and *not idle*. However, the Task Manager screenshot you might take at that time could be very misleading:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.notebookreview.com%2fattachments%2fcpuslowdown-png.147869%2f" /><br />
This is typically what it looks like your CPU speed has been reduced to save power when you're idle on the machine (and no background computation is going on). Unfortunately, on this device, I stress it *again*, this happens when you are active and using the
 device.<br />
<br />
You'll notice an aggressive slowdown and stuttering. Fortunately, there is a quick fix to the problem:<br />
<br />
a) Click the battery icon<br />
b) Wait a few seconds (that's literally how long it takes due to the CPU stutters)<br />
c) Change your Performance slider in any direction<br />
<br />
This solves the stuttering, for anytime between the next 5 to 50 minutes; until it inevitably happens again. Needless to say, this is an extreme nuisance, and clearly a bug with the device firmware or software which should be fixed ASAP.<br />
<br />
Note that I always keep my performance setting at Best performance, yet this issue keeps happening repeatedly.<br />
<br />
5. Sub-par GPU benchmarks: The pure CPU benchmarks seem to be faster than the previous generation (Pro 4). Older GPU benchmarks also seem to be faster than the previous generation. However, most benchmarks starting with 3DMark 11 regress to levels substantially
 below the previous generation device:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforum.notebookreview.com%2fattachments%2fbenchmarks-png.147870%2f" /><br />
<br />
I'll post full benchmark results on another thread soon, but these results appear very abnormal indeed.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else run these on their Pro 2017 i7 based device? Could you let me know if your results differ?<br />
<br />
<br />
To sum it up - that's five brand-new issues with a brand-new flagship class device. Extremely disappointing to say the least.<br />
<br />
I've been through every Surface generation since the original abomination that was the Surface Pro. Allow me to summarize my list of issues with each:<br />
<br />
i) Original Surface Pro, 64 GB *and* 128 GB: SSD issues which were very hard to trace. Random crashes, failures, and loss of data. Most probably caused by defective SSD.<br />
<br />
ii) Surface Pro 2 512 GB: Quite possibly the *only* Surface device I have had which worked without issues.<br />
<br />
iii) Surface Pro 3 512 GB: CPU underclocking issue (not like the stuttering above - a much more "reasonable" underclocking when the machine is under stress).<br />
<br />
iv) Surface Pro 4 1 TB/Surface Book 1 TB/Surface Book Performance Base 1 TB: This generation first introduced the blurry text issue above. This generation also took about six months to stabilize - from freezing problems with docking stations to freezing problems
 when shutting the type cover, this generation was extremely problematic upon launch.<br />
<br />
v) Surface Pro 5: Adds three fresh issues:<br />
a) Defrag instead of trim,<br />
b) CPU stuttering,<br />
c) Fan always on,<br />
In addition to sub-par benchmarks, and retaining the blurry display issue.<br />
<br />
The issues are *not* OS related and reproduce on clean factory installs, as well as, in the case of blurries, being persistent across two generations of the device already.<br />
<br />
I'd use a Mac at this point if I could. Doing free beta testing for Microsoft is one thing, and then having multiple fresh issues with each "newer and better" device is another thing.<br />
<br />
Especially considering how they've taken the pen out of the Surface Pro 2017 box, and how they're now storage-spacing a 1 TB device so they can ship you two cheaper (and slower) 512 GB SSDs, this thing is
<strong>one big rip-off</strong>.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we get new devices, we may encounter several issues even when we assume that it should not run into any problems, considering it's newly introduced into the market. The best thing you can do to make sure your Surface Pro 2017 is not lacking what should
 make it work properly, is checking for updates and installing the available updates on your device. If you find no changes after verifying that the Surface Pro 2017 is updated, we suggest taking the device to a Microsoft Store to have Microsoft professionals
 look into it. You also have the option to return it and get a different unit of the Surface Pro 2017.</p>
<p>

<p>Most, if not all, of these issues, are not hardware/device-specific issues, with the most notable highlight of the blurry text issue which has been present since the 4th generation of Surface devices. As such, your recommendation belittles my issue (especially
 the "check for updates" part) and is very offensive.</p>

<p>Thanks to the people of the Internet, I have been directed towards these solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Blurries - <strong>nasty, physical patch</strong>. See the screenshots, nay, physical pictures below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73d1a18a-aeef-4206-906d-45e463f10d2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/73d1a18a-aeef-4206-906d-45e463f10d2f" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6db3056b-43d3-4903-b114-1d2a82efd38b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6db3056b-43d3-4903-b114-1d2a82efd38b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to use a Surface VGA Adaptor to make this happen. Just plugging this adaptor is not enough, you also need to get some conductive wire and follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.geeks3d.com/20091230/vga-hack-how-to-make-a-vga-dummy-plug/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have to use capacitors - just plain old conductive wire was sufficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this is to trick Windows 10 to output to a second display, which you used to be able to do for absolutely free on earlier Windows versions. Thank you for helping make the Surface as ugly looking as possible physically, Microsoft, by removing the ability
 to project to a fake external VGA display without this nasty physical hack. Hey, at least it works, and I have a story to tell if anyone asks about Microsoft's excellent devices and the literal workarounds one has to devise to get them working properly. I'm
 sure other people will agree that it makes for a great fun pastime - working around Microsoft's bugs so we can use the hardware we paid for. Also, its a great tactic to sell otherwise useless VGA adapters, I think - kudos, Panos &amp; team!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Defrag - simple enough:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) <strong>Disable any defrag schedule from the defrag app GUI</strong>, because Microsoft will otherwise burn your SSD a little bit every week on schedule. Remember, perseverance always pays off!!!</p>
<p>b) Run defrag.exe from the command line with the /l parameter to force a trim. So, for example,
<strong>defrag c: /l</strong>. This *seems* to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. CPU Stuttering - you need to set <strong>CsEnabled=0</strong> in the key <strong>
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power</strong>. I don't know if anyone actually appreciates the Surface default setting here anyways. After overriding this value and rebooting, my stuttering issues seem to have ceased entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT: This issue has happened again after about 2 hours of use. Unfortunately, it is a maddeningly irritating issue, not in the least because there's absolutely no documentation of what the new power slider in Windows 10 does, when displayed by the
 battery icon in the system tray. This is *not* the standard power schemes and is something completely new, undocumented, and apparently buggy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. <strong>Fan always on - this is *mostly* fixed by the fix #3 above</strong>. The fan still appears to be always-on, but it is at least set at the very lowest intensity on idle now. Which is a huge, huge step above the previous setting of always on, always
 at max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I'll repeat the benchmarks to see if the situation is any better now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, that's four workarounds for five issues, one of which is a full-fledged physical workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I get any bonus for hacking my way through your bugs for you, Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please send Panos my best regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BTW - are surfaceforums.net affiliated with you guys at all? I posted my questions there and was banned for stating the truth.
 I'm keeping with my great new shiny and super-buggy Surface device.</strong></p>

</p><p><strong>Please be advised that the following issues have been reproduced on a clean OS install, irrespective of hardware:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) Blurry - hardware and OS image independent. Also occurs on Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book and Surface Book with Performance Base.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) Defrag instead of TRIM - OS image independent. I don't have any Surface Pro 2017's lesser than 1 TB to test with, so I don't know if they also use a multi-drive configuration via StorageSpaces presented as a single disk. If they do, this would
 reproduce there as well.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your time in reporting the problems you have encountered to us and sharing the workarounds for some of it. Regarding the 5 issues you have identified, are all of these also encountered on Surface Pro 4, Surface Book and Surface Book (Performance
 Base) or only the blurry display issue and the rest are specific to Surface Pro 2017?</p>

            Only the Blurry issue reproduces on Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, and Surface Book Performance Base. This is a cross-generational issue. The remainder issues are exclusive to the Surface Pro 2017.

<p>We would like to understand more about the <strong>CPU stuttering</strong> issue you mentioned. Because, if you're running the device in 100% CPU usage for a period of time, the heat will go up in the device and eventually the CPU clock speed will get lowered
 to keep the device cooling in compliance with regulatory requirements.</p>

<p>You don't need to run the device at 100% CPU for extended amounts of time (or even, for short periods of time) to reproduce this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the issue does seem to happen most frequently when the system is under stress of some kind (for example, multiple browser tabs with videos running in them) - therefore, not completely idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I almost think that the issue may be the CPU failing to return to a higher frequency state from a power save state. Given the fact that I can manually force the CPU to scale up by clicking the battery icon in the system tray and moving the Power Mode slider
 in *any direction*, this seems to be the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue does not reproduce when stressing the CPU exclusively using benchmarks such as wPrime or SuperPI, therefore it could not be a heating issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, a TeamViewer connection may help you experience the issue firsthand, and remains on offer.</p>

    <title>cannot turn off system sounds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stonecherub  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot turn off system sounds</h2>
                    Win 7 Pro 64 bit.<br />
<br />
System dings interfere with my digitizing of old vinyl LPs, I want ALL non-music sounds off.
<br />
<br />
I have done this so far:<br />
<br />
Control Panel &gt; sound &gt; sounds &gt; No sound - done that and checked several time on reboot, sound scheme remains No sounds.
<br />
<br />
Outlook: Tools &gt; Options &gt; Other tab &gt; Advanced options - "Provide feedback with sound" is NOT checked and the required add-in is not loaded.
<br />
<br />
By rights, I should hear nothing BUT:<br />
<br />
1) Control panel &gt; programs and features &gt; remove a program -- Ding-ding, boop, it was removed. So much for "no sound."<br />
<br />
2) I have set Outlook 2003 to not show images on opening e-mails, just boxes with the label "Right click here to download pictures. To help protect your privacy, Outlook prevented download of some pictures in this message." I normally click the gray bar at
 the top that downloads them all. Once the pictures are downloaded, either closing or deleting the displayed e-mail opens a pop-up message box with accompanying dingie. It is the downloading of pictures that activates the sound.
<br />
<br />
Please, Sir, I have been a good boy and done everything I was told to do but it still beeps at me. Why is it so angry?<br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>It might be that IPv6 is on and supported by the network.</p>
<p>Scan your computer and make sure that it is clean from viruses and malwares.</p>
<p>Then, try this.</p>
<p><strong>WinSock and TCP/IP Refresh.</strong> <br />
<br />
Type <strong>Cmd</strong> in the Start Search text box.<br />
<br />
Press Ctrl-Shift-Enter keyboard shortcut to run a&nbsp; Command Prompt as an Administrator.&nbsp; Allow elevation.<br />
<br />
Type <strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> in the Command Prompt , and then press the Enter key.<br />
<br />
Do the same process for refreshing the TCP/IP just replace the typed command with.<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh interface ipv4 reset</strong> &nbsp; press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>netsh interface ipv6 reset</strong> &nbsp; press Enter<br />
<br />
<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong> &nbsp; press Enter<br />
<br />
Restart your Computer.<br />

<h2>            Skype won&#39;t connect</h2>
                    <p>First time I've used Skype in a while, possibly the first time I've used it on this computer.&nbsp; Definitely the first time I've used it on Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Keeps saying "Skype can't connect".&nbsp; Diagnosis Wizard says basically the same thing.&nbsp; "Turn off and wait 2 minutes."&nbsp; Yeah, that didn't work.&nbsp; (Wait 2 minutes!?!?!&nbsp; Is this the stone age!?!?!)</p>
<p>2) Can't find out what my Skype name is.&nbsp; When I try to create a new one, (using the old e-mail), I get the previously mentioned "Can't Connect" message.</p>
<p>3) If I try to change the password, it tries to change my Microsoft Account Password, which I don't want to do.&nbsp; Not helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help.</p>

<p>Make sure you are running Genuine Windows . That's first step to peotect against hackers. Then update Windows and install latest Windows Service pack(if any). Make sure your Windows Firewall is on, log on to:</p>
<p>XP: <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a></p>

<p>and perform full system scan using internet explorer. It should show some threats and remove them. If you don't have any Anti-Virus try to install one such as Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>

<p><span>Hi robertsmills2008:<br />
<br />
Re-format your PC totally, and zero the disks and sectors. <br />
Turn off the Internet and buy a new router and setup a <br />
more secure network environment at home, and please <br />
install hardware based firewalls and Commodo® Firewall, <br />
also equip your PC with good AV program and, ask you<br />
Internet Deliverer if they can renew your ISP and <br />
IP-address information. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance,
<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>

            Office (Word) 2016 is a standalone product. If you buy one license, you can put it on one machine. You can uninstall it from the desktop, and put it on the laptop if you'd like, but that's probably not going to help you. 
<br />
<br />Office 365 may be the way to go if you need it on more than 1 pc.

            It depends upon which version have you bought.
<br />
<br />1. If you have bought Word standalone, then the license is for only 1 computer. You can't put on another.
<br />
<br />2. If you have bought Office 365 Home - Then license is for 15 devices - 5 computers + 5 tablets + 5 phones
<br />
<br />3. If you have bought any other version - Only one computer (+phone and tablets depending upon the version)

<h2>            Windows 8 always shows Blue screen</h2>
                    HI!<br />
<br />
Since I've installed Windows 8 I have PC crashes. No matter what i'm doing - for example installing a program or chatting sometimes it shows me a Blue screen then collects information to 100% and don't restart if I use the PC button. What's wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            <p><span>Hi TsvetanTsvetanov, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to know that you are facing Bluescreen issues since the installation of Windows 8. It would be helpful if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the system?</p>
<p>2. Did you perform an Upgrade or Clean installation?</p>
<p>3. Have you updated all the device drivers to the latest version?</p>
<p>2. Do you receive any error codes or messages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span>You may check the <strong><span>Event Viewer </span></strong>for any error logs relating to the Bluescreen crash.<br />
<strong><span>a</span></strong><b>.</b> Right click at the bottom left of the desktop.<br />
<strong><span>b</span></strong><b>.</b> Select <strong><span>Event viewer.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>c.</span></strong></span> Look for any error messages related to the issue<strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p><span>Unplug all the external devices connected to your system (except the Keyboard and mouse) and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p>You may refer to the computer manufacturer website and install the latest version of Chipset, Display, Sound and Network card drivers.</p>
<p>If Windows 8 drivers are not available, you may install Windows 7 drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span>a. Download the drivers from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click on the driver and click on <b>‘properties’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the <b>‘compatibility’</b> tab and check the box <b>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</b> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on <b>‘Apply’</b> and click <b>‘OK’</b> to install it.</span></p>
<p>For further information, refer the article:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What if a device isn't installed properly?</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3:</p>
<p><span>You may try running a memory Diagnostic test and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <b>Windows logo button and F key</b> on your keyboard. </span></p>
<p><span>b. In this window, you can find a small search bar. In this search bar enter
<b>Diagnose your computer’s memory problem, </b>click on <b>search button </b>and search using
<b>Settings</b> option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>If the issue persists, <span>Place the computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d. On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e. On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. On the <b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g. Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services.<b><br />
a. </b></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<b><br />
</b></span><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items<b>.<br />
</b></span><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns.<b><br />
</b></span><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the<b> Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the<b> Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem.<b><br />
</b></span><span>Once you determine that the startup item or the service that is causing the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check
 box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            This is ludicrous answer. Did you not read the fact that the machine didn't boot up? And you're a tech. That's the problem with windows, all talk and no action.&nbsp;&nbsp; Pay attention.<br />

<p>The chances are it would not boot anyway as the drivers are for the old Motherboard.</p>
<p>You clean install on a new machine.</p>
<p>But first check if the new laptop manufacturer supports ans supplies Windows 7 drivers for your new model number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we get to the license rules:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>

    <title>Merge Accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morganmccrary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merge Accounts</h2>
                    I just bought a new laptop and did not realize that on my former laptop, my Microsoft account was linked to a different email. Thus, when I was setting up my new laptop, I used the email that I thought I had used, but now I have two separate Microsoft
 Accounts. What I need to do, is change the email on Account 1 to the email that I am using for Account 2. It doesn't let me however because it tells me that the account is already in use. Is there a way to make Account 1 my primary account without losing any
 information etc that I have on Account 2?

            Hello Morgan,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Why Don't you want tu use account 2 instead of account 1 or in addition to ?
<br />What I suggest is to copy files from Account 2 to Account 1 using File Explorer.
<br />But if yu bought apps on MS Store on Account 2, you can't transfer them to another account.       
        </p>

            Hi Morgan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You cannot merge accounts yet.  
<br />
<br />You can add a new non-MS account email to any MS Account and then make it primary to replace the present one.  But since you already have another MS Account email it couldn't be used that way.
<br />
<br />So in that case the solution would be to go into Windows 10 Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info and choose the link to Sign in with a Local Account to convert it temporarily to a Local Account.  Restart PC, go back to the same place and click the link which has replaced it to Sign in with a Microsoft Account and enter the desired MS Account info.  This allows you to use the same exact Windows 10 account but swap it for another MS Account.
<br />
<br />If the links are not present then you'll need to create a new MS Account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People with the desired account, sign in to set it up , move your files over, test all programs run correctly, then when ready delete the old account in th same place.    
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

<p>Patricia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. Account 1 has my subscriptions on it that I need to use such as Microsoft Office etc. I haven't bought any apps in the store however, so I don't think that's an issue. The email I am using on Account 1 is an old email address that
 I deleted months ago so I didn't realize that I had used it to sign up for this account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Would it also be possible to move everything over from Account 2 to Account 1, then delete Account 2 and change the primary email on Account 1 so that it is the right email address? I would just have to wait the 60 or 90 days Account 2 to be fully deleted
 before I can use it correct?</p>

            I cannot say for sure that the waiting period is even reliable as I have seen if not work in the past..<br /><br />So it would be better to keep the existing account by changing it to a local account and then changing it back to the desired MS account. Do you not have those links available?

<h2>            The time for 360&#42; gun controllers is now</h2>
                    
<p>A proper gun on xbox 360 would be awesome. And i think kinect may have some potentials, perhaps integrated on a more minor level to enhance a gun controller. However, xbox seems to be sticking to no physical items, even if to its detriment, so i propose,
 why even include kinect. I have done a decent bit of research to find what potentials are out and in development. Here is what pro-xbox-gun-controller fans should check out and get xbox to evaluate. First the
<strong>Mag Gun Controller</strong>, which has only barely hit the market, it is most like what people are probably looking for, however it has a few flaws. In the most recent footage of its use, there is evident minor lag, and appears to be issues with turning
 around 360*. The controller has all buttons of an xbox controller except the right stick, which is replaced by something built into the gun, so you point up with gun and on-screen you look up. This system could potentially be perfected to remove these faults.
 This is also probably cheaper than the alternative i am about to explain. Currently in development by someone else is something totally awesome, i am so excited of its possibilities, but alas the company won't even say proposed release dates. It is called
 the <strong>Microvision Pico Projection Gun</strong>, but more recently they have upgraded the gun and now call its development
<strong>Project Tuatara</strong>, it will blow your mind! It now has no lag, is wireless, and has always worked full 360* as is needed in games, XBOX GET INVOLVED IT'S THE FUTURE OF FPS!!!</p>

<p>i am not talking about those old light guns, this is not duck hunt, this is a full 360 degrees on screen turn capacity, gyro-based replacement of the right stick on the controller, which controls head movement (where you look). It will make games more realistic,
 more immersive, more fun. I am sure there is a huge market out there for this, if the price is right. If you still don't know what i am talking about then i will state my intentions from the first posts thick bold words, by saying: look them up. THE FUTURE
 OF FPS IS MODERN GYROSCOPIC BASED GUN SHAPED CONTROLLERS.</p>
<p>Incase anyone is still too lazy to look, i will just let you know these guns were tested on real FPS games like Flashpoint and COD titles.</p>

<p>I dunno. I couldn't get any of the guns to work on the last Gen systems with HD enabled. Probably even worse now with 1080p. Too bad cause the replica Beretta (was not available in the US) was amazing.</p>

<p>Why do people just not even read what is written? (lazy, simple or american?)</p>
<p>I never said make FPS fully Kinect, that's just ridiculous. I said incorporate eg: throw grenade or give orders. But ultimately i even said it is not really needed.</p>
<p>I never said use a light gun, and even said my first suggestion had its faults.</p>
<p>It was my second suggestion that really interests me.</p>
<p>If any of you actually checked it out, you would be on my side.</p>
<p>It has been very popular at E3 and whatever those games shows are called.</p>

            <p><span>I'm only using file explorer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Because since I discovered the original value of the registry entry I amended to be have contained PianSa (loc), which was a local account I created for fixup but not anymore, I decided to search the temp directory containing that value and delete it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I searched the temp directory for one that includes that value and delete it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And that's one value that I found.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, when I was trying to delete it, I wouldn't be allowed to saying the above message.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But then I couldn't find anything that's open.<span>&nbsp; </span>It must be because I have amended the registry key from value PianSa (loc) to %USERPROFILE% right?<span>&nbsp;
</span>It turns out the pathname is the same except for the username.</span></p>

<h2>            Computers in same workgroup not seeing each other</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 Windows 10 desktops which I use for my home office.&nbsp; I recently swapped their physical positions.&nbsp; Now, neither will see each other when I try to map drives from one to the other, and when I try to set up a network printer.&nbsp; Other than a change
 in positions, which required a change in Ethernet cables, nothing else has changed.&nbsp; Both are connected to the same router.&nbsp; Here's what I've done to address the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Checked workgroup name.&nbsp; Both connected to same workgroup.</li><li>Checked sharing options:&nbsp; Both have network discovery, file &amp; printer sharing turned on.&nbsp; Password-protected sharing is off.</li><li>Rebooted router.&nbsp; Rebooted satellite modem.</li><li>Connected both computers to one switch fed by satellite modem.&nbsp; Rebooted both.</li><li>Set up both computers with static IPv4 addresses.</li><li>Tried using a different router with both computers connected to Ethernet ports on router.</li><li>Flushed DNS cache.</li><li>Used the Windows 10 network reset tool on both computers.</li><li>Restarted both computers numerous times.</li><li>Checked to be sure that each computer has a different name.</li><li>Checked to be sure that Windows is activated on both computers.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what else to try.&nbsp; I have a Windows 7 notebook computer which is connected wirelessly to the router to which the desktops are connected, and each desktop sees it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I've reverted to the original router, both computers connected by Ethernet cable to that router, dynamic IPv4 address.&nbsp; Still no connectivity between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why will these two computers not see each other, given the connection as described?</p>
