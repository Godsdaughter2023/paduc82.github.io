            Hi Anil, 
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your PC? I want you to turn the PC off, and upon boot up, tap the “esc” key. I want to see if you see something along the lines of “system diagnostics”
<br />
<br />If everything is slowing down... I usually always think hardware issue. Could be a failing hard drive, bad MB, etc. 
<br />
<br />See if you can find the diagnostics, and run them, quick and long tests on any components it allows you to, and see what it finds. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>COD has become the SMACKDOWN VS RAW of FPS. SAME GAME OVER AND OVER with a ROSTER CHANGE. Im sorry, but MW3 will not see a penny from me. I will however be buying BATTLEFIELD.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-&gt; HOWEVER. If a special pre-order came with a special code allowing me to Kick Bobby in the sack.....THEN I would pre-order.</p>

<p>Whats BF3 got that warrants $60?&nbsp; Its not some giant leap forward for fps either.&nbsp; Its all up to what suits your tastes.&nbsp; Personally NO shooter is worth $60.&nbsp; None of them offer the content of say a Elder Scrolls or ME, but unfortunately $60 is the going

<p>I don't agree with the statement that no shooter is worth $60. Reach was worth it with all it's multiplayer modes, customization, co-op, good campaign, and so on. Gears 3 and Battlefield 3 also look like they're worth it to me. I'll say MOST shooters aren't
 worth 60, but there are some.</p>
<p>I agree with you about games like Elder Scrolls and ME in terms of single player dedication and the content they give you there which is really unmatched in any other genre. Sad that these games don't get the same attention as shooters. But you also can't
 forget that people like playing things together and &nbsp;a well executed multiplayer is also great content which require effort to create.</p>

<p>Im not hyping it as the best game ever, nor is any other fan of the BF series. &nbsp;What we see in the improvements to BF 3, and everything theyre adding to BF 3, we see as better than what the devs are doing with MW 3. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi TobyWolfe
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Take actions related to touchpad driver 
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Expand Human Interface devices &gt; Right click on the touchpad listed there &gt; 
<br />
<br />A. Roll back the driver (You will have to repeat the steps for all entries listed including Synaptics)
<br />Click Properties &gt; Under Drive tab, if Rollback Driver is enabled click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website (You will have to repeat the steps for all entries listed including Synaptics)
<br />Go to the website of the computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, you click Update Driver Software, in place of this, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />2. I would recommend that you restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br />

<p><span>I have a couple of questions, first is Ccleaner okay to use? Also whats a safe site to download it from? I’ve uninstalled Microsoft Flight Simulator Stream and reinstalled it but at times it will freeze up when switching from one aircraft to another.
 I want to uninstall the addons and then uninstall Flight Simulator and run a registry cleaner/repair. Restart my pc then reinstall Flight Simulator.&nbsp; thanks, Blair...&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Registry cleaning will not help your issue, and it won't help&nbsp;<em>any</em> issue because the registry doesn't need to be "cleaned."&nbsp; It's more likely to do harm.&nbsp; If you have a specific problem that you think might be related to registry settings, and you
 feel comfortable editing the registry, that's a different story.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't use the Task Manager to monitor the memory usage.</p>
<p>Press the <strong>Windows Logo Key + R</strong> to bring up the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box.</p>
<p>Type&nbsp; <strong>resmon</strong>&nbsp; in the <strong>open</strong> box and click <strong>
OK</strong>.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Resource Monitor</strong>, click the <strong>Memory Tab</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will show a graphic of the memory usage, in the&nbsp;lower <strong>Physical Memory</strong> section.</p>
<p>Hover the cursor over any item there to see a popup definition of that item.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Available</strong> memory is the <strong>combined total</strong> of the
<strong>Standby</strong> memory and <strong>Free</strong> memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the top section, you will see all of the tasks that are running and the different memory usage information for each task. Hover the cursor over the
<strong>Column Header</strong> to see a description of the different columns.</p>

<h2>            Recording device playback through ___ not working.</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday I ordered an Avermedia Live Gamer HD and everything was working fine. I'm currently using a Logitech G930 headset and I had to do a little loop in order to get audio to record and play through my headset. It follows as so. In the Playback tab
 the Headset which is meant to be a Default Communication Device and the Realtek Audio&nbsp;device is the Default Device and in the Recording tab the Headset is again the Default Communication Device and Stereo Mix is the Default Device and my problem lies in the
 fact that I have to listen to the Stereo Mix through the Headset and have the headset being played through the Realtek Audio. I noticed one problem in my trouble shooting and tried to fix it myself and also tried browsing forums for a fix. I can't hear the
 stereo mix being played through the headset but it is in fact playing as both the stereo mix and the Realtek speakers are producing sound. So I looked further into the situation and I realized I can't do any playback with recording devices at all when I click
 "Listen to this device." Level are all set to max, tried reinstalling drivers, disabled everything but my headset and I still can't listen to a recording device.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing to note is I can record my voice in programs like audacity, I can also hear sounds when I'm using the headset. I can also hear sounds through the Realtek audio when connecting external speakers. I tried switching out 3.5mm audio jacks and it
 still didn't work. A prompt response would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Found a pretty simple but annoying fix and all you need to do is disable both the onboard sound and the headset you use then restart your PC followed by enabling both devices again. As for the sound latency it's not really noticable in game but when you
 play back a&nbsp;recording the delay is bad.

            <p><strong>Will upgrading to Windows 10 affect other drives or partitions in my computer?</strong></p>
<p>No, only the drive where the upgrade is initiated from will be affected. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported.

<h2>            HP ENVY 15 Notebook PC, Headphones not working</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Headphones not working</p>
<p>I recently started having problems with audio on my laptop. It first began when I would be using the computer for long periods of time and eventually the headphones would cut out. If I unplugged them the speakers would still be working fine but when I plugged
 them back in no sound would come through. Sometimes sound would come back to the headphones after a few minutes but most times I would just restart and they would work fine again.
</p>
<p>Over the past few days it got a lot worse with them cutting in and out constantly and switching between the headphones and the speakers without me removing them from the jack. I updated my audio drivers but this didn't seem to fix the problem. I would still
 get very patchy audio.</p>
<p>Currently, the headphones will not play any sound when plugged in (they do work fine with other devices) apart from a few clicks as they are pushed into the jack. The speakers still work fine when the headphones are not plugged in.</p>
<p>I am trying to determine whether this is an software or hardware problem and if there is any fix available without having to shell out money for repairs.</p>

            <p>Hi. Please press and hold the power button on your console for 10 seconds to do a hard reset. Turn the console on and try again.
  </p>
<p>If that didn't work please navigate to the game under my games and apps and press the menu button and scroll down to saved data and select to delete all locally saved data. Your saved data will sync from the cloud once you open the game again</p>

    <title>Xbox Customer Advocacy and Exceptions Management Team leaves me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlmerlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Customer Advocacy and Exceptions Management Team leaves me hanging</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an Xbox One for my son for Christmas. I preordered in June as soon as they became available for preorder. I received it around Thanksgiving, and immediately wrapped it and put it under the tree until Christmas Day. This was a mistake on my part.
 I heard that there were problems with the Xbox One and that many had faulty CD drives. I figured it had to be a minuscule number and surely wouldn’t affect me. I was wrong. Christmas day came and my son opened his gift, and of course immediately wanted it
 fired up. We got everything hooked up, fired up the first game. (Forza 5). It actually played, until we tried to eject the disc to put in a new game.</p>
<p>That is where the wheels fell off so to speak. The unit would not eject the game, and would no longer play the game in the unit. Spent several hours on the support forums trying various fixes to get the disc ejected.&nbsp; All failed. Logged onto to Xbox support
 chat and went through the process of explaining my situation. I was left with a choice of sending in my Xbox one for repair and waiting 3 to 4 weeks for its return or doing an advanced exchange. The advanced exchange sends you a new unit (well new to you at
 least) and when you get it you put your old one in the shipping box and send it back.&nbsp; Of course there is a catch, you have to give them a credit card number and they will put a hold for the full purchase price of the Xbox on your card until they receive the
 old one back. This being Christmas and my son’s main gift, I really had no choice in the interest of my own sanity, but use the Advance Exchange.&nbsp; I was worried about the Forza disc being stuck in the game and it being returned to me. I was told by representative
 that they would put a note in my ticket and the game would be returned once it reached the repair facility.&nbsp; It all sounded good to me and I proceeded.</p>
<p>I received the new unit the next day, and packed up the defective unit and sent it back. New unit worked fine. I received an email saying the repair facility had received the defective unit and the hold on my credit card was removed. I was thinking to myself
 that for a bad situation this worked out pretty well. I was wrong. Four weeks later I had not heard anything back from Microsoft in regards to the game that was stuck in the original machine.&nbsp; I contacted support, and they told me that they would have to refer
 me to the Customer Advocacy Team and open a ticket with them. I proceeded with opening a new ticket. A few days later I got an email from “Jeremy” a Customer Advocacy team member who explained to me that he had contacted the repair facility and they could
 not find my game disc, but they would be happy to generate a token for a download version of the game if that would be acceptable to me. I emailed him back and said that would be acceptable. This should have wrapped everything up, but once again I was wrong.</p>
<p>Three days later, I had not heard back from"Jeremy". Maybe he didn’t receive my email or something. So, I contacted support again with my Customer Advocacy ticket number and asked if there was a problem. The representative told me my ticket was open and
 that my reply was in there.&nbsp; The representative then went on to tell that he couldn’t issue me the game token, and that to give them 24 hours. Unhappy, I waited 24 hours and surprise, surprise no response. Contacted support again, this time I spoke to a customer
 representative named “Ian”. Ian told me my ticket was still open and that he would flag it to be expedited. “Ian” proceeded to tell me that I was now in good hands and that this problem would be taken care of and that he would personally check on it and ensure
 that it was resolved and that I would get download token. He took my email address and my telephone number and basically pulled every lever in the book to reassure me that it would be taken care of.</p>
<p>And guess what, I still haven’t been contacted. It still isn’t taken care of, and now it’s the weekend. I know the first thing my son is going to ask me when he gets home from school is if he can play Forza. I am almost at the point of going and buying my
 son the game again, because while I’m upset at being jerked around by Microsoft Xbox support, I am absolutely furious at my son being dragged along for the ride. The only thing that is stopping me is the fact that I do not want to give them anymore of my buisness.</p>

<p>Well that sounds frustrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry you're having such a hard time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loads of ONE's are working fine but that's no help to you or your son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's one of those frustrating things that you're just going to have to get through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I encourage you to remain polite through the entire process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finally get your Forza download I think it would be fair to suggest that due to the amount of delays and frustration that you've been subjected to that you should get some further compensation.&nbsp; Have something in mind like a specific game, some
 MS points or a year's worth of LIVE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tell the people you're dealing with that you're not happy and you want to escalate this to Microsoft's High Level Complaints department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, if you've been reasonable enough you're bound to get some compensation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the hard bit is the wait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on in the end.</p>

<h2>            Unable to print a document in Portrait format on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: To print a photo of a document, with out it turning90 degrees, to be in a landscape format when I want portrait,,&nbsp;&nbsp; thx m</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to print a photo image of a document, &nbsp;(its in a photo format of a document like a will or a deed, and its been either scanned or its a snip), Well if the photo of the document is somewhat square, but i want it printed on a page for reading, I
 want it in a portrait format. &nbsp;When I go to print it and request Portrait, my pc keeps turning it so the document will be in landscape. If I shrink the size of the document to adjust for the paper width, &nbsp;it still turns the document to be in a landscape format.
 &nbsp;What happened to the good old days of Pc's when they did what you told them to? now they tell me what I want, when its incorrect..</p>
<p>So how do i freez the document in a protrait postition, and turn the paper?? or virse visa. &nbsp;thx, M</p>

            Hi- I have tried several solutions- I have a 2012 Envy 17-3270NR, product code A9P84UA#ABA.&nbsp; My envy still will not sleep.&nbsp; The display shuts off, but not the computer, and the only way to get it to function again is a hard restart using the power button.&nbsp;
 There also is a problem with playing videos stored on my device- they start out playing well, but then distort.&nbsp; And Firefox (version optimized for Windows 10) malfunctions if left open for extended periods- the graphics distort and I just have big opaque
 squares of color.&nbsp; My drivers are all up to date, AMD Radeon HD 7800M, Intel HD Graphics 4000.&nbsp; Help please?<br />

<p>
</p><p>My envy is newer and the x360 model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you gone in to device manager and ran manual updates on display, chipset, or other related drivers? I dont think that these are all coming in with Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My headphone jack was not working. I went in to DM and checked for updates for realtec audio adapter. It found updates, installed them, and my headphone jack was fixed. So do check driver updates in DM.</p>

            I went through every driver in device manager (dozens!) and attempted to update each one of them, but all said they were up to date with the exception of my synaptics touchpad and the Intel Management Engine Interface, the latter of which I downgraded
 earlier when trying another solution that was posted in the forum.&nbsp; Needless to say, that solution failed also.&nbsp; Laptop still not right.&nbsp; Starting to feel hopeless.<br />

            <p>I have contacted NIVIDIA &amp; Intel &amp; had long discussions with them to ensure that I loaded the latest, correct drivers for my system. Also I have reinstalled DirectX 11. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 on my computer. Really don't know what to try next. Both Photo Gallery
 &amp; my game used to work ok, but unfortunately cannot pin-point what happened to stop them working - think it might have been an auto Windows update as I haven't loaded anything else.</p>

<h2>            Missing DLC</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the season pass for The Division when it first was launched, but none of my DLC is available. I have played all of them before, but for some reason none of them are available now. It keeps prompting me to purchase them again. When I go to manage games it states that the season pass&nbsp;is owned and all the DLC is downloaded. I contacted Xbox support and followed the troubleshooting methods. I removed my account and conducted a hard reset, however none of my content is available. Can anyone assist? I really enjoy this game and want the full experience back.</p>

<h2>            How do I delete the Guest account on the computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Original title : default guest accounts </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hi, i was using my computer this morning when i got a message from my action center telling me that my guest account had been accessed putting my security at risk, it then gave me an option to turn it off, which i did. this is the default user account used
 when first setting up your computer. i then tried to delete this account but was not able too, only having the option to turn on or off. i want to get rid of this account as i don't use it and it unsettles me having received that message, i don't like to think
 that somebody else can gain access to my computer as this happened while i was online. i have Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 8. Obviously i can only create new accounts and then remove them, but not the default. anyone out there have a solution.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> shu zhe ng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Unable to boot after Hibernation by closing down laptop lid.</h2>
                    <p>This morning, after I've closed the lid of my laptop which triggers the hibernation action the laptop stops working thereafter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried booting into windows 10, automatic repair, and even tried to boot using media creation with USB but to no avail. The laptop just wont boot into windows logon, and even prompt me with "Unmountable Boot Volume" error once. Before this happens, the
 laptop frequently pops up an error with a SD card and a magnifying glass picture stating "No Bootable Device" after booting up from a shut down. It happens almost everyday. Currently, the most troublesome part is my laptop is unable to boot into Windows Recovery
 Environment(stucking at "Please Wait" with a rotating circle). Is this series of error are of the same category or is there any fix to this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help, any help will be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello, thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After numerous attempts, luckily I am able to boot into Windows by holding shift+F8. I've went to advanced startup repair to do the cmd fix you've mentioned. Even though, the next time I boot from a shut down, I still get "No Bootable Device" in on my first
 boot. The only way to solve it is to wait for the miracle to happen, after 2 hours it finally boot. Is it caused by the imcompatible SSD for my laptop. By the way my laptop model is Acer VN7-592G. SSD model: TS256GMTS800. My laptop is 2 months old and this
 problem starts happening since the first week i bought it. Please let me know if you have any idea whether this is caused by software or hardware issue. Thank you in advance!&nbsp;</p>
