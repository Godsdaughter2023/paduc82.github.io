<h2>            Windows 7 View Installed Updates</h2>
                    The layout of the 'View Installed Updates' screen in Control Panel -&gt; Programs and Features is nice if you know what section an update is in. However, if you're looking for a list of updates in order of install date (which is what most people with a decent
 IQ would want) you will not find it. I get so tired of companies fixing things that are not broken or dictating how the user should use the end product. Nice Job!

            <p>I may have misunderstood, but cant you just change the group to 'none' and then click the 'installed date' column?</p>
<p>
</p><p>right-click in 'white space' in one of the columns, click 'group' then 'none'. Then click the 'installed on' column header for the order you require.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>right-click in 'white space' in one of the columns, click 'group' then 'Installed On'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that's what you wanted.</p>

<p>I believe they're also, like Fifa are doing another 'overhaul'.</p>
<p>I'd like to see little bits, that just add to the atmosphere, such as subs warming up along the touchline. Generic-looking managers, resembling their real life counter parts stood near the tactical area, randomly waving their arms! Obviously won't happen,
 but I can hope.</p>

<p>Not too impressed in all honesty.</p>
<p>Gutted because I was really hoping for some sort of overhaul in the game engine but it really just looks like a slight upgrade from PES 2011 so far.</p>
<p>Here's hoping its an early build. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /></p>

 maybe thats why, although it has problems i still find it satisfying to score goals which is the main thing for me</span></p>

<p>I'm looking forward to it. It all sounds really good! I still enjoy playing PES 2011 today, both Master League and Become A Legend! All PES 2011 needed was better off the ball runs from your AI team mates, Better referees and more animations (Although its
 alot better than previous versions).</p>

<h2>            Headset&#47;Microphone - Front Pannel 3.5mm Jack - Problem</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi there :)</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Recently i bought the Creative "Fatal1ty" headset for my computer which includes a microphone.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have been playing left 4 dead 2 recently when it suddenly decided to stop working. I tripped over the wire not long ago, so i thought the wires might be damaged. I carefully took the headset apart but found the wires to be perfectly connected.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can hear sound through my headset, just no one can hear me.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I unplugged my microphone jack and plugged it in again. Under 'Sounds' in 'Control Panel' and 'Recording' it says the Headset is working and has a tick next to it.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>When i unplug it and re-plug it in, the noise level increases to fill all the bars then suddenly depletes.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can't figure out what is wrong, the wires are all fine, the jack in port is fine too. I have the headset enabled.. Any ideas?</strong></p>
<ul>
</ul>

<p><span>Hi Will,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How exactly are you testing the microphone if it’s functioning properly?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Check the level tabs and settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Plug the MIC and try
<br />
<br />
Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;Disconnected Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them and then on lower right properties.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure the proper one is enabled and check other settings - on Levels tab make sure
<strong>MUTE </strong>is unchecked and APPLY / OK changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See the link below for more information
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Connect a microphone, music player, or other audio device to your computer</span></strong></p>

<p>Okay on Call of duty black ops i can't connect to some of my friends because my NAT type is on moderate. How do i get it to be open? I live in Arizona, I have Cox internet, My router is a cisco linksys E1000 wired to my modem and my xbox is wired to my linksys
 router. I've wired my xbox directly into my modem and my NAT type has not been restricted, it's been open. So i know the problem is with my router settings. Now I've called XBOX live support and they've walked me around the whole turn of your modem and router
 wait 30 sec. and check if that helped thing. FAIL! I was told to call Cisco linksys etc. Now that is a whole another story but basically they've got a nice lil money making scam going on that if your router is out of warranty (Which my router just so happens
 to conveniently be) they won't assist you until you buy a new warranty for $25 or buy an entirely new router for $40 or so. Let me tell you I gave the supervisor a very explicit ear full about that. Didn’t do any good as I expected but it felt good to express
 my feelings lol. Once again, FAIL!! So i called Xbox back and told them the story of what happened when i called cisco linksys. Even the Xbox support girl thought that was total B.S. (i agree) So she said check the cisco linksys forums and Xbox forums to get
 answers. So i tried Cisco linksys and did some things with port forwarding UpnP or something like that, stuff FAIL! Itried Xbox forums and they pretty much say to do same thing, Go to portforwarding.com change some settings on your router, and guess what?
 Once again FAIL! I’m starting to get really frustrated with this whole problem. I know I’m not the only person who is or has had this
</p>
<p>problem. If there is anyone out there that can help please do! It would be much appreciated!</p>

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It's not possible to use an existing phone number as a Skype Number. You need to choose a number from our pre-selected range.

            <span>Hi Nitesh,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for the update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What are the other options that you get in the compatibility window?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try to install the game normally to check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue still persists, I suggest you to check in Clean Boot state as below and install the game, check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><strong>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” to boot the computer in normal mode.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

                    <p>Hi, I haven’t used Skype for a loing time and just tried to log in to chat to a friend but found the password didn’t work. When I tried to recover it, the email listed is not mine. I went through the recovery process but the email says that despite my answers,
 they cannot verify the account is mine.</p>
<p>I want to delete the account and make a new one rather than have them use it for goodness knows what. Mind you, I suppose they now have all my info.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do please?</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail&#58; can&#39;t compose or send e-mails from any of my accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have not been able to send emails today, 22 March 2014. The problem may have started earlier in the week, but I haven't tried sending mail sooner than today.</p>
<p>When I open Windows Live Mail, I get&nbsp;this very large message (the black lines are to cover up details of which I didn't know whether they would identify private info):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a5dc46f-9ed5-4ecb-8093-55486ce84a6f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do still receive emails, but when I try to compose a new email - from any of my accounts (yahoo, gmail, etc), nothing happens. I have no trouble sending email from these account via webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe related: I had a power cut earlier in the week while my PC was on. When I restarted my PC, it checked the disks (and maybe changed things; I didn't understand what I was reading on my screen and it moved very fast). After I logged in, I received an
 error message. It appears every time&nbsp;immediately after signing in to Windows 7. This is the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bc8c982-7c95-4105-8f06-5e127948bbec" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you click on 'yes', you end up on this page: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2715633/en-nz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2715633/en-nz</a></p>
<p>However, the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1 is enabled and it worked perfectly fine before (I didn't change the configuration; I wouldn't know how and why to do it). It also doesn't mention MOM.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The error message in that question is the same as the one I get when I try to forward a message. So it looks like I have to uninstall and re-install Windows Live Mail 2011; quite a challenge if you're not completely sure what you're doing like me. I have
 an extremely large number of folders (including storage folders). I really hope I'm not going to lose anything ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's past midnight here, so will try it tomorrow and let you know whether it solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else has any suggestions, they'll be welcome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, George222(2).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now my Company account can't be used to make purchase through Microsoft SE store anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas are welcomed , tried Store support, looking at many threads with the same issue...no answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the cart is trying to show something but can't ..broken links between gallery/Xbox design labs and the shopping cart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My account works perfectly I'm able to design one controller in the US store , but when using SE store the cart is broken.</p>
<p>It's clearly some data stuck in the backend not being able to show the designed Xbox controllers ..that we deleted from my gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried different devices, browsers, cleared the cache, cleared STORE app...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 crashed my motherboard</h2>
                    <p>I am so angry. I installed windows 10 on my laptop and desktop. Soon the got a blue error screen on my desktop, I had to restore it and uninstall windows 10. This week I got a blue error screen on my laptop and today it has crashed. I have to replace a 850
 dollar computer. I am NOT Bill Gates and do not have that kind of money on hand to replace it. It will take months to replace it .&nbsp;<br />
I am a writer and need my computer. I am so very disappointed with your company. How do I fix this mess?</p>

            <p>My computer downloaded a windows 10 update, and immediately started acting bogged down the morning after the updates were automatically installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following day my computer crashed and when it booted up, there was issue with even reverting my computer to the previous build. &nbsp;Eventually my hard drive would not even register on boot up, but if I powered it down the windows would try and troubleshoot
 and resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the hard drive, it was good. &nbsp;I pulled all my files from it, as a safe guard - and ordered another motherboard (old one barely had 2 years use on it) and hard drive (maybe 1 years use on it) just in case. &nbsp;Installed the new motherboard. &nbsp;I ended
 up needing the extra hard drive because windows 10 was too messed up to load and would not revert.<br />
<br />
Reinstalled windows 7 on the new drive, everything is peachy. &nbsp;Just lost hours upon hours of business time, the cost for parts... I expect some issues from time to time, but having a motherboard crash from an OS update is kind of absurd. &nbsp;I won't be installing
 Windows 10 again, which is a shame since it seemed like a good product - I just cannot afford to have to risk spending more money to replace or the week it took to get everything fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to 10 off the free offer I am spammed with while using Windows 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to initially boot to my desktop, which I tried to revert to the previous build of 10. &nbsp;It failed and said Windows had been shut down to prevent damage to my computer. &nbsp;I had no recent hardware updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure there is something in your user agreement that prevents you from being responsible for any damages caused while using your product, unfortunately for me.<br />

            Same here. Computer store just called to tell me it's the motherboard and the cost to replace is what i paid for the computer. Needing it right now while looking for a job. I reluctantly accepted the upgrade. Constantly in my face. Came back to it after
 and it was dead. Only a year and a half old, barely used. Microsoft is HORRIBLE. So many people are having this problem. Some telling me the motherboard crashing is not from an upgrade. Really? A year and a half old, no issues ever, barely used and Dead Right
 after this upgrade. I need it desperately right now and can't afford to replace it. Never again. May have to go with Apple next.

            <p>I love the way you people at Microsoft try to give us the run around and blame it on everything but your stupid free upgrade to Windows 10. I to downloaded the free Windows 10 and right away my computer would crash. I lost EVERYTHING!!! I NEVER had any problems
 with my computer before that. Then after I downloaded, my computer done nothing but crash. I reset it 6 times. I ended up having to buy a new computer!!!!!!!!!!!! In the meantime I got a recovery disc and restored to the Windows 7 my computer originally had.
 It worked great for a month. Now all it does is crash again and now tells me I don't have a genuine version of Windows 7 and it still continues to crash. And it is my original windows with the same key. So how can that be?</p>
<p>You better be prepared to have a lawsuit from several people. Including me. I want either a new Windows 7 CD and a complete clean of my computer to work correctly, for free. or a new hard drive with Windows 7 Or you replace that computer free of charge.
 No more playing games and no more give us the run around and passing off the blame to us!!!!</p>

            I can't believe there isn't a massive lawsuit going on yet over this. My computer is done for as well and during a time when I'm job hunting with a crappy phone. They care less. Disgusting. If and When U can ever afford another computer, it will be a Mac.

            Yes I love the way they are blaming us for the crash. Their Windows 10 was so wonderful. It's the FUTURE my azz. My computer ran beautiful until I downloaded the Windows 10. They will never take the blame Guess we will all have to start a law suit against
 them. And no measly check in the mail for $10. I will make sure it's worth my time. But I had no choice to buy one on payments. Microsoft owes me money!!!!!

            Same exact thing happened to me with a work computer that was just over 2 years old and the user hardly had any applications or software on it. &nbsp;Very lightly used. &nbsp;The computer crashed literally the morning after an evening install and Microsoft still
 insists that it was likely a bad motherboard to begin with. &nbsp;Common Microsoft. &nbsp;Stop hiding from this problem. &nbsp;They want me to pay $200 for a new motherboard and the computer was $250. &nbsp;Not to mention it has already cost us 2 weeks without the computer. &nbsp;The
 WORST customer service ever!

            It's amazing what they are getting away with. I may have to explore lawsuit options. There's got to be something started already. I don't have $375 to replace my computer as many others don't. Only a little over a year ol, download 10 and the motherboard
 goes. Psh. The computer repair people i took it to said the same thing happened to her personal Mac and that out Was because of the update. And yes the customer service is the worst ever. That was a nightmare listening to their script and yelling at the person
 to actually Listen to what i was saying. I went higher up and they assured me i was being transferred to specialists. Nope. Right back to scripted customer service ****. Worst company ever. Lying cheating thieves.

<h2>            corrupt registry system restore Blue Screens pfn list corrupt</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit.<br />
<br />
When I turn on the computer it BSODs before I can log in, then reboots and starts the system repair.&nbsp; If I choose to use system restore it BSODs to PFN_LIST_CORRUPT.&nbsp; If I cancel system restore it gives me repair details saying my registry is corrupt.&nbsp; I tried
 booting in safe mode as well to get the minidumps and BSODed there too.<br />

No recent changes in hardware or software.<br />

            I have tried the other options in advanced boot. &nbsp;When I try and boot in Safe mode (any of the three options) I BSOD before login. &nbsp;When I try and boot Normal I BSOD before login.
<div><br />
<div>When I run Startup Repair it starts to search for problems to fix and then gives me the option to restore from system restore. &nbsp;If I choose to use system restore I BSOD with PFN_List_Corrupt. &nbsp;If I choose not to use system restore the scan finishes and
 when I look at the details of the scan it says registry corrupt.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately I can't seem to find my windows CD. &nbsp;I packed it in a box to go into storage and now can't find the box I packed it in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I just sat down to give it another try and was able to get into the system recovery options menu. &nbsp;In there I was able to do a system restore. &nbsp;I restored to 2 weeks ago when I KNOW my computer was working. &nbsp;After doing this I restarted and BSODed again.
 &nbsp;This leads me to believe that I must have a hardware problem somewhere yes?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried running System Recovery Options again to do the memory test but I got BSOD saying System_Service_Exception. &nbsp;Is there anyway to test where I may be having these hardware issues? &nbsp;Or Am I way off in my assumption?</div>

            Fallout 76 should have been included on a card or piece of paper with a code on it. Double check all the documentation that came with it. If it's there, then you can redeem the code on the console in the store using your Xbox account. If the code was not
 included, then you will need to speak to the retailer where you got it from so they can help you get the code for your bundle.

<p>Hi RandomkidAC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. If you purchased an Xbox One X Fallout bundle, then you'll have a code for redemption included in the box materials itself, most likely located on an insert/flier. Be sure to look through the entire
 box. You can either choose to redeem the code via the console once you've signed in with your Xbox profile information, or you can sign in online to your account there and redeem it online.</p>

            There should be a card with the code on it in your box. You have to redeem the code in the store hub. After that you could download it. The download could take a while. F76 is around 53GB.

<p>See DaveM121's reply, and let me ask the following question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you want a second partition? What are you going to use it for? Many people do this for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a article I wrote on the subject a while back:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div>
<p><span>***********************************************</span></p>
<p><span><br />
How many partitions should I have on my hard drive, what should I use each one for, and how big should each of them be?<br />
<br />
It’s a common question, but unfortunately one that doesn’t have a single simple answer, right for everyone. Many people will answer with the way they do it, but their answer isn’t necessarily best for the person asking (in many cases it isn’t even right for
 the person responding).<br />
<br />
*The Terminology*<br />
<br />
First, let’s get the terminology right. Some people ask “should I partition my drive?” That’s the wrong question, because the terminology is a little strange. Some people think that the verb “partition” means to divide the drive into two or more partitions.
 That’s not correct: to partition a drive is to create one or more partitions on it. You have to have at least one partition on it to use it. Those people who think they have an unpartitioned drive actually have a drive with only a single partition on it, and
 it’s normally called C:. The choice you have is whether to have more than one partition, not whether to partition at all.<br />
<br />
*Some History*<br />
<br />
Back before Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (also known as Windows 95B) was released in 1996, all MS-DOS and Windows hard drives were set up using the FAT16 file system (except for very tiny ones using FAT12). Because only 16 bits were used for addressing,
 FAT16 has a maximum partition size of 2Gb.<br />
<br />
Hard drives larger than 2GB were rare in those days, but if you had one, you had to have multiple partitions to use all the available space. But even if your drive was no bigger than 2GB, FAT16 created another severe problem for many people–the size of the
 cluster was bigger if you had a bigger partition. Cluster sizes went from 512 bytes for a partition no bigger than32Mb all the way up to 32Kb for a partition of 1Gb or greater.<br />
<br />
The larger the cluster size, the more space is wasted on a hard drive. That’s because space for all files is allocated in whole clusters only. If you have 32Kb clusters, a 1-byte files takes 32Kb, a file one byte larger than 32Kb takes 64Kb, and so on. On the
 average, each file wastes about half of its last cluster.<br />
<br />
So large partitions create a lot of waste (called “slack”). With a 2GB FAT16 drive in a single cluster, if you have 10,000 files, each wasting half of a 32Kb cluster, you waste about 160Mb to slack. That’s a substantial portion of a drive that probably cost
 over $400 back in 1996–around $32 worth.<br />
<br />
So what did people do? They partitioned their 2GB drive into two, three, or more logical drives. Each of those logical drives was smaller than the real physical drive, had smaller clusters, and therefore less waste. If, for example, they could keep all partitions
 under 512Mb, cluster size was only 8Kb, and the waste was reduced to a quarter of what it would otherwise be.<br />
<br />
People partitioned for other reasons too, but back in the days of FAT16, this was the main reason for doing so.<br />
<br />
*The Present*<br />
<br />
Three things have changed dramatically since 1996:<br />
<br />
1. The FAT32 and NTFS file systems have come along, permitting larger partitions with smaller clusters, and therefore much less waste. In fact, with NTFS, cluster sizes are 4K, regardless of partition size.<br />
<br />
2. Hard drives have become much bigger, often over 1Tb (1000Gb) in size.<br />
<br />
3. Hard drives have become much cheaper. For example, a 500Gb drive can be bought today for around $50. That’s 250 times the size of that typical 2Gb 1996 drive, at about an eighth of the price.<br />
<br />
What those things mean together is that the old rationale of having multiple partitions to avoid substantial waste of disk space is gone. The amount of waste is much less than it used to be and the cost of that waste is much less. For all practical purposes,
 almost nobody should be concerned about slack anymore, and it should no longer be considered when planning your partition structure.<br />
<br />
*What Partitions are Used for Today*<br />
<br />
There is a wide variety of different ways people set up multiple partitions these days. Some of these uses are reasonable, some are questionable, some are outright bad. I’ll discuss a number of common partition types in what follows:<br />
<br />
1. A partition for just Windows<br />
<br />
Most people who create such a partition do so because they believe that if they ever have to reinstall Windows cleanly, at least they won’t lose their data and won’t have to reinstall their applications, because both are safe on other partitions.<br />
<br />
In fact the first of those thoughts is a false comfort, and the second is downright wrong. See the discussion of&nbsp; partition types 2 and 4 below to find out why.<br />
<br />
Also note that as time passes, many people find that their Windows partition that started out to be the right size turns out to be too small. For example, if you have such a Windows partition, and later upgrade to a newer version of Windows, you may find that
 your Windows partition is too small.<br />
<br />
2. A partition for installed programs<br />
<br />
This normally goes hand-in-hand with partition type 1, a partition for just Windows. The thought that if you reinstall Windows, your installed application programs are safe if they are in a separate partitions is simply wrong. That’s because all installed programs
 (except for an occasional trivial one) have pointers to them within Windows, in the registry and elsewhere, as well as associated files buried within the Windows folder. So if Windows goes, the pointers and files go with it. Since programs have to be reinstalled
 if Windows does, this rationale for a separate partition for programs doesn't work. In fact, there is hardly ever a good reason for separating Windows from application software in separate partitions.<br />
<br />
3. A partition for the swap file.<br />
<br />
Some people erroneously think that having the page file on a separate partition will improve performance. That is also false; it doesn’t help, and often hurts, performance, because it increases head movement to get back and forth from the page file to the other
 frequently-used data on the<br />
drive. For best performance, the page file should normally be on the most-used partition of the least-used physical drive. For almost everyone with a single physical drive, that’s the same drive Windows is on, C:.<br />
<br />
4. A partition for backup of other partitions.<br />
<br />
Some people make a separate partition to store backups of their other partition(s). People who rely on such a "backup" are just kidding themselves. It's only very slightly better than no backup at all, because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss
 of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: head crashes and other kinds of drive failure, severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes, virus attacks, even theft of the computer.&nbsp; In my view,<br />
secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer.<br />
<br />
5. A partition for data files<br />
<br />
Above, when I discussed separating Windows on a partition of its own, I pointed out that separating data from Windows is a false comfort if it’s done with the thought that the data will be safe if Windows ever has to be reinstalled. The reason I call it a false
 comfort is because I fear that many people will rely on that separation, think that their data is safe there, and therefore do not take appropriate steps to back it up. In truth the data is not safe there. Having to reinstall Windows is only one of the dangers
 to someone’s hard drive, and not even the most likely one. This kind of “safeguard” falls into the same category as a partition for backup of other partitions; it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common
 dangers that affect the entire physical drive, not just the particular partition. Safety comes from a strong backup regimen, not from how you partition.<br />
<br />
However for some people it can be a good idea to separate Windows and programs on the one hand from data on the other, putting each of the two types into separate partitions. I think that most people’s partitioning scheme should be based on their backup scheme,
 and backup schemes generally fall into two types: imaging the entire hard drive or backup of data only. If you backup data only, that backup is usually facilitated by having a separate partition with data only; that permits backing up just that partition easily,
 without having to collect bits and pieces from here and there. On the other hand, for those who backup by creating an image of the entire drive, there is usually little, if any, benefit to separating data in a partition of its own.<br />
<br />
By the way, in all fairness, I should point out that there are many well-respected people who recommend a separate partition for Windows, regardless of your backup scheme.&nbsp; Their arguments haven’t convinced me, but there are clearly two different views here.<br />
<br />
6. A partition for picture files<br />
<br />
Some people like to treat pictures and videos as something separate from other data files, and create a separate partition for them. To my mind, a picture is simply another kind of data, and there is no advantage in doing this.<br />
<br />
7. A partition for music files.<br />
<br />
The comments above pertaining to picture files apply equally to music files. They are just another kind of data and should be treated the same way as other data.<br />
<br />
8. A partition for a second operating system to dual-boot to.<br />
<br />
For those who run multiple operating systems (Windows Vista, Windows XP, Windows 98,&nbsp; Linux, etc.), a separate partition for each operating system is essential. The issues here are beyond the scope of this article,&nbsp; but it’s sufficient to note that I have no
 objection at all to such partitions<br />
<br />
*Performance*<br />
<br />
Some people have multiple partitions because they believe that it somehow improves performance. That’s not correct. The effect is probably small on modern computers with modern hard drives, but if anything, the opposite is true: more partitions mean poorer
 performance. That’s because normally no partition is full and there are therefore gaps between them. It takes time for the drive’s read/write heads to traverse those gaps. The closer together files are, the faster access to them will be.<br />
<br />

<div><span>*Organization*</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)"><span>I think many people overpartition because they use partitions as an organizational structure. They have a strong sense of order and want to separate apples from oranges on their drives.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)"><span>Yes, separating different kinds of files on partitions is an organizational technique, but so is separating different kinds of files in folders. The difference is that partitions are static and fixed
 in size, while folders are dynamic, changing size automatically as necessary to meet your changing needs. That generally makes folders a much better way to organize, in my view.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)"><span>True, partitions can be resized when necessary, but except with Windows Vista, doing so requires third-party software (and the ability to do it in Vista is primitive, compared to the third-party solutions).
 Such third-party software normally costs money, and, no matter how good and how stable it is, affects the entire drive, entailing a risk of losing everything. Plan your partitions well in the first place, and no repartitioning should be necessary.&nbsp; The need
 to repartition usually comes about as a result of overpartitioning in the first place.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)"><span>What frequently happens when people organize with partitions instead of folders is that they miscalculate how much room they need on each such partition, and then when they run out of room on the
 partition where a file logically belongs, while still having lots of space left&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(1, 1, 1, 1)"><span>on the other, they simply store the file in the "wrong" partition. Paradoxically, therefore, that kind of
 partition structure results in less organization rather than more</span></span></div>

<p>Hey @_502</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem, and after 4 LONG hours, I managed to solve this one for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>let's just make sure we are all at the same position:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Winkey + R to open the run window</p>
<p>2. type Appwiz.cpl and hit enter</p>
<p>3. click Turn Windows features on or off</p>
<p>4. our problem here is that after ticking the IE11 option and clicking OK, if we reopen this window it is still unticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also available through here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I did to solve it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>go back to step 4 mentioned above,</p>
<p>but when you tick the IE11 option, also tick some unticked stuff as well!</p>
<p>for me, Telnet was unticked, so</p>
<p>I've ticked both things at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after I did this, a windows update window appeared, and after that I was asked to to a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>problem solved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Xbox Live gold card trade with Microsoft points&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Xbox live cards</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 12 month of xbox live gold card. &nbsp;All the writing on it is in Spanish, it also says it's a product of Brazil. &nbsp;I was wondering if there is any way that I could trade it for Microsoft points.</p>
