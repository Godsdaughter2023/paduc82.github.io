<h2>            Windows 10 - netplwiz stopped admin access - regedit disabled Administrator - cannot reset</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I really need help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has a Windows 10 Lenovo netbook.&nbsp; He decided that he wanted to use the Ctrl-Alt-Del combo for logging on.&nbsp; He researched what to do, and followed a post on TenForums.com that gave 4 different methods to achieve what he wanted.&nbsp; He chose to use the
 netplwiz option.&nbsp; It seemed to work.&nbsp; After a day or two, he found that he could no longer update or install any options nor perform any operations requiring elevated privileges.&nbsp; Whenever the dialog to approve the use of elevated privileges appears, the Yes
 button was not only greyed out, but completely disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched into this and found various suggestions, including using the net user commands through the command prompt.&nbsp; Of course, to achieve the elevated command prompt, this had to be performed through the recovery options.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp; I investigated
 his account - had been modified to a guest level account.&nbsp; Tried activating the administrator account - no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I researched further, found the option to open Regedit via the recovery command prompt.&nbsp; Managed to activate the Administrator account (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\....\SAM - reset value 38 in the binary data from 10 to 11).&nbsp; However, the Administrator account was
 now the only account that the machine recognised.&nbsp; As we wanted to try to maintain his account, this was not desirable.&nbsp; Via Regedit i attempted to resolve this by reactivating his account.&nbsp; Failed.&nbsp; Now the machine only recognises the Administrator account,
 and will not allow the Administrator to logon - "there is a problem with your account, please contact your administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted all of the reset options including the factory level reset.&nbsp; Reset and maintain user data could not complete - not enough disk space.&nbsp; Reset all could not complete - "Cannot reset this PC".&nbsp; Reset to factory also displayed same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempted to boot into safe mode using F8 key.&nbsp; First time it raised an error screen about wiping the Temporary Platform Module (?) or TPM.&nbsp; I cancelled out of that as I was not sure.&nbsp; Since then, attempting any boot operation has lead to a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My straight up gut feel is that this machine is now totally bricked.&nbsp; However, I am wondering if there is another bofin out there who has seen this before and has beaten it.</p>

            <p>Thanks Pavan_N, but that was no help what so ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestions you have given relate to a black screen occurring on a Win 10 machine that is actually booting up.&nbsp; This device is failing at that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the first three steps in the troubleshooting link you provided:</p>
<p>1) Signed in - NO. Can't get to a login screen.</p>
<p>2) Recovery drive - yes the HDD was partitioned with a recovery partition - not that I can do anything with it, as the machine allows no access</p>
<p>3) Boot in safe mode - Read the second last paragraph in my original post - tried that once - no longer able to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a netbook style Lenovo laptop, with no external devices attached.&nbsp; It has not been exposed to any adverse hardware operations - only attempts to resurrect the Administrator account through software/OS methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions please?</p>

            Hi All,&nbsp; since there does not seem to be any answer for this, I have moved on to trying to rebuild the laptop from the downloadable ISOs.&nbsp; That has it's own problems - which I will detail in another thread.&nbsp; But just for the record, in case it is related
 to this problem, the installation stalls at the window where you choose Language, Time and Keyboard settings.&nbsp; None of the settings can be changed, laptop does not respond to any key presses, nor trackpad activity.<br />

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This saga is finally ending.&nbsp; Spoke with Lenovo Tech Support. We can to the agreed understanding that what appears to have happened is a hardware failure during the period I was trying to rectify the OS administrator account issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop was purchased in February, so end result is that it's getting replaced under warranty.</p>

<h2>            After upgrading windows 10 computer keeps shutting down</h2>
                    <p>Hello.<br />
I have TOSHIBA laptop.<br />
After upgrading windows 10, my computer keeps shutting down, but when i turn it on, nothing has been closed, like it went just to sleep, but it turned off. Sometimes it turns off after i am using it for hour or to, sometimes it turns off after a minute or less.
 I tried power settings, restored default settings etc. i could find on the internet, but nothing worked.</p>

            Hello Laura, <br />
<br />
We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround. Please confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation.
<em>(Type <strong>winver</strong> into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)</em><br />
<br />
Any changes made prior to the issue that might have caused it (aside from the update)?<br />
<br />
Confirm the make and model of your device, if you're using a PC, make sure to check wired connection for your monitor as this could be a connection issue.
<br />
<br />
Also, please provide more information regarding the intermittent shutdown of your computer. Does it automatically restart your PC after it shuts down or you need to manually press the power button?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we recommend isolating the issue if it has something to do third-party software installed in your PC.
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Boot to Safe mode</a>, then check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
We will keep an eye out for your update on this.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            Make sure you activated windows 10. The upgrade is no longer free and you will have to purchase a license--$120 for Home Version. Check with Toshiba for windows 10 drivers if available for your model. If no win 10 drivers are available, your computer might
 not meet the requirements for windows 10. You will have to either use the win 10 generic drivers which might not work or return to your previous windows version.&nbsp;

<p>I don't know.. but from what you have described, the computer is going into hibernation.</p>
<p>I might experiment with disabling hibernation by opening a command prompt (admin) and typing or right click to paste in the command;</p>

    <title>How to copy a directory with all permissions and junctions intact&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mean jim  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to copy a directory with all permissions and junctions intact&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any way to copy a directory with junctions in it and have it copy them as junctions, not the contents of the junction?<br />
<br />
I'll try to make a long story short, but I just spent a few hours cleaning up after robocopy and Windows 7's hidden junctions.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 installed on a spare HD so I can play around with it, get used to it, test things and figure out how I want to set
 it up before taking the plunge and replacing XP full time.<br />
<br />
Just as an experiment, I wanted to create a new user account, but put its user directory on another drive and use a symlink to point to it from C:\Users.&nbsp; I created a new user account called Test, logged in so that its home directory was created, and then logged
 out.<br />
<br />
I discovered that moving or copying the files, either in explorer or a command prompt didn't move or copy the directory junctions.&nbsp; I then tried robocopy since it has options to copy all security, owner and auditing info.&nbsp; There is also an option to "copy symbolic
 links versus the target."<br />
<br />
The exact command line I used was:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; robocopy C:\Users\Test D:\Users /E /COPYALL /SL /R:0<br />
<br />
First, it didn't even copy the permissions, the few files it did copy inherited the destination parent directory's permissions, and it added a strange permission which I'll get to in a minute.&nbsp; It didn't take long before it stopped with an error.&nbsp; I don't remember
 the error because I've rebooted several times since then, and I don't care to try again just to get the exact error message to post here.<br />
<br />
What happened is that there is a hidden directory junction in C:\Users\Test\AppData\Local.&nbsp; The junctioin name is "Application Data" and it links to C:\Users\Test\AppData\Local (the same directory it's in).&nbsp; This caused it to keep copying the "Application Data"
 folder into itself until the max folder name length was exceded and it stopped.<br />
<br />
When I tried deleting the directory, I kept getting an error that it couldn't delete the directory because it wasn't empty.&nbsp; I had taken full control of the directory, but I still got the error and the directory (from what I could see) was empty.<br />
<br />
Here's where the strange permission comes in.&nbsp; For some reason, the copies of the "Application Data" directory were set to hidden/system, and had the Everyone group's "List folder / read data" permission set to deny, which is why I couldn't see them, even in
 administrator command prompt.<br />
<br />
Once I got the permissions sorted out, I still couldn't delete the directory because the name was too long.&nbsp; Windows kept telling me to rename it so it was shorter and try again.&nbsp; I finally managed to delete it by renaming a few "Application Data" directories
 to "a" and then moving part of it to another directory.<br />

            <em>Not for the faint of heart, but this is doable if you combine a couple of tools in a Powershell script<br />
<br />
I think the simplest approach would be to use</em> <em>the Powershell Community Extensions http://pscx.codeplex.com/</em> for finding source junctions and creating new ones at the target. Then, use SetACL
<em>http://setacl.sf.net/ to save the ACL from the source, then restore them to the newly created junction.<br />
<br />
Should not be too many lines of code :-)<br />

<h2>            Need driver for Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 mouse for Windows 10 computer.</h2>
                    I just bought my 85 year old father a Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 6000 for his Windows 10 computer. I use them on my Windows 7 machines and love them. Is there a driver that you can provide me so that he can use &nbsp;all functions (including magnifier)
 and will install on his Windows 10 machine? Thanks in advance.

    <title>The touchscreen gestures on my laptop stopped working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meehow09  say:</h3>
<h2>            The touchscreen gestures on my laptop stopped working</h2>
                    I restarted my computer after installing updates and the gestures do not work anymore on the touchscreen of my laptop. The gestures work on the trackpad. When I touch the touchscreen, the cursor moves and clicks where I want it to, but it does not register
 anything once I try to swipe up or from the right to get the charms bar to show. Pinch to zoom also does not work as well as just swiping down to scroll a webpage down.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to restart my computer as well as restart it with no luck at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me.</p>

            <p>My new ASUS&nbsp;X202E Touchscreen stopped working shortly after buying it last month. Maybe it was the Windows 8.1 Update? I dunno. I couldn't figure out. Spent 4 hours reinstalling factory drivers &amp; pulling out my hair upon finding the solution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION that WORKED for ME:</strong></p>
<p>Goto <em>Windows Device Manager</em> (WDM) @&nbsp;section, <em>"Human Interface Devices"</em> (HID).
</p>
<p>Note, you will NOT see anything labeled, <em>"Touchscreen"</em> in the entire HID list.</p>
<p>Right-Click menu&nbsp;for each HID should look like the following list:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Update Driver Software..."</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Disable"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uninstall"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "--------------"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Scan for hardware changes"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "--------------"</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Properties"</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Obviously, if the right-click menu's 2nd item =<em> "Disable"</em> then it's already
<em>Enabled</em></p>
<p><strong>SOLUTION is to ENABLE each HID that 2nd item = <em>"Enable"</em></strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ALL OF THIS WOULD'VE BEEN MUCH EASIER IF THE DISABLED HID WAS LABELED, "TOUCHSCREEN"</p>
<p>but sad to say it wasn't... and that's why I had to check each HID if it was enabled or not.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Several Lenovo laptop users&nbsp;experiencing similar Touchscreen problems blogged about&nbsp;finding this solution &amp; all mentioned their BIG disconnect was NOT being able to see anything labeled, "Touchscreen" in the entire WDM.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully, your situation is easier just by downloading an OEM fix but that wasn't my experience.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now, if Microsoft will only allow me to download an image of the Windows 8.1 Pro that I purchased thru their online store 2 weeks ago, I&nbsp;should be on my way...</p>

                    <p>My friend and I both have separate Xbox one's but when we play together on two separate wifi's my games lag very badly.&nbsp;His games never have this problem, and if I play my Xbox alone it works fine. Just to&nbsp;reiterate: Two Xbox's on two separate wifi's - when playing together one always lags bad, the other never does. Alone both work fine.

    <title>Why do some of my Edge bookmarks disappear at times&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasseymour18901  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do some of my Edge bookmarks disappear at times&#63;</h2>
                    I'll be glad to attach anything anyone needs to help me, especially someone with Microsoft. Interestingly enough, my reading list in Edge never has any issues, other than the fact that it fails to sync at times without telling me, which I find out after
 many of my more recent reading list entries have gone away after I reset my Dell Inspiron 7558. Right now, I use Firefox, Chrome and Opera for my 812 bookmarks, all on the bookmarks bar. Keeping all my bookmarks of the entire east coast, especially New England
 and the DC area, right where I leave them is very important. I have my own way for me to keep them all organized and easy to find when I'm scrolling through them in the bookmarks bar, on top of searching for them in the address bar, of course. Most importantly,
 I hope Windows 10 Redstone 4, officially version 1803, will make Edge much more reliable as far as anything is concerned! I will install that as soon as I can, which is in less than 48 hours!

            Hi Thomas.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I don't think you can rely on Edge to sync your Favorites reliably.  So since they are important to you like mine are to me, I would regularly Export them to file in your Documents, backed up to an external  or OneDrive/Google Drive so you have them safely in the cloud in case of hard drive failure or fire. 
<br />
<br />Do the same for your other browsers or sign into them to Sync under an account you create.  I find this fully reliable for Chrome and Firefox, for example.
<br />
<br />As to the version Update which will sometimes fail to save these, I would also do it manually by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing Upgrade this PC Now which is a more stable method and avoids buggy Windows Update and/or the buggy Upgrade Assistant.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<h2>            Xbox won&#39;t allow me to sign in or add account</h2>
                    <p><strong>This problem has been solved with a soft factory reset and possibly restarting my router/modem. Worked for me.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks everyone who lended aid :)</strong></p>
<p>Sigh...so for the last 2 days i haven't been able to sign into my account on xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until now I've been super busy with work so i haven't really attempted to fix it other than doing a hard reset and resetting my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I've got 3 days off and i wanna play some Xbox...i figured "eh, its probably a problem on Microsoft's end. I'll just give it some time, maybe it will fix itself".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well i still can't login to my account, so i tried googling the problem. Apparently this problem isn't unique to me. So i tried the fix that seemed to work for others. I removed my account from my xbox so i could re-add it and hopefully solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well now i can't even add an account to my Xbox...it just loads like its attempting to, then it goes right back to the account screen mocking me...add account...add account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, hard resets dont fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However i am able to log into Xbox.com with my account just fine...as well as Microsoft.com, everything except the thing i want it to work on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>0x801901f4</p>
<p>That's the error code i received when attempting to log in</p>
<p>Trying to add an account gives me no error code...just doesn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please help me</p>
<p>Im out of ideas :(</p>
<p>Until this gets figured out, i guess it's time to start reading a new book</p>

<p>Hello Lummoxicide,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend doing a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a> being you have a good network connection. When doing this select keep games and apps. Once it done try to add a profile and if unable to post any error that you get here also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 freezes &#40;RAID&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ultimate-tester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate x64 freezes &#40;RAID&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since I bought my 2x 2TB I only got dissappointments.</p>
<p>1) Since MBR supports up to 2TB, and my RAID-0 installation has a capacity of 4TB I lost 2TB. I had to switch to RAID-1 to use the second hard drive (but now I have 2TB capacity instead of 4TB).</p>
<p>2) Windows freezes randomly. This mostly happens while writing to the disk. The first seconds I can use the computer normally again, the HDD shows as full: http://img87.imageshack.us/img87/3470/spacege.png<br />
When I keep pressing F5 to refresh, the amount that's available increases. When the amount is back to where it should be, the full computer is responsible again.</p>
<p>What did I try to solve this problem:</p>
<p>- Flash bios to the latest version<br />
- Upgrade/Downgrade raid controller drivers. I tried from 8 till 9 (intel matrix storage manager)<br />
- Update motherboard drivers</p>
<p>What is my current configuration:</p>
<p>- RAID-1 with total capacity of 2TB (exactly the same hard drives from samsung)<br />
- RAID controller from Intel (I had Gigabyte before (2 controllers on my motherboard), but that one has the exact same problems! The RAID controller is functioning correctly... It's something with WINDOWS)<br />
- Gigabyte GA-P35-DS3P Motherboard (raid controllers onboard)<br />
- Dual core 2,66 GHZ processor (intel socket 775)<br />
- Windows 7 Ultimate x64</p>
<p>My computer's score (note that the hard drives get the lowest score while they are the newest and while calculating this score the computer froze a few times):<br />
http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6812/performance.png</p>
<p>I would like to see this problem solved as soon as possible since I use my computer almost 10/7.<br />
While writing this message my computer froze over 5 times.</p>

<p>Well my first idea was using RAID-0 to get 4TB out of 2TB ( I HATE partitions and second drives etc.. I want 1 drive with everything.. all this mess with more drives makes me crazy) so now I have RAID-1 which comes in handy since I use my computer a lot
 and things may get broken so I have my backup..</p>
<p>Im almost 100% certain that WINDOWS will function normally when I break the raid and run on the single disk. But that's no solution.. that's just a work-a-round (a very bad one aswell, since WINDOWS should support this fully).</p>

<p>Update: I broke down the raid and disabled it in the BIOS. Now Im using the configuration before I had my new harddisks.</p>
<p>My WINDOWS still freezes up! Now maybe this is something else. I did some testing and now I know the problem only occurs when I am<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">installing</span> something.</p>
<p>Now also, if I try to remove a program in the control program, it comes with the following error:</p>
<p><em>An error occurred while trying to uninstall &lt;program&gt;. <br />
It may have already been uninstalled.<br />
<br />
Would you like to remove &lt;program&gt; from the Programs and Features list?</em></p>
<p>Pressing YES or NO makes no difference: the program stays in the list.</p>
<p>Trying to uninstall with CCleaner (at the tools-&gt;Uninstall section) it will work.</p>
<p>This error shows with EVERY program in the list.</p>
<p>Maybe some service broke? Can someone help me out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. I know this is not caused by a broken/damaged hard disk. When the computer freezes I get the same problem (the capacity of the harddisk decreases and shows as totally full) but ONLY for the harddrive where WINDOWS is installed too. My second hard drive
 shows up without problems and correct details. This must be something within WINDOWS. I guess some service..</p>

<p>I can't seem to make anything usefull out of that post:</p>
<p>1) I already broke down my RAID.</p>
<p><br />
2) Since I broke down my RAID I reinstalled WINDOWS 3 times. 2 Times where custom builds (RT Win Customize versions) and the other one was straight downloaded from MSDN (the 2 custom builds where modded versions of the MSDN version).</p>
<p>Since I use the MSDN version, the problem in my previous post (uninstalling software) has been solved. This was probably caused by a service or feature that got deleted.</p>
<p>3) I have a good anti-virus product. You guys will say it's the best of the world "Microsoft Security Essentials"</p>
<p>4) Why create an image of an installation that doesn't seem to function properly?</p>
<p>5) Same as number 4...</p>
<p>Problem is not permanently solved since there seems to be something wrong which I don't know. HDD tests all come back to me with a "100% working device" but in WINDOWS it freezes and then tries to reload the HDD but fails and gives a wrong capacity.</p>
<p>Now I'm not an expert, but is it possible that 2TB just is too much for a partition with WINDOWS installed on it? (since the MBR limit is 2TB).</p>

Yes I must say this crossed my mind. I reseated RAM, did the whole cable management again, tried other power suppliers, other SATA connectors, cables, power cables, etc.</p>
<p>You must understand that Im a member of million-dollar-pc (maybe you've heared of it) and I know how to handle the hardware ;) I like everything clean and nice but on the other hand I don't want to damage anything. So far my current build never had anything

<p>I did stress tests on CPU, RAM and HDDs. All three passed successfully. I also tested the hardware outside of windows.</p>
<p>Tomorow I'm going to do my last reinstall of WINDOWS before I just return the hard disks to the store and let them figure it out because I have no clue what this can be.</p>
<p>I am going to make 4 partitions out of 2 hard disks. My configuration:</p>
<p>HDD01 - 1x 1TB for the WINDOWS installation and program files.<br />
HDD02 - 1x 1TB for the backup of this drive<br />
HDD01 - 1x 1TB for installation files (software, games, maybe music too)<br />
HDD02 - 1x 1TB for other storage and possibly music aswell</p>
<p>Now this is completely the opposite of what I want (like I said before I hate partitions and I want only 1 HDD) but I must learn to live with it I guess!</p>
<p>If this configuration will work properly (which I will test of course) then I think the problem lays with MBR.<br />
Else, I'm going to return to the store where I bought the hard drives. Maybe buy some new sata cables just to be 100%.</p>

<p>UPDATE: The 4 partitions didn't work out very well. Windows still freezes. Weird enough only the partition where windows is installed will become red (full) and freezes while the other partition on the very same disk is useable (reacheable).</p>
<p>Now the only thing I want to know is if this is a software or a hardware problem.</p>
<p>I still have a few days left to bring back the HDDs and get new ones...</p>

<p>I have to say that after reading this thread completely through, you are looking at a hardware problem.&nbsp; I am assuming that you had a different drive working well prior to purchasing the two 2TB drives.&nbsp; During this process, have you been using the same
 physical drive to install windows on every time?&nbsp; Maybe there is a problem with the controller on the drive itself that doesn't like windows but plays well with all of the non windows testing you have done.&nbsp; If you have changed the physical drive between the
 two and are experiencing the problem still, then I would point at the controller on your motherboard.&nbsp; Maybe pick up a pci sata card and see if you have the same problems.&nbsp; This will at least help you determine if the problem is on the motherboard or the hard
 drives.</p>
<p>so, in short:</p>
<p>1. if you haven't already, try the other 2TB drive as the OS drive</p>
<p>2. If number 1 doesn't resolve the issue, try plugging in a PCI sata card and loading, if the problem goes away, you know it's your motherboard, if it does not, you know it's most likely the drive. (it could still be something other than the sata controller
 on your mobo if the problem persists after using a pci card.)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply:</p>
<p>1) Yes I did that already</p>
<p>2) I think for a non-RAID configuration this is not needed.</p>
<p>I sent the HDD's back so Ill see what happens with the new ones.</p>

<p>I have a similar problem on my hardware config - but it works OK with a 32bit system.</p>
<p>I have been reading the various forum entries here and elsewhere, relating to to x64 Ultimate for BOTH Vista And Win 7.</p>
<p>The problem is truly a hardware contention problem, which seems to manifest predominantly on hard drives or USB drives. Various freeze durations occur, but most notably, this problem seems to involve non-responsiveness of 30 seconds, and multiples thereof.</p>
<p>No-one has complained about this problem when using 32bit versions of the OSs, even when the 32bit systems have been loaded onto previously "suspect" hardware platforms that have this failure with X64. This very clearly demonstrates that this is NOT A HARDWARE
 problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further investigation reveals that this Freezing problem is only occurring on x64 ULTIMATE installations, and as any competent techy will tell you, that amounts to 1-2% of systems. of those, less than 20% will be Ultimate level installations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a major problem with the contention handling processes in the Microsoft software as issued to x64 Ultimate installations of bot Vista and Win7, BUT .. .. ..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft just doesn't care, because it recommends using 32 bit systems for everything, and the small number of us geeks trying to push the envelope with x64 installations are expected to just shut up and stop complaining, and revert to 32bit systems.</p>
<p>The bit I cannot figure out is that with all of Microdosft's resources available, they cannot narrow the field of investigation to the hardware contention handling code in Ultimate, and compare this with the Non-Ultimate versions, and get it fixed. Some
 reports of this freezing issue go back TWO YEARS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I say again, this is NOT a hardware problem. It is a software issue restricted to Win7 x64 ultimate and Vista x64 Ultimate only. The highest priced versions of these flagship softwares have magnificent flaws in them.</p>

    <title>Removing Phantom Network Bridge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guardian hope  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing Phantom Network Bridge</h2>
                    Hello everyone! I appear to have run into a slight problem after removing a network bridge I needed temporarily.<br />
<br />
I removed the network bridge via device manager by uninstalling the MAC Bridge Miniport device. However, at the time I didn't realize that I still had my "Local Area Connection" and "Wireless Network Connection" bridged. I was able to resolve the resulting
 problems by reinstalling the drivers for the two devices as well as resetting the TCP/IP network stack. Additionally, I had to remove the duplicate entries for the network adapters from HKLM\\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Network\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}\
 as it appeared Windows didn't remove the adapters properly - stating that connections with the same name existed.<br />
<br />
After resolving all of these issues I still have one pressing matter. The Wireless Network Connection still says its bridged. However, there is no "MAC Bridge Miniport" in device manager and no network bridge listed in the Network and Sharing Center. How do
 I go about resolving this?<br />
<br />
I have attached two screenshots below depicting the issues.<br />

    <title>System File Checker I can&#39;t find correct path to copy and fix - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System File Checker I can&#39;t find correct path to copy and fix corrupted file.</h2>
                    
<div>I was not able to install the Windows Vista Home service Pack update.&nbsp; I ran the System File Checker tool and it found problems with the wlgpclnt.dll.&nbsp; I followed the process below.&nbsp; When I did the icacls line, it said "invalid parameter "administrators:F"."&nbsp;
 My hard drive is at C:, not F:&nbsp; I entered icacls C:\windows\system32\wlgpclnt.dll/grant administrators:F&nbsp; What do I enter to grant full access to the file, and where is the location of a good copy of the file?&nbsp; I could only find the one in the windows\system
 32 file.&nbsp; I don't have a system disk either.&nbsp; Could you please help me?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong> , click<strong>All Programs</strong> , click
<strong>Accessories</strong> , right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong> , and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong> . If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong> .
</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</li></ol>
To determine which files could not be repaired by the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>findstr /C:"[SR] Cannot repair member file" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt</span></div>
<strong>Note</strong> The Sfcdetails.txt file contains details from every time that the System File Checker tool has been run on the computer. The file includes information about files that were not repaired by the System File Checker tool. Verify the date
 and time entries to determine the problem files that were found the last time that you ran the System File Checker tool.</li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>edit sfcdetails.txt</span></div>
The Sfcdetails.txt file uses the following format:
<div>Date/Time SFC detail</div>
</li></ol>
The following sample log file contains an entry for a file that could not be repaired:
<div>
<div>
2007-01-12 12:10:42, Info         CSI  00000008 [SR] Cannot <br />repair member file [l:34{17}]"Accessibility.dll" of Accessibility, Version = <br />6.0.6000.16386, pA = PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE_MSIL (8), Culture neutral, <br />VersionScope neutral, PublicKeyToken = {l:8 b:b03f5f7f11d50a3a}, Type <br />neutral, TypeName neutral, PublicKey neutral in the store, file is missing<br /><br />
</div>
</div>
If the System File Checker tool cannot repair a file, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>At an elevated command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>takeown /f &lt;var&gt;Path_And_File_Name&lt;/var&gt; </span></div>
For example, type <span>takeown /f E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll</span> . </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER to grant administrators full access to the file:
<div><span>icacls &lt;var&gt;Path_And_File_Name&lt;/var&gt; /GRANT ADMINISTRATORS:F</span></div>
For example, type <span>icacls E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll /grant administrators:F</span> .</li><li>Type the following command to replace the file with a known good copy of the file:
<div><span>Copy &lt;var&gt;Path_And_File_Name_Of_Source_File &lt;/var&gt; &lt;var&gt; Path_And_File_Name_Of_Destination&lt;/var&gt;</span></div>
For example, type <span>copy E:\temp\jscript.dll E:\windows\system32\jscript.dll</span> .</li></ol>

    <title>End of support for Windows Vista&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            End of support for Windows Vista&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've read on mutiple website that Microsoft will no longer give updates for Windows Vista Home Premium after April 10th, 2012. Is this true? On the official Microsoft page (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/products/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/products/home</a>),
 it says: ''Microsoft no longer sells <span>Windows Vista</span>, though we will continue to support it. It is still available from some retailers.'' And when I look on the End of Support page (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/end-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/end-support</a>),
 it only says that support for SP1 ended last year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm a bit confused. I'd be grateful is someone could clarify this for me.</p>

            <p>Hello remco8264,<br />
<br />
Please review the end of support for the operating systems of Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7 at the following link:
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/lifecycle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/lifecycle</a><br />
<br />
You would not get updates for Windows Vista SP1 but if you update your service pack to SP2, you will still receive updates.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>
