<p><span><span>Hello Teddybare,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It is normal that the ‘desktop.ini’ file shows up in the folders or files to be written to the disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But it would actually not be written when you complete burning the files to the CD.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you continue burning with the desktop.ini file included and check if the file would still appear after you complete burning.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

<div>All my pc harware and info can be found there. Also tried everything that was listed on that page for troubleshooting. Since then I re-installed my gfx card so obviously im running different vid drivers now but they are the most up to date ones. They do
 seem to have been the cause of one or two of the BSODs though. Anyone familiar with different drivers from ati that are more stable for a sapphire 4860 gfx card than the most up to date ones? &nbsp;<strong>NOTE</strong>: the bsods occur even when the gfx card is
 NOT installed.</div>

<p>Nothing? I have already done all the troubleshooting Spirit helped me with in my original post. Swapping out the HDD and doing a fresh instal of win7 ultimate x64 helped for awhile but it seems the issues are now back. I did also however swap out my IDE
 cable because when I first swapped HDDs the BIOS acted as if nothing was attached on master channel. After new cable it read the HDD fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible at this point a bad hardware controller? Perhaps the IDE pin system itself isnt reading correctly on the mobo? Any way to troubleshoot those or anything else?</p>
<p>On the four crashes yesterday each had different bug check strings:</p>
<p>BAD_POOL_CALLER</p>
<p>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA</p>
<p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the info is in the minidumps and also posted in original thread. PLEASE point me in the right direction if anyone can I would be grateful</p>

<p><span>Hi GL21,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After
 re-installing Windows 7, how long did the computer worked before you saw the blue screen again?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you noticed or make any changes after installing windows 7 until you received the blue screen?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><strong>P<span>erform a check disk operation from&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Recovery Options</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can help solve some computer problems and improve the performance of your computer by making sure that your hard disk has no errors. If system
 restore doesn’t help, then use the command prompt tool from the Windows Recovery options and then perform check disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To run chkdsk from Windows Recovery Options</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the command prompt, type chkdsk followed by one or a combination of switches listed in step b and c.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note 1:</span></strong><span> You need to perform check disk operation on C:
 drive. So, the command to switch to C: drive would be chkdsk c: and followed by switches as given in the steps further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/f = The /f switch is the most common of the chkdsk switches. It tells chkdsk to try and fix any errors it finds.</span></p>
<p><span>EX Type: chkdsk C:/f</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note 2:</span></strong><span> Answer Y when chkdsk asks you if you want to check
 the drive next time Vista boots (restarts).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/r = The /r switch tells chkdsk to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector is a spot on the hard
 drive that cannot hold saved data anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>EX Type: chkdsk c:/r</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Answer Y when chkdsk asks you if you want to check
 the drive next time Windows Vista boots. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span>If check disk finds any bad sector, the data on
 the sector would be lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall display driver, network adapter driver and sound, video and game controller drivers from<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe
 mode</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you’re able to boot the computer successfully from Safe mode, then try uninstalling the drivers of the above mentioned devices and then restart
 the computer back to normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device
 manager</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 display adapters.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the display component and choose uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Repeat
 the same for network adapter drivers and sound, video and game controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you completely uninstall the drivers, restart the computer back to normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Re-install the chipset drivers from the drivers disc that came with your computer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Is it possible at this point a bad hardware controller?</span></p>
<p><span>There might be a possibility of the hard drive controller driver. To confirm that re-install the chipset drivers and then check if the issue still
 persists. If yes, then you’ve a problem with the hard drive controller.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know the status of the issue after trying these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Hi, well one of the first things I did was check the disk but ofc I will check it again. As far as how long it took from a fresh install to BSOD i'd say around 3-4 days of light use. Also I didn't make any changes from install other than making sure ALL
 drivers were the newest up to date ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't had the BSOD in safe mode as of yet from this install but before my fresh install on different HDD i had several BSODs in safe mode including 2 or 3 that didn't create minidumps. I will definately re-install the chipset drivers.</p>
<p>I'm fairly suprised there aren't any updated chipset drivers from ASUS for this board. And since this is my second mobo of this kind due to a bad NB (specifically on-board video memory we believed), I wouldn't be&nbsp;surprised&nbsp;if this one might be failing as
 well.</p>
<p>PC has been off for a day and a half so I'll keep it up for now after troubleshooting and we'll see what happens. I will post when if and when something does.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>ok well i have had 5 crashes since last post. 3 were bsod rest were crash to blank screen(no video input my tv tells me). only one created a minidump entry. cant get win to fully start long enough for me to upload that one to skydrive at the moment. Is there
 a reason windows startup repair never works? wasted my time on &nbsp;that "recomended" utility.</p>
<p>anyways trying to get into safe mode so well see if that happens. will edit with new info if i can get it back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: ok back into safe mode now. newest minidump uploaded to skydrive but i dont think its going to help much. Also two of the newest BSODs that DIDNT produce minidumps did post failed drivers. One was atikmdag.sys the other was dxgmms1.sys</p>
<p>I did completely uninstall all ati video drivers then update with newest ones. The<strong>dxgmms1 is a Direct X file</strong> but dx11 comes with my win 7 so how is that even an issue? I also ran dxdiag in both x86 and x64 modes and it stated everything
 was fine. This is just frustrating. Might possibly go back to XP and see if any problems happen there but that is a last resort for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did run chkdsk and NO errors were found. I reinstalled my chipset drivers (which in this case seems only to be a NB filter, is that right?) before all these new bsods and crashes. No change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>EDIT #2: </strong>actually 5 new minidumps in my skydrive now from today. Two caused by driver verifier and points to hidclass.sys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, just in case someone feels like sticking around to help on this one theres another minidump uploaded as of this morning. I completely uninstalled ati CCC software and the atikmdag crashes have stopped (apparently a common issue with CCC)&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I recieved another bsod this morning citing BAD_POOL_HEADER. And HIDCLASS.sys is still causing bsods from the driver verifier. No help on that one either huh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PLEASE let me know someones opinion even if its wrong its more than I have. Don't be shy to post up your input if you think you got an idea. At this point i'll try about anything to fix these BSODs&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Downgrading from 10 to 7 ruined my hard drives</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting very stressed now. I've been left without a working pc for a week after trying to downgrade from 10 back to reliable old 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i told it to downgrade everything seamed fine until the PC would not boot windows.<br />
<br />
Repair from my windows 7 disk didn't work either. I took it to a PC repair shop, I hoped they could get the data from the drives before reinstalling windows 7. The files were inaccessible. The hard drive had been put into mbr format and could not be read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had to format a disk to get windows back on, and I'm now running software I'm hoping will get my files back. windows backup didn't work either so my backup disks are useless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a hard drive I haven't formatted with a lot of music files on, my entire CD collection is on there. Is there a way of getting back those files without formatting and possibly losing most of them?
<br />
<br />
It's been a very disappointing experience with windows 10. I won't be recommending it t anyone who values any data on their hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, </p>
<p>Vicky</p>

<p>You need to use a search engine to look for file recovery tools. There are a great many out there and some have a free trial mode to show you if any files are recoverable. You also need to review your backup policy. Irreplaceable files must always be stored
 on two independent media, especially when doing major maintenance work. a 1 TByte backup disk in a USB case costs less than $60!</p>

    <title>inconsistent internet connection after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garyzeiher  say:</h3>
<h2>            inconsistent internet connection after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I amusing a Toshiba S855D-S5120 laptop through a Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Router. Up until upgrading to Windows 10 (29 July) I was running Windows 8.1. My internet connectivity was fast with no glitches prior to the upgrade. Since upgrading to Windows
 10 my connectivity is extremely slow most of the time. I say "most" of the time because when I first access the internet each morning it takes a l-o-n-g time (guessing around 45 seconds to a minute or more but never timed it) for my server to load. My internet
 provider is through my phone service which is <em>cox.net</em>. I am using <em>att.net
</em>powered by <em>Yahoo</em> for my internet browsing. This used to be <em>bellsouth.net.
</em>Why am I using this? Because we moved form Alabama to our new home here in Arizona 4 years ago and Bellsouth was my internet provider for 21 years and it was a simple matter to just stay with this instead of having to create another new account through
 Cox. Anyway, I stated above that my internet connectivity is extremely slow "most" of the time. Again, as I stated above when I first access the internet each morning it takes a l-o-n-g time (guessing around 45 seconds to a minute or more but never timed it)
 for my server to load. When everything does finally load and I access my internet browser (Internet Explorer) as an example lets say&nbsp;I find say a news article that I want to read. I&nbsp;open the article and one of two things happens: 1) the page does not fully
 load and I get a message telling me either Yahoo or the URL for the site&nbsp;I am trying to access is not responding or 2) I get a message telling me a long running script is stopping the page from loading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me expound on these 2 items:</p>
<p>1) I have no idea what is happening here and I have no idea where to look or even what to do if I did know where to look.
</p>
<p>2) In my internet&nbsp;options I unchecked the "disable scrip debugging (Internet Explorer)" and "disable scrip debugging (other)" and applied these changes.</p>
<p>Let me go a step further now. As I stated when I first access the internet each morning everything loads extremely slowly. This first thing in the morning. Now, once I am on the computer for awhile everything starts loading fairly quickly.&nbsp;But once I close
 my internet connection&nbsp;and go back in later the pages may or may not load quickly. I have my History active and set for 7 days. I do, however, have the "Empty Temporary Internet Files when browser is closed" under Internet Options checked so these temporary
 files do automatically delete when I&nbsp;close the browser. Going a step farther, if I don't use my computer until say later in the afternoon or evening again I experience the slow loading situation. I tried contacting Tech Support but had to leave my phone number
 for a call back since the wait time was over 2 hours. When Tech Support did call me the individual I spoke with was difficult to understand and absolutely no help at all. I am hoping someone out there may have had or is having this same issue and will know
 how to attack it. I also went on the forum and saw several posts with this same issue&nbsp;but they had received no response as yet. If anyone out there can help me here I will certainly appreciate it. I'm not a computer whiz&nbsp;either so&nbsp;please take that into consideration.
 I have posted on here before and some of the responses I got to my issue where directed more at a real computer geek and not for the layman. No offense to any of you computer geeks out there. Only wish I had a better knowledge of the inner working of a computer
 myself. Not too likely for a 69 year old guy who still fondly remembers the Commodore 64.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> brooks in pennsylvania  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 East Asian Language support - sinilar to XP&#63;</h2>
                    With XP Pro, you go to Regional and Language options to add input methods (IME) for East Asian languages after installing Asian Language Support. Language Packs in XP change the languages for all&nbsp;menus and dialog boxes.<br />
<br />
Is this similar with Windows 7?<br />
<br />
Which versions of Windows 7 allow the installation of East Asian Support and East Asian input methods (IMEs)?<br />
<br />
Does the language bar in Windows 7 work the same way as it does in XP Pro?<br />
<br />
I do not want&nbsp;to install a Language Pack, since I do not want to change the menu language. What I want to do in Windows 7 is have the ability (as I currently do in XP Pro) to write emails and create documents using Chinese characters, and Korea Hangul.<br />
<br />
Which versions of Windows 7 have Asian Language Support?<br />
<br />
There is an answer to a similar question which did NOT address the issue. The person who answered this other question confused Input Methods (IMEs) with Language Packs. In XP Pro, these are separate issues and I believe that this is also true with Windows 7.

<p><span>Hi Brooks in Pennsylvania,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The feature – Input Method Editor (IME) is available in all the editions of Windows 7.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Type in Chinese, Japanese, and other character-based languages</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Type-in-Chinese-Japanese-and-other-character-based-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Type-in-Chinese-Japanese-and-other-character-based-languages</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can customize your keyboard for a specific language or format by
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-your-keyboard-layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>changing the keyboard layout</span></a>. The layout controls which characters appear on the screen when you press the keys on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before you can change the keyboard layout, you must add the input language and keyboard layout that you want to Windows. For more information,
 see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-an-input-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Add or change an input language</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Coming to the language bar query, the language bar in Windows 7 has the same features as that of Windows XP language bar.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To clarify your doubts and to get a better picture, refer the following article:</span></p>

<p>I need help, I just got Windows 7 on a new computer. Each time I start up the system it tells me that I need .NET frame work 2. I tried to download the program, but the system rejected it and said it couldn't be downloaded to 64bit.</p>
<p>I work from home and need to download Citrix, but the system won't allow it to be downloaded.</p>
<p>If someone could help me, I would really appreciate it.</p>

            Naman, I have tried to download Windows .NET framework vs 2 from the website, however the system rejects it each time. I have tried to shut down the auto update feature, but that didn't help either. The response is, windows can't "This product is not supported
 on a 64 bit system." Yet each time I start up my computer it states that .NET framework vs.2 is required to run my programs. HELP!!!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand how you'd love to stay connected through social media. There are several reasons as to why you have encountered this issue. To sight an&nbsp;example, it can be that the website is blocked or there's a third-party tool interfering with your browsing
 experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned that there are programs installed on your PC before this issue started, we recommend that you perform<strong> System Restore</strong>. By doing this, you can restore your PC back to its original state before this issue occurred.
 To get started, click this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17085/windows-8-restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and refer to the
<strong>"Restore your PC to an earlier point</strong> <strong>in time"</strong> section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the end result and if you need more help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Although the RESTORE system had been turned on all along, the only RESTORE point available was May 15, 2017(when Silverlight installed itself)-&nbsp;2 days after my last successful Facebook visit. I did a RESTORE to that May 15 date but it did not help. For some
 reason, no RESTORE points were made since 2015,even though I have often added programs. I am not desperate enough at this time to restore back 2 years.
</p>
<p>Any other suggestions? Thank you for your reply.</p>

<p>The problem solved itself (maybe with Defender updates). I had run 3 full Defender scans over time-the last one -while it was scanning-&nbsp;showed a yellow alert telling me it found an irregularity but after the scan the History showed no quarantined or other.
 Since it showed nothing I didn't bother to check if it was fixed. Anyway a week later I did a Defender quick scan that again showed nothing but this time I checked and it was working.&nbsp;3 earlier Malaware bytes found nothing. Thank you all very much for your
 help.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you able to open the .pdf files successfully?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you're able to open the .pdf files using Adobe Acrobat, then it is not required to associate a program to open the .pdf files as Adobe Acrobat is the default program to open the pdf files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In order to appear the program in Set Program Access and Computer Defaults, programs must be registered in the Windows registry. Typically, programs register themselves during installation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your program does not appear in the list, it has not been registered and cannot be set as the default program using Set Program Access and Computer Defaults. For assistance with this program, contact the manufacturer of the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information on "Troubleshoot Set Program Access and Computer Defaults" check this link:

<p>I just ran to the store and when I returned, I was signed out of XBox Live. I tried to sign back in, and was told my information was incorrect, so I went through the process to change my password. When I logged in, I saw I had 8400 extra Microsoft Points
 that I did not purchase. My email inbox also had 3 confirmation of purchase emails in it. If someone did use my account to buy Microsoft points, it won't reflect in my bank statement until later so I can't check there and Customer Support line was of no help.
 What do I do? How do I check what method was used to buy the points?</p>

<p>Couple things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your password is less then 16 characters the 360 console including the emulator on the One does not like passwords longer then 16 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your password is less then 16 characters and still having this issue try this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Load any backwards compatible game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Hit the start and select buttons (small round buttons on either side of the big xbox button on the controller). This will bring up the 360 guide it will give you a choice to download profile click on that and enter in your email and password. You may
 need to sign out of your account first by hitting the Y button while having the 360 guide up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this worked for you or not.</p>

            My password is less than 16 characters. &nbsp;My account isn’t on the emulator anymore because one of the steps on the other page told me to try deleting my account off the Xbox and re-downloading it as well as clearing the cache for 360 games. The thing is
 that &nbsp;since I cannot connect to Xbox live I can’t get the account back on there at all so there are very few games that I can even play without signing into an account on the 360 emulator. And just to reiterate I can still play Xbox one games online fine.
 However this issue with 360 games and the emulator and not connecting to Xbox live has been going on for at least six months for me.&nbsp;

            It says leave game, sign in (0 profiles), download profile, and mange storage. If i hit download profile it says “Can’t connect to Xbox Live. Select Test Connection to troubleshoot your connection. For more info, go to www.xbox.com/support.” Then it gives
 me the options to test connection or cancel. If I choose test connection then it takes me to the Xbox one network settings tab which says I’m connected to Xbox live everything’s all good and my NAT type is open with IPV4 and IPv6 active. &nbsp;By the way it is
 X to sign in on the 360 dashboard thing. Y Leaves the game. I also dont know if its important but I am in the xbox preview program.&nbsp;

            &nbsp;I can choose the sign in button but my account isn’t on the 360 emulator (because a possible solution was to remove the profile off of the xbox one and 360 emulator) so it directs me to download a profile. &nbsp;when this problem first started happening my
 account was on the 360 emulator but if I chose to sign in it would say it couldn’t connect to Xbox live so it couldn’t sign me into my profile.&nbsp;

    <title>Create image file on SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harroun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create image file on SSD</h2>
                    <p>Have been trying to create an image file on an external SSD drive (Intel 730 series 480GB). Each time I start the saving processes from the computer (Surface Pro3) to the external drive, it always fails quickly. If I change to standard mechanical hard disc
 the image file is created without problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting fact, before I upgraded to the Surface Pro 3 using my older notebook and desktop workstations. With Symantec Ghost I had the same problem. Create an image file to a normal HD OK. Change to a SSD and quickly fails. However I could do normal restore
 from the external HD to a new SSD on any of the computers. At the time I had thoughts that the software was older and did not like USB and SSD combinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with a completely different latest software and new hardware, like all hardware USB 3.0 versions. I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am scratching my head a lot of this one.</p>

            <p>The problem is most likely the SSD card itself.&nbsp; Those things are unreliable and really only good for general data storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With an image file, only use USB pendrives or regular hard disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 250GB SSD card and it proved to be unreliable with image files but has been great with regular files.&nbsp; Unknown why but SSD cards in general will have an issue or two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, if you got a CD that came with the SSD card, you may need to install the driver suite that is on it.&nbsp; You may also check with the SSD card maker's web site to see if there is a firmware update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I wouldn't trust a SSD card for anything other than to use for emergency backups.&nbsp; Use a regular hard disk or USB pendrive instead.</p>

<h2>            High definition audio unit code 10 no sound with hdmi</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Somehow the sound is hard to transfer to my TV/stereo using a HDMI cable. Picture, no problem. Had the same problem in preview, but got it fixed, oh'boy am I glad that the error is back...not!<br />
I am amazed how its possible. No, it does not work to uninstall or update, or restart. Its just hard to do anything when I cant deside how and what driver I want my PC to use for different purposes. Its not listed in the manage sound department. This is probably
 connected to the Intel chipset and drivers, but its updated and there is no other. Know my chipset but cant find it at Intel and therefor no other drivers... if thats needed. Seems like this is a repeting error from MS and hope they fixit and fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Have installed a new Intel graphics driver, but no solution. Have read that this problem have been solved with installing a intel win 8 driver, but that seems a bit wierd at this point for this version /win10.</p>

            Sorry that dosent help. I have tried everything... It worked in preview when I tried different drivers from Nvidia Geoforce. Now the system overrides and reinstalles the newest driver anyway...<br />
<br />

            The problem might be the Nvidia GeoForce (840m) driver. This was the solution last time, in preview build. Either i havent been able to find the right previous driver or the release version win 10 is different. All of my drivers is updated to the newest
 versions. That is sadly not the issue! Thanks. Now trying to find a older compatible driver. This is not what consumers should use time to resolve.

            <p>Nobody here will give you advice re cracking passwords. So, if you can't remember it, you will need to do a back to factory reset.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that unless you save all important stuff, it will be lost after the reset. Remove the drive, connect it to another system and make a copy of anything important..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your computer has been supplied with a recovery partition in place of disks..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font><br />
</font></span></p>
<p><font><span>For Dell, press F8 </span><span>on the keyboard until the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Boot Options
</span><span>menu appears on the screen.</span></font></p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu,<span><font>&nbsp; </font></span>p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>ress the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</font></span></p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to contact the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks
 for the model.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"><font> all</font></span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus solution. ONLY AFTER you have done this should you replace stuff from
 backups or install anything else.</p>

I have tried what you suggested but it made it worse...</div>
<div style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
I don't need my account to be in Hebrew, I just want to be able to see whatever is written in hebrew - at the subject line, contact info, folders in my Inbox..</div>
<div style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
At the moment all of those - when written in Hebrew - appear as square boxes</div>
<div style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
The only thing i'm able to do is read some of the e-mails content, and reply back in Hebrew (the subject line not included..)</div>

It became unreadable after the windows version upgrade on my computer - a few weeks ago, and since then I have tried everything I could think of to fix it...&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Well, found some work around by changing some flag within chrome browser, that improves fonts rendering:</p>
<pre>enter "about:flags" in the address line of chrome
and then in the results table, enable "direct write" (which is disabled by default).</pre>
<p>
</p><p>May have something to do with the default set of fonts on win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
