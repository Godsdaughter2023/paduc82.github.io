<h2>            How do I add shortcuts that will show up on all users desktops&#63;</h2>
                    I need to have the same shortcuts appear on the desktop of all users on each of the tablets that I am setting up. I can get the shortcut onto the Start button but not onto the desktop of all users.

<p>I suppose it could be masked&nbsp;with a hidden or system attribute or even possibly one part of a library of aggregate folders. The former wouldn't have allowed you to create a Desktop folders with the same name in the same place, of course.</p>
<p>When you open the folder using the&nbsp;<em><span>%PUBLIC%\Public Desktop</span></em> method, click in the address or path bar. This will reduce the&nbsp;<em><span>Computer &gt; C: &gt; Users &gt; Public &gt; Public Desktop</span></em>
 to a standard pathname like&nbsp;<span><em>C:\Users\Public\Desktop</em></span><span>. Does that reveal any secrets?</span></p>
<p>In any event, it would seem that you've found the folder for your common desktop items.</p>

<p>That'd be cool but sadly no, it gives you the awesome feeling that you get like when you finish the game 100%. Everyone can see your gamerscore, so the higher the score, more achievements you've completed and &nbsp;the more awesome you are! :)

<p>You use it to show the world how awesome you are at assassins creed 2. In all honesty Gamerscore has no meaning other than how many games you own. Take in for example a person who owns one game and another person who owns 50 games. Now the guy with 100 games
 has a gamerscore over 20,000 and the guy with one game has a gamerscore of 600. Now does this mean the guy with 20,000 gamerscore is better than the guy with 600? No. But if you really need the ego boost or bragging rights just go rent every game until you
 have beat them all. </p>

            It has to do with the file association to the tif, under folder options file types if you look down the list the tif file will show, opens with Windows and fax Viewer. The only way to change that is to install or find another program to associate with
 the extension.

<p>An XP Pro SP3 machine has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Picture and Fax Viewer </li><li>Windows Live Photo Gallery </li><li>Microsoft Office (2003) Picture Manager </li></ul>
<p>Whenever you want to print a single .tif, the photo printing wizard comes up, with a lot of unnecessary steps just to print the single .tif that was clicked on.</p>
<p>What can be done to just print the .tif intended, without all the extra steps?</p>
<p>Doc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change (or create) the associated "print" action for the file type:</p>
<p>Open Windows Explorer and click Tools &gt; Folder Options &gt; File Types.</p>
<p>Find the extension you're interested in, e.g., TIF.&nbsp; If it's not in the list, click New and add it.</p>
<p>Click the Advanced button.&nbsp; If there is no Advanced button, click the Restore button to restore to default.</p>
<p>When the Edit File Type dialog opens, you'll see a list of the actions that will appear when you right click a file with this extension.&nbsp; In my XP Pro system, there is a "printto" action (which starts the Photo Printing Wizard).&nbsp; If I click the Edit button,
 the Edit Action dialog opens and reveals the command line for the application used to perform the action, in this case</p>
<p>rundll32.exe C:\WINNT\system32\shimgvw.dll,ImageView_PrintTo /pt "%1" "%2" "%3" "%4"</p>
<p>So, you can either change the application command line for the printto action or (and this is probably a more conservative approach to start with) create a new print action with an appropriate command line.&nbsp; To test, I created printIV which is intended to
 use IrfanView (a very versatile free file viewer) to print the file. The appropriate command line for IrfanView is</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Irfanview\i_view32.exe" "%1" /print</p>
<p>Once you have created the action, you can print the file by right-clicking and selecting your new action from the context menu.&nbsp; If you want, you can make your new action the default action, which will then print the file when you double-click it (rather
 than opening the file).</p>
<p>The only catch with this method is that the application you select to do the printing must be capable of being invoked from the command line -- and you must know the correct switch and syntax to cause printing to happen.&nbsp; I don't know that information for
 any of the apps you list (except, of course, Picture &amp; Fax Viewer, which is the current default).&nbsp; IrfanView can be obtained<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> .</p>
<p>One final caveat:&nbsp; if you use XP Fax Services, you might not want to change the defaults for TIF files.&nbsp; Adding a new option should be OK, however.</p>

<p>Well, to quote Mick Jagger, "You can't always get what you want.&nbsp; But if you try sometimes, you might find, you get what you need."&nbsp; IrfanView is a far better and more versatile utility than anything that comes with Windows XP, but if you insist ...</p>
<p>Copy the contents of "application used to perform action" for the printto command.</p>
<p>For reference, this is</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rundll32.exe C:\Windows\system32\shimgvw.dll,ImageView_PrintTo /pt "%1" "%2" "%3" "%4"</p>
<p>Leave the first argument as is.&nbsp; Replace the second argument (%2) with the name of your default printer.&nbsp; As shown, this needs to be surrounded by double quotes.&nbsp; Replace the third and fourth argument with pairs of double quotes.&nbsp; For example, if your default
 printer is HP LaserJet you would enter the following for your new right-click command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rundll32.exe C:\Windows\system32\shimgvw.dll,ImageView_PrintTo /pt "%1" "HP LaserJet" "" ""</p>
<p>Note that if you want to print to a shared network printer, use the form "\\computername\sharename"</p>

<h2>            You must be an administrator running a console session in order to use the windows File Checker utility.</h2>
                    
<p>I can't access Computer management. So i found this thread</p>
<p>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/d38bb260-6088-44e8-ae4f-c164379c7e66.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the part i followed</p>

<p><span>Try opening Computer Management from Start Search Bar. Follow the location to open computer management.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on Start</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Start Search bar type Computer Management and hit enter and check if you are able to open it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command
 Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
</span></p>
<p><span>sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft
 versions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>But i ended up getting this error.&nbsp; You must be an administrator running a console session in order to use the windows File Checker utility.<br />

<p>There are several issues with that thread.</p>
<p>It is in the Windows 7 forum and you are in the Windows XP forum - are you in the right place?</p>
<p>There are too many suggestions in the thread that begin with the word "try". &nbsp; Try, try, try...&nbsp; You need to do, do, do and fix, fix, fix - not try things.</p>
<p>Never have I seen sfc /scannow solve any XP problem and if it ever finds anything to do, you have some other problem (it is a good time waster though).</p>
<p>The thread did not seem to come to a happy ending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have Windows XP, tell us you XP version and Service Pack, describe the method you are using to access Computer Management and what happens (or doesn't happen) when you do.</p>
<p>Has Computer Management ever worked before?</p>
<p>What is it that you are trying to do with Computer Management (it should still work regardless).&nbsp;</p>
What is the issue you need to fix?
<p>There are several ways to open Computer Management, so do this:</p>
<p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter (or copy and paste) the following:</p>
<p><strong>%SystemRoot%\system32\compmgmt.msc<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Click OK<strong><br />
</strong></p>
What do you see that you don't think you should see?
<p>What do you not see that you think you should.</p>

            <p>This first answer did not help at all.</p>
<p>I run as an administrator and the system still asks to run in a console session as an administrator.</p>
<p>I do not need any comment about whether SFC helps solve a problem &nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>I tested this and you do not have to go into computer management to start an administrator&nbsp;command session. It is sufficient to right click the command session icon and click run as administrator.</p>
<p>I suppose the whole thing is a poorly documented enhancement in Windows 7. The error message is misleading. This was the case in windows 0 all the way through 3,98,XP,Vista and&nbsp;Windows 7. Nothing has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any event the whole thing is explained in:</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Left click the Start button at the lower left hand side of the screen.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Type "cmd" without the quotes in the Search Programs and Files box</p>

<p>The problem turned out to be bad RAM, which memtest86 didn't detect.</p>

                    <p>Hi, &nbsp;i have just purchased an acer desktop and going through the installation and setup it shows that the product key for the pre installed windows 10 has been used on another device, I have contacted ACER and all they say is send the system back to them
 and they'll send another however I have paid someone to install my additional devices and antivirus and this will all be gone and have to be done again. &nbsp;Does anyone know how to fix this without losing all the work thats already been done?</p>

<p>The problem is really down to Acer and they should sort it out for you.</p>
<p>Uninstall the antivirus software.</p>
<p>Remove the additional devices and uninstall any additional software they may have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ask Acer about covering the cost of the additional work you needed to pay for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be another user has an alternative idea but I would think it unlikely. You can wait and see what other responses you get.</p>

<h2>            Selecting an addon scenery airport</h2>
                    Hi All, I have installed several addon airports and they show up in my scenery addon list, but how do I know if my added airport is selected and not the default airport? There is a second page to select an addon airport, but I haven't been able to get
 an airport selected. I hope someone knows the answer.

            <p>Which Flight Sim software are you referring to? &nbsp; If you are using FSX, then the installed add on scenery needs to be at the top of your list in your Scenery Library for it to take priority over the default scenery. &nbsp; FSX will read from Priority 1 downwards
 and of course, you will be able to tell the difference between the two when FSX is launched for that area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: &nbsp;your second page of add on airports. &nbsp; Are you referring to the Add on folder in the FSX directory, that contains folders for Scenery and Texture? &nbsp;But then, this is just a list of loaded add ons and are not subject to any page limitations. &nbsp; But first
 clarify which Flt. Sim you are using.</p>

            <p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Safe Mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs or not. In Safe Mode computer starts with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article to boot to Safe Mode.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below
 to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong><span>How
 to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</span></strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to p<span>erform a System Restore and check if it works:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This kind of issue usually happens when the Updates for the devices on the computer is installed. Thus, there is a possibility that this may conflict with/damage the existing device drivers and thus the device might not work as expected.
</span>To perform a System Restore, you may refer to the article below and refer the section “<strong><span>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</span></strong>”:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(104, 33, 122, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and
 also reset the recently changed settings on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

    <title>Enforcement page not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> feedmeyourdawg  say:</h3>
<h2>             Enforcement page not working </h2>
                    
<p>Hi... Not sure if I'm &nbsp;posting in the right place, sorry if I'm &nbsp;not. Just a quick &nbsp;question &nbsp;regarding &nbsp;my sons account. He received &nbsp;a permanent suspension about 2 weeks ago. The email from enforcement &nbsp;was very vague and didn't &nbsp;specify a reason. I've
 been talking &nbsp;to customer &nbsp;support trying to find out a way of contacting &nbsp;the enforcement team because we are unable to log into his account &nbsp;to view &nbsp;the enforcement &nbsp;history &nbsp;and therefore &nbsp;cannot raise a case review to find out the reason.</p>
<p><span>Usually I just click sign in, it logs me in and then we can viesuspensions and what he got reported for but now, when I try to log in, it just reloads the whole Page without logging me in.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Whilst I have chatted to some lovely &nbsp;people at customer &nbsp;support, &nbsp;no one has been able to help. We moved house about 3 weeks ago and he hasn't &nbsp;been online. The day he went online, he bought xbox live credit and made some online purchases... that very
 same day he received &nbsp;the suspension. We have moved region and I've &nbsp;since found out that we were supposed &nbsp;to update the region on the xbox, but didn't &nbsp;know we were supposed &nbsp;to... could this have something &nbsp;to do with the suspension? We have invested probably
 &nbsp;thousands over the years and I just thought it would &nbsp;be fair to be given an exact reason for the suspension, that's &nbsp;all I ask. Is there anyway of getting the enforcement team to look into this as I'm literally &nbsp;exhausted with trying to get an answer. The
 gamertag &nbsp;in question &nbsp;is GetPanzerSHREKT.</p>
<p>I would really appreciate &nbsp;any help with this as I don't &nbsp;know how else I'm &nbsp;supposed &nbsp;to contact enforcement. I've &nbsp;even tried through different &nbsp;accounts from different devices and still no luck... Thanks, Amy.</p>

<p>You won't be able to get any real specific on the general information on the rules that were broken. &nbsp;You should have received an email on the account that was tied to the account. &nbsp;If it is a permanent ban he loses access to all content and subscriptions.
 &nbsp; The only way to contact the enforcement team is through the case review on their website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The region change should not have been a factor it the decision of the enforcement team. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. &nbsp;Good Luck!!</p>

<p>When XBLPET issues an enforcement action, an email message is automatically sent to the address associated with your Xbox Live account. This address is referred to as your Microsoft Account (MSA). If you are using a child account, an email is also sent to
 the Microsoft Account associated with your parent or guardian. Each email message explains that the account was subject to enforcement action and links to pages that provide additional information.</p>
<p>In addition to the email message, affected accounts also receive an Xbox Live message that can be viewed from your Xbox console, Xbox.com, and the Xbox app on Windows 10. Like the email, this message explains that the account received enforcement action
 and provides links to more information. Note that if you have received a full account suspension you may be unable to view this message, and will instead be notified upon attempting to sign in to Xbox Live that the account has been suspended from the service.</p>
<p>Feature-specific notifications are also displayed when attempting to use impacted features or apps on your Xbox One console. The specific method of notification depends on the enforcement type and what feature or app you select, but typically include a notification
 indicating you are not allowed to use the feature. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I submit a Case Review?</p>
<p>Submitting a Case Review is easy, and can be accomplished in several steps:</p>
<p>Sign in to enforcement.xbox.com with the account that received the enforcement action and select the large box with an orange hammer icon, or visit your Enforcement History.</p>
<p>Find the enforcement action that you wish to have reviewed, and select Apply for Review.</p>
<p>Read the Case Review Terms of Use and agree by clicking the checkbox and selecting Agree.</p>
<p>If you are already eligible for a Case Review, select the green arrow icon. If you are not yet eligible, you will be presented with a short questionnaire. These questions help gauge your understanding of the Code of Conduct and associated policies. Upon
 successful completion of the questionnaire, select the green arrow icon.</p>
<p>Provide any details (up to 500 characters) regarding the enforcement action that may help XBLPET conduct a more complete investigation. This may include context around the activity or content that received enforcement, information about your game activity,
 or any other facts that you believe are worth noting. When complete, select Submit.</p>
<p>After submitting, an Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement agent will begin a thorough review of the enforcement action. This includes reviewing available data and re-examining evidence that contributed to the enforcement, taking into account any new details that
 you have provided. </p>
<p>Sorry about the generic response, but this is the info I was able to find that might help. I must admit that I am a bit confused as you must be signed in to the account to check its enforcement history, but once an account is permabanned, you can no longer
 sign into it. If none of what I have posted here helps, I am certain another ambassador, or official support person, will chime in and give us both a hand.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding so quickly, really appreciate &nbsp;it. </p>
<p>What I can't &nbsp;get my head round in the fact we have been loyal customers for over 10 years and literally spent thousands. Then to get this email...</p>
<p>This message is to notify you that your Xbox Live account has been subject to enforcement action due to a violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement.</p>
<p>This notification has been sent to your Xbox Live account and the email address associated with your Microsoft Account. For additional information please visit enforcement.xbox.com.</p>
<p>This violation was brought to the attention of the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team through complaints filed by other Xbox Live players or in the course of our operation of the service. After reviewing any complaints and other available evidence, the
 Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team determined that a violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement occurred and enacted the appropriate enforcement.</p>
<p>I think after all these years I'd &nbsp;be deserving of an actual explanation. I find it totally &nbsp;unacceptable that a service is taken away without giving a reason... did they receive &nbsp;complaints filed by other Xbox Live players or did they find something in
 the course of their operation of the service? And if so, what? C'mon Microsoft &nbsp;surely your customers &nbsp;deserve more respect! From what I have gathered on forums so far... enforcement &nbsp;dish out these harsh punishments but have made themselves &nbsp;completely &nbsp;uncontactable
 so you can't &nbsp;even ask why. You get told to go to the enforcement &nbsp;website through the account you have the issue with, but they take that access away so you can't &nbsp;actually &nbsp;log in... I can't &nbsp;decide if this cowardly &nbsp;behaviour &nbsp;or people on a power trip...</p>
<p>Please can someone &nbsp;just give me a straight &nbsp;answer about what's &nbsp;happened &nbsp;with my sons account and not tell be to go through &nbsp;the enforcement &nbsp;website &nbsp;BECAUSE I CAN'T.</p>
<p>Thanks again, Amy</p>

<p>These are the possible reasons for a permaban or suspension.</p>
<p>1.9 Are there things I can’t do on the Services? You must not use the Services to harm others or the Services. For example, you must not:</p>
<p>• Use the Services to harm, threaten, or harass another person, organization, or Microsoft;</p>
<p>• Damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Services (or any network or Authorized Device connected to the Services);</p>
<p>• Assign, resell, or redistribute any part of the Services or access to the Services, including the sale or purchase of an account;</p>
<p>• Share your account password or otherwise authorized a third party to access or use the Services on your behalf unless we provide an approved mechanism;</p>
<p>• Enable unauthorized third party applications to access the Services;</p>
<p>• Use the Services or any content on the Services for commercial purposes;</p>
<p>• Use or attempt to use any unauthorized means to modify, reroute, or gain access to the Services;</p>
<p>• Use any automated process or service (such as a bot, a spider, periodic caching of information stored by Microsoft, or metasearching) to access or use the Services, or to copy or scrape data from the Services;</p>
<p>• Obtain (or try to obtain) any data from the Services or related hardware, except the data that we intend to make available to you; or</p>
<p>• Use the Services or related hardware to design, develop, or update unauthorized software;</p>
<p>• Fraudulently increase the play count or otherwise manipulate the Services in any way, including using a script and/or otherwise automated process;</p>
<p>• Use unauthorized software or hardware to access the Services or modify an Authorized Device in any unauthorized way (e.g., through unauthorized repairs, unauthorized upgrades, or unauthorized downloads). You agree that we have the right to send data, applications
 or other content to any software or hardware that you are using to access the Services for the purpose of detecting an unauthorized modification and/or disabling the modified device; or</p>
<p>• Attempt to disassemble, decompile, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, modify, further sublicense, distribute, or use for other purposes the Services, any game, application, or other content available or accessible through the Services, or any
 hardware associated with the Services or with an Authorized Device. If you do, we may cancel your account and your ability to access the Services, and pursue other legal remedies. We may take any legal action we deem appropriate against users who violate our
 systems or network security, this Agreement or any additional terms incorporated or referenced in it. Such users may also incur criminal or civil liability.</p>
<p>It should have told you the reason for the suspension in the email you received. Also, are you certain that it is a permaban? In the info you posted, I did not see the duration of the suspension.</p>
<p>The other problem here, is that the Enforcement people do not read these forums. The only way to have any kind of contact with them is through the enforcement site. Was his account attached to a parent account? If it was, you should be able to access the
 site using the parent account.</p>

<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the speedy reply. I actually got it to work, I got that the error was due to communication with some of my hardware and the BIOS.</p>
<p>I have the newest BIOS, so I started unplugging things.</p>
<p>USB devices - no effect</p>
<p>All other hard drives than boot - no effect</p>
<p>In the end, it proved to be the CD-ROM drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnected the CD-ROM drive, managed to boot and install from the USB. But the installation procedure was still unstable until I unplugged all the hard drives. Now I have manged to complete the install, re-attached all hard drives and everything is working
 fine. Haven't reattached the CD-ROM drive yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am not sure that there are hardware problems, this setup worked without fault in Windows 8.1 and its working just fine in 10 now, bar the CD ROM of course.&nbsp;</p>

                    Like others here I have been getting the "Important Update" message for the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition Service Pack 3 (KB955706) about 4 times a week for many months. Unlike the others, I can go back through my update history and see that
 it has always had a successful install, yet it still pops up every few days as a needed update. in fact, I think at last count it had successfully installed 10 times! How can I get rid of this notification?

<p>
<span>Thank you for posting your question!<br />
<br />
This problem occurs if the update is installed; however, a file is not updated when the computer restarts.</span><span>&nbsp;<span><br />
I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it does the job for you.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
Our plan of action would be to remove the update from “Programs and Features” and install it manually from safe mode.</span><span>&nbsp;<span><br />
<br />
1. Open “</span><strong>Programs and Features</strong><span>” from control panel.<br />
2. In “</span><strong>Programs and Features</strong><span>”, click on “</span><strong>view installed updates</strong><span>” from the left pane.<br />
3. Once the updates are listed, locate and remove the update “</span><strong>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition Service Pack 3 (KB955706)</strong><span>”<br />
4. After removing the update, go ahead and download it manually from</span>&nbsp;<strong><span><br />
</span>Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Service Pack 3 -&nbsp;<br />

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
<span><br />
5.</span><span>&nbsp;<span>Install the update in</span>&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong><span>.
 Safe Mode disables most running processes and services. These services include the Windows Update service. Installing an update in Safe Mode is a quick test to verify whether an application or process is interfering with the installation. To install in Safe
 Mode, follow these steps:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li>
<span>Restart the computer. As the computer starts, press the F8 key.</span>
</li><li>
<span>Use the arrow keys to choose</span><span>&nbsp;<strong>Safe Mode</strong><span>,
 and then press ENTER.</span></span> </li><li>
<span>When the installation is finished, restart the computer in normal mode.</span>
</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>
<span>Visit the Windows Update or Microsoft Update Web site to verify whether the update is offered. Alternatively, wait until Automatic Updates
 runs again.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the above mentioned steps do not work, I would suggest you to post your question to the TechNet forum. Y<span>our question would be better suited to the TechNet forum since the issues related to “Microsoft SQL Server 2005” can be better answered
 by&nbsp;<span>that community.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One Day One Edition Making Loud Noise </h2>
                    
<p>The noise appears to be coming from the front right of the console near the power button, it seems to be like a hard drive spinning and is quite loud I only just noticed it recently the console hasn't be banged or anything and is in good condition.</p>
<p>I bought it from GAME and even got accidental damage cover, would I be able to return it and get a new one on the same day?</p>
<p>Also if there's anyway to resolve this issue please list your suggestions and such.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem as of Sunday just gone.</p>
<p>It's really loud no matter what you do, sit at dash or play games and apps. It use tobe really quiet.</p>
<p>Could it of been the last update??</p>
<p>I spoke to support and they said I can send mine away and get a new one.</p>
<p>Don't know what to do, the sound it makes is over powering and you really have to crank up the TV to drown it out.</p>

<p>Seems that way I got the day One Edition and it must be the update or dust but dust shouldn't be in the interior of the hard drive and the noise is quite noticeable.</p>
<p>If you find a fix do message back.</p>
<p>As I recall the first few months or before this I couldn't even hear the fan of the console now the fan is very noticeable and the Hard drive noise or what ever's causing it quite off putting.

<h2>            Dell XPS 15 9570 Windows 10 ACPI.sys DPC Latency issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello, as the title says i am having trouble with the windows power manager giving me huge latency spikes which render my system useless for real time audio recording, as it causes
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">clicks and pops</span> even on high playback buffer settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS A VERY COMMON ISSUE AND IT IS HAPPENING TO MANY USERS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what i've tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Installing latest drivers up to this date (Feb 6 2019)&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Disabling various drivers</p>
<p>-Changing power settings to max performance and setting minimum processor speed to 100% on both Batery and AC</p>
<p>-Disabling CPU throttling</p>
<p>-Clean boot</p>
<p>-Disabling ACPI driver with no aparent improvement, the ACPI.sys continues to run and cause the spikes acording to my DPC Latency analyser (latency mon)</p>
<p>-Excluding the program i use to record from the cores that are being affected by the ACPI.sys using task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are your thoughts on this? Who should adress this issue, Windows or Dell?&nbsp;</p>

            If you are not using RAID HDD configuration you probably don't need a dynamic disk,<br />
and you can't mix and match partitions on one HDD as Basic or Dynamic.<br />
It is possible to convert a Dynamic disk to Basic , but it's easier the other way around.<br />
<br />
To create a new basic partition either delete the current partition to create unallocated space, or<br />
reformat the partition as a basic NTFS disk, and you should have an option to create<br />
a logical or primary partition, depending on other factors such as number of already existing<br />
primary partitions, and whether it is to be an extended partition or separate partition.<br />
<br />
If you have free space (green) you need to delete that and make it into Unallocated space before<br />
you can create a new partition.<br />
<br />
Click on&nbsp; Help&nbsp; from the Disk Management Window of Computer Management and you will find<br />
some more details that may further clarify.<br />
<br />

            So, it looks like I misunderstood your question. Maybe you could explain it again and clarify<br />
where I missed your point ?<br />
- Did I assume incorrectly that you&nbsp; know to R/click on the drive while in Disk Management
<br />
and select 'format' ?<br />
- Do you require a Dynamic disk vs a Basic disk ?<br />
<br />
Did you read the Help files, or is this too much trouble ?<br />
<br />
A Dynamic Disks can only be a single partition the covers the entire disk</span><br />
This partition can be devided into Volumes.<br />
<br />
- And,&nbsp; you cannot do Dynamic Disks on Win7 Home Premium -<br />

<h2>            Printer driver was not installed. The system cannot find the file specified</h2>
                    <p>I have Win 10 Pro and I can´t install my printer. I have an old HD Deskjet 890C that&nbsp; worked very well with my late Win 7.
</p>
<p>The problem now is, no matter how many times I try the "solutions" given, nothing works !</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) - When trying to add manually and reaching the window where I have to "ask" Windows Update to download more options to HP Manufacturer, after some seconds, another window pops up saying Windows couldn´t obtain a list of devices and to try again later...
 Of course this pops up EVERY new attempt I try, so : winupdt not working ??? No ! It´s working as many updates were downloaded since my first try.... I even tried the "deleting&nbsp; SoftwareDistribution&nbsp;folder solution" to see if it was corrupted and preventing
 the download. Nothing happened again - same window poping with the "not obtaining device list problem"... ;-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) - Tried going to catalog of Microsoft and downloading my driver from there (3 options and only one, with 11,6 MB appears to be the right one). OK, thought I was going to get it going now... No !! After extracting the file to a folder and pointing the
 installation to "Have DIsc" option and then to the inf file it contained, I could see my printer in the device list, click Next, it shows my printer that will be installed, click Next again and ONE second later, new Error window saying that phrase on the Subject:
 "Printer driver was not installed. The system cannot find the file specified".&nbsp; How can this happen if the file was downloaded from Microsoft site ??????? How can´t the system find it ????</p>
<p>I then tried to point the Have Disc option to my old HD with win 7 and so, old driver for the printer that worked before, and AGAIN same message of "not finding the file specified".... (??????)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I tried also through Device Manager, illuminating the USB Compound Device&nbsp; (that in fact IS my printer - its connected through an USB to Parallel cable), and in "Action", tried "Add legacy Hardware" but to end in the same choices 1 and 2 above</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I did tried installing then 2 or 3 printers from the first list (without using winupdt) to see if somehow my printer would work with them... No ! It didn´t ;-( (By the way, is there a driver from this "first" list that would make my printer just print
 something ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a brand new Dell XPS 8930 and no, I won´t buy a new printer before understanding WHY those two methods above aren´t working for me !!! Stubborn is my second name ;-).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lucia</p>

            Hi Lucia.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The printer was discontinued in 1999 after the last Windows edition that supported it was Windows 95:  <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/bpd04791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/bpd04791</a>
<br />
<br />If you had a Windows 7 driver that worked it might be able to be installed in Compatibility Mode in Windows 10 but it would be one for the record books if it worked.  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>How do I run an "inf" file in compatibility mode ?? It isn´t an executable.... ;-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I do have a driver that worked with Windows 7 and it is still installed at my old HD as I mentioned before on my number 2 above. The driver is located at Windows/System32/spool/drivers/x64/PCC and is a "cab" file that doesn´t have Compatibility Mode under
 Properties (nor the INF file inside this CAB one...)</p>
<p>

            Yes, there are many complaints about Windows 10. But these are not my fault because I am only a volunteer who is giving my time here to help you.<br /><br />If you would like to express your opinion about this further please go to the feedback Hub in your start menu to post feedback for Microsoft. They will not even see it here as this is a volunteer Tech forums where people help others out of the kindness of our hearts.<br /><br />I hope they start this you will reconsider the rating you gave me for something I have no control over and after I had done my very best to help you.

            Thank you, Lucia. I appreciate that you understand I am not Microsoft and only trying to help customers with a problematic operating system.<br /><br />I do hope you'll reconsider the rating you gave me because it only affects me personally and not Microsoft, so if you feel that is appropriate as you indicate it would be much appreciated.<br /><br />Good luck to you and congratulations for keeping a printer running longer than I had ever heard of before! I also miss Windows 7!

<h2>            How to recover files after windows 10 update</h2>
                    We currently update to Windows 10 and have lost all our documents, pictures, videos etc. Since then, we tried going back to Windows 8.1 in hopes that our files would be back. They haven't and are nowhere to be found. How do I get them back? Also can't
 find the windows.old file. Please help!

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>How did you upgrade to Windows 10? Is it through&nbsp;Windows Update or an Installation Media?</span></li><li><span>Did you do a clean installation of Windows 10 using an media creation tool?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have performed clean installation, you would need to install all the application or software. As the&nbsp;clean installation erases the contents of the computer hard drive, your files, settings, and programs will not be saved any more.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading will not result in any loss of files or photos, I suggest you to check for windows.old folder on the drive where Windows 10 is installed. The Windows.old folder contains a copy of the previous Windows installation, and can be quite large in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually the path is <strong>C:\windows.old </strong>where is 'C' is the drive on which the previous Windows was installed and you upgraded it to Windows 10.</p>
<p><span>If you failed to find your files in windows.old folder, I suggest you to use your favorite search engine and&nbsp;search how to recover lost files from Windows.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Chess Titans uses Aero for its display, and&nbsp;Windows Starter doesn't support Aero. Only versions up from Home Premium support that feature.
