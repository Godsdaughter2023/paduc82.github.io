            Hi,&nbsp; In answer to my CD/DVD Drive not working, I tried everything, then found out the drive actually 'mechanically broke'.&nbsp; New one installed and all is OK.

<h2>            Gears of War 3 - DLC not available when licensed content from two users exists on same console</h2>
                    

<p>I originally posted this problem at Epic Games' forums here:</p>

<p>http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/826013-DLC-Skins-and-Characters-not-available-on-2nd-XBox-for-Licensed-User</p>

<p>Soon came to realize that the problem is:&nbsp; when DLC licensed to two different users exists on the same console,&nbsp; none of that DLC is available to any user playing on that console.</p>

<p>So right now, the only DLC for Gears 3 that is on both systems at home is licensed to me.&nbsp; So on the main console, my kids can use any DLC that has already been purchased (since it is licensed to me on that console).&nbsp; But if they are playing on both consoles,
 none of the DLC is available to whomever is playing on the second console (of course, unless if I'm signed in on the second console).</p>

<p>The dilemna is... the first actual gameplay-based DLC comes out November 1st.&nbsp; I was going to pay for a second Season Pass for my son, to be registered on the second console, so that DLC can be accessed by anyone playing on either console.&nbsp; But since there
 would then be DLC licensed to to different profiles on the same console, nothing will work.&nbsp; This is the same reason that I haven't purchased any marketplace weapon skins yet (which all three of them want).</p>

<p>I'm ready to spend more money on the game, but not if I know for sure if everything is going to work correctly.</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; I also PM'd Forum Admin at epicgames.com about this same issue, and was told that any support questions for the game should be directed here.</p>

<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;Now that the free map pack is out, I am the only one that can play multiplayer on the second system. &nbsp;Any of my kids try to play, they get the error that the host has DLC that we don't have, although it is already downloaded on that system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So this has now gone from an annoying problem, to making the game completely unplayable on more than one system. &nbsp;Why did I buy two copies of the game if I can't utilize both copies?</p>

<p>Hey MrDo, sorry to hear about the issue, and I'm very sorry we didn't offer a response to your initial post before now. I'm curious, did you end up purchasing the DLC with a second account on the second console? Please let me know, and we'll go from there.

<p>That's the problem; I WANT to spend more money on the game, but am worried that if I do, nothing will work. &nbsp;I wanted to buy a second season pass, so that all my kids would be able to access all of that DLC on both systems. &nbsp;Here is all the info I can think
 of to help you guys solve this problem.</p>
<p>We own two copies of the game. &nbsp;Right now, I have the following DLC under my account: &nbsp;Season Pass w/ Horde Command Pack, Liquid Green Skin, all four pre-order characters, Aaron Griffin, Infected Omen Weapon Pack, Adam Fenix. &nbsp;All of these were purchased
 on the main console, then re-downloaded on the second console. &nbsp;All DLC (map packs, characters, and skins) works for everybody on the main console, but nothing works for anyone but me on the second console, which so far, is how it should work anyway. &nbsp;If I
 am signed in, we can play a split-screen game fine, with all DLC available.</p>
<p>My son has on his account Mechanic Baird and Aaron Griffin. &nbsp;He cannot use either of these characters on the second console.</p>
<p>A few days before the Booster Map Pack came out, my son purchased the Crimson Omen Lancer skin (80pts) on the main console to see if the mismatching of DLC had been fixed with the title update. &nbsp;To our surprise, it worked. &nbsp;However, when he re-downloaded
 it on the second console, it was not available. &nbsp;This is contrary to how DLC should be working, and has been a known issue since soon after Gears 3 came out.</p>
<p>The day the Booster Map Pack came out, he downloaded it on the main system under his ID, and everything still worked for everyone on the main console. &nbsp;When he re-downloaded it on the second console, he was unable to play a versus online match, and the booster
 maps were not available in private. &nbsp;We deleted the Booster Map Pack from the second console, and I tried downloading it under my ID first on the second console (so that the console ID tied to it would be that console, so that it "should" work for everyone
 on that console). &nbsp;That still didn't work; no one could play online on that console (except for me).</p>
<p>One other weird thing... if I am signed in on the second console, and sign out, then someone else signs in without leaving the game, the maps from the horde command pack are available to play in versus, but nothing else associated with the pack are available
 (characters, new horde fortifications). &nbsp;Since this seemed somewhat working, I did a license transfer so that the Booster Map pack would be assigned to the main console. &nbsp;I deleted it, cleared the cache, re-downloaded it, and... still nothing. &nbsp;Works fine
 for me, doesn't work for anyone else.</p>
<p>So at this point, everyone can play online on the main console. &nbsp;I am the only one that can play online on the second console now that the Booster Map pack is causing conflict.</p>
<p>To re-itereate my first point, I WANT to spend $30 for a second season pass under my son's account on the second console, so that all DLC will be available for everyone on both consoles. &nbsp;My kids also want to buy weapon skins, but only if they will be available
 to them on both systems. &nbsp;But... only if I know that everything else is still going to work. &nbsp;Seeing as how the Booster Map pack was "purchased" (for free), under my account on the second console, but still didn't work for anyone, it worries me.</p>
<p>Getting this fixed would be a HUGE deal for many people. &nbsp;If you visit the Gears of War 3 Issues sub-forum on Epic's website, there are numerouse posts of people that have the same issue.</p>
<p>I'll keep coming back to this thread to check for updates. &nbsp;Thanks!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for the very thorough post MrDo. I'm curious, are your kids part of a family pack by chance? If not, I'm wondering if either of their profiles were ever prompted to download the free Booster Map Pack. It might be worth deleting the map pack from the
 console, and then have them sign into the game, to see if they're prompted to download the maps. Also, just to be sure, have you tried the following for the unavailable DLC issue?<br />
<br />
"Delete (or move to a different storage device) all of the Weapon and/or Character skins from the console that are not licensed to the gamertag having difficulty accessing the content. You do not need to delete or move save games." At that point, if the initial
 issue is resolved, we can try re-downloading/re-adding the DLC for the other players. Please let me know if you have tried this step specifically!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Duh... I had tried the memory card thing when the first game came out, but forgot to check again. &nbsp;So after multiple tests, everything works now; here's the rundown:</p>
<p>-- Yes, all three kids are part of a family pack, but I don't think that part is relevant.</p>
<p>-- I moved all DLC registered to me off of the hard drive to my memory card, and deleted the booster pack, and cleared the cache.</p>
<p>-- Signed in with my daughter's account, was prompted to re-download, and it did, but it still didn't work. &nbsp;Tried again with my other son's account, still didn't work. &nbsp;Then it hit me...</p>
<p>-- Unplugged my memory card from the system, then tried again, and both were able to play online. &nbsp;Woohoo! &nbsp;Now to keep testing...</p>
<p>-- My oldest son that has some DLC; re-downloaded, then moved to his memory card. &nbsp;Only his memory card plugged in, and everything works, including his DLC.</p>
<p>-- Plugged in my memory card and my oldest son; signed in both, and everything works.</p>
<p>-- Plugged in my oldest son's memory card, sign in as daughter only, can't play online. &nbsp;Go back to the main menu, unplug son's card, try again, and online play is available (no need to clear cache).</p>
<p>So I think everything works now. &nbsp;I will purchase the other season pass on Friday and &nbsp;let you know. &nbsp;As things stand now...</p>
<p>-- Any DLC on the hard drive must be licensed to that console, and be licensed to the same user. &nbsp;This DLC can be used by anyone on that system</p>
<p>-- Any user can also use their own DLC on that system. &nbsp;To keep things clean, that DLC should remain on a memory card. &nbsp;(This is probably the important part for anyone having the multiple DLC issue).</p>
<p>-- If any DLC is on the hard drive or a memory unit of a user that is NOT signed in, no other person will be able to use any DLC on that console (including Booster Map Pack, which is required to play online versus), so only plug in memory card of anyone
 that is going to sign in and play.</p>

<p>Well... it all works now. &nbsp;Second season pass, everyone bought a weapon skin, and they all work. &nbsp;Summary again...</p>
<p>-- Any DLC on the hard drive must all be licensed to that console.</p>
<p>-- Any other DLC should stay on an individual's memory card</p>
<p>-- If a memory card/stick is plugged in to the system, and has DLC on it, that user should be signed in before starting a match. &nbsp;(in other words, if a person isn't playing, don't plug in that memory card). &nbsp;</p>
<p>-- Once pressing start at the title screen, the game will scan all storage devices and check who is currently signed in. &nbsp;If any DLC not licensed to that console is found, and that user is not signed in, NO DLC will work for anyone. You can go back to the
 title screen and correct this by signing in that user, or removing any DLC not for that console.</p>
<p>Phew...! &nbsp;It's good to have a fully working game again.</p>

<p>Hello MrDo, I was referred to you by someone on Xbox support forums. I am having similar issues with a gears of war 3 dlc. Recently i purchased a new Xbox and transferred all my stuff onto it. Last week I decided to play gears of war 3 and when i got to
 the main menu, a notice popped up that said that the horde command pack was unreadable.I bought that dlc on a different gt that had this gt on the same console as well. I have done and tried everything and nothing has worked. I redownloaded the dlc about 5-6
 times.</p>
<p>I've done just about everything from license transfer to moving the dlc onto a USB . &nbsp;But I still get a notice that says that the dlc content is unreadable. I'm not sure if I missed something or if I didn't do something correctly. if you or anyone can help,
 that would great.</p>

            It's the restore partition put there by the computer manufacturer, to be used if you want to restore the computer to as-bought condition.&nbsp; Consult the documentation that came with the computer, or ask the computer manufacturer about how to use it.&nbsp; If
 you're sure you won't want to use it, it can be gotten rid of.

<p>Check at Epson for drivers for Windows 10 at the link. The printer model is very old and there are not any win 10 drivers. Time to update to a new All in One printer, scanner. Printers are cheap. It's the ink that's expensive.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I have had a canon printer for awhile but the ink pads are full and no way to replace or fix it.&nbsp; Buying another printer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I want to use the 24 pin printer (great printer)&nbsp; is because of the expensive ink.&nbsp; It prints great text and all things black and white.</p>

<p>I just upgraded from windows 7 to 8 and I find it to be incredibly slow. When I&nbsp;click&nbsp;on the desktop it takes ages for the cursor to get back. The&nbsp;boot up&nbsp;time takes way&nbsp;longer&nbsp;than on windows 7 and even&nbsp;when I&nbsp;wake the PC up from sleep, it takes longer
 than it did on windows 7. I am seiously considering downgrading back to windows 7.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that <b>you are unable to boot the computer as normally after upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8.
</b>Please let me know if you are not facing this issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I will help you resolve the issue!<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Before we proceed with troubleshooting, I would need little information on the issue.</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the methods and check after each method:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b><b><span>Run Performance Troubleshooter, to ‘Fix Windows system performance problems on slow Windows computers’.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘Windows + <b>R</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the ‘<b>Run’</b> windows type

<b>troubleshooter</b>, and then click <b>Troubleshooting</b>. Under <b>System and Security</b>, click
<b>Check for performance issues</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Check in “Safe mode”:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Start the computer in “Safe mode”,</span></b><span> to start the computer with minimal set of drivers and services.</span></p>

<p><span><span>h)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b> and then restart your PC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: If the issue does not persists, start the computer in “clean boot” to check if any third party services or applications are causing the issue.</span></b><span> Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step A:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type

<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step C: Determine whether the problem returns.<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to
<b>Step 4.</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>Step D: Enable half of the Startup items:<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step E: Determine whether the problem returns: <br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step F: Resolve the problem: <br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box
 for the problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step G: Reset the system to Normal startup mode:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type
<b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>

<h2>            Surface pro 4 pen</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 30px">I am using a Surface pro 4.&nbsp; The tip of the pen no longer works.&nbsp; It was working before the last automated windows update about a week ago.&nbsp; The top button works and opens one note fine.&nbsp; The pen tip does not respond to any app.&nbsp;
 I replaced battery, removed it from the Bluetooth list and paired it back up, did the windows updates.&nbsp; These did not fix it.&nbsp; I connected my surface pro 3 pen and I got the same results.&nbsp; One note opens but pen tip does not respond.&nbsp; The surface pro 3 and
 4 pens work fine on my surface pro 3 that I have.&nbsp; Any thoughts how to fix this on the surface 4?<br />

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 stuck on 57&#37;</h2>
                    <p>1st. thank you gregrocker for your help.'</p>
<p>Now my computer was not really frozen while installing Windows 10, just crawling, 5 days went by and only 57% done.</p>
<p>After reading so many complaints about Windows 10, I am wondering if it is really worth to install it.</p>
<p>My dilemma is how do I stop the process, is any unintended damage that may occur if I just unplug the computer?</p>
<p>thanks for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS What I mean is&nbsp;I am happy with windows 8.</p>
<p>the computer is only 1 and 1/2 years old.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Angel,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It would be grateful if you could provide us few questions answer to understand the issue better and to provide you better assistance.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is the installation has further proceeded or still stuck on 57%?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">How are you trying to upgrade to Windows 10 using Windows 10 ISO or Windows update?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Since it has been stuck on 57% more than 5 days, I would suggest you to restart the computer. Once you restart the computer it'll start with Windows 8.&nbsp;In-order to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8 first of all you need to update to Windows 8.1
 then only you will be eligible for free upgrade to </span>Windows 10<span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you wish to upgrade&nbsp;to Windows 10 try to upgrade using Windows 10 ISO and check if it helps in resolving the issue. Download Windows 10 ISO and create media from the below link</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you complete creating media. Insert the Windows installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Do not perform clean and custom installation. If you do so, activation issue will occur.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hoe this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.</span></p>

<h2>            User Account Picture won&#39;t change</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Recently I noticed that the user picture I view at login is not the same as the one I see when I open the start menu. The start menu picture is the basic flower picture while the login picture is the fish picture that I chose. It's been like this
 for a while but I've only recently thought of fixing it, so I have no idea what originally cause this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I went to change the picture to another default one, and although the picture shows up in the User Accounts window, it still won't change in the Start Menu.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another interesting thing is that custom pictures behave even more weirdly. I can browse for one of my own pictures and select one, but once I click it and go back to the user account page it just shows up as nothing, a white square. The Start Menu
 is still a flower.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>After restarting, the custom picture I chose shows up in the login page, but after logging in I found that the flower picture is now in the Start Menu AND the User Account page. When I go to change my picture I see two flowers in the place where
 the flower and the white patch of nothing used to be.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Any help would be appreciated, this isn't a huge problem but I do find it annoying.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi bluelinedpaper,</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following steps to set default pictures for the user accounts and check whether if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Name the image that you want to use to
<strong>user.bmp</strong> and/or <strong>guest.bmp</strong> for the account type you want it as the default for.</span></p>
<p><span>2<strong>.</strong> Make sure that you have
</span><strong><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/86163-hidden-files-folders.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Show hidden files and folders</span></a></span></strong><span>
 selected in Folder Options.<br />
3. Open a Windows Explorer Window. <br />
4. Navigate to <strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\User Account Pictures </strong></span></p>
<p><span>A) For the default logon picture you want to change, right click on
<strong>user.bmp</strong> or <strong>guest.bmp</strong> and click <strong>Rename</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>B) Rename them to
<strong>user.bmp.bak</strong> and/or <strong>guest.bmp.bak</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>, then click <strong>Yes</strong>, <strong>Continue</strong>, and <strong>
Continue</strong>.<br />
C) Right click on the image from step 1 and click on <strong>Copy</strong>, then click on a empty area in this window and click
<strong>Paste</strong>.<br />
</span><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong><span>
<strong><span>To undo this</span></strong><span>, delete the new image from step 4C and remove the
<strong>.bak</strong> off the name of <strong>user.bmp.bak</strong> and/or <strong>
guest.bmp.bak</strong> to restore the default images given by Vista</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Close this window when done.<br />
6. Select</span><span>
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/86163-hidden-files-folders.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Do not show hidden files and folders</span></strong></a></span><span>
 in Folder Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you want to set Default logon pictures for all users, then try the following steps:<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> The following steps won’t work in home editions of Windows Vista.<br />
</span></span><span><span>1. Click Start, type
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong> in start search and press ENTER<br />
</span></span><span><span>2. Go to the following branch:<br />
</span></span><strong><span><span>Computer Configuration\ Administrative Templates\ Control Panel\ User Accounts<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>3. Double-click
<strong>Apply the default user logon picture to all users<br />
</strong></span></span><span><span>4. Set it to Enabled<br />
</span></span><span><span>5. Exit the Group Policy Editor.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.<br />

<p>You sound confused.&nbsp; Memory and disk space are two entirely different things.&nbsp; Files are on the disk, not in memory.</p>

<p>I get a pop up box telling me that my computer is low on memory, and that I should close some of my files. This happens when I am on the internet or reading my mail.</p>
<p>I am, I agree, not very computer savvy, so if you can give me some suggestions to move forward I would be very grateful.</p>

            Without the exact wording of the message you see, I can not be certain but, I doubt that it says close "files".&nbsp; The problem you are more likely having is that you have too many windows open.&nbsp; If you are using Chrome as your browser, it is particularly
 a big user of memory.&nbsp; So just close it down and restart your computer and the problem at least temporarily will go away.

<p>You need to take and study some very basic stuff about computers.&nbsp; It is very difficult for us in a forum like this to help you when you do not use the correct terms and those terms you do use mean something different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files are not stored in memory.&nbsp; They are stored on your storage device which is generally a hard drive.&nbsp; "memory" is an intermediate storage place used by the computer to process information.&nbsp; So, a low memory message from Windows has nothing to do with
 the number or size of files you have stored on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of messages that Windows will display have to be interpreted by someone who understands this stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, as best I can tell from what you have told me, it is likely that you have too many windows open at one time.&nbsp; For further guidance, you probably need to sit down beside your computer and a knowledgeable person.</p>

<p>You cannot change your account region. If it was entered incorrectly or you have since moved you would have to create a new account with the correct information.

<p>Greetings, SeaborneSumo. It sounds as though the region to which your account was registered does not match your physical location. This will cause issues such as the one you are describing. You may need to create a new account registered to the correct
 LIVE supported region. <br />
<br />
If you have any further questions, please create a new thread for us and we'll be happy to assist. Thanks! :)</p>

            Windows 7 is indeed the successor to Windows Vista, but I don't expect it to replace Windows Vista overnight. Consumers and businesses will continue to have access to it through various mediums, such as downgrade rights which allows you to choose a corresponding
 edition of Windows Vista over Windows 7 when purchasing a PC. Most consumers will certainly choose Windows 7 in most PC purchases because of the numerous improvements this new upgrade offers.

<h2>            Lenovo Miix 2 touchscreen and Bluetooth issues &#40;error code 43&#41; on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Lenovo Miix 2 - 8 inch 8.1 tablet touchscreen failures</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using a lenovo miix 2 8 inch tablet running a fresh windows 8.1 install with all available updates. The tablet works flawlessly for hours on end, but every now and then the touchscreen just completely refuses to work, often immediately after
 connecting my bluetooth headset, mouse, or keyboard. sometimes it gives error 43, and needs to be disabled and re-enabled, and other times it just says it's working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>just to get some potential dead ends out of the way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. i've tried a fresh install already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. i've unchecked "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" for both "I2C HID Device" in the device manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. i've tried using the 1.07 bios that has been floating around, which has not helped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have been going through the event viewer, and consistantly found the following messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>source: win32k</p>
<p>A touch device does not support the maximum count properly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Source: Kernel-PnP<br />
</p>
<p>the driver \driver\WUDFRd failed to load for the device Sensors\BcmGNSSLocationSensor(lots of numbers)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Source: Kernel-PnP</p>
<p>the driver \driver\WUDFRd failed to load for the device HID\INV6050\4&amp;418b572&amp;1&amp;0000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>each boot, these are the only "warning" events, and they lead me to conclude that somehow both the GPS and Touch screen are failing to load on boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the touch screen is running on the base drivers that windows 8.1 installs automatically, and the GPS is running on Lenovo's drivers from their website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry if this was long winded, just wanted to give relevant information. thank's in advance for any help :)</p>

            <p>Seems the issue is with Silverlight and Update for Windows 8.1 (KB2962409). I did several tests this weekend and found that the Miix 2 8 worked fine without these 2 updates. The moment either Silverlight is installed or KB2962409 update is applied, the touchscreen
 begins to stop responding intermittently. Seem more severe with Silverlight where it almost does not recover even with reboot. With KB2962409, the touchscreen randomly works after a few reboots, and sometime after leave it in sleep mode for sometime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope MS or Lenovo can find out what the real issues are. A bit handicapped with streaming from some websites without Silverlight. Hope MS can release another Silverlight version that does not trigger the fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For the moment, I uninstalled both the above and the touchscreen seems to work just fine. If other users find this helpful, please let this forum know as well and forward to the relevant Lenovo forums too.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing all the required information related to the&nbsp;issue. We also appreciate the effort that you have put to try and fix the issue till now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from corrupt drivers for the Bluetooth or the touchscreen, corrupt chipset driver for the laptop could also cause such issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run the hardware and device troubleshooter and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the methods listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link and run the hardware and device troubleshooter:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong>”
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>For issues with the Bluetooth and touch screen driver, I would suggest you to uninstall the driver for the subsequent device and then restart the laptop. This will reinstall the driver for the device. Follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.
</li><li>Locate the <strong>Bluetooth radios</strong> and expand the driver icon.</li><li>Right Click on the driver icon and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instruction to uninstall the driver.</li><li>Restart the laptop. Check if the issue persists with the Bluetooth devices. </li><li>Open Device Manager again and locate <strong>Human Interface devices</strong> icon and expand the driver icon.
</li><li>Right Click on each driver and choose <strong>Uninstall</strong>. Click on <strong>
Scan for hardware changes</strong> icon on the top of the window. Check if it fixes the issue. If not, restart the laptop and the device drivers will be reinstalled automatically.
</li></ul>
<p>For error code 43, you can refer to the article to get the details:</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873(v=ws.10).aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, download and install the latest chipset and display driver for Windows 8.1. Refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS038319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/downloads/detail.page?DocID=DS038319</a></p>
<p>Also, choose <strong>Bluetooth </strong>from the drop down menu and check if the latest version on the website is already installed on the laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us posted. </p>

            <p>I want to thank everyone for informative help and kind advice.&nbsp; After a couple of days (of frustration for me) and your continuing encouragement, I finally have defeated that 'endless loop.'</p>
<p>What worked for me was the neosmart.net download to a properly working CD/DVD burner.&nbsp; I initially tried using my old desktop CD drive, but I forgot it was a read-only device and wouldn't be able to burn a copy of the recovry CD.&nbsp; I found a working DVD burner
 to copy the neosmart.net download correctly.</p>
<p>It took several cold boots on the laptop&nbsp;with the recovery CD&nbsp;together with a "shift F6"&nbsp;&nbsp;followed quickly by "any key" to access the needed restore menu.</p>
<p>I noticed on Google that this "Configuring Updates: Stage 3 of 3 - 0% complete." has been affecting Vista since 2008.&nbsp; It's almost 2012 and this is still causing problems?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving America !</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in the community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try these steps on making sure that the default speakers and microphone are set with the device as well in Skype. Refer to the screenshots below to make sure that the device is selected properly on both the device and Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First is to right click on the speaker icon at the system tray then it will show you the window below. Make sure that the default device is the USB headphone.
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a51126c4-26f1-4128-b78d-7b3c35ce815a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a51126c4-26f1-4128-b78d-7b3c35ce815a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, check the settings in Skype if the same Headphones is selected as the default, open your Skype app, click on the triple dots icon
<strong>( . . . )</strong> and select on <strong>Settings</strong>. Make sure to change the
<strong>"Default Device" </strong>to the <strong>USB Headphones</strong> you are using:<br />
<br />

<p>If the issue would persist, try on downloading the latest release of Skype through this link:&nbsp;
<a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download Skype 8.</a></p>
<p>Once installed, try to check the settings as well if the <strong>"Default Device"</strong> is changed to your Headphones and click on
<strong>Test Audio</strong>:</p>
