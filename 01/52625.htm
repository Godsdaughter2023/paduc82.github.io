    <title>Win10 on HP Touchsmart 420 &#40;Touch not working&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richince  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 on HP Touchsmart 420 &#40;Touch not working&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My wife has an HP Touchsmart 420 which we recently upgraded to Win10. Shortly after I noticed the touch feature was not working. I logged out of her account and into mine and the touch was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Continuing to investigate I checked my laptop a Lenovo Thinkpad X230t. My touch was working but on my daughters account the touch feature was not. The one common thing that both accounts with the touch feature not working was that they were disabled when
 Win10 was installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Win10 will not allow me to turn touch back on in either of these accounts... but I can still use the touch feature on accounts that had touch on during the upgrade or by creating a new account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So wondering if anyone else has experienced this and come up with a solution... other than to create a new account and migrate all settings, programs, and links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

</li></ul>
<p>If&nbsp;the above step,&nbsp;does not help follow step 2.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks but neither of these solutions worked. I was skeptical that it was a driver issue based on the fact touch works on one account but not the other on the same computer. I even went so far as to uninstall and reinstall the drivers with no success. The
 second option just took me in a roundabout manner to the touch and pen setting which don't do anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your time and assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;and send the ok to transmit, I get a pop up asking me if I have permission to send info to that file. I sign in as the Administrator. I spent over an hour with one of Brothers' Technician and the final word is that somehow the permission inside windows

<p>I have no idea how do check or add that permission. I hope someone can help. Thanks Lucho</p>

<p>Hi Michael thank you for your reply. to begin, my printer is a brother model MFC250C.</p>
<p>Yes it is the first time this happens. The only update was an automatic Windows update, I have not installed or update any programs but my antivirus program "Bit Defender" updates automatically.
</p>
<p>The problem started by the program sending my PDF files to my folder as JPG instead then it started to reject the destination folder and I got the error message below.</p>
<p>Trouble shooting steps: I got most of these steps from the Brother's website.</p>
<p>Since the problem is in the control center, I downloaded the Control Center drivers and software update from Brother's website. Since it did not work then I used their uninstalled tool and uninstalled the program completely and rebooted. later on I did the
 same procedure but when the program asked me to reboot I did not. I cleaned the computer with CCleaner before uninstalling and re installing (once only) still did not work. I checked the Brother Registry entries without deleting anything. I should tell you
 that this is a multi-function printer and the fax and copy functions are working fine. Also I can scan via email. It is only the scan to file that is causing problems.</p>
<p>I wish I could attach a copy of the error message but here it is. Error CC3-104-004-10506</p>
<p>"Please make sure that you have correct permission to write to the destination folder." The destination folder being Documents normally but I also tried the picture and desktop folders.</p>
<p>I have tried to advice the steps as I remember them and in sequence.</p>
<p>I certainly hope that this will help and thank you again.</p>

<p>Michael I appreciate all you have done for me and my problem. Unfortunately it is still unresolved.</p>
<p>I have been in touch with the manufacturer of the printer four times. The first time I used the "Chat box" and the lady tried hard to fix the problem. Unfortunately she could not.</p>
<p>To my surprise I received an email from them. A few questions and a few directions but no success.</p>
<p>I received another email from them and same results. Finally I received an email suggesting an address</p>
<p>which suggested a few steps to correct the problem and again we had failure. However their suggestion</p>
<p>gave me an inspiration and I tried those steps in a different way and folder and I believe that indirectly</p>
<p>I have found a possible cure. I have not tried it yet but I believe it should work.</p>
<p>So now I am thankful to you for your efforts and interest. I am also thankful to the manufacturer of the printer for same reasons. I am also thankful to this website. I do not want to mention names and addresses of the people involved because I have not
 obtain their permission. It is not a common occurrence so chances that someone else will have this problem are few.&nbsp; If I get good results and fix the problem I would let you know.</p>
<p>And Michael thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Help and support service missing in services.msc</h2>
                    When I try and open Help and Support in XP, I get an error telling me I need to start the Help and Support service. When I go into services.msc to do this, the Help and Support service is not listed&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div>A missing Help and Support service does not fit the symptoms of a corrupt user profile. &nbsp;The Help and Support Service is system wide and does not belong to a particular user, and if you think your user profile is corrupted, you better not just delete it
 unless you want to lose all the stuff belonging to the user you are deleting. &nbsp; That is not a good way to handle a corrupt or suspicious user profile - unless you want angry users!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have you ever used any third party applications on your system where the product description includes such descriptive phrases as:</div>
<div><br />
<div>cleaner, mechanic, detective, cure, optimize, clean up, tune up, speed up, fix up, compact, compress, faster, power, boost, booster, guaranteed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>The Help and Support Center sometimes get broken with overzealous cleaning and there are lots of things&nbsp;to "try" that sometimes work and sometimes they don't. Sometimes people just give up and never use Help and&nbsp;Support Center again, but it can always
 be repaired.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We can reinstall the missing Help and Support Service in a couple of ways, let's start with the least complicated:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Using Windows Explorer, browse to and locate c:\windows\inf\pchealth.inf. &nbsp;THat is the Help and Support installation information file. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right click the pchealth.inf file&nbsp;and choose to Install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may be prompted to enter your XP installation CD as it looks for the&nbsp;installation files. &nbsp;The files are on your XP installation CD or, if you have no XP installation CD, the files will already on your system from the original installation (if Help
 and Support was working&nbsp;before) - you just need to tell the installation where to look for them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may want to locate the files on your system before you start the installation so you will know where to tell the&nbsp;installation to look when it needs a file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you don't have an XP installation CD, change the "Copy file from" dialogue (by clicking the Browse and Retry&nbsp;buttons) to point to the appropriate folder for each requested file. &nbsp;Usually, the files are in these folders.</div>
<div><br />
<div>dataspec.xml (c:\windows\servicepackfiles\i386)</div>
<div>pchdt_w3.cab (c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries)</div>
<div>HCAppRes.dll (c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries)</div>
<div>atrace.dll &nbsp; (c:\windows\system32)</div>
<div><br />
<div>If those files are not in the same place on your system, you need to do a Windows&nbsp;Search on your system for the file you need and point the installation to the correct&nbsp;folder for your system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reboot your system to be sure the installation is complete and check in the Services&nbsp;now to see the condition of the Help and Support Service.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the Help and Support service is not running, right click it, Start it and then be sure&nbsp;the Properties are set to Automatic, reboot again and be sure it starts on it's own.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If for some reason that does not get your Help and Support Service installed (maybe you can't find the files) you can follow these other&nbsp;instructions&nbsp;from Ramesh:</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Updates Disables Network DNS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffpilgram  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Updates Disables Network DNS</h2>
                    This issue happens with every single Windows 10 update that has come up since launch. &nbsp;Anytime after updates have been installed, my wired LAN connection shows up as Unidentified and unable to access internet. &nbsp;None of the previous support topics about
 refreshing DNS settings or rebooting the computer ever solve this issue. &nbsp;The only thing I can do is go to my router, get a pen, and press and hold the reset button until the router shuts itself off and turns back on again, then after doing this maybe 3 times
 I can finally access the internet again. &nbsp;My wife's computer is connected to Wi-Fi and she never experiences this issue with any Windows 10 update. &nbsp;Neither of us are using McAfee or Norton antivirus, so that is not the cause of the issue.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The User Profile logged on with temporary profile usually occurs because a registry handle from software was not unloaded when the software closes or the user logs off the software. To resolve you concern, we suggest that you visit this

<p>When Windows has a problem reading the profile information for a user it will log that user into a temporary profile (but you know that already).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to the brief message (which may be missed) other symptoms are a desktop with all your usual icons, shortcuts, etc. missing and a panic situation where you might think all your programs are gone and all your personal files (documents, pictures,
 music, etc.) are "missing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unlikely that anything is really missing - the temporary profile just doesn't have access to the same desktop, programs and files and things the regular user profile does if it was working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may just be a fluke and restarting your system and logging out and back in will get things going again but sometimes a user profile can get corrupted and the user will never be able to log in normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't fix a corrupted user profile but you can create a new user account (which will make a new profile) and copy things from the corrupted user account into the new user and then you will have to login with the new user account from now on.&nbsp; Later when
 you are comfortable with the new user account you can delete the corrupted user account to keep your system tidy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some generic ways to test for a corrupted user profile and what do to if you need to create a new user account and copy things:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>If you see the taskbar and desktop with just a few icons and it appear that all or most of your installed programs and personal files are "missing" it could be that you have a corrupted user profile...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely unlikely that all your documents (or anything else) has vanished or been deleted...&nbsp; they are just in a place where you can't see or find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This condition sounds like a corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes (for some reason) Windows has a problem reading your profile information when you login and that condition could just be temporary and simply restarting your system will get things going again and if that works you should keep an eye on things
 because it could be a sign of a bigger problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your user profile is corrupted Windows will log you in to a temporary profile and that temporary profile is not going to have any of the things that you are used to seeing - but you can fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every user on your system has a user profile and under each user profile are all the things what belong to that user - the Windows desktop, the taskbar, the All Programs menus, Documents, Music, Images, etc.&nbsp; Each user has their own set of these and if Windows
 has logged you in to a temporary profile you are not going to see any of these things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Explorer to navigate to the C:\Users folder and look for a folder that has the same name as the user profile you are used to using - that is where all your "missing" items are.&nbsp; You might see something like this in the Users folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c9a724bc-120b-471b-a5a4-37f14337c9eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3655b99a-1741-4e2e-9868-be7b63285e97" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When your user profile is corrupted Windows will log you in to a temporary profile and that temporary profile is not going to have any of the things that you are used to seeing - but you can usually recover everything missing from a corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you login you might briefly see a message "Preparing your desktop" followed by a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=937f7707-d975-45ce-836d-00248b0a20f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30194e82-bab9-4cd2-8699-4e7bd803f586" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message will fade away leaving you with a desktop with just a few icons - maybe all you see are a few basic things like a Recycle Bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A temporary profile does not last...&nbsp; as soon as you shutdown or logoff the temporary profile is deleted and when you restart your system or login again you will see the same thing again (a good thing to test).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the problem is temporary and if you restart your system a few times things might start working again (lucky you) but if that does not work you are going to have to create a new Windows user and copy parts of the afflicted user profile to the new
 user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another quick test to verify the problem of a corrupted user profile is to open a Command Prompt window and see what the prompt says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a Command Prompt window and tell us what the prompt says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=20382857-f809-49f2-8783-1488b77717f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b2f885f-7175-4a0f-a9cb-aed6f9c87c3b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally the Command Prompt window will open in the Users folder that belongs to that user like this for user Jose:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=67489ccb-14d4-48e8-a8cb-db4d928cbe58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffdb1f55-780c-4c3a-8a43-39aac7400844" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the prompt looks like this, it means your login profile is corrupted and you have been logged in to a temporary profile (it says TEMP):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=09b91157-1859-4d53-8093-bea5f1abd845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e57d32ef-334d-4cfe-999a-25a0466be256" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open a Command Prompt window what does your prompt say?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your user profile is corrupted and fails repeatedly to login, you cannot fix or salvage it - you must create a new Windows user account and copy most (not all) of the files from your corrupted profile to the new user account and then use that new account
 from now on. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has an article that tells you how to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is likely that one of these files in the afflicted user profile is corrupted so don't copy these to the new user account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ntuser.dat</li><li>Ntuser.dat.log</li><li>Ntuser.ini</li></ul>
<p>One of those files has the corruption in it so you don't want to bring those corrupted files (or any that look like it) into the new user account you have created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example you would NOT want to copy files that looks like these from the corrupted profile into the new profile:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=de94f72d-605e-4fd5-b769-e7266cd834d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/31580e5e-0cc6-4a55-9e34-fc5965cbe09a" /></a></p>

<p>Not following that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my system to always open a Command Prompt as Administrator in the system32 folder since that is where I do most of my messing around.&nbsp; I don't remember where the Command Prompt opened before that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test my corrupted profile theory I created a new user called 'test' and logged in successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening a Command Prompt I was in c:\Users\test (I think - it was a long time ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The I logged out from user 'test', logged in another way and purposely "corrupted" the profile for user 'test' by renaming one of the profile files so it became missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I logged in as user 'test' again I got the temporary profile message, the desktop only had two icons on it and when I opened a command prompt I was in c:\Users\TEMP&gt; which is my clue that the profile was indeed temporary.</p>

<p>Understood.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>...Not wanting to confuse you any more! I'll try to explain a little better what I was trying to say in my earlier post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your screenshot above when you right click on cmd.exe and Run as administrator the prompt will be C:\windows\system32&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but if you open cmd.exe (not elevated) the prompt will be C:\Users\Jose&gt; (using your example).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might have confused the OP (and what they were seeing) because of the difference between "elevated" and "non-elevated" prompts, that's all. Not questioning your expertise at all.</p>

<h2>            Flight Simulator 2004 compatibility with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I've recently upgraded my computer from Windows XP to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Flt. Simulator 2004 has downloaded successfully into Windows 7, but will not run. When trying to open the program, the&nbsp;home screen of the program opens in reduced size for a couple of seconds,&nbsp;then
 replaced with revolving&nbsp;full-screen bands of 3-4 colors,&nbsp;causing me to re-boot.&nbsp; I've been told the problem&nbsp;could be&nbsp;graphic card/driver related, although right clicking on the icon says program is compatible. After clicking on many Microsoft and Intel self-help
 pages, and downloading the latest Intel "Express Chipset" the problem remains.&nbsp; Would appreciate any assistance...but please remember, keep it simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Possible to rescue games from an old account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Possible to rescue games from an old account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This used to be my secondary account. It was created on a machine that no longer exists. It has a bunch of XBLA games on it that were also bought and downloaded pn a machine that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Is it possible to go Gold, download the games and then cancel gold? Would the games still be playable with my main xbox live account on the new xbox?</p>
<p>Or maybe is it possible to transfer ownership of the games to my main account?</p>
<p>Or the only way I'll have to play those games is to go Gold and stay Gold?</p>
<p>Any way to check which games I own? :P It's been really long, since 2007.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. :)</p>

<p>Providing you can log in with the purchasing account, then you need not be Gold to get your games back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can set them up to download by logging into the site with the purchasing account and going here to add the items to your download queue
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/en-GB/account?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a> Once you've done that simply log-in with the same account on your console and the downloads should start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If for some reason the site is playing up, as it seems to be recently you can set-up the downloads from your console as well. Simply go to the My Xbox Channel and select your Avatar with A. Now move to the Account Management tab and select the Manage Account
 option. Here go to the bottom option of Download History where you can queue up the items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If when viewing Active Downloads (Guide button, Marketplace blade, Active Downloads) you get the message "Assigned to Another Console" simply Press Y to Download All Items and make your current console the default for downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I haven't worn you out with all that and I wish you the best with your games.</p>

<h2>            Compatibility with ubuntu</h2>
                    <p>I am planning to buy this device, but I would like to know whether dual booting with ubuntu will affect the touch screen and tablet. Are there special drivers required?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ubuntu does have the drivers for WiFi, Bluetooth, touchscreen, detachable keyboard, and the pen - BUT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran Ubuntu 17.10 on a Surface Pro 3 for 24 hours but did not setup a dual boot configuration; I wiped out the tablet and ran Linux on it for the whole day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to consider using Hyper V, VMWare, or VirtualBox and run it in a virtual machine instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dual booting on a Windows machine does work but sometimes GRUB will get an update and blow both operating systems (you cannot even recover the data)! &nbsp;Run it at your own risk in that fashion but it should work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pen function is not refined and basic, more like a mouse in resolution. &nbsp;Firefox is sluggish and also Linux is not very good with multitasking but will do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi connects instantly but at times, connection will be lost but the icon will display 5 bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard/touchpad work perfect and you can shut off the touchpad via the Settings panel in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get a serious drop in battery life and get around 2.5 to 3.5 hours with the i5 model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is said that the current Linux kernel 4.13 and higher includes the Surface drivers (tablets only) but I did try LinuxMint and it did not work. &nbsp;Fedora does but did not fully test it.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business&#92;Microsoft Teams - Sending Missed Calls Notification to Manager</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a group in Skype for Business which dials a number of engineers when a certain number is called.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to send notifications out explaining who picked up a call, or if the call was not answered by engineers through to a manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I would achieve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan Monks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification. Based on my experience, currently it is not feasible. If one call came in, Skype for Business would not give prompt report or notification to explain whether it was answered
 by some user and who answered it. If you use pure online Skype for Business service, what the only relevant feature came into my mind is you can let your manager check Skype for Business report in Office 365 admin center:</p>

            It is the "new &amp; improved" Paint ... 
<br />
<br />It is new software from MS. No surprise it is feature deficient.  
<br />
<br />Check the File menu for a feedback command. If there isn't use the Windows feedback hub to submit your feature request / complaint to MS.  The feeback site, UserVoice, is the only place MS is sure to look at your submission. There are relatively few MS staff who see submissions here.

<br />
<br />The Text you created in Paint, can you export it as a png and then import it into Paint 3D - that should hold the formatting . . .

<h2>            How can I access my Earthlink mail account folders from Mail&#63; Or ANY progam in Win8&#63;</h2>
                    I am new to Win8 and hate it. But I'm stuck with it because it came on my new HP. Anywayz, I need to get all my old EarthLink messages (from a Win XP system running TotalAccess). How can I get Mail to access the EarthLink inbox folders? If I can't do that,
 how can I migrate the old messages to Mail. (Transfer Tool didn't)&nbsp; TIA<br />
<br />
Here is a rephrasing of that question:<br />
<br />
how do i import messages (from Earthlink Mailbox) into outlook?<br />
<br />
I used the Export function in Earthlink Mailbox (on an XP system) to produce a .csv (and .dat) file. The file was an export of my old inbox and all the saved folders I had attached to it. How can I get these saved email folders into Outlook?

            <p>Hi Jean</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the delay in our response. Based on your post, I understand that you want to transfer the emails from your Earthlink to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, can you please verify what are you referring when you say you want to transfer it&nbsp;to Outlook? Is it&nbsp;the Microsoft Outlook&nbsp;email client, or&nbsp;your Outlook.com/Microsoft account?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emails on your Earthlink account can't be imported to your Outlook account. If in case you are referring to the Outlook email client, you can post it at the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/outlook">
Microsoft Outlook support forum</a> as they are the one who can better help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also configure your account on Windows Live Mail, which is part of Windows Essentials (Different from the Mail app in Windows&nbsp;8).&nbsp;This would automatically get the emails from the Earthlink server. You can download it here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Essentials</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, please follow the steps in this article to configure your account.</p>

<p>Boa tarde galera,</p>
<p>Comprei uma TV 3d e obviamente quero ver filmes em 3d, o xbox tem a capacidade de reproduzir conteudo no formato mkv direto do pendrive?</p>
<p>Ou preciso converte-los para mp4?</p>

<p>Se não me engano precisa converter sim pois que me lembre o 360 reproduz wmv, mov, mas baixando optional media aqui no site mesmo no link:</p>

<p>Permite uma gama maior de vídeos serem rodados (mas MKV não é mesmo assim suportado) eu sei que no meu depois deste update rodou tudo menos MKV (só não testei MP4 pois não tenho quase vídeo algum neste formato).</p>

<p>Eu tenho uma 3D também, mas nem tentei rodar pelo Xbox, fica muito mais simples colocar o HD externo direto na TV, ou então usar o PLEX(no caso da minha que é LG) pelo computador para fazer o streaming. Os arquivos mkv de 3D são tudo acima de 8Gb para coloca-los
 no Xbox vc vai precisar de um HD externo, então pq não colocar direto na TV pq ela já roda os MKV?</p>

<h2>            How many GB of space will the Halo&#58; The Master Chief Collection take on Xbox One&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How&nbsp;many GB of space will the Halo: The Master Chief Collection take on Xbox One? This game has a lot of content 93 online maps from all of the 4 Halo games combine including the PC maps plus all the 4 games are put together on one disc so this game is gonna
 take a lot of space I think I'm not sure my guess is like 20 GB.What do you guys think?</p>

<p>If you add up the needed space for digital download on Halo CE anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 4 it would be about 26GB or show (not counting DLC maps). &nbsp;Now if you add in Halo 2 add in every single map from all DLC from all the games and bump up the resolution
 and graphics the memory storge will like be at least 30GB or show. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be interesting to find out how much space this will take up as the games are remastered in full HD for the XBox One so they will probably take up more space than what Rogue Warrior quotes above. &nbsp;I really wish there were a standard looking console
 with 1TB like what will be coming out for CoD: Advanced Warfare. &nbsp;Personally, I'd love to see an XBox One Ultimate edition with 1TB driveHDrive and Kinect. &nbsp;Barring that a Halo edition as long as the console was tastefully done with a more subdued approach
 would be fine.</p>

<p>The basic Halo: The Master Chief Collection download will take up Size: 59.11 GB per the xbox.com &nbsp;store:
<a href="https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/Games/Halo-The-Master-Chief-Collection/f33009f4-14ff-4821-94e3-c3573c868c2e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
store.xbox.com/.../f33009f4-14ff-4821-94e3-c3573c868c2e</a></p>
<p>Now if you add Halo 2 plus add in every single map from all the DLC maps from all the Halo games plus download the new digital series, Halo: Nightfall, and access to the Halo 5: Guardians Multiplayer Beta and bump up the resolution and graphics the memory
 storage might be at least take up another 20-30GB. Also the Halo Collection Has A 20 GB Day-One Update.</p>
<p>The initial Call of Duty®: Advanced Warfare takes up Size: 48.97 GB so the regular 500GB Xbox One Console will only hold like 10 games. Makes the 1TB hard drive a requirement plus I read &nbsp; /PRNewswire/ -- WD®, a Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) company, and
 world leader in storage solutions, today introduced the My Passport® X portable hard drive for gamers. When connected to Xbox One™ or a PC, the sleek 2 TB My Passport X drive provides much-needed storage capacity for gamers to store up to 50 extra game titles,
 eliminating the need to delete previously purchased games from their Xbox One or PC hard drives and removing those "storage full" warning messages while allowing players to get back to their games. In addition to added storage, gamers can use My Passport X
 to take saved games to use on friends' systems without having to download. "Game file sizes are expanding to 36 GB per game and upwards, and are projected to continue growing," said Tony Tate, vice president and general manager of WD's Content Solutions unit.
 "Console gamers are able to store on average only 10 games on the 365 GB out of 500 GB that is available on the onboard hard drive. The My Passport X portable drive delivers a fast and easy way to expand capacity and enables an expanded library of games on
 the go."</p>

<p>The basic Halo: The Master Chief Collection download that take up 59.11 GB can take an average of 8 hrs. (even with fast internet) &nbsp;And if you do get the disc it requires a the 20 GB Day-One Update per complaints in other forums due to a download cap unlike
 Halo 4 that came with 2 discs. &nbsp;They feel if it were Bungie releasing this collection we wouldn't be hearing this, that 343 screws up everything with a &nbsp;half-assed, crudely cobbled-together product prone to crashing, lockups (and as of press time) absolutely
 non-functional multiplayer. 343 must have noticed and began to apply patches throughout the next couple days after launch saying "Fixing issues in multiplayer", however I haven't seen them make much of a difference with the extremely long wait times. &nbsp;big
 team battle is limited to only 12 players instead of the usual 16. As time went on they seemed to attempt to fix these problems by removing half of the multiplayer playlists including all halo 1 &amp; 4 lists, leaving us with only 7 to choose from. Unfortunately
 this didn't really seem to help much, matchmaking was a tad bit faster but there were still 15-30 minute waits to find a game, not even close what I'd expect from a next gen game, even halo 3 back in 2007 was 10x faster, it's inexcusable. The need to bring
 back Bungie! Plus since the console and games are so expensive, Xbox Live needs to be FREE! Also prefer cheaper corded controllers (like the 360) that won't die in the middle of gameplay like wireless controllers.</p>

<p>Start deleting games to make room of your remaining 350GB after the system uses the remaining 150GB for its OS. Or mindlessly throw away aa $100 for not a game but system upgrade with an external harddrive.</p>

<h2>            File Explorer should treat .mpo files like .jpg files</h2>
                    <div>
<p>The .mpo files are 3D picture files that consist of two jpg images (left and right view). The EXIF data for a .mpo file includes all the fields for a jpg file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File explorer does not display Date Taken and other EXIF data for my <a href="https://capablegroupinc.ca/basement-renovation-in-mississauga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
basement</a>&amp;<a href="https://www.canfloor.com/catalog/vinyl-flooring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> flooring</a> projects .mpo files because it treats them as an img instead of a jpg. If the .jpg extension is added to an .mpo file, then the EXIF data
 is displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could a simple change to the registry have .mpo files be recognized as .jpg files and display the EXIF data as it should?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have experimented with adding the .jpg file extension to .mpo files and it appears the file content is not affected when copying and moving files. It would be awkward to continually add and remove the .jpg file extension:</p>
<p>filename.mpo (EXIF data not displayed&nbsp;but can be displayed in 3D) -&gt;</p>
<p>filename.mpo.jpg (.jpg extension added, EXIF data displayed but can't be displayed in 3D) -&gt;</p>
<p>filename.mpo (.jpg extension removed, EXIF data not displayed but can be displayed in 3D)</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>MPO file format is yet to be fully supported by Windows and that is the reason behind EXIF data not being displayed. Most probably, Windows might not display the EXIF data even if you
 tweak registry as it is not fully supported. </span></span></p>

<h2>            Moderate NAT type help - Linksys WRT320N &#47; Cisco DPQ3212 setup</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a Linksys WRT320N router connected to my Cisco DPQ3212 cable modem. I am stuck on a moderate NAT type, but cannot get it to "open". My main objective in opening my NAT is to join a party and play Halo 4 with a player that I currently cannot.
</p>
<p>Connections to router:</p>
<p>&gt;Xbox (ethernet)</p>
<p>&gt;PC (ethernet)</p>
<p>&gt;2 computers, and some misc. devices (4) connected wirelessly.</p>
<p>I have given my Xbox a static IP address of 192.168.1.110, and i have port forwarded the ports:</p>
<p>53 TCP and UDP, 80 TCP, 88 UDP, 3074 TCP and UDP. They are all enabled. I'm not sure if application name matters, but they are 1,2,3 and 4.</p>
<p>I saved the settings, restarted my router, and no cookie. Still moderate.</p>
<p>Additional info:</p>
<p>-ISP: Cox</p>
<p>-I have a wireless adapter for 360 if I need to use it</p>
<p>-I attempted to enter my modem, but after login (blank/blank) I did not see any configurable settings.</p>
<p>-Disabling NAT alone screwed everything up, disabling NAT and DHCP server (in attempt to get bridged mode) really screwed things up (not sure if i did it correctly though). I reset my router to defaults after that and then tried port forwarding with a static
 IP.</p>
<p>-Cox customer support was useless</p>

<p>If I am forgetting anything please let me know, I really appreciate any and all help! I am not sure what is wrong or how to fix it</p>

            <p>Hey there Echo!</p>
<p>Firstly: Visit linksys webpage and make sure your router is up-to-date with the latest version of firmware.<br /><br />Secondly: When you configure network ports to be manually forward, (Port Forward/Virtual Server) make sure you turn off UPnP. These two features should not be enabled at the same time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is UPnP, Port Triggering or DMZ enabled? If so, please disable those as they interfere with the Port Forwards you set.</p>
