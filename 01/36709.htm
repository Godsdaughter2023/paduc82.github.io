    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary - freezing&#47;pausing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sumsolstice95014  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary - freezing&#47;pausing</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I upgraded&nbsp;three systems - one i7 desktop and two i7 notebooks - to Windows 10 Anniversary (from Windows 10, which were previously upgraded from Windows 7).&nbsp; Silly me - as I was low on disk space afterwards, I did the disk cleanup and deleted
 all the old versions and install files.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The i7 desktop started freezing up a lot - I checked the system logs and saw lots of I/O timeouts on the disk subsystem (Patriot Ignite 480GB SSD).&nbsp; I rebooted, it seemed OK, so I downloaded the Patriot disk utility and updated the drive's firmware.&nbsp; The
 drive toasted - the system won't boot, etc.&nbsp; I'm trying to see if I can get Patriot Memory to replace the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the notebooks (am writing this on) is an HP 2540p - i7 2.13GHz, 8GB RAM, Crucial C300 256GB SSD - have noticed pausing on as well.&nbsp; Checked the system logs - see several instances of disk&nbsp;timeout, retries, and resets here as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System<br />
Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disk</p>
<p>The IO operation at logical block address 0x11f64b30 for Disk 0 (PDO name: \Device\00000037) was retried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System<br />
Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storahci</p>
<p>Reset to device, \Device\RaidPort0, was issued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft - they basically gave me the link to&nbsp;create the&nbsp;.ISO file (they claim it's the Anniversary edition, but I don't know yet) and said I could use my existing Win7 or later keys to activate Win10.&nbsp; Never mind all the lost time or data,
 nor the toasted SSD (my fault, I suppose) involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what I am seeing&nbsp;on these two systems (third is same notebook as second, but with Intel X-18 160GB SSD vs the Crucial in this one&nbsp;- and I haven't checked it yet) - I would not advise anyone&nbsp;I know to do the update to Windows 10 Anniversary edition
 until this issue is understood/resolved.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also (one of the few) with Windows Phone 10 (Nokia Lumia Icon) - doubt I'll be updating it to the Anniversary edition any time soon.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I reported this problem 3 or 4 times while testing insider builds as well as others. I have an FX8320 and 5 drives 2 of which are SSDs. My drives would constantly freeze/read slow and I would get the exact same error messages in event viewer. THE SOLUTION
 THAT I FOUND was to update the &nbsp;SATA controller drivers which I manually had to do through device manager/AMD chipset drivers. Since then my drives have been working decently with no freezes/error messages. I reported this problem more than a few times and
 knew it wasn't my system since everything ran smoothly every time I rolled back. My advice to anyone reading this with the same problem&nbsp;would be to first try updating your SATA drivers. I knew this was going to be a problem once this update released.

            <p>Looking on the HP Elitebook 2540p&nbsp;notebook now that&nbsp;reported the system log entry above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure about how to update these drivers,&nbsp;search for updated drivers said I had the most current version.&nbsp; FYI&nbsp;- it appears the driver version for this was part of the MS Install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storage Controllers:&nbsp; Microsoft Storage Spaces Controller,&nbsp;&nbsp; Device Provider: Microsoft,&nbsp; Driver Date: 06/21/2006, Driver Version 10.0.14393.0, Driver Signer: Microsoft Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AHCI driver is: Driver&nbsp;c:\windows\system32\drivers\storahci.sys (10.0.14393.0, 128.34 KB (131,424 bytes), 7/16/2016 4:41 AM)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The storage controller driver is from 2006?&nbsp; And it has the same version # as the storahci driver?&nbsp; &nbsp;I would have thought MS would have updated this along the way - perhaps it was inherited from the original Win7 install, then grandfathered to Win10, and
 into Win10 Anniversary?&nbsp; I'll start looking for newer ones if I can find them somewhere.&nbsp; Perhaps Intel has some for the chipset in the HP, but I don't see anything new on their site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks DarkgamerX - you gave me somewhere to start looking.&nbsp; MS - if you're reading this - I think this is something that needs to be looked at ASAP.</p>

            My previous SATA drivers had the exact same date. I looked for newer ones for my motherboard but did not find any on the ASUS website so I went to AMDs site and looked for chipset drivers for 9series motherboards. Just try looking for more recent compatible
 SATA drivers for your board. I tried clean installs with insider redstone builds and they all had the same ancient drivers and the same freezing problem. I never had to manually update the default drivers to get things working properly which is why this problem
 had me rolling back to the public build. I find it difficult to believe that this problem made its way into the final release. One guy who reported it had 11 upvotes so you would think they would have at least acknowledged it.

            <p>The laptop uses the Intel QM57 (IbexPeak-M) chipset.&nbsp; Can't find anything new driver-wise on Intel's website, and nothing past Win7 available on HP's site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running the&nbsp;latest driver update package from late 2015 on Intel's site can't find anything to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing I really see as an option from web searching is to tweak the registry to go from AHCI to IDE mode, then shutdown and switch the settings in BIOS to go to IDE.&nbsp; Not quite ready to go there yet - hopefully MS (or Intel) will come up with a newer
 driver or something - can't believe this isn't going to cause them a&nbsp;huge amount of grief going forward.

            Have you tried updating the driver manually? Find the sata driver in device manager and click on "update driver software". Click on "browse my computer for driver software" and browse to where the driver is located. Include subfolders should also be checked.
 From there if a sata driver is in the package it should be updated.

<p>
</p><p>Yes - I tried that - for both the Storage Controllers&nbsp;\ Microsoft Storage Spaces Controller driver and the IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers \ Standard SATA AHCI Controller tree - started with C:\ and include subdirs.&nbsp; Had even extracted the files out of the most
 likely Intel driver update&nbsp;and had them in a subdirectory off the root - didn't find anything there either.&nbsp; It's getting annoying - some of the pauses are a few seconds, the longest being 30 seconds.</p>

    <title>Cannot set Windows Font Viewer as default program for TTF filetype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xenodrake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot set Windows Font Viewer as default program for TTF filetype</h2>
                    <p>I'm on Windows 10 64-bit, latest Anniversary update, and I am trying to reinstall some TTF fonts, but when I open them they open in some MFC IMDisplay application, and I can't use that to install them. When I try to select an app in the Windows 10 Default
 Programs in Settings, "Windows Font Viewer" doesn't show up as an option for TTF, but it is selected for other font files like TTC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I try to right-click on the TTF file and Open With, Browse for Windows Font Viewer myself (C:\Windows\System32\Fontview.exe), and it shows an error: "The program you have selected cannot be associated with this file type. Please choose another program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very odd. And I'm dealing with other odd issues right now I'm trying to sort out. I'm an IT major but I can't figure this one out on my own.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed reply, I only just received notification that there had been a response left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately my laptop does not have a removable battery so I was unable to do your test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue I have noticed Windows 10 has done some updates, coincidence or not, the issue seems to have stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll monitor the situation and advise if it returns.</p>

<p>Go into "Safe Mode with Networking" by rebooting your computer and tapping the F8 key, then using the arrow keys to select Safe Mode... and hit enter. Then download Malwarebytes Antimalware and run Full Scan, then "Show Results" and "Remove Selected". If
 your are asked to restart your computer, then do so and itwill restart normally. Then download "Revo Uninstaller" and&nbsp;unistall Click Potato from the list of installed programs. Make sure to reasd the instructions for using Revo Uninstaller. I believe there
 are also instructional/tutorial videos for using Revo Uninstaller available. After unistalling with Revo restart your computer and run CCleaner in it's default mode(ie. as you first install it)</p>

            Thanks rhabdomantist,
<div>I actually found this link after stumbling on Revo Uninstaller which i hoped would remove clickpotato (I have tried many times over about a year to get rid of it!). The strange thing is it didn't actually list clickpotato so google brought me here after
 I typed in Revo...doesn't find click potato! I followed your instructions and Malwarebytes found and removed the click potato program (i think!! I can't find it anymore anyway!).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ran Revo uninstaller again ( thinking maybe it would appear, you never know!) and it still didn't find it but after taking your advice and reading your instructions ended up using many of its other very useful features!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your info and help!</div>

<h2>            Can I deactivate windows 10 pro from faulty laptop &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought a laptop and seperate bought windows 10 as well but the language was korean version so I upgraded it to windows 10 pro to use english as display language ( the windows 10 home korean version didn't support english as display english even not allowed
 me install language pack)</p>
<p>so I got windows 10 pro in the laptop however, after that bluescreen kept come up so I sent it back to the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent almost 300pound just for&nbsp; for windows 10 home( kor version) and for windows 10 pro to upgrade it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I logged in microsoft account which I used for the laptop but my windows 10 pro is still active and linked with the faulty laptop.</p>
<p>I got new fancy good laptop I wanna use my windows 10 pro for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>don't tell me I can't use the 10 pro anymore please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it's bounded with my microsoft account not with the faulty laptop I think. and the windows 10 upgraded from FTP version not from OEM version.</p>
<p>is there any solution for me ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Sarah,<br />
<br />
Upon successfully activating Windows 10, your device is entitled to a digital license which is tied to your Microsoft account. On your new device, you can run the Activation troubleshooter to reactive your license. Kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;button, select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Update &amp; security</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Activation&nbsp;</strong>,
 and then select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. You must be signed in as an administrator.</span></li><li><span>The troubleshooter will show a message that Windows can’t be activated on your device. Select&nbsp;<strong>I changed hardware on this device recently</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Enter your Microsoft account and password, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Sign in</strong>. You’ll also need to enter the password for your local account if the Microsoft account you entered isn’t a connected
 account.</span></li><li><span>From the list of devices that are linked to your Microsoft account, select the device that you’re currently using, select the check box next to&nbsp;<strong>This is the device I’m
 using right now</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Activate</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let me know how it goes.</span></p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks so much for your reply. Unfortunately when I go on the Activation panel in Settings I get no Troubleshoot option. When I try and enter the product key it tells me that the product key "can't be used on this copy of Windows". My laptop is fully updated.
 How can I solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>If you’re signed in using the correct Microsoft account, here are some reasons why you can’t reactivate Windows:
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The edition of Windows on your device doesn’t match the edition of Windows you linked to your digital license.</li><li>The type of device you’re activating doesn’t match the type of device you linked to your digital license.<br />
Windows was never activated on your device.</li><li>You reached the limit on the number of times you can reactivate Windows on your device.<br />
Your device has more than one administrator, and a different administrator already reactivated Windows on your device.</li><li>Your device is managed by your organization and the option to reactivate Windows isn’t available. For help with reactivation, contact your organization’s support person.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still having issues reactivating your product key, I recommend that you get in contact with our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Support team</a> for further support.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to sync iphone with new computer &#40;windows 10 OS&#41;</h2>
                    I just downloaded iTunes and hooked up my iPhone&nbsp; to my new computer. I am trying to sync in order to download pictures from the phone. I keep getting a popup saying that it can't sync because&nbsp;itunes can't find the folder, "iPhone pics." I have no idea
 what that means. Does it mean the folder with such a name is not on my computer (it is)? or is not on my phone?
<br />
Help would be appreciated.<br />
Thank you!

            <p>The latest version of iTunes should solve this. And I use the FonePaw iOS Transfer which is nice and much more powerful than iTunes, but you have to pay for some functions. Overall, I will prefer that. You can sync your iPhone to new computer with simple
 clicks. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Erlend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions in order to understand the issue better. </p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>When you say “SSD drive not listed on boot manager” what exactly do you mean by you have to access Special list to find it?</li></ol>
<p><span>These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably a driver).&nbsp;Follow these methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><span> You may follow the suggestion provided in this Microsoft article and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would suggest you to boot into Safe mode with networking and check if you face similar issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If issue doesn’t persists in safe mode you can try performing Clean Boot. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

            <p>Hi Soofi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most programs written for Windows&nbsp;Vista also work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run correctly, you can try changing the compatibility settings
 for the program, either manually or by using the Program Compatibility troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.

            <p>Yes and no. Beats was bought by Apple sometime ago. And Apple/Beats use a different wiring standard (OMTP). The Xbox controller uses the standard that Android phones use (CTIA).</p><p><br /></p><p>What that means is that the mic and ground wire are flipped. So when you plug in your beats headset into the controller you will be able to hear others but your mic won't work or it will just make noise.</p><p><br /></p><p>You would need to get an OMTP to CTIA adapter.<br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Connecting a compatible headset to Xbox One<br /><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/connect-compatible-headset</a></p><p><br /></p>

                    with the Japanese keyboard in windows 7 ultimate it has you type in katakana by default.&nbsp; this is incredibly annoying, katakana is near worthless when it comes to japanese words how can i switch it to write in hiragana?&nbsp; THIS IS NOT Microsoft IME please
 do not post solutions for IME or tell me to use IME as romanji is even more worthless as it is a major crutch and even a hindrance to learning the language.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&nbsp;would suggest you to go through the steps and check.</p>
<p><strong><span>Keyboard shortcuts</span><br />
</strong><br />
<strong><span>ALT-~ (tilde):</span></strong> Cycles between kana and direct input mode<br />
<strong><span>ALT-SHIFT:</span></strong> Cycles through available languages<br />
<strong><span>ALT-CAPS_LOCK:</span></strong> Switches to katakana input mode<br />
<strong><span>CTRL-CAPS_LOCK:</span></strong> Switches to hiragana input mode<br />
<strong><span>SHIFT-ALT:</span></strong> Switches between English mode and Japanese mode.<br />
<strong><span>Control - ~:</span></strong> Switches between the current input mode and the English mode within the Japanese IME.</p>
<p><br />
<strong><span>TIP:</span></strong> Switching between Hiragana input mode and Direct Input mode through the language bar is tedious. Instead you can switch by pressing Alt-Tilde (the key below ESC on your keyboard).
 So, if you need to type Japanese, press Alt-Tilde and start typing. When you are done press Alt-Tilde again to switch back to English. To achieve the same result when in Japanese mode, press Control - ~.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Mouse doesn&#39;t work with Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    Yesterday, when I updated m Windows 10 to the Creators Update, my bluetooth mouse (Microsoft Designer Bluetooth Mouse) stopped working. It said I had to reinstall the driver, which we couldn't find. I called support and eventually we ended up restoring
 Windows to the previous version. The mouse now works, but I don't have the features of the Creators Update. When will the mouse be compatible?

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you have contacted answer desk and was advised to rollback the update for the mouse to work, that would mean that the specific drivers for the mouse is still underway. For the meantime, we would like to have your feedback regarding this issue by using
 the <strong>Windows Feedback Hub</strong> that you can get from the Windows Store for free by clicking on this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my PC is a Samsung Galaxy TabPro S. I have two expensive Bluetooth accessories : a dedicated Samsung Galaxy C Pen and a Microsoft Designer Mouse. They worked perfectly on Windows 10 1607 and they CANNOT be connected on Windows 10 1703 "Creators Update".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's unacceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Microsoft does not give us any control over updates and they just happen. Now my Designer Mouse does not work at all, it won't even Pair anymore. Rolling back an update and spending ages on messing up my system is not an acceptable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working flawlessly before the update. you BROKE it. now FIX it. I paid for the mouse and the OS, both are Microsoft Products so don't make your mistake my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix it!</p>

<p>5 months after the Creator "upgrade", still no fix nor ETA on a fix for this mouse issue ???!!!</p>
<p>I pretty much like the solution offered by support : "use another mouse". Thanks for the tip Microsoft, but it seems only a halfway solution, I will go directly to using another OS and vendor, never heard of issues between 2 Apple devices..</p>

    <title>How to Complain about Windows 10 and Customer Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tasha marie  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Complain about Windows 10 and Customer Service</h2>
                    <p>A couple of things to complain about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 3 nights ago, and since then the performance of my computer has slowed right down, and certain elements have even become unresponsive. This morning, I had to restart my computer several times just to be able to use it normally because
 none of the icons or menus were responding. I'm now able to use it of course, but certain settings such as adjusting the brightness of the screen (which went up by itself after the upgrade) cannot be changed despite my efforts; it simply does not acknowledge
 that I'm trying to change it. That's the first complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second thing is that I got through to the Answer Desk Chat to address the issue with someone online - I got through to Mary N - who, after taking control over my computer, ran numerous scans and restarted the computer several times, with no result. On
 top of that, something simple like asking her how to turn off these new notification sounds because they were so loud and disruptive, she couldn't figure out the answer to. Her way of dealing with it was to run another scan, click on unrelated menu items such
 as 'apps' and and disabling a bunch of things on my computer that were nothing to do with what I had asked her, before restarting the computer again which cut off the conversation completely that time. Not only had nothing been fixed, but I found out how to
 turn off the notification sounds and it was so easy to do. What kind of professional is this person? How do I know that she couldn't still be in control over my computer? That's the second complaint. I never got back in contact with her though, which leads
 me to my next complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third complaint is, when I got back to the Answer Desk Chat, and was put through to Edmund V, I explained the whole situation to him, and after a half hour of silence, I gave up on the conversation. Another "professional". I took a screen shot of it
 just in case I need to provide proof. That's the third complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last complaint is, why is there no way to complain?????? I've searched through the support topics provided, and the community discussions and questions and "answers", but there is nothing to help me to get through to someone who I can actually talk to
 and resolve SOMETHING at least. Is there someone out there at ALL who can help? I am in the UK, so I need a number or something that I am able to contact from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any helpful answers.</p>

            I too have had nothing but trouble. Of course customer service is a joke. They give you American names, but none of them live in the US. All the CS's are outsourced to other countries. With that being said, this release is the worst by far. They released
 it before it was fully tested, in fact al of us who installed it are the testers. On top of everything you said, 10 randomly closes my apps when in use, which has already cost me more money than I care to talk about. I wonder if I can sue MS for lost wages
 due to their **** **** product. The only reason at all for me to use this junk, is some of the software I use is designed for windows or Mac, and honestly, **** Mac too, they are worse than MS. Every app closes on its own, causing loss of data. Lock screen
 stays locked, requiring a reboot to unlock screen. For the original poster, go get Linux Mint. It will install side by side with windows, and its just as easy, if not easier. Plus hackers don't mess with it, and you can do so much more than

            <p>Dear Microsoft...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 days ago, one of my children hit that terrible "upgrade to windows 10 button".&nbsp; The next day, I found windows 10 on my computer, and after 4 hours of swearing &amp; cursing, I finally had located alol of my missing files.</p>
<p>yesterday, I logged on, and found that all the files I had found, and re-placed onto my desktop had disappeared!&nbsp; enough, I said.</p>
<p>I reverted to windows 7, only to spend the same amount of time trying to find my data.&nbsp; when I was just about completed reloading my data, my computer screen blinked a few times, and then AUTOMATICALLY STARTED TO UPGRADE BACK TO WINDOWS 10.!
</p>
<p>One BIG difference this time. . . besides not wanting it. . . all my data was now ERASED!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew it was soon time to replace my PC, but you have now helped me make a better informed decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello APPLE!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>did I mention that they were adoption files, special ed files, and employment files?&nbsp; Irreplaceable?&nbsp; My kids will be soooo happy with Microsoft when they turn 18 and start asking questions. . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>way to go Microsoft!</p>

            same here...it was done compulsorily without my permission and while I was in the middle of something. I cannot get my gmail emails on the new system despite trying every fix I have read in all the blogs and my computer is so much slower.&nbsp; Unless someone
 can get my email capacity back for my gmail account I will be reverting to Windows 8 in the next few days. Without my eamils easily accessible my laptop is useless.&nbsp; I am in my sixties but computer literate though I am considering giving up on the whole joke
 now.&nbsp; Why cant I find anyone to help me fix my emails.

<p>Reply to all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate Windows 10. For what felt like months I refused to make the switch. It happened automatically while I was working graveyard one night, when I came home to my computer shut off I was confused, and I turned it on and it was all different. I was livid.
 I didn't want this ****. Assuming I would never get my old os back, I tried my best to accept it. So the next time I turned it on it wouldn't go to windows, it was a screen saying that something went wrong and it couldn't start up, and my options were to redownload
 windows 10, continue and select whatever files I wanted to keep and try download again. livid. so I tried to save all my photos. finally after 2 days got the damn thing to start only to find it takes 10x as long to get to any website, all my Microsoft word/excel/office
 software was gone, so I couldn't access all my budgets and resumes. so I tried to download the software again and adding fuel to fire it took 3.5&nbsp;**** days to download it! my computer didn't use to be slow. and now after all that fun stuff I find I cant burn
 a&nbsp;**** disc anymore! are you kidding me!? delete all my software so I cant do anything. make it stupid slow so I cant do anything. I hate you windows 10. worst "upgrade" ever. windows 10 can go jump off a roof. I hate this.</p>

            <p>It seems to me that the more we get frustrated with the poor service, the less MS listen and the less they do!</p>
<p>So, lets try a polite approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To somebody high up in MS management:</p>
<p>You clearly have (or had) a great reputation, and great knowledge of the kit you produce. Please would you grasp this problem? It has many strands, you need a whole team to resolve this, and I politely suggest you get it done before we all go to Apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I'm still here when you email me to say its all fixed.</p>

            <p>I have tried for months to resolve my Windows 10 nightmare , I did speak to someone on the phone ( from America ) but got no help. I have also been in chats with the help desk but found them useless and like you they took control of my PC for over an hour
 with no joy.</p>
<p>i find it incredible that with all the complaints that have been made Microsoft still seem to be ignoring their customers , it's a sign of how the whole system is set up when at the bottom of any technicians reply you have a " helpful " button but no unhelpful
 button.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I woke up yesterday to find my computer upgraded to windows 10.... it was left on overnight&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I HATE WINDOWS 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st &nbsp;I hate how you microsoft keeps changing my computer ..... I have vision problems so i tried to change it back like how I had it but it would not let me.... that option was grayed out.. &nbsp;it also seemed to be hazy (not clear )</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd every 5+ secs the screen would jump like it was unstable. &nbsp;come to find out if I was on any website/page it actually would keep jumping to the top of that particular page&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd my sound stop working&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4th I tried to go back to my old version but the computer said it was not available .... i thought you had 30 days.... &nbsp;then it says the old version was deleted to make room for more storage/info</p>
<p>
</p><p>5th I awoke to my computer saying "you will like some of the changes to your computer " &nbsp;NO I THINK NOT &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my only option was a 90 day online trial windows 8..... &nbsp;after 90 days then I have to pay? I just paid $700+ for this computer &nbsp;now i have to pay for windows 8. &nbsp; microsoft, you know exactly what you are doing, UNLESS I can get windows 8 free from IBUYPOWER
 or MICROSOFT&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I feel scammed&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft certification process</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i have a short question: If a publisher wants to release a new Game, the game has to pass the Microsoft&nbsp;certification process. That means, the game must match certain technical things.</p>
<p>Is it right, that one of the guidlinie is: to use not morethen 100KB Downloadload or 10 KB Upload (or something similar)?</p>
