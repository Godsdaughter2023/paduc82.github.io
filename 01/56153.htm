<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t boot...&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; pissed off&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I hate windows 10...laptop won't boot up. It decided that with the short time I was on the Net that it wanted to download updates...without telling me. Was only on for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can't fix this or have it fixed, than I'm going to talk to a lawyer about a class-Action suit against this colossal piece of **** called Windows 10. I was only on for 5 **** MINUTES AND IT DECIDES TO GET **** UPDATES!!! BRING BACK THE OPTION TO JUST
 SEE IF THERE ARE ANY **** UPDATES!!!<br />
</p>
<p>Now if you want a question than here's one: HOW DO I BLOODY FIX THIS WITHOUT LOSING **** EVERYTHING!!!!</p>

            <p>Just finished doing that for about 10 hours and Windows 10 update toasted my hard drive. Drive is completely unresponsive and failed its &nbsp;SMART Test. Coudn't wipe the drive as it wold not respond. The drive is totally toasted. Will now have to buy a new
 one and I better not run into ANY problems reactivating Windows 10 because I had to replace a drive damaged by a Windows Update. &nbsp;😠</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I will state that the laptop was working perfectly until I went on the Net for 5 **** minutes when Windows 10 decided to update itself.</p>

            New drive for my laptop (Kingston 1TB SSD) just came in after having the other drive destroyed by a Windows Update. Will be reinstalling Windows 10 on Saturday and will call Microsoft if I have any activation problems.

<h2>            Xbox One - blank screen</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever my xbox is turned completely off (off standby, when you cannot turn it on via kinect) and I turn it back on it will not project to my tv. HDMI cable is good and so is the port I've verified with my 360 and PC. The only way to get it to work seems
 to be to reset the resolution every single time and this only works after the xbox has sat for at least 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tv when turned on says "no signal" &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Gears of War 2 DLC Request Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjachang yt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War 2 DLC Request Microsoft</h2>
                    
<p>I hopped on Gears 3 the other day and got an alert that I could not play online until I downloaded the map packs that have now been made free. Thus, the map pack levels are playable in normal matchmaking. So my request is that the same thing be done for
 Gears of War 2. Alot of people have been wanting this to happen for years and have now given up hope. There is a total of 19 DLC maps for GOW2, and people would love to play these maps commonly in regular matchmaking.</p>
<p>Sadly, &nbsp;Epic never did anything about this; and now, since Microsoft has bought GOW from Epic, I was wondering if they could make this change. If Epic still has control over past games I would hope that Microsoft could request this of them on our behalf.
 It's a good place to start in listening to the GOW Community moving forward. I hope this may come to pass. Thanks.</p>

<p>Ohh, it was the Boost Map Pack that was free and required to download before playing GOW3 online, duhh...</p>
<p>Even still, since all of the 19 Map Packs cost $9.99 total on GOW2 currently, I would still hope that they could be free and required to play online. Or at the very least, please make the Flashback Map Pack free and required before playing online; so that
 we may final have a change. The second option may be more realistic and it would still be great, because we would love to play those old GOW Maps again on GOW2.</p>

<p>Maybe 1 out of every 200 games, map pack levels are present in regular matchmaking for me. I am pretty sure that this is because everybody in the lobby had the maps downloaded, thus making the map pack levels a viable option. But this is very very rare.
 So if all the DLC Maps, or solely the Flashback Map Pack is made free and required for online play, these levels should show up in matchmaking alot more, and this would be amazing. Can I get a response from support on this? Thanks alot, and sorry for making
 three separate posts, I was posting expecting to be able to edit.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Edna Allen,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Since when are you facing the issue?<br />
3. Have you done any recent changes on the computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to try uninstalling and reinstalling the touch screen drivers in device manager and check if this
 helps. </span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.</span></span><span><span>Click &nbsp;<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click &nbsp;<strong>System</strong>,
 and then click&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<strong>Note</strong> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click &nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click &nbsp;<strong>Allow</strong>.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.</span></span><span><span>In Device Manager, expand the appropriate category for the touch
 screen driver and right-click the listed driver. Here you will get all the option to update or Install/uninstall drivers. Click on
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
<strong>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Restart the computer. This will let the computer automatically detect the device drivers on restart of the computer. Now check if the issue
 resolves.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>If the issue persists you may contact or refer to the website of the computer manufacturer and get the latest drivers
 installed for the touch screen to work properly.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the below mentioned link for updating the drivers -<br />

Are you trying to tell me that there are no Restore Points on your machine? If so then a manual Registry Restore might help. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.
 Note that it may reset your password to an earlier value.<br />
1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu that looks like this one:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode<br />
3. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
4. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
5. Select the Command Prompt from the menu that looks like this one:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7<br />
6. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win*<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
7. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32\config<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xcopy *.* Q:\MyRegBack\<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd&nbsp; RegBack<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir<br />
8. Examine the dates of the Software, System and SAM files. Were the files created before or after your problem became apparent?<br />
9. If they were made before the problem became apparent then you can type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y software&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y System&nbsp; ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy /y Sam ..<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (the two dots are part of each command)<br />
10. Reboot normally. If things do not work out then you can backtrack by copying the original registry files from Q:\MyRegBack to Q:\Windows\System32\config.<br />

<h2>            I have a Windows 10 Home product key but I&#39;m running Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    So for a while, I have been running an unactivated version of Windows 10 pro. I decided to buy a product key for Windows 10 home off of Amazon. When I try to enter the key it says this is not the right key. Obviously, the problem is that I need to have
 Windows 10 Home installed not Pro but this is where I ran into the real problem. There is no way to download Windows 10 Home if you already have Windows 10 Pro. I watched tutorials on how to edit the registry so the media creation tool will think you are running
 home and install home instead if pro. I have tried this multiple times now and every time&nbsp;the settings that I changed get reverted and it downloads pro. I feel like I have hit a dead end and I'm baffled that there is no way to downgrade even from a non-activated
 version of Windows. Where am I to go from here? Any ideas are much appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Unfortunately, you can't activate or convert to Windows 10 Home using the product key. You will need to download Windows 10 Home then perform a custom install.
<br />
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<p>I know about the chat, but my Son thought that maybe if he bought a web cam, he would also be able to see his friend.</p>
<p>I don't think it works like that does it?</p>
<p>I don't know much about games, as I don't go on them myself. I think, like you said, there would be an option on the game site to video.</p>

<h2>            Cannot remove failed mirror. Gets &#34;The last healthy plex cannot be removed.&#34; Stumped&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have two 3TB WD Caviar Green disks set up in mirror. One has failed with the volume status = "Failed Redundancy (At Risk)" and the failed disk (Disk 0) says "Errors". The working disk (Disk 2) is online. My boot disk (Volume 2, Disk 1) is not involved
 or affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to remove or break the failed disk, getting the error message "The last healthy plex cannot be removed." At first I tried to use the GUI but it is ambiguous which disk to select (frustration!) so I used the command line and executed the following:</p>
<p>&gt;diskpart<br />
&gt;list volume<br />
(I determine the affected volume is 0)<br />
&gt;select volume 0<br />
&gt;detail volume<br />
(I determine the failed disk is 0)<br />
&gt;break disk 0 nokeep</p>
<p>(Then I get the following error message:)</p>
<p>The last healthy plex cannot be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am stuck and don't know how to proceed without actually just physically removing the failed disk. Any tips?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there -&nbsp;I did physically remove the failed disk and restored it as a simple disk, and it worked great with no error messages. At this point I am thinking there is no serious problem with the disk since it works perfectly as a simple disk.
 But as soon as I added it back to the mirror it fell into the failed status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that WD Red is recommended for NFS and RAID. Is using Green for my mirror the problem? Still, I can understand it may cause the failure but not why Windows would refuse to break/remove the failed mirror. What should I do?</p>

<p>Hey there Adi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear you are running into this problem. How long ago did you purchase this console? Do you have any trouble when you are playing with the controller not binding or disconnecting Mid game, or does it just not power up the console?
</p>
<p>Of course you can always try to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Physically Power Cycle</a> the console to see if this helps. If the issue persists you can also try to perform a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Factory Reset and keep all games and apps</a>. Make sure to have your account credentials ready to go as you will have to Add your account back to the Console.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a try and let us know if anything changes. </p>

<p>If your controller isn't paired, that's the problem. If it is, unfortunately that's one of those little things you have to deal with every now and then with this system. Holding the power button on the console down to turn it off will probably fix it...
 for a while. But this annoying little problem comes back occasionally with my xbone. Problems like these are why I consider this to be the worst console I have ever had, and I have pretty much had them all (47 years old, gaming since the start of home consoles).
 I'm not trying to bash the system, but these types of problems I simply DO NOT have with other systems that shall not be mentioned. The games work fine for the most part though, and exclusives like the Forza series make all of these little annoyances worth
 it. I mean... what can you do? Not play Forza or Halo? LOL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tl;dr: Just power off by pressing the button on the console for 10 seconds, or re-pair your controller and it should work again, but chances are you will have to deal with the issue again sometime in the future.</p>

            Hi COMPTONNJ
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1903 is being rolled out to users in a controlled manner to users worldwide unlike previous feature updates. If you want it immediately -
<br />
<br />A. Optional but recommended step - Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Disable any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can enable it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Press update now
<br />OR
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.
        </p>

            Hi COMPTONNJ 
<br />
<br />Rest assured, you have absolutely nothing to do, and there is nothing wrong with your PC . .. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft are releasing version 1903 in stages, initially, users must click Update Now to get that update, now it is being released to certain PC hardware architectures and then to all PC's . . .
<br />
<br />This is being dome to make sure the update is compatible with all systems and not causing the uses PC's to crash. This is actually a safer way to release these major updates to minimize any update related bugs for users
<br />
<br />So, all you need to do is wait a little while until your hardware is included in this release . . .

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, This is because some hardware isn't supported and some devices don't have the drivers necessary to update to Windows 10 version 1903.  Microsoft will be testing their update and making the updates available to more and more hardware so you'll be notified as soon as microsoft are ready to push out the update.  One thing at this time is to ensure you currently have the latest driver updates...check windows updates to see if it detects hardware updates, check in device manager and go on the manufacturers website

            It may mean there’s a hardware, driver or software incompatibility on your system or that you have an external hard drive or SD card connected to the PC.
<br />There’s a bug which prevents systems with external drives connected from updating, if this might be the problem in your case, try disconnecting them &amp; running the update again.

I don't no if everyone is having the same compatibly problem but mine is related to the fact that they broke the sound Speakers output from Creative SB X-Fi drivers worked under 1809 but its missing under 1903 which I have reported online about already. that's
 what keeping me from using 1903 since the 5.1 connection to my speakers goes missing and it doesn't detect the speaker out only shows both HDMI Out and SPDIF Out under Build 1903, anyway that's the only problem I am having under gigabyte model G1Assassin-2-rev-10
 motherboard, that has the sound chip or card built into the motherboard system, again I have sound in 1809 build but it drivers seem to end up broken under 1903 Build. I hope getting the word out about this error helps get it fixed faster so I can use the
 newer builds that the only thing I noticed wrong when upgraded to 1903 , since no sound I downgraded it to 1809 in time, anyway it doesn't effect my blutooth Headphones those still work without my built in sound card</p>
I think that's why the windows update is not upgrading my desktop to Build 1903 since they broke the hardware drivers for&nbsp; Gigabyte brand , Socket 2011, Intel X79 , G1Assassin-2-rev-10 motherboard that works fine in 1809 build, but when upgraded to 1903 it
 removes the speaker settings and only shows&nbsp;<span>both HDMI Out and SPDIF Out under Build 1903 from the Windows 10 downloaded drivers under build 1903 which worked correctly it seems under 1809 build for me, that's why I am not having it upgraded
 yet to 1903 that's the only problem for my desktop that's keeping me on 1809 build, no problem using Bluetooth speaker or Bluetooth headphones under 1903 , it just keeps me from using my 5.1 sound system that connected to my motherboards built in sound card,
 anyway I hope that can be fixed without the next few months if I am lucky anyway.</span>

<h2>            Stuck at the &#39;Choose Your Keyboard Layout&#34; Screen</h2>
                    <p>I just updated Windows 8 and it completed successfully. However, when I went to IE I noticed the screen was flickering and I saw a popup that said Installing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After seeing nothing was happening besides the filckering, I tried to restart the computer to see if that helps. When the PC went to reboot, a blue screen with white lines popped up and the PC reboot again by itself. It then went into Automatic Repair and
 brought me to the Choose Your Keyboard Layout screen. I can not do anything at this screen. I tried hitting every key on my keyboard when I noticed the cursor buttons didn't work with no results. I know it's not my keyboard since I can hit the F2 and F12 buttons
 on the load screen. Anyone know what I can do to at least restore my PC before the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joe</p>

            Unfortunately, I had to order a DVD and had to reinstall Windows 8, which also formatted the drive. But it did seem to create a backup of the hard drive, so everything wasn't lost. It was just a pain reinstalling everything I used and moving my pics, videos,
 and music from the backup.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go through the process and then Automatic Repair starts from there I get stuck on choose your keyboard layout - much like the original post I am unable to use any eternal devices keyboard mouse they all freeze and or are not recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I did but still no solution</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran recovery disk </p>
<p>System restore - get error that antivirus maybe causing problems I believe the actual error code is 0x80070005</p>
<p>Refresh - disk is locked</p>
<p>Resent - unable to</p>
<p>Went to bios to make sure everything was booting correctly even reset them.</p>
<p>I read a million websites that basically give the same info of recovery steps none of which have worked for me.</p>
<p>/FixMbr</p>
<p>/FixBoot</p>
<p>/RebuildBcd</p>
<p>
</p><p>CMD: chkdsk c: /f /r/ /x (finalizing this now so we will see if anything works)</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall windows 8 by keeping the files but (upgrade) and it says something like restart with media - so I am unable to do this
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately I have two hard drives and installed win 8 on my second hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I start up from the new win 8 I can see the HDD of my original disk.&nbsp; So I am wondering if there are some steps I can take from this point.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes, You're right: it's so frustrating. I go through all steps (even those bcdedit and so on), and regardless what I tried: I stuck finally at the "select keyboard layout"-page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there really nobody out You can lead us to NOT re-install Windows 8.1 from the scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to refresh things I got the note that my drive is locked down. Setting drives to active with diskpart doesn't work to me either. So: what is going on here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>This is what my situation was for me. Hopefully this helps someone with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this screen popped up when I took out some old RAM sticks and put some new ones in. Immediately my motherboard reported an error with the RAM or just that a change was detected. I left the settings to automatic and continued on to land on the keyboard
 selection screen that would reboot if I chose to continue to windows 10. (Now that 10 is out I upgraded from 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened a few times. I went back to the BIOS and reset it, similar result with sometimes another option to repair the PC or continue to windows. I tweaked a few settings, which were similar to how I had it before anyway. For some reason there was a
 new option to repair the disk but I chose to restart. And then randomly after trying many different things, the windows loading screen offered to check the disk and "repair" it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let this go repair the disk for whatever reason, and then it gave me the option to boot "Windows 8.1". I chose that, I guess, and it booted into my Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>o_o What was going on? I have no clue why it randomly checked the disk and repaired it after restarting it and tweaking the normal settings around. Maybe trying to repair the startup process (one of the advanced options or whichever) will do the same thing
 and repair it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird stuff. I'd say to try tweaking settings around first, if you know what you are doing, and it might 'magically' come back to life. The keyboard layout selection had nothing to do with my keyboard... or anything for that matter.</p>

<h2>            Pinnacle 14 Ultimate &#40;w&#47;AV DV2 board &#38; 64 bit driver&#41; with Windows 7 results in BSOD</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently loaded P14 Ultimate onto my Win7 computer using the AV DV2 board and its 64-bit driver.&nbsp; Talk about flakey!&nbsp; Pinnacle loads fine.&nbsp; The first time I begin to capture video from the board (from a cold boot), things seem fine.&nbsp; I'll stop capturing,
 transition to the edit function, then re-initiate the capture...this is when things get exciting.&nbsp; One of three things happen.&nbsp; (1) within seconds, a BSOD appears, (2) video capture is spotty and there's a loud audio beat on both tracks that I'm unable to
 track to other installed equipment, or (3) video/audio capture fails entirely without a BSOD.&nbsp; Upon reboot, the AV DV2 card is recognized by Pinnacle, but doesn't work at all.&nbsp; A repair of the driver results in the processing looping back to the start of my
 description.&nbsp; I've repeated this several times.&nbsp; My calls to Pinnacle have been less than productive.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Mike</p>

    <title>Suggestions repair corrupt system files Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giraffe 2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suggestions repair corrupt system files Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for advice on the best way I might be able to repair corrupt and possibly install missing system files to my W10 installation. I have a USB copy of W10 Microsoft Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues are with a 32GB Hp netbook which I have upgraded from W8.1 to W10. All went well with the upgrade albeit challenging due to space issues and the OS is working well but I have two current problems. 1 a recent Hp recommended driver update failed,
 2 system restore does not retain restore points. There is 11GB free space on the C disk and a 2GB ram which is 75% used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result of the issues I carried out an sfc scan and this revealed some corrupt files but I have not been able to find the report. I then as seemed recommend in such cases carried out a Dism scan and this revealed a file could not be found. In this case
 I have produced a report but unfortunately I do not understand the detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken to Hp support who looked at the dism report and concluded this netbook did not have enough memory to install the failed driver update or repair defective system files and recommended I reinstall W8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am currently thinking is there a way to sort out these problems and retain W10 as apart from the two issues W10 works satisfactorily and ideally I would like to retain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further advice will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>G</p>

            <p>Hello Aswin</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply although I do not think you have read my post fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a start up problem. I have a corrupt/missing system file problem and what I am now realising is a questionable sized computer for the windows 10 installation. I feel I have been pushed like everyone else into this installation by Microsoft
 and a&nbsp;lack of clear advise from Hp on the suitability of this computer for this upgrade. I am now at a stage where Hp now appear to wash their hands of this computer and its problems now&nbsp;Windows 10 is installed. I now feel alone in dealing with the problems
 and will remember this for here on. I have only had this computer for 8 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I now think I should&nbsp;do is reset the netbook windows 10 installation&nbsp;from a usb media creation tool I made earlier and know it works having already used it successfully on a fully sized Toshiba laptop. From there on I will recheck the system files using
 sfc scan and if all is well then I will be happy but if not I will have to have a look at reinstalling windows 8.1 from a usb image copy I made when I first bought the netbook. I hope this W10 installation has not prevented a return to W8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent this through for information and will be pleased to here from you if you have any further comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>G&nbsp;</p>

            I too have exactly the same problem as you do, where I have already installed windows 10 and right after the installation, I have opened a command prompt and typed sfc /scannow and hit Enter. then it proceeded to perform the scan and attempt to repair
 any errors found. However, after the scan, I was issued a message stating that some corrupt files were found but the scan failed to repair them. WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

            <p>Hi Chris</p>
<p>The reinstall worked on my computer . Corrupt files gone. All has been working well up until yesterday when the latest cumulative update would not download and install. I think I will have to reinstall W10 again. It suggests once again my small 32GB netbook
 is not really suitable for the W10'upgrade as Hp support had previously stated. Any way I will carry on with the reinstall process. I hope this helps.</p>

            I have been having the same issue and results are noted below if it helps you:&nbsp; (As per Microsoft) the SFC was able to cleanup some files, but not all. The list&nbsp;prompt mentioned that the corrupted files&nbsp;were&nbsp;'unable to fix them'.&nbsp; Microfoft then suggested
 to run a DISM program.&nbsp; The result was that the 'DISM.exe/online/cleanup-image/scannow' was unable to execute due to an #87 error - "the cleanup-image/scanhealth option is unknown."&nbsp; So, I executed the DSM.exe/? and&nbsp;DISM.exe/Online/?.&nbsp; In neither did I find
 a "scanhealth" option in the "Online" executed folder.&nbsp; This is the 'Error: #87' as it was listed in the scrolled error in the cp.&nbsp; Microsoft, in turn, wrote the following, "I would like to inform that i<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f you are not able to repair
 some files after performing SFC scan, I suggest you to refer to the point 3 “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log
<var><span>%WinDir%</span></var>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log”. Under the section “Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)” to repair the corrupted files after performing SFC scan."&nbsp; I did this and the results were unsuccessful.&nbsp; I have now scanned and listed a number
 of corrupted files, many if not all &nbsp;seemingly unrepairable.&nbsp; I am awaiting further direction because the typical data entry from the log is unclear as to the result.&nbsp;

<h2>            Is there any specific Windows 10 Pro 32 &#38; 64 bit .iso file for clean install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On the following link it is possible to download windows 10 .iso file for clean install by means of the media creation tool:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>media creation tool-perform a clean installation using a USB or DVD</strong>" describes how to make a clean install from DVD, but there is no information about how to install the windows 10 pro version and not clear if the .iso
 file contains even the pro version or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following scenario is usual for company customers:</p>
<p>1. Business computers with windows 7 pro will be upgraded to windows 10 pro and activated.</p>
<p>2. The IT technician want to reinstall the computers from an .iso DVD to get a new clean install.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft:</p>
<p>"<strong>If you’ve already successful activated Windows 10 on this PC, including if you upgraded by taking advantage of the free upgrade offer you won't need to enter a Windows 10 product key. You can skip the product key page by selecting
 the Skip button. Your PC will automatically activate later.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The clean installation from the windows 10 .iso DVD never ask if you want to install windows 10 home or pro version. If you skip the product key page, the home version will be installed. (tested only on computer which was upgraded from windows 7
 home to windows 10 home before) The windows 10 home will be activated automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How to make a clean install of the windows 10 pro version on already upgraded and activated computers without to enter any windows 7 pro product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What .iso file to use and where to download?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can not find any distinct and official information about windows 10 pro clean install on Microsoft sites.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, have you tried redownloading your profile? May look like you have to delete your game save and retry that part again. What you can do if you do this on Xbox 360 is to save that backup data for Gears 2 and try starting a new game with a cleared save
 and see if you can retry it and unlock it.

<p><br />
You can always re-install drivers even if they are native in Windows. Go to Control Panel and open Device Manager. Look down the list for all references to your&nbsp;webcam (video, microphone, etc). They may show up with a yellow ! mark indicating there is a problem
 with the driver&nbsp;or they might not. If none show up at all try enabling "Show Hidden Devices" from the View menu. For each webcam entry that you find, right click on it, select Properties then Driver. Click on the button that says "Roll back driver". The previously
 working driver should then re-install.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the Roll Back driver option is disabled that means there was no new driver installed. You can still reinstall the driver however. Right click on each webcam entry and select Uninstall driver. When that is done unplug your webcam. Reboot is optional, otherwise
 plug your webcam back in again (into a port on the computer NOT into&nbsp;a hub)&nbsp;and Windows should re-detect it and install the drivers again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In case it<em> was</em> a driver update that caused your problem, when you have&nbsp;rolled back&nbsp;each of the webcam drivers and tested that&nbsp;the camera&nbsp;works again, go into Windows Update and search for updates. The problem driver should show up again. From the
 view updates screen (the one with the details about the updates) right click on the webcam driver update and select "Hide update". After that it shouldn't bother you again.</p>

<h2>            What&#38;&#35;39&#59;s your fave &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; rifle&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In Battlefield.<br />
<br />
Kind of bored at the moment and just made my triumphant return to BF3.&nbsp; I used the M416 which I hadn't used since...I dunno.&nbsp; After I service starred is I guess.&nbsp; Seems to be a solid rifle.<br />
<br />
All time favourite is the G3A3 though.&nbsp; I went though hell with that thing.&nbsp; It was nerfed after B2K hit and was
<em>absolutely</em> horrible but I stubbornly used it.&nbsp; Then it got buffed again and it was all good.</p>

<p>Not sure that I have a favorite. I use all of them except the burst fire AR's. I guess maybe the M416 but that has more to do with the fact I liked it so much in BF:BC2. I like the AUG and the L85 too. I can't say that I really like the G3 much. It's ok.
 I have as many kills with it as I do most any other AR.</p>

    <title>Issue with BitLocker encrypted ReFS storage space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephtr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with BitLocker encrypted ReFS storage space</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
For more than one year I am using the storage spaces feature for a ReFS storage space consisting of two (mirrored) external hard drives.<br />
In May I tried out BitLocker using a password but disabled it the same day. The following days and reboots there were no signs that the storage space would still be encrypted. However after clean installing Windows 10 Windows asks me for the 48 digit recovery
 key. I still have the original password but instead Windows asks me for the recovery key, which I didn't kept (since I disabled BitLocker).<br />
By searching the internet I learned that there had been some reliability issues with storage spaces and BitLocker (additionally I had the Windows Insider Preview builds running), but is there any hope to find a possibility for gaining access?</p>
<p>I'm not even sure if the drive actually is encrypted (or if it is only partially encrypted).</p>

<p>Because it is an external drive there was no option to upload the key to my Microsoft Account. I have saved and printed the key, but removed both once I decrypted the drive.<br />
In the meantime I have tried running photorec (from testdisk) and it seems like it finds some files which should have been encrypted by BitLocker.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps adding AZERTY keyboard even if I periodically remove it...</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I want to complain that Windows 10 is the most invasive, obstructive and opaque OS from Microsoft ever. Moreover, my Microsoft account is made with an old email I used for games when I was 13 and I don't want to create a newer outlook email,
 nor do I want my computer to be linked to the Cloud constantly, but since I have to use Visual Studio for school, there's no escaping it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that's out of the way, here comes my situation/question: I am a bilingual Canadian person who needs to use both the US Keyboard and Canadian Multilingual Keyboard setups on a daily basis. For some reason, Windows 10 thinks that because I use a Keyboard
 with french characters, I require the AZERTY setup installed and ready to use (AZERTY is an atrocity that should not exist). I have never used AZERTY. I do not want to use it. And I will hate it forever. FYI: AZERTY is a French Keyboard used in FRANCE, but
 I am not in FRANCE, you might have guessed. Windows 10 knows for sure. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, enough about how bad AZERTY is. The problem is the following: even though I remove AZERTY at least once a week from my system, Windows 10 adds it back a couple days later. I have reached my wit's end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever I Alt+Shift, I'm afraid I'll type a's instead of q's and vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously this is stupid,</p>
<p>A deeply frustrated Windows 10 user.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p />
