<h2>            Switched from Domain to Workgroup and can no longer login.</h2>
                    OS: Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit<br />
<br />
The situation:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Was on a Domain with a previous employer.</li><li>Switched user account from Domain to Workgroup, restarted computer (thinking the login would stay the same).<br />
</li><li>A local user account (my first and last name) is the only user account I have access to and none of my passwords work. The domain user name was: "domain/my-first-and-last-name".<br />
</li><li>I've loaded in my OS Installation Disk, went to "Repair your computer", selected the command prompt, and entered "net user administrator /active:yes". It states the action had been successfully completed but no changes occur at the login screen, which makes
 me think the account with my first and last name is the only account on it and is also the only administrator.<br />
</li><li>I've also selected "Repair your computer" from the F8 start-up menu and when it asks me to login, the two user accounts are ASPNET and my first name (a different user name than what the Domain login user name was and what my single option currently is at
 the main login screen, which confuses me).</li></ul>
<br />
The IT department at my previous employer is slow to get back to me... I understand I may have to do a clean install but would really like to recover the documents and pictures on the computer.<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Is there anyway to get around doing a clean install or should I play the guessing game more with passwords?</li><li>Would an IT person be able to enter the Registry or something to change the password or add an (or another...) administrator account?</li><li>Also, would I be able to take out the hard drive of the laptop and connect it to another computer?</li></ol>

            Every Windows installation has an admin account. It cannot be deleted. However,<br />
- It can be renamed<br />
- It can be disabled<br />
<br />
Since appear to have a high tolerance for pain, here you go. You can reset any password by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in
 this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tap the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "Jack" 123456 /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To create the new account Jack with a password of 123456)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net localgroup administrators "Jack"&nbsp; /add<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To promote Jack to admin level)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.<br />
<br />
When finished, never ever allow a Windows machine to have just one local admin account. It's asking for trouble.<br />

            <p><span>Apologies in delay in the response. After checking your computer manufacturer website, I found that original drivers are not available for Windows 8 OS. This issue can be caused due
 to compatibility issue between audio drivers and Windows 8. To fix this issue, I would suggest you to download Audio Driver from this link:
<a href="http://www.sony.co.in/support/product/vpceh3aen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sony.co.in/support/product/vpceh3aen</a> and save it on the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Install the driver in Windows 7 compatibility mode, see:

<h2>            Where do I find comprehensive information &#40;beyond the usual basics given&#41; on speech recognition commands&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am a disabled professional with limited (and steadily decreasing) use of my hands,&nbsp;but I am determined to remain employed at&nbsp;my job, which requires extensive writing and editing, so I am seeking out all possible technological advances that will help me
 do that.&nbsp; I want to use speech recognition to write and edit documents and make marginal comments.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time in the Review menu.&nbsp; I have mastered the basic commands that are usually listed on Help screens, but I need more.&nbsp; I especially need to
 be able to make marginal comments efficiently and accurately, but so far I have found that the performance of the speech recognition is inconsistent.&nbsp; I'm fine when I am working in the Word document, but when I make new comments in the margins, the commands
 don't always work there.&nbsp; For example, if I make a typo in the marginal comment, I often cannot correct.&nbsp; The word "correct" comes up in my message.&nbsp; I also cannot figure out how to move easily between my marginal comments and the document itself.&nbsp; A comprehensive,
 specific list of commands would be most helpful.&nbsp; Any keystroke saved leaves me energy for thinking instead of struggling with hardware and software, so saving keystrokes is my goal.&nbsp; Anything that would help with that will make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I haven't found the complete solution yet, your helpful suggestions at least put me on&nbsp;some paths toward solving the problem.&nbsp; I did try the work around, and it did work.&nbsp; However, the process was cumbersome.&nbsp; Because I might make as many as 40
 or 50 marginal comments in an average document, some of&nbsp;which can be lengthy, going through the extra steps the work around requires would add too much time to the editing process and I'd never meet my deadlines.&nbsp; It would work for documents needing only a
 few short&nbsp;comments, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing me with a new search term: WSR.&nbsp; That may lead me to some information.&nbsp; I am definitely considering the WSRToolkit and did visit your company's site.&nbsp; I'll research it a bit more and maybe order it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While on that site, &nbsp;I also accidentally stumbled on a headset there that might help me with accuracy (though my accuracy is&nbsp;fairly good&nbsp;because&nbsp;I speak a lot professionally so have learned to be conscious of volume, phrasing, and enunciation). &nbsp;My favorite
 work area for the winter months&nbsp;is near a heat vent, and I'd noticed that my speech recognition accuracy seemed to decrease mysteriously when the furnace fan came on, and got better when it went off, but I thought I was imagining things.&nbsp; Reading reviews for
 microphones told me that the fan could very well be a factor, and the right microphone (which unfortunately will probably be a high-priced one) could make a big difference.&nbsp; I'll look into that,&nbsp;too,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your reply also presented me with a challenge:&nbsp; Why NOT try to learn programming, so I can learn to make programs fit my needs?&nbsp; I've been able to teach myself other difficult skills; why not programming?&nbsp;Any recommendations on tutorials or other materials?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, although my original problem is not yet totally solved, thank you for opening up some possibilities.</p>

            Using Speech Recognition
<div>
<p><span>Windows</span> Speech Recognition makes using a keyboard and mouse optional. You can control your PC with your voice and dictate text instead.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fResources%2f3.6%2fHelpHub%2fshared%2fimages%2falertset_warning.png" /></div>
<div>Note
<p>Speech Recognition isn't available in all languages.</p>

 up Speech Recognition</a></span></span>
<div>
<p>There are a few steps you need to take before you can start using Speech Recognition. First, you’ll need to set up a microphone. Next, it’s a good idea to take the tutorial to learn how to use Speech Recognition effectively. Finally, you can train your PC
 to recognize your voice.</p>
<div>To set up a microphone
<div>
<div>
<p>Before you set up Speech Recognition, make sure you've plugged the microphone into your PC so the following steps work.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>set up a microphone</span> in the search box, tap or click <span>Settings</span>, and then tap or click
<span>Set up a microphone</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fResources%2f3.6%2fHelpHub%2fshared%2fimages%2falertset_warning.png" /></div>
<div>Note
<p>If possible, use a headset microphone; it's less likely to pick up background noise.</p>
<div>To take the tutorial
<div>
<div>
<p>The tutorial that comes with Speech Recognition takes about 30 minutes to complete, and it’s a good use of time. It teaches you the voice commands used in Speech Recognition.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>speech recognition</span> in the search box, tap or click <span>Settings</span>, and then tap or click
<span>Speech Recognition</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Take Speech Tutorial</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the Speech Recognition Tutorial.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>To train your PC to recognize your speech
<div>
<div>
<p>Speech Recognition uses a special voice profile to recognize your voice and spoken commands. The more you use Speech Recognition, the more detailed your voice profile becomes—and that should improve your PC's ability to understand you.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>speech recognition</span> in the search box, tap or click <span>Settings</span>, and then tap or click
<span>Speech Recognition</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Train your computer to better understand you</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions in the Speech Recognition Voice Training.</p>

<div>Notes
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can also use the ICAO\NATO phonetic alphabet to say the keyboard keys to press. For example, you can say "press alpha" to press "a" or "press bravo" to press "b."</p>
</li><li>
<p>Using Speech Recognition to press keyboard keys works only with languages that use Latin alphabets.</p>

<p>You make a good case for the noise cancelling microphone, and I'm seriously considering&nbsp;that now.&nbsp; What do I need to know about compatibility with Windows 8 for microphones&nbsp;like that? What about compatibility with RT? I haven't found definitive information
 on the Microsoft Compatibility site and would like to be sure before making the investment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also considering the WSRToolkit and maybe the WSRMacros User's Guide. I am reasonably certain that those won't work in RT, but will they work with Windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Screen tearing</h2>
                    After installing a recent windows 10 update i have experienced screen tearing issues when playing certain games on steam. It has never happened up until i installed this update.

            Hi Henry, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver       
        </p>

            Although I have not heard specifically of screen tearing specifically being a symptom, many other people have reported other video problems with a recent window update:
<br />
<br />UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER 
<br />This is a recent, VERY common problem being asked on the site. The current unverified best guess is to try resetting the Video driver: either roll it back, or uninstall it and let win re-install, or windows upgrade it or manually download upgrade from video system builder site
<br />
<br />- In start menu search for Control Panel’ (icon view) 
<br />- Right click on Device Manager 
<br />- Select Run as Admin 
<br />- Expand Display Adapters
<br />- double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall to display the Driver Properties dialog
<br />- You have buttons for 3 options: 
<br />- if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the “Roll Back Driver button” 
<br />- or you can try the Uninstall button 
<br />- or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update “manually” is better) 
<br />- restart Windows 
<br />
<br />
<br />If it is not an Intel(R) HD Graphics driver, make note of the name (in case the fix above did not work). Go to the web site for the video card maker and see if they have a newer driver for the specific video card.  Also ask the same question there to see if they can come up with a better answer.

    <title>Windows 10 randomly wakes from sleep when on battery with the lid - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim hunt - cto at red oxygen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 randomly wakes from sleep when on battery with the lid shut.</h2>
                    <p>I have a ASUS ROG laptop with Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the sensible thing and disabled windows update, so that is not the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The event log says the reason for the transition is a "Power Button" event.</p>
<p>But as the power button is situated above the keyboard, and with the lid lid shut, it is physically impossible to press it. (especially when the computer is sitting on my desk and there are no people or animals in the room)</p>
<p>This leaves just two possibilities:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;The hardware has a fault, and is randomly sending power button events to the OS (Unlikely because we only ever see these events when the computer is sleeping, not when it is off, nor when it is awake)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;The Operating system is reporting a power button event when it is actually something else that triggered the wake-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We could spend a lifetime debating the cause of these wake events, but that is not the real issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The problem is that the Operating system will allow itself to wake up when the computer is "On Battery" with the "Lid Shut"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On several occasions my laptop has gotten so hot that I cannot hold it when i have pulled it out of my backpack.</p>
<p>On other occasions the OS has drained the battery to critical level, meaning that I cannot use the machine until I get to one of my chargers. Considering the fact that I purchased a laptop because I need to perform on call support, this is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround I usually shutdown every time, but unfortunately that is not always possible, nor should it be.</p>
<p>The reason Microsoft offer a sleep function is because of laptops, so to suddenly not be able to use that function, due to fear of damage to the hardware, is not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So finally my question... </p>
<p>Does anyone know how to report this bug to Microsoft?</p>
<p>We see so many issues all related to this where laptops are waking up while on battery, but no-one seems to be addressing the root problem, which is
<strong>"Windows CAN wake up from sleep while on battery with the lid closed".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently I cannot report this bug to Microsoft, because I don't have the customer relationship with Microsoft, ASUS does.</p>
<p>ASUS support is no help, because they see every problem as a hardware problem and try and fix it accordingly. (Reset the computer back to factory defaults, then Swap out the power button and system board.) And when neither of these actions helped, repeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling Microsoft using the "This is a problem with Automatic Updates" angle, but of course they just told me how to disable&nbsp;Automatic Updates, and when I tried to explain that this did not help, ran into a blank wall.
</p>
<p>It seems the Asia Pacific support team is unable to report bugs to the Microsoft&nbsp;development team.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you have upgraded to Windows 7 you now have to install the Drivers, etc&nbsp;for Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to your Computer or Video Card&nbsp;Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers download Section &gt; then Key in your Computer or Video Card&nbsp;Model number &gt; look for your Windows 7&nbsp;Operating System &gt; find either Graphics / Video or Chipset Drivers and download and install
 them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then try&nbsp;to do the Screen Resolution change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Depending on what type of graphics solution you have installed in your computer, you are able to adjust the look of your display settings or what is called your screen resolution. You can adjust it so you can have more space on your screen for multiple windows,
 or to make things bigger on screen for you to see. Changing your screen resolution in Windows is a very simple task.</p>

<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f04%2fimage_thumb7.png" /></a></p>
<p>This will open the Screen Resolution item. Here you will see information about your Display, the current Resolution along with the orientation (normally
<em>Landscape).</em></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image8.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f04%2fimage_thumb8.png" /></a></p>
<p>If you would like to change the screen resolution, simply click in the resolutions available, as you can see, mine is set to 1680 x 1050 (recommended) highest, while lowest supported is 800 x 600. The higher, the better quality, most displays or graphics
 card only support a certain resolution, so yours might only stop at 1280 x 800 for instance. If you want to lower the resolution, simply drag the knob anywhere along the vertical line and Windows will adjust the display to support.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/image9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f04%2fimage_thumb9.png" /></a></p>
<p>If you are satisfied with the results, click Apply and OK to confirm changes.</p>
<p>If you are sure your graphics card can power a much higher resolution and you are not seeing it as an available option, you may need to install updated drivers for the graphics card.</p>
<p>Also, some computers use something called shared graphics, which means the graphics in your system uses some of the main memory to help render the interface. So, if you have 2 GBs of RAM in your computer, some of it might allocated to graphics. Sometimes
 the manufacturer of your computer might be conservative and allocate just the bare minimum. If you would like to adjust this, consult the documentation that came with your computer, this often requires going into the BIOS settings for your computer.</p>
<p>If your computer has what is called a discrete graphics card or what is known as a dedicated video card from a known vendor such as AMD or Nvidia then you probably need to download the latest driver which can enable additional capabilities.</p>

<h3> dotmik-cay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update error &#34;Windows can&#39;t update important files and services while the system is using them...restart the computer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{32be5ed2-5c86-480f-a914-0ff8885a1b3f}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;For some time now I have been unable to update Windows Vista 64 Home Premium (PC shows the message: "Windows can't update important files and services while the system is using them...restart the computer").&nbsp; I am also finding that the system files checker
 (scannow) does not work (the window shows an error message reading: "There is a system repair pending which requires a reboot to complete."). &nbsp; No matter how many times I restart the PC, the results and messages for both issues remain unchanged.&nbsp; When I am
 successful downloading an update, I often find it will not install and receive error code 80070BC9. &nbsp; My HP IQ506 is set to download updates automatically, but never does.<br />
<br />
I have used McAfee Security Suite Elite (AT&amp;T U-verse provision) on this PC for over 2 years.&nbsp; McAfee online technical support removed their product (including all registry entries) from my PC to determine if they were causing a 3rd party conflict.&nbsp; They also
 did an in-depth review of my PC for infections using tools available to their Tech Support personnel.&nbsp; No problems were found.&nbsp; Based on Community recommendations, I have scanned for malware (Malwarebytes, Super Antispyware,etc) with no success.&nbsp; I have used
 numerous MSFT tools and manually downloaded hotpatches (MSFT Fix It Center, Defender, Systems Update Readiness Tool - KB947821, etc.).&nbsp; Only AFTER these system problems started, I downloaded and used certain 3rd party utilities such as Tweaking.com, C Cleaner,
 Wise Reg Cleaner, etc.<br />
<br />
I have confirmed Windows&nbsp; and related "services" are running (also restarted these services) and were set to "automatic" on the MSFT Console.&nbsp; I am reasonably confident that there are no malicious "bugs" in the system.&nbsp; I don't know if it is a coincidence,
 but these problems started right after MSFT did a number of "automatic" downloads a while ago.&nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have noted that some of the registry repair utilities, including Tweaking.com, all get "hung up" (loop?) at the same spot in the registry.&nbsp; This registry location is shown in the Title above.&nbsp; Since I am not registry proficient, I do not know if the repetition
 of WOW 6432 over 10 times at one location in the registry is an issue or not.&nbsp; Nor am I sufficiently confident in my technical skills to attempt a registry repair without guidance.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Dottie <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>I can certainly understand the inconvenience which you are facing at the moment due to issues with Windows update. I appreciate the efforts which you have put to resolve the issue till now. We will work together
 and try to resolve the issue further. </font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>As per the error message “<strong>Windows can't update important files and services while the system is using them...restart the computer</strong>” or error code “<strong>80070BC9</strong>” during Windows update, it
 could be due to some other non-Microsoft application which is using the system files which are required while running Windows update.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>Let’s place the computer in clean boot state and check if you are able to install the update.<br />
<br />
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>You can follow the methods:</font></font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><strong>Method 1:</strong></font></span></p>
<p><font>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>You can refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot state:</font></p>
<p><font>“<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong>”</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Follow the section “<strong>Windows 7 and Windows Vista</strong>”</font></p>
<p><font>You can follow the section <strong>“How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</font></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a><span><font>
</font></span></p>
<p><font><font><strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>If the issue still persists, you can move ahead with method 2.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></p>
<p><font>I would suggest you to reset Windows update components and check if it helps.</font></p>
<p><font>You can refer to the link to reset the components:</font></p>
<p><font><font>“<strong>How do I reset Windows Update components?”</strong></font></font></p>
<p><font><font>Follow the section “<strong>Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7”</strong></font></font></p>

</font></p>
<p><font><font><strong>Note: </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the link:
</font></font></p>

</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><strong>Method 3:</strong></font></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to rename the software distribution folder and check if it helps you to install the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps:</p>
<p>a) Open an administrative <strong>Command Prompt</strong> window.</p>
<p>b) Run the following commands and press <strong>Enter</strong> after each command:</p>
<p><strong>Net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p><strong>cd %systemroot%</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ren SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></p>
<p><strong>Net start wuauserv</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>c) </strong>Try to install updates again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>As per the issue with the error message “<strong>There is a system repair pending which requires a reboot to complete</strong>” while running SFC scan is concerned, I would suggest you to start Windows using Last Known Good Configuration and check
 if you still face the issue. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>You can refer to the link to do so:</font></p>
<p><font>“<strong>Using Last Known Good Configuration</strong>”</font></p>
<p><font>Follow the section “<strong>How do I start the computer using Last Known Good Configuration?</strong> ”</font></p>

            Hi Pinaki, Thanks for your patience in guiding me through this MSFT issue.&nbsp; Since it is my understanding that I must access the Internet to test/obtain Windows updates, I belatedly realized the MS 921935 procedure may not work for me.&nbsp; On the SERVICES
 tab of the console, I was successful verifying&nbsp;that 3rd party vendors&nbsp;were not the cause of the&nbsp;update problem.&nbsp; Likewise, none of the programs on the STARTUP tab caused a&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;as I began the 3rd step of verifying&nbsp;MSFT programs on the SERVICES tab,
 I started&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;error code 8024001f (not connected to the Internet) when attempting to update.&nbsp; Using different&nbsp;combinations of boxes&nbsp;between the STARTUP tab and&nbsp;"Hide all Microsoft services" on the SERVICES tab gave me different results&nbsp;(error code 8024001f,
 a green bar that didn't stop moving in the update window, no response at all, etc.).&nbsp; Given the infinite number of combinations that exist for t

            HI Pinaki, I had already started your second recommendation (Method 2 - KB971058)) when I received your last note. All was going well until I got to step 6, reregister the BITS files/Windows updates. I received a message the first 2 files were "successful".
 However, when I entered the 3rd item (regsvr32.exe mshtml.dll), I received the following message: *The module "mshtml.dll was loaded but the entry point DIIRegisterServer was not found. Make sure that mshtml.dll is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again."
 Since I did not know what to do with this message, I stopped all work on my Vista 64 PC and went to another computer to send you this note.&nbsp; I am not sure how to fix this item, or whether to back up or go forward?&nbsp; And if so, how??&nbsp; Thanks again for all your
 help, Dottie&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; I also have now loaded and used the Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit.&nbsp; The scan showed no root related infections.&nbsp; It seems everything continues to point toward a corrupt registry that started when I received multiple MSFT downloads at one
 time a couple moths ago. <br />

            Hi Pinaki, I have now used the "Last Known&nbsp; Good System Configuration" and "System Restore" tools.&nbsp; Neither one fixed the Windows update or Scannow issue.&nbsp; Unfortunately, System Restore only went back about 10 days because of all the work being done on
 the computer.&nbsp; (I have 325GB of free space on Drive C.) The problem pre-dates the 10 days by many weeks.&nbsp; At this time, the remaining open item is the Windows Update Component Reset (KB971058) and the "entry point DIIRegister Service" issue I experienced in
 attempting&nbsp;&nbsp;to reregister the Bits files.&nbsp; I was unable to proceed beyond that point.

            <p>Hi Pinaki, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually HP had recommended I upgrade my Touchsmart IQ506 to Windows 7 from Vista 64 about 2 years ago.&nbsp; It was a disaster.&nbsp; HP support recommended and did the&nbsp;initial installation (under warranty), but they&nbsp;could not make Windows 7 work properly on this
 computer.&nbsp; HP escalated the matter and the&nbsp;Case Manager determined&nbsp;my PC should never have been upgraded to Windows 7 in the first place...contrary to HP's initial advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;(After extensive testing, the Case Manager found Windows 7 does not run properly on
 the HP IQ506.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we had to start from scratch and&nbsp;reload Windows Vista 64.&nbsp; My PC has run well for the past 2 years until the current series of MSFT updates I mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Again Pinaki, Returning to my attempt to follow your earlier recommendation that I "Reset the Windows Update Components (KB971058)", does MSFT advise Vista users what to do if the customer is unable to reregister the Bit Files and receives the message,
 "The module 'mshtml.dll' was loaded but the entry point DIIRegisterServer was not found. Make sure that mshtml.dll is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again."? Thanks for your continued assistance.&nbsp; Dottie

            <p>Hi Pinaki, Just wanted you to know that the Vista URL you provided actually connects to the MSFT Windows 7 upgrade installation.&nbsp; As I noted earlier, HP Technical Support and HP Case Manager were&nbsp;unable to install and run Windows 7 on my PC.&nbsp; Having had
 problems with Windows updates previously on this and other computers, I rather work to&nbsp;correct the problem as opposed to "kicking the can down the road".&nbsp; Further, it's rather frustrating that MSFT Technical Support said they could solve this issue or would
 sell me a Windows 7 upgrade. Not sure why I should be paying $100 for a problem that coincidentally started immediately after multiple&nbsp;MSFT downloads?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At any length, as I have done further work on this problem and&nbsp;discovered 2 things. 1) &nbsp;&nbsp;The Distributed Transaction Coordinator in MSFT Services will NOT start.&nbsp; I receive error code #1067 EVERY time I attempt a manual restart.&nbsp; 2) I discovered this DTC
 problem when attempting a DCOM verification on the dcomcnfg/component services/computers/my computer/default properties tab where "Default Authentication" and "Default Impersonation Level" have NO settings options listed.&nbsp; The drop down boxes are blank.&nbsp; (MSFT
 Community has indicated they should be set to "Connect" and "Identify" respectively.)&nbsp;&nbsp;On the same Default Properties Tab, the computer will NOT allow me to check "Enable Distributed Com on the Computer", also as recommended by the Community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also receive
 a message, "error code 8004E00f - Com was unable to talk to the MSFT Ditributed Transaction Coordinator".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried many things, but have been unsuccessful addressing these latter 2 items.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pinaki, it may be that the MSFT Community will want these last 2 items as part of a separate thread.&nbsp; However, it seems clear that all of these events&nbsp;somehow relate to the Windows update and MSFT registry scanner (scannow) issues on this PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you
 think I should&nbsp;start?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again, Dottie&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi <strong>xIainx</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can have five devices associated with Movies &amp; TV app. All of them can access the media you've purchased and saved in your account. You might want to check if you'll be able to remove the device from the other device by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Launch <strong>Movies &amp; TV</strong> app.</li><li>On the upper-right hand corner, select the <strong>three-horizontal dots</strong> and click
<strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>S</strong><strong>how my download devices</strong> (<em>A small frame will open with a list of the devices on which you signed in and downloaded content.</em>).</li><li>Click <strong>Remove this device</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: You can only remove one(1) every 30 days.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>

<p>Hi Justine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for helping me. I followed the steps that you outlined in your reply, but when I reached step 3 a small frame opened, however, I could not edit to remove the device. This was display only. The document appears to be saying you can only remove a
 device by logging in to that device.&nbsp; </p>

</p><p>For your info I am running Windows 10 Pro in S mode.&nbsp; version 1803 OS build 17134.254.</p>

            In regard to this reply to the question if you'd be so kind as to provide a quick follow up - I understand the steps that you listed, in that they show possible signs of system manipulation outside of the OS and local user. &nbsp;Any way to isolate the source?
 &nbsp;Perhaps identify the device and/or port number etc etc? &nbsp;As well as configure settings in Windows that prevents remote connections permanently? &nbsp;I'm more interested at this point in prevention and detection than I am cleaning up their mess. &nbsp;Thanks for responding
 if you do! &nbsp;

<p><span><span>You’ve replied to a two-year old post, but I'll reply to you. Here is a list I’ve compiled of some things that can be checked for 'hacking':</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. First of all check if any rogue programs or services are running. Open</span><span> a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type msconfig and press Enter. On the Startup Tab, uncheck any entries that are unknown to you. Repeat this for the Services
 Tab. If you uncheck anything restart the computer and </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">when it restarts, put a tick in ‘Don‘t show this again‘ as you‘re effectively doing a selective start up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. It’s probably not relevant these days but this only takes a few seconds to check. Open
</span><span>a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type cmd and press Enter. Now<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> type system.ini and press Enter. If under [drivers] there is an entry
</span></span><span>user=user.drv, you may have been hacked, so restart the computer and check again. An entry of timer=timer.drv is safe.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Now check the net statistics:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3A. Open </span><span>a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type cmd and press Enter. Now<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> type netstat -ano and press Enter. If ‘Established’ is in the State column, make a note of the PID and the Addresses alongside it,
 as someone may be hacking you</span>. If <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the IP Address begins with 192.168, you are safe as it’s part of your home network.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3B. To check if you are being hacked, open Task Manager by
</span><span>hitting Ctrl+Shift+Esc. Go to the Processes Tab &gt; View &gt; Select Columns and put a check in the PID box so that the column is displayed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3C. If the PID that you noted in 3A appears and it is not a name that you recognise, right-click it and End the process. You can click the word PID at the top to sequence the numbers to make it easier to find. Restart the computer and check again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3D. If you didn’t find the PID, restart the computer and rerun the netstat –ano command. Open Google in a browser window and type the IP Address into the search box. If it’s a suspicious site, restart the computer and check again</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Lastly, run your ‘anti’ programs to clear up any residual malware files that may be present, which you should be doing on a regular basis anyway.</span></span></p>

<p>Please Contact Sculptris Software technical support here <a href="https://support.pixologic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.pixologic.com/</a>&nbsp;and follow the instructions or click on contacts at the bottom for more information (though getting the correct phone number - it there's another one than the one I&nbsp;saw for the USA -&nbsp;will probably mean making sure you have

<h2>            Cannot select multiple folders using shift key</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: copy function</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Vista and could move a series of several folders&nbsp;from one location to another in one motion by highlighting the first folder, hold the Shift key down and then click on the last folder. All folders located between the first and last folder would then
 be highlighted in blue. I could then click on any one of the blue highlighted folders and drag the group to the new location. Apparently, this does not work on Windows 10! How do I do it in Windows 10????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I highlight a folder, press Copy, and place my cursor in the new location, what do I press to put the copy of the folder in the new location?</p>

    <title>Start Menu and Font Size in Windows 8.1 is Changing When Waking from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gosia5pl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu and Font Size in Windows 8.1 is Changing When Waking from Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>I have been working on Windows 8.1&nbsp;. When I put the laptop to sleep mode,&nbsp; when it wakes up, all the fonts in windows Start Menu becomes smaller. This font change would also be seen in Windows Log on menu. The Desktop icons&nbsp;and fonts&nbsp;remain unchanged.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is really very annoying. I can only&nbsp;solve the problem by a restart.&nbsp;All the font sizes will come back to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Also&nbsp;noticed that the Wi-Fi connection shows "limited" status and can&nbsp;only be fixed by&nbsp;disconnecting and reconnecting.
</p>
<p>All this problems started after&nbsp;running updates.<br />
&nbsp;I appreciate any comments on this.<br />

<p>That usually happens if there's a pending balance on the account. It won't let you change the primary payment method.
</p>
<p>However, you can try adding a new payment method, then go to billing.microsoft.com and perform a service transfer. This will migrate all services associated with the first payment method to the one you just added. It also effectively cancels the old payment
 method.</p>

<h2>            solitaire collection freezes</h2>
                    
<p>Pyramid (my fave) and tri-peaks&nbsp;keep freezing, usually will go back to start where I select it again, but sometimes it won't unfreeze. I have tried everything I can think of - have uninstalled and re-installed many times. The sound is funky, so I have selected
 no sound, didn't work. Turned off iRadio, didn't work, went back to reset settings, didn't work. I love this game and don't know what's wrong. Mahjong, which I also love, works perfectly. Started after I upgraded to Windows 8.1. I have an HP 2000 laptop, but
 like I said it all worked before I upgraded the OS. Can you please help? Very frustrating! My email is

<p>sorry was supposed to get an email when there was an answer but didn't. It happens on tri-peak too but pyramid most often. I left the background and card colors at default this time, but no diff. Sound is logey, plays when it wants whether or not it's shut
 off. but I can put up with that. It's the freezing. I was going to upgrade but if it's going to freeze while I'm playing I don't want to pay. I read a post that said they tried that and same probs. Please help! I love this game.</p>

<p>I sincerely apologize- I was doing further research into this issue about why it is continuing to freeze. Apparently this is actually related to a Windows Update and not actually the game but this update getting "stuck" has caused many apps to behave poorly
 or not run at all. &nbsp;In fact, I just got word a few minutes ago that some people might not even realize it was stuck at all and the system may not even say that it was but after following these steps will silently install in the background.</p>
<p>To "unstick" it, please do the following.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows Key</p>
<p>2. Type &nbsp;Check for Updates and click on Settings below the search bar</p>
<p>3. Click on it</p>
<p>4. Install any updates that are waiting </p>
<p>5. Reboot</p>
<p>6. When you're done rebooting, uninstall Solitaire (to do this, right click on the icon and choose Uninstall from the bottom menu)</p>
<p>7. Press Windows Key + R</p>
<p>8. Type in wsreset.exe and Enter</p>
<p>9. This will launch the Windows Store. Reinstall Solitaire</p>
<p>This should fix everything right up for you! :)</p>

<p>No you will not need to purchase a new copy of Windows 7. The worst that you may be required to do is activate by phone (see instruction below). I've included info of hard drive test utilities. The first of which is to download the hard drive manufacture's
 own diagnotic software.</p>
<p>HD Tune: <br />
Provides drive info and has an option to test your drive.<br />
<a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdtune.com/</a></p>
<p>SpeedFan:<br />
Monitors internal remperatures and has an online drive health analysis feature <br />
(SMART tab) for hard drives. It will show how your drives <br />
compares with other drives of the same make and model.<br />

<p><strong>How to activate Windows 7 manually</strong><br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5) <strong>Stay on the phone and wait for a person to help you with activation.</strong></p>

<div>No, definitely not. You don't have to do that with Windows 7, nor with</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can change whatever hardware you want. If yours is a retail copy,</div>

<p>Thanks for the links <span>J W Stuart. I tested&nbsp;HDD with Hd Tune Pro, no errors detected.&nbsp;The table&nbsp;is green and no errors found. I checked Health status, there is a warning on Ultra DMC CRC Error count, but I don't believe this may be a big problem. So,
 it's not a HDD problem? &nbsp;You can read about my problem here:</span></p>

<p>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:<br />
If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>First try running Memtest86+, this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or
<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct. Let it run for as long as you can, 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a></p>
<p>If you have a copy of Windows XP around try installing it temporary (if not Windows 7 will work as well)<br />
"No need to activate as you get a 30 day grace period which is perfect for testing"<br />
and then use the following tools (this assumes the memtest shows no failures)</p>
<p>Prime 95:<br />
<a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/</a><br />
It's a stand alone .exe file contained in a .zip archive.<br />
Just choose to run the "stress test" option for 3 hours or more.<br />
If your PC can pass this test both your memory and CPU<br />
are fine (close the case cover to maintain proper ventilation)</p>
<p>Core Temp: <br />
Monitor the temperature of each core of your processor. For non overclockers using the stock Intel/AMD heatsink and cooling fan you can expect a temperature of 35 to 40C at idle and up 60C to 65C when running Prime95.<br />
<a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/</a></p>
<p>CPU-ID (CPUZ): <br />
Shows the clock speed of the CPU under various load conditions (if you are using Intel's EIST speed step technology). Also has two tabs (Memory and SPD) which show the actual memory speed and 'SPD' tab shows the rated speeds for each memory slot that is populated.<br />
<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php</a></p>
<p>HD Tune: <br />
Provides drive info and has an option to test your drive.<br />
<a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdtune.com/</a></p>
<p>SpeedFan:<br />
Monitors internal remperatures and has an online drive health analysis feature <br />
(SMART tab) for hard drives. It will show how your drives <br />
compares with other drives of the same make and model.<br />
<a href="http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.almico.com/speedfan.php</a></p>
<p>GPU-Z:<br />
A lightweight utility designed to give you all information about your video card and GPU.<br />
<a href="http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/</a></p>
<p>HWMonitor:<br />
A hardware monitoring program that reads PC systems main health sensors : voltages, temperatures, fans speed.<br />
<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/hwmonitor.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cpuid.com/hwmonitor.php</a></p>
<p>PC WIZARD:<br />
A powerful utility designed especially for detection of hardware, but also some more analysis. It's able to identify a large scale of system components and supports the latest technologies and standards.<br />

<p>My RAM is new. I fully tested them with memtest, no memory errors found. Then I tested PC with old RAM a month ago there was errors.</p>
<p>Temperatures are fine I tested it too.</p>
<p>I also tested HDD yesterday with HD Tune, no any errors,&nbsp;bad sectors or corrupt files found.</p>
<p>My vendor checked every part of the PC and everything by them is fine, but I still getting freezes every day.</p>

<p>Well, it's fine too. I even don't know who can cause my problems. I even losing hope to fix it.</p>
<p>Can this be caused by internet options? I got Dhcp errors every hour in Event viewer. Here is one of the errors:</p>
<p><span>The IP address lease [ip adress here] for the Network Card with network address 0x002618F056BB has been denied by the DHCP server 0.0.0.0 (The DHCP Server sent a DHCPNACK message).</span></p>
<p><span>And why after every freeze, blue screen&nbsp;or reboot I must connect to website again? I always choose to remember password and connect me automatically, but after freeze and restart I must connect again. Maybe it's something wrong with IP's
 or something?</span></p>
<p><span>I have two PC's at home, maybe I need to try to put my old HDD to my computer and see will I get freezes? If I get the freeze&nbsp;or&nbsp;blue screen, then it's not HDD fault. If&nbsp;I won't get freezes anymore, then it's HDD fault.</span></p>

<p>atipmdag.sys - adress 90Fgec00 at 90E30000, datestamp 4b8ddb4c</p>
<p>The another was jsut blue screen and few words: "the computer was stopped working to prevent damage etc..."</p>

    <title>Forced to switch &#34;Home Xbox&#34; in order to play - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lemonmonster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forced to switch &#34;Home Xbox&#34; in order to play</h2>
                    <p>We own two Xbox One consoles as of last winter. We have been playing Fallout 76 together on these two Xboxes since then. We utilize the "home" xbox with an additional account in order for us both to play at the same time. Tonight while in the middle of playing
 my husband was disconnected multiple times from the game, I was not, until ultimately receiving various error messages every time he tried to log back on (I don't know what they were I apologize we just assumed it was a server issue with FO76) until he could
 no longer log into the game. He logged off/on, restarted, and ultimately we attempted to log into opposite Xboxes to see if it was a game error or not and he was able to sign into my Xbox with no issues and then play. When I attempted to sign into his however
 I did not have access to the game because it was purchased under his account. We switched back and he encountered the same issues with not being able to sign into the game. The message at one point said to go the the My Xbox and change the settings so we made
 that Xbox the "home" xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really confused as to why and how this happened after months of playing with no login issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did this happen?</p>
<p>Will this continue to happen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>We get 5 "switches" a year with a possible 6th but then what happens?</p>
<p>Is there a way to put all our purchases (games, gold, etc) onto one account now that we've got them on two?</p>
<p>Is there a way to prevent this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any and all help with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>If you switch more is really hard to switch back. A game crash wouldn't cause the Xbox homes to switch.</p>
<p>It's limited to 5 so the system isn't abused.</p>

<p><strong>Why did this happen? Will this continue to happen?&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Normally you won't have that issue unless for whatever reason his xbox was having trouble staying connected to the internet. At least this was our experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you look at how the&nbsp;<em>Home Xbox </em>works, the user who actually owns the xbox live subscription/games doesn't need to be logged in for anyone else to enjoy the benefits of both.
<em>With the exception of any account specific items of course.&nbsp;</em>On the <em>Home Xbox</em>, it's also the only way to enjoy playing your games offline. So in the event of a network or service outage, you can still play.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Playing next to my own husband, there has been times where he's lost his xbox live connection while mine is still running and vice versa. I feel like it has more to do with the server our accounts are on tbh and it normally fixes
 itself the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think only on one occasion did I actually bother doing a soft factory reset to fix my console and even switched to a wired connection to get it working faster. Sometimes it worked by simply resetting the modem.
<em>Although we haven't seen that same issue in awhile.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>We get 5 "switches" a year with a possible 6th but then what happens?</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, support doesn't allow for any additional switches per year past the
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">5 limit.</a></strong>&nbsp;So you won't be able to change your
<em>Home</em> console again until the next year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Is there a way to put all our purchases (games, gold, etc) onto one account now that we've got them on two?</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p>I don't believe there is a way to transfer the game licenses between the accounts. I know for us he's even gotten some gold games that I didn't bother downloading and in order for me to play them I have to have his account signed in on the console in order
 to play them on my account (We no longer pay for his xbox live subscription). We plan to switch to the ultimate pass once that comes out since we're already saving money not having to pay for two live subs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Is there a way to prevent this?</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not 100% sure what causes it exactly. But try a wired connection to your modem and see if you run into the issue again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Christopher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround you can try running the software in compatibility mode and check if that works.</p>

<h2>            Receiving 0xc0000022 error when launching programs after update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer recently underwent an update for Windows 10. After it finished, some of my programs would not launch. The following prompt launches when I attempt to open them: "The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000022). Click OK to close the
 application." These programs include f.lux and a variety of sound card programs. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Rathin Kacham</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: My headphones do not work because of this error as well. I think this is because of my sound card problem.</p>

    <title>Win 10 failed this morning &#40;automatic repair failure loop&#41; ... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> field_studies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 failed this morning &#40;automatic repair failure loop&#41; ... coincident with fall update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
Hope someone here with a similar experience can help. I've spent the morning reading forums, but haven't found a solution to my current issue.<br />
<br />
I'm using a new (1 month old) Windows 10 pre-built tower. It arrived, I soon discovered, with a faulty motherboard. Once that was replaced it seemed to be working without issue ... until this morning (last night I shut it down for the first time in a few days;
 I think in the intervening time I installed the fall update? might be coincidental)<br />
<br />
Now it boots straight into the <span>Automatic Repair</span> blue-screen. This processes fails. In the advanced options, I've tried to use
<span><em><strong>Startup Repair, System Restore, Previous Version</strong></em></span>, and even
<span><em><strong>Startup Repair, System Restore, Previous Version</strong></em></span>, and even
<span><em><strong>Windows Reset</strong></em></span>, but none work (the first fails, the next two claim there are no previous points to revert to, and windows reset fails).<br />
<span><em><strong>Windows Reset</strong></em></span>, but none work (the first fails, the next two claim there are no previous points to revert to, and windows reset fails).<br />
<br />
I've also tried to boot off of a Windows 10 media creation tool USB. That only seems to give me the option of a clean install of Windows or, by selecting the 'repair' option, puts me back into the startup repair bluescreen, with the same (non-working) options
 as earlier, minus Windows Reset.<br />
<br />
I'm nearly resigned to taking it in to the store for repair, but as they can't look at it until tomorrow so figured I'd try to work at it a little more myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've run CHKDSK on my C: drive, and it turned up clean</li><li>I've run <em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em> and <em><strong>dism.exe /Image:C:\ /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></em><br />
though neither seemed to turn up anything or help. - strangely, if I disconnect my C: drive, I get the same blue screen circuit detailed above; but if I disconnect either of my storage drives, I get just a black screen with "reboot and select proper boot device"</li><li>I have accessed the <em><strong>DISMReportLogFile.txt</strong></em> in my System32 folder. There are a few warming messages therein (these relate from my most recent boot attempt, via the USB Windows drive):
<ul>
<li>"[...] c:\Windows may not point to a valid Windows folder. - DISMOSServiceManager: : Final_OnConnect"</li><li>"Failed to load the provider: X:\windows\TEMP\92DA3[etc]\PEProvider.dll. - CDISMProviderStore : : Inter [...]"</li><li>"Failed to load the provider: X:\windows\SYSTEM32\Dism\MetaDeployProvider.dll. -CDISMProviderStore: :Internal_GetProvider [...]"</li><li>"[1524] [0x80070002] FIOReadFileIntoBuffer: (1381): The system cannot find the file specified."</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
If anyone has any ideas, I'd be very grateful! </p>

            Do you have a Dual Boot?   It may have actually been repairing the Version 1809 Update that was withdrawn due to serious problems.  What version does it say you're running in Settings &gt; System &gt; About?
<br />
<br />Can you post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays.
