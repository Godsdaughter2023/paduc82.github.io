    <title>Unable to boot to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephens4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to boot to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My PC had been running fine, when I was unable to boot to Windows after attempting to clone my hard drive. &nbsp;Key word is attempting, since the cloning process also failed. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used a USB image of Windows to hopefully correct the problem by using the "repair my PC" pick and the BCDBoot command however, it tells me that it is unable to download the boot files to my hard drive from the USB image. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can still use my original boot disk to get to the files on it, however, cannot use it to boot or even have it on the system when I boot from another (good Windows 10) drive. &nbsp;I would rather not have to transfer all my files and reinstall many programs
 if I don't have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            Have you tried below -
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

            Hi Stephen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would abandon the clone, replace the original drive, save a System Image backup externally with Macrium which always works.  Tutorial:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Swap in the other drive, boot with the rescue media, apply the image making sure to include the EFI/System boot partition and C at minimum.  You can resize the partitions on the fly using the drive tools link below each partition after you drag it to the target drive.  
<br />
<br />After imaging, it should start without need for repair as long as you included the System partition.  You'll also have a solid backup stored for future use.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Intermittent USB Mouse Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aland2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent USB Mouse Freeze</h2>
                    Problem:&nbsp; The mouse cursor intermittently freezes for 3 to 8 seconds or more.&nbsp; This usually happens when I click on a web link while I am browsing the internet, but it may also happen when I am using other applications (or am just in the background) at
 random times.&nbsp; I use WiFi for my internet connection, and my WiFi connection is often flakey, frequently disconnecting and reconnecting.&nbsp; The touchpad and keyboard work just fine during these freezes.&nbsp; I have owned my system for 11 months, but this problem
 only surfaced a few months ago.&nbsp; These freezes also seem to happen just before I get notified of a low battery condition.<br />
<br />
Hardware: Logitech G7 Wireless Mouse, Sager NP9262 notebook, Intel Core2 Quad Processor Q9450 2.66GHz, dual Nvidia GeForce 8800M GTX in SLI, 4GB DDR2/800 memory, Intel PRO/Wireless 4965 802.11a/g/n, Bluetooth Wireless, 3 hard drives, etc.<br />
<br />
Software: Logitech SetPoint Control Center 4.72.40 (same driver version), Windows Vista Ultimate (64-Bit) 6.0.6001 SP1 build 6001 and all current updates, ZoneAlarm Firewall 8.0.298, AVG Anti-Virus Free Edition 8.5.339, Firefox 3.0.11, Process Explorer 11.33,
 Open Office 3.1.0, SeaMonkey 1.1.16, Adobe Photoshop Elements 5.0.2, Nero Home Essentials SE, Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 1.6.2.0, Quicken 2006 Basic Release R3, iTunes 8.2, Left 4 Dead, and lots of other stuff.<br />
<br />
Fixes Tried:<br />
(1) I bought and started using new batteries in my G7 mouse.&nbsp; This reduced the number of low battery condition notifications, but it did not eliminate all the other freezes.<br />
(2) I found a lot of reports of similar mouse freezes on the web (for example, http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/99e3491c-9b60-4cd8-8113-90775600b9a8).&nbsp; I did not find any reports of fixes that would be applicable to me.<br />
(3) A tech suggested I unload the Logitech software and try running default Vista drivers.&nbsp; This did not help.<br />
(4) I downloaded and installed the latest drivers from Logitech's web site.&nbsp; This did not help either.<br />
(5) The tech next suggested downloading the latest wireless driver from http://downloadmirror.intel.com/17525/eng/ICS_Dv32.exe, which I did.&nbsp; I ran it, but it did not show me any results.&nbsp; I rebooted and found that I still had freezes.<br />
(6) I then did a clean boot using the instructions at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/929135.&nbsp; I had a lot of weird things happen (Firefox didn't work, for example), but I was able to get IE7 up and browsed some web pages.&nbsp; I did experience several
 mouse freezes.&nbsp; This most likely eliminates software outside of Vista as a source of the freezes.<br />
<br />
Notes: I believe that these freezes are caused by WiFi activity, either hardware or software (drivers).&nbsp; Because this problem surfaced recently, I doubt it is a hardware problem.&nbsp; I find it more likely that it was caused by a software update, but I have no
 idea of exactly when this problem started or what update might have caused it.

<p><span>Hello AlanD2,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From what you have described it sounds as though the device may be having some sort of interference either with the touchpad on your laptop or the drivers
 themselves are not completely compatible with the 64bit operating system you are running.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may want to try a clean boot to try and narrow down the issue with your laptop. I have included a link to the instructions for a clean boot below. I
 have also included the first part of the instructions to get your started.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista.</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Perform a clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>
 If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft
 support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click

</span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>, type
<strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the </span><strong><span>Start Search</span></strong><span> box, and then press
 ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
</span><strong><span>Continue</span></strong><span>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
</span><strong><span>General</span></strong><span> tab, click
</span><strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong><span>, and then click to clear the
</span><strong><span>Load startup items</span></strong><span> check box. (The
</span><strong><span>Use Original Boot.ini</span></strong><span> check box is unavailable.)
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
</span><strong><span>Services
</span></strong><span>tab, click to select the
</span><strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong><span> check box, and then click
</span><strong><span>Disable all</span></strong><span>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
</span><strong><span>OK</span></strong><span>, and then click

            AlanD2,<br />
Your wireless mouse runs on the 2.4GHz frequency, as do almost all wireless consumer electronics.&nbsp; It can experience interference from any number of devices: your wireless LAN adapter, your wireless router, a 2.4GHz cordless telephone, a baby monitor, a security
 camera, a microwave oven, etc.&nbsp; The list is almost endless.&nbsp; When you went to the library you did not experience the issue so it is most likely due to interference with some new device in your home that you may not even be aware has a wireless component or
 may not have thought of as a possible source of interference.&nbsp; Do some sleuthing - start noticing exactly when the freezes occur, how many minutes apart, how long it lasts, what times of day, etc.&nbsp; You should start to see a pattern.&nbsp; I have had people find
 out that similar problems occurred only when the phone rang or only when the wireless router was updating DHCP addresses or only when someone was making microwave popcorn.&nbsp; I know that sounds far fetched, but I ran a wireless business for many years and saw
 some very strange issues caused by interference.&nbsp; You said your local wifi provider was offline for two days and you did not see any interference.&nbsp; Do you have wireless Internet - are you running wireless from your house to a tower that provides your Internet
 service?&nbsp; If so, then your mouse is getting interference from your wireless radio that communicates with the tower.&nbsp; And your mouse is interfering with your radio, which is causing your wifi service to be flaky.&nbsp; Like I said, I ran a wireless ISP for years
 and have seen this happen many times.&nbsp; You may not be able to use a wireless mouse if you are using wireless Internet.<br />

<h3> ever&#39;man it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Sync Center - Cannot Set Up Folder for Always Available Offline</h2>
                    <p>I have one W10 Pro laptop that refuses to make folders available for offline use.&nbsp; Windows 2008R2 server, using folder redirection for Desktop and Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Sync Center opens fine</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Manage Offline Files Enabled</p>
<p>3. In 'Set up new sync partnerships', folders listed: Folders(1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offline Files</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Network files available offline</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Folders</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; When I click on Set up, I get the dialog instructing me to right-click folder and select - Always Available Offline</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; In 'View Sync partnerships', I see - You have no sync partnerships set up on this computer.&nbsp; Click ... &nbsp;
</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; In file explorer, when I right-click one of the two redirected folders and select - Always available offline, nothing happens; there are no changes.&nbsp; On all of my W10 computers that work, right clicking the folder shows&nbsp; - Always available offline greyed
 out with a check next to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No users on the offending machine can select any folders for offline use, including administrators.&nbsp; All of these same users have fully functional offline folders on another W10 machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What would prevent selection of folders when everything up to that point seems to work?</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;Hey y 'all, yet another BSOD with the new 1803 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have run sfc /scannow and it said there were no problems.</p>

</p><p>I have an old version of Adobe reader installed (version 11 something) but it has been getting sluggish ever since the "update" 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;All I was trying to do was update Adobe reader to Reader DC, hoping it would fix the sluggish movement of the older one, AND to continue getting updates from Adobe. And it BSOD while trying to install it with this:</p>

            Adobe Reader DC is notorious for experiencing problems on Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Try downloading and install the earlier release Adobe Reader XI (version 11)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/install-reader-x-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/install-read...</a>
<br />
<br />Adobe provides a click to run installer for quickly setting up the application. I personally don’t recommend it, since it can sometimes fail or doesn’t install properly. Users should instead, go to the Adobe Reader DC Distribution page and download the full installer. On the download page, choose your operating system version, language and the version supported then click Download. This downloads a setup file you can use to install Adobe Reader 11. You can also store it on a file server so other computers on a network can easily install it.

<p>
</p><p>To isolate the concern, we suggest that you connect the keyboard to other computers, and see if it does the same thing.</p>

<h3> wahabalisiddiqi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 built-in backup and recovery</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I used to have Windows 8.1 which was having built-in internal backup and recovery of Windows 7 (which was good and helped me once when my windows got corrupted). Now Windows upgraded to 10, and the backup and recovery of Windows 7 no longer functional/it
 is deleted or removed from system by auto.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to have such kinda backup and recovery in my system as it used to be, if it is possible in Windows 10 than let me guide about the steps, if not than how can i go back to Windows 8.1 without effecting files and folders to get that built-in backup and
 recovery of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second question is my drive is only one consists of 452 GB, how can i split it into two ; one for Windows and second for personal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will really appreciate your help regarding this matter. Thanks!!</p>

<h2>            Why does my computer think my Lexmark printer is a mass storage device</h2>
                    <p>Got a new Dell computer a few months ago after the old one crashed.&nbsp; When I hooked my Lexmark all in one printer up, the computer now thinks it's a mass storage device upon start up.&nbsp; If I unplug the USB cable before starting the computer will come on normally.&nbsp;
 Once I plug the printer cable back in after start up, it will print normally too.&nbsp; However, if I leave the printer cable plugged in and then start the computer, it shows that all my USB ports are Lexmark mass storage devices and takes me to a screen for diagnostic
 tests.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any settings I can modify to get this to stop?&nbsp; It's getting annoying to have to unplug the cable everytime I want to turn the computer on.</p>

<h2>            How can I change the lock screen photo Windows 10 desktop</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to change the lock screen photo on my desktop pc running win 10 pro x 64 (upgraded from win 7) unless I disable Cntrl Alt Del security option which clearly is not a satifactory work around. The PC is set up as a workgroup. I do appreciate this
 or similar questions have been raised many times before but as yet, to my great surprise I have not been able to find an answer that works.</p>
<p>Please can someone advise me that this issue has been accepted as a problem and a resolution is or will be worked on.</p>

            A friend helped me look into this.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's a minor bug here that's impacting you.&nbsp; For now you can create the registry key:
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\System</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>and create the REG_DWORD value DisableLockScreenAppNotifications and set that to 0x0.&nbsp; After that you should be good to go.</p>

<p>Hello, After the March update My kinect has been restarting or just turning off for no good reason. I've tried power cycling but it did't work. It's not a big deal but I mainly use it for voice control as the interface is hard to maneuver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Had the same thing happen to my titan fall bundle console on the 2nd day of ownership. The console kept saying the kinect was unplugged. &nbsp;Exchanged the system at game stop and downloaded my games again only to find out the mic that came with this one doesn't
 work. I really dont want to download everything for a third time, but I'm not sure that GS will replace the mic by itself. I was dead set on getting a PS4, changed my mind because I've always been an xbox guy, and the titan fall bundle seemed like a good buy,
 but now I've spent more time troubleshooting and going through setups than anything. Would've eased the pain a bit if GS just swapped out bundles, but instead I received a normal xbox one console box with a sleeve instead of the pre order box I originally
 had, and they cut it open to remove the tf code. I'd be curious to see how many of those codes get sent back to microsoft, and how many get sold by someone who works for a game store. I obviously don't need a second tf code, but maybe selling it or trading
 it for a different game would've left less of a bad taste in my mouth.</p>

<p>Mine started doing the same thing after working great for a 1 1/2 years. &nbsp;I use mine for controlling my Xbox and TV.. This is very annoying and not the way this XboxOne was sold. When they switched to Win 10 OS on the console &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;they obviously have
 some code problems with the Kinect and haven't bothered to fix them yet. I am starting to think that I should have both the PlayStation. ***.</p>

<h2>            windows 7&#47;desktop stops responding during wake up</h2>
                    <p>HP Pavilian desktop/windows 7: after working for years something changed. Upon waking (w/ either keyboard or mouse) from sleep it starts the wake up process but very quickly (~8 seconds) stops w/ a black screen. There is no activity and no response. The
 only option is power off &amp; reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a number of others who have this same problem, and tried a host of different things. So far the best answer I've found is not a solution but a work around.&nbsp; It is to use hibernate instead of sleep. While not the optimum it at least works. Is
 there a solution that would allow me to use sleep again?</p>

            I was on a trip and tried to use my Laptop. I got locked out of my account and have had great difficulty getting logged-in. Thank you for your response. I have done the following:
<ol>
<li><span>Shut off Hibernate</span></li><li><span>I tried with &amp; without Balanced Plan</span></li><li><span>Unplugged wireless mouse &amp; tried USB direct mouse</span></li><li><span>Clean Boot</span></li><li><span><span>Ran</span> Power troubleshooter</span></li><li><span>NVIDIA Installed driver: GeForce 307.83 Driver, Version 307.83</span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
</span>Following your advice I reset the Power Plan to default and verified my video driver was the latest. No change.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>NEW DATA</strong><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>The "Hang-up" seemed to occur right after my D: drive was accessed (apparently looking for a bootable CD).&nbsp; I put my Windows 7 CD into D: before I put the computer to sleep. It seemed to spend a little more time looking at D: but the result was the same
 (Hung up with a blank screen). I did not get the expected&nbsp; <span>
"Press any key to boot from CD or DVD"</span></li><li>I turned off Sleep and turned on Hibernate and this works as a workaround, however, I would far rather have a solution than a workaround, if you have any other ideas.

            <p>I have restored the powercfg defaults earlier and I once again repeated the process without fixing the problem.&nbsp; I have tried the troubleshooting steps of the referenced MS Support Article several times and I once again repeated the processes without fixing
 the problem. After I performed the steps of your 8/6/14 reply the nature of my problem has changed.&nbsp; To begin with my computer hung up during wake up now upon sleep it passes right on through sleep and powers off.&nbsp; When I power back up it does a complete reboot
 accessing BIOS and on through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can do is turn off Sleep and turn on Hibernate.&nbsp; Clearly the power management functions are not performing as intended.&nbsp; Surely there is a way to fix this?</p>

            <p>I tried to follow your instructions but I didn't accomplish anything.&nbsp; There may be a couple of reasons for that:</p>
<ol>
<p>1.&nbsp; With all the things I've checked, changed and tried the nature of my problem has shifted. I no longer know whether it would wake from Sleep because it blows right on through Sleep and almost immediately powers off.&nbsp; When I power up It tells me "Windows
 did not shut down successfully" and give me the option to reboot int the safe mode.&nbsp; This was noted in my Sep. 7 reply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; After running powercfg -ENERGY &amp; shutting down the Command Prompt I then executed Sleep.&nbsp; After going through Sleep to Power Off and rebooting I don't know how to retrieve the powercfg -ENERGY data.</p>

    <title>Best lossless ripping format for Windows Media Player 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hope corson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best lossless ripping format for Windows Media Player 11</h2>
                    I have Windows XP Pro with Windows Media Player 11. &nbsp;I have been researching online what lossless ripping format to use to provide the best sound quality for ripped and burned CDs when I play them in my high end sound system. &nbsp;My research has turned up
 a great deal of confusing and contradictory information. &nbsp;I delete from my library and computer ripped CDs after I have burned them so I don't care how much space it takes up. &nbsp;Nor do I care about tagging, FLAC, MP3, etc, etc, etc. &nbsp;ALL I want to know is which
 of the two lossless ripping formats in Windows Media Player 11 listed below will provide the best sound quality when I play ripped and burned CDs in my high end sound system. &nbsp;I would greatly appreciate it if Microsoft engineers could respond to this posting
 (in preferably non-technical language).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows Media Audio Lossless &nbsp; &nbsp; Uses 206-411 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; 470 to 940 Kbps (Best Quality)</div>
<div>WAV (Lossless) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Uses 600 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1411.2 Kbps (Best Quality)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: The Kbps numbers come from the Rip button menu</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On its face it would appear that WAV (Lossless) would provide better sound quality than Windows Media Audio Lossless because of the much higher Kbps and/or because it requires much more space. &nbsp;I have seen online postings which state that the two formats
 provide identical sound quality and other postings which say that WAV (Lossless) provides better sound quality. &nbsp;I am hoping that my question will result in a definitive answer because it is clear from my research that it is badly needed.&nbsp;</div>

            <blockquote>I have Windows XP Pro with Windows Media Player 11. &nbsp;I have been researching online what lossless ripping format to use to provide the best sound quality for ripped and burned CDs when I play them in my high end sound system. &nbsp;My research has turned
 up a great deal of confusing and contradictory information. &nbsp;I delete from my library and computer ripped CDs after I have burned them so I don't care how much space it takes up. &nbsp;Nor do I care about tagging, FLAC, MP3, etc, etc, etc. &nbsp;ALL I want to know is
 which of the two lossless ripping formats in Windows Media Player 11 listed below will provide the best sound quality when I play ripped and burned CDs in my high end sound system. &nbsp;I would greatly appreciate it if Microsoft engineers could respond to this
 posting (in preferably non-technical language).
<div><br />
<div>Windows Media Audio Lossless &nbsp; &nbsp; Uses 206-411 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; 470 to 940 Kbps (Best Quality)</div>
<div>WAV (Lossless) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Uses 600 MB &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1411.2 Kbps (Best Quality)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note: The Kbps numbers come from the Rip button menu</div>
<div><br />
<div>On its face it would appear that WAV (Lossless) would provide better sound quality than Windows Media Audio Lossless because of the much higher Kbps and/or because it requires much more space. &nbsp;I have seen online postings which state that the two formats
 provide identical sound quality and other postings which say that WAV (Lossless) provides better sound quality. &nbsp;I am hoping that my question will result in a definitive answer because it is clear from my research that it is badly needed.&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
===============================================<br />
Sorry, I'm certainly not a Microsoft Engineer (and I would suggest <br />
that you do not hold your breath until you hear from one) but I agree <br />
with you that .WAV should be the best lossless choice.<br />
<br />
Might be worth a try to do some test samples and compare your <br />
burned CDs to the originals when played on your sound system.<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm not as critical as I should be but using the simple MP3<br />
format seems adequate to me. There is a point where increasing the<br />
bit rate becomes overkill because IMHO you cannot improve on the <br />
original sound quality.<br />
<br />

            <p>This was the first link on my search for "Windows Media Player lossless" and I notice it's almost 3 years old, has over a thousand views, and just two posts. I'll add a third, and hopefully be as helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ripping to WAV will give you what is on your audio CD, two channels (or separate recordings, usually left and right for stereo) of LPCM digital audio sampled at 44,100 cycles per second (hertz), with 16 bits (the ones and zeros) for each sample. This adds
 up quickly, 44,100 X 16 = 705,600 bits per second to be precise. That's still a lot, even by today's standards. I want my vast music to sound as good as possible, but if I'm not loosing anything by storing it in a slightly more complicated container, then
 I'm not loosing anything, just gaining some complication, and some digital storage space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes digital audio is recorded at 48,000 hertz (48 kHz), or 96 kHz, or even higher, which is arguably better, despite diminishing returns. These samples can also be recorded at higher bit rates (24 bit, 32, etc.) This is also arguably better, again
 despite diminishing returns. This extra data adds up even more quickly, so much so that some fancy math is needed to shrink down the total size. If done losslessly, no data is lost. It will sound exactly the same because the computer does the math to play
 the original recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what's the best? I like FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec). I like using it with Audacity, which lets me choose various speed/size settings. Since my computer is pretty fast, I choose the setting that takes the longest time to complete, but more so because
 this results in the smallest file size. All settings sound exactly the same. All lossless codecs (provided nothing goes wrong and they're outputting the same sample and bit rate they take in) sound identical. I came here because this is the question I wanted
 answered:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the differences between FLAC and WMA when ripping in Windows Media Player? Can I adjust these differences to gain better performance/smaller file sizes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After testing a few albums and averaging their file sizes, I've decided to use WMA. All files were slightly smaller.</p>

            <p>WAV is certainly better, but if you have a £5 audio card and £10 speakers it doesn't make any difference what format you choose.</p>
<p>The best choice is down to what sounds best on your system to you.</p>

            MajorTom is correct, FLAC is considered one of the best quality digital formats, evidenced by commercially available releases that provide FLAC as well as lossy (and longer established) MP3. Not all players support FLAC, but syncing software can convert
 for you. More importantly, home audio components are starting to support FLAC as well as AAC and WAV.

            <p>OK. See this article, which explains the problem: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
An update that improves the compatibility of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 with Advanced Format Disks is available</a><br />
<br />
I rather thought that the functionality contained in the hotfix was installed with a regular update, but it may be that this happens only on systems where it's needed at the time. If installing the hotfix doesn't solve the problem, you might get better advice
 from Acer support or in their forums, if they have any.<br />

    <title>Invisble and unpinnable icons in the taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyle biro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invisble and unpinnable icons in the taskbar</h2>
                    <p>So I recently got Windows 10 and it's great, but there's a really really weird taskbar bug. I pinned Chrome to the taskbar and shortly after I&nbsp;unpinned it. The icon was removed but the actual functionality of the app still existed. For example, I could still
 right click the place where the icon would be and open new Chrome windows. I pinned Chrome again and then unpinned it, thinking it would fix the problem, but it made it worse! Now there's&nbsp;three or&nbsp;four&nbsp;"dead" or "ghost"&nbsp;Chrome icons on the taskbar even after
 I uninstalled Chrome! Of course, clicking them does nothing and I have no clue how to remove them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right click on the task bar and click task manager</li><li>Right click on Windows Explorer and click end task.</li><li>Click File at the top and click new task, in new task window type explorer.exe and click OK</li></ul>

            I was having problems with my right mouse button not working to unpin programs from the task bar. I used this and it started working again, then stopped just as quick. I had to do it again and now it seems to be OK.

<h2>            Critical error - start menu - we&#39;ll try to fix it next time you sign in</h2>
                    <p>Following an automatic update by windows, this message started appearing on a brand new laptop (1-month old). I had this problem before with my older laptop and it drove me insane as the only solution seemed to be to reinstall windows and rebuild my machine.
 I did it 3 times with the old laptop and then gave up, bought a new laptop in the hope to never face this situation again and bang... 1 month later, it comes back!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NONE of the solutions offered on the support pages worked. The best I could get to is disabling my windows button and the only way to shut down is pressing the windows key + X. Not to mention that the windows tiles screen is gone. Oh and Cortana + anything
 on the task bar aren't working either. Grrrrrrr</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called MS support line and the response I got was that the only way to resolve this problem is to pay for their 1-off support &nbsp;line ($99) or annual support ($149) - NICE TRICK MICROSOFT!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP - I am not going to pay for support on a brand new product that was corrupted by its own manufacturer. I am a standard user, only using a web browser, skype and Microsoft office.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi...getting the same error on another computer?....sounds like an incompatible software issue...Is there a third party software you always install afterwards?...when exactly did this problem occur like was anything
<em>installed</em> before the error came up?...I'm running five different versions of Windows 10 and have no start menu errors.*john

            <p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed response. I have tried all your suggestions before posting my message. I tried them 3 times already. The scans come up with no findings and DISM doesn't make any difference. Windows did not create a restore point before the recent
 update that messed things up. When I restored to an earlier restore point, the problem persisted. &nbsp;I tried also to restart in safe mode and that didn't help either. Finally, adding another user was simply not possible - the button for creating a new user simply
 doesn't work - even in admin mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... last night, yet again, I reinstalled Window10 and all the software I have on my computer - wasted 3 hours on this exercise (in addition to the countless hours I spent before trying to fix it). The problem is gone. At least for now - who knows what
 will happen next time Microsoft force feed another update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, I did not make any changes to my machine - I would classify myself as a very ordinary user. The only programs I have on the machine (and had to reinstall last night) are: Norton antivirus, Skype, MS-Office, Adobe Reader, Google Chrome, Dropbox and
 a printer driver from Epson. Nothing else. These software packages are used by millions around the world so I would expect MS to test that its updates don't cause issues with these sort of basic and common programs. My laptop is a good middle-range HP model
 with Intel i5 processor - again, nothing unusual about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see thousands of pages on this issue in various forums - clearly the problem is not just mine. It's time MS created a real solution rather than rehash old suggestions that don't work or try to charge money through support lines. &nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks John. See my response to Sayan. I have very ordinary and commonly used software on my machine (MS-Office, Google Chrome, Norton AV, Skype, Dropbox and printer driver). The problem occurred right after a Bios update that was done automatically and
 included 3 windows updates. The only choice I was given about it was whether I clicked 'Yes start now' or 'Remind me later' so I just went ahead with it. I didn't install anything after the update. I only worked on an existing excel spreadsheet and used the
 Chrome browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, last night when I re-built the machine, I reinstalled all these software packages and the issue isn't there. Everything works for now. Who knows what will happen with the next forced update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say is that clearly you are lucky with your 5 machines or have better knowledge about which updates should be accepted and which shouldn't. I don't have such knowledge and when an update comes up, I just click 'OK'. This problem is not unique to
 me - go ahead and run a search online and you will see thousands of pages of people complaining about this issue. I hope for you that you never have to face this issue on your machines - Dealing with it and following all the proposed (yet ineffective) solutions
 is extremely tedious and sucks the will to live right out of me.</p>
