            Hello,
<br />
<br />Other users are reporting this issue as well. Atm, I suggest you to wait untill Microsoft issues a patch of fix for this. If you've multiple issues with V1809, I suggest you to roll back to V1803, as Microsoft has withdrawn V1809 update currently.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            I have a similar problem. I have mapped network drives to a windows server and have shortcuts to programs on my desktop in the mapped drive. When I restart the pc and click on the shortcut it cannot find the program. I have to go into windows explorer
 and open the mapped drive(which will show a red X) before the shortcut will work again. The red X will change to green after you open it.

<h2>            How To Fix A Corrupted Registry</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>I have made a 'hole' in my Registry and I didn't back it up first. &nbsp;Can it be fixed?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had trouble with a USB device and it seemed the Tun Miniport Adapter was conflicting so I tried to uninstall it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Miniport Adapter had the yellow mark next to it in Device Manager and was apparently using the same driver as required by the USB device (an endoscope).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Following the advice in this thread: &nbsp;<a href="http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2139271" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/forum-replies.cfm?t=2139271</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I deleted the registry entry for the adapter in HKey_Local_Machine/SYS/Control Set 01/Services/Tunmp</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And Control Set 2.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There's a Control Set 3 and 4.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I couldn't complete the procedure because my machine refuses to let me uninstall and just tells me it might be needed for bootup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And now I can't even start the thing because of the missing registry entry. It tells me:&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can I somehow complete the procedure? That might fix things. A reinstall of the adapter would create the registry entries I suppose.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or can I somehow copy the entry from Control Set 3 or 4 into Sets 1 and 2?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            If your system will not boot up far enough for you to get to the F8 Advanced Boot Options menu and into at least Safe Mode (does it?), you will not be running a System Restore.<br />
<br />
We usually don't know what things like "can't boot, won't boot, can't start, won't start, getting an error" mean to people without some more details.<br />
<br />
If you have botched up your registry via manual editing resulting in a non boot scenario and did not back it up beforehand, that would be a very appropriate use of
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB307545</a> but that is too complicated when their are easier ways (that is what KB307545 is
<i>really </i>for).<br />
<br />
You might try from the F8 Advanced Boot Options Menu:<br />
<br />
<b>Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)</b><br />
<br />
That is a copy of your system configuration that XP saved the last time the system booted properly - so try that first.<br />
<br />
Failing that:<br />
<br />
If I were you, I would boot your system of unspecified make and model with unspecified XP version and Service Pack on a Hiren's Boot CD.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The HBCD has a Registry Restore Wizard that will let you roll back your registry to a date prior to this incident.&nbsp; Note that this not the same as a System Restore in XP - it only restores the registry from the list of presented Restore Points it finds on your
 system.<br />
<br />
For the future, you may want to entertain this free and easy registry backup program.&nbsp; The trouble (for me at least), is remembering to use it before tinkering:<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Here's the rest:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
From the HBCD shortcut, find and use the Registry Restore Wizard.<br />

<div>Hi</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;(not a real answer, this, rather a response to some real answers).</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;thanks for the real answers, guys.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Much valuable information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;Sorry my English was a little vague. Screwed up the Subject? Object? of the sentence. The 'it' I was referring to, the 'thing' as it was referred to later, is/was the Tun Miniport Adapter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Not the computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Oh, yes, and the computer: &nbsp;having been steered towards this corner I assumed it'd be understood I've got winxp.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I should be more explicit, more detailed perhaps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>WinXP SP3 on an Asus A8NSLI with an Athlon 64 3200.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I can start the computer and use it okay, barring Blaze DTV which won't work while that Adapter is out of commission.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Adapter is the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I first looked there were two of them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And both had yellow marks next to them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I wrote this query there were two of them and I couldn't uninstall them. I couldn't complete that procedure. I queried this forum regarding that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But since then I have deleted them. I did delete them. Bit of screwing around with permissions and this and that but I got them to go.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But still nothing worked. &nbsp;That is: the USB endoscope still didn't work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And my Blaze DTV stopped working, too. Very important, that.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I added them back in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But that didn't help. &nbsp;I didn't really expect it to help the endoscope but it didn't help Blaze either. It still won't run.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are now two Tun Miniport Adapters listed in Device Manager.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But they are labelled #3 and #4. &nbsp;The computer thinks there's four adapters, looks like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And they can't be started.</div>
<div><br />
<div>They both have yellow marks against them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So that's the full story up to date.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I made a 'hole' in the registry by deleting a key.</div>
<div>In order to uninstall a Tun Miniport Adapter.</div>
<div>Eventually I got it uninstalled. (them)</div>
<div>But it didn't help anything.</div>
<div>So I installed another. (two)</div>
<div>And still nothing is helped.</div>
<div>But now I've got two yellow marked Adapters in Device Manager.</div>
<div>And the computer seems to think there's four adapters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And the question becomes:</div>
<div><br />
<div>How can I restore the registry as regards Miniport Adapters?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Get it to where it should be?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Troubleshooting the yellow marks doesn't work. Goes nowhere.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Can anyone help with that?</div>
<div><br />
<div>p.s. thanks for the info re Hirens and Erunt. I'll follow it up and it may very well get me out of trouble here (get Blaze working again - watch 'Luther' on tv) but ideally I'd gain the knowledge of how to deal with this miniport registry thing. That'd
 be good.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps a kind of knowledge applicable to many applications and their registry data. Could be very useful, very illuminating.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now I must go do really important earth shattering things: give the children a bath.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Skylanders Won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Play...</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure for Xbox 360, and it just won't seem to play. I either get an error saying the disc is unreadable, or if the game actually does start, when I click on Load Game, it keeps loading but doesn't actually load the
 game. I've tried using a lens cleaner, as I didn't know if my Xbox was dusty or whatnot. The one time I did get it to play was when I took the hard-drive out, but now that doesn't work either.</p>
<p>If it's the game, how would I go about exchanging it? I can't exactly return the game to the store, as it came with numerous accessories like figures, the portal, stickers, etc.</p>
<p>It's just incredibly frustrating to not figure out what the problem is.</p>

<p>Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure constitutes standard Xbox 360 game software and is therefore subject to all standard terms of warranty coverage and return policies for X360 software. Some retailers, such as Gamestop, only allow for full refunds within 7 days
 of purchase, though you should try an exchange of the disc first if you continue experiencing issues.</p>

<p><em>There is nothing in the drive that could cause a game to crack in the console.
<br />
It is far more likely the crack was caused by the nipple in the games box. You would need to purchase another copy yourself.<br />
<br />
But if you truly believe the console did this you should phone support and order a repair as you wont want it happening to any other disc's.</em></p>

<br />
Windows 7 does not create documents and neither does it have the capacity to password-protect any documents on it's own.<br />
I suspect this is a function of whatever Office suite you are using.&nbsp;

<h2>            Crysis 2 activation code problem</h2>
                    
<pre>Greetings.<br />A couple of days ago I purchased an XBox 360.&nbsp;There were 2 games included: Forza 3 (2 CDs) and Crysis 2 (activation code). So I've tried to activate Crysis 2 using my activation code. I entered the code and the download began. I was wondering if I could browse XBox Live service and download the game at the same time so I tried to figure out if it was possible. So I pressed the "B" button on my gamepad (if I'm not mistaken) but it turned out that I cancelled the download of the game. It did not appear in my games list so I decided to enter the activation code again to finally download the game. But I was told that the code has already been activated. I tried to find where the game is or at least how to start the download of it again. The only place where I found some game data was my hard disk drive. There was no way to start the download from there so i decided to delete it. Once I deleted it, I've tried to enter the activation code again but failed. So my question is: "Is there any

<p>go to Account Settings under Settings. then go to Download History. Everything you download through Xbox live appears there. It should be there so you can start the download over. if for some reason it isn't i would suggest contacting Xbox Live.</p>

<h2>            Windows media player 11 &#40;vista&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm currently pulling my hair out with WMP11 for vista - I cannot download or repair it due to running
Version 11.0.6001.7004
The original error I had caused me to only be able to hear video played through wmp.<br />
Now I cannot play a CD nor burn an mp3.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to fix this problem and get a later version so that I can hopefully repair WMP11!?!<br />

Thanks

<p><span>Hi Spodwmp,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Quick question, do you remember what the original error message? When did you started having problems with media player? Have you tried doing
 a system restore?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You’d have reinstall Vista to get the older version of media player back. Try running a system restore first and see if that will fix it.

            Hi Cory... there is a policy to manage drives.  Not sure it would work.
<br />So i would recommend testing it first.

            SarahKong, I appreciate the answer, but I'm pretty sure all that does is hide the drive letter from Explorer.&nbsp; I will doublecheck it, but either way, I just ended up writing a little powershell script to change the drive letter of whatever had it at boot
 up(if anything) and then assign the letter to the volume I actually want.

            That's what i was wondering as well... i was hoping if you hide it won't use it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>i have tried all of the above suggestions and it doesn't help, when you reset the database, WMP imports all of your songs with today's date for the date added and the problem is that all of my smart playlist which use "Date Added" become useless and unfortunately
 "Date Created" is not an option in WMP 12 smart playlist filters to resolve this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why is Skype automatically logging me out several times a day on both my laptop and mobile&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Skype has begun logging me out automatically and randomly several times a day.
</p>
<p>Unless I have just logged on and am active continually since logging on - I get tossed off.
</p>
<p>This Skype auto log-out also happens on my Windows 10 PC <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and</span> my Apple mobile device.</p>
<p>Needless to say it a real annoyance. </p>
<p>Anyone have any insights?</p>
<p>Thanks for any input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Sidenote: the mandated topics and sub-topics provided are bizarrely limited to problem areas not related to Skype general hiccups such getting auto-logged out on any / different devices used...)

<h2>            Wireless adapter not connecting to 5GHz N, 2.4 G works fine though</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there, I recently purchased a black wireless N xbox adapter to take advantage of my wireless n router. &nbsp;It worked fine on 2.4, but every time I try to connect to my 5 GHz n connection, it doesn't even receive an IP from the router. &nbsp;It says cannot connect
 to router, restart it. &nbsp;I have restarted my modem and router, I have enabled DHSP, added my MAC adress to allowed on my router, manually entered IP, I've literally tried every single troubleshoot thing on Xbox's wireless troubleshooting guide, but nothing
 works.</p>
<p>Please help, I really don't want this purchase to be a waste of my money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks ahead of time.</p>

    <title>Box Update Error Code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spacierboot5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Box Update Error Code</h2>
                    
<p>A Friend gave me his Xbox 360 Slim. It has a black screen whit this message. System Update Stopped Cannot read the update from your storage device. Please reinsert it to continue the update. Status Code 351F-3CD6-B780-1100-C000-0032. The controllers will
 not function even a wired one.</p>

<p>I don't know what device he used for updating. I have tried updating from a USB Flash Drive, burning the content to a CD, putting in a game that I know has an update on it and hooking it up to a wired internet connection. I still cannot get rid of the error
 code and get back to the dashboard.</p>

<p>Any Ideas?</p>

<p>What happens if you boot the console with the hard drive removed?</p>
Could you try configuring a USB memory stick on another console, plug that into the console that has the problem, remove the hard drive and then try to update the console.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />You can start/stop Superfetch service in administrative Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />To start the service, run following command: 
<br />
<br />sc config “SysMain” start=auto &amp; sc start “SysMain”
<br />
<br />To stop the service, run following command:
<br />
<br />sc stop "SysMain" &amp; sc config "SysMain" start=disabled
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<p>
</p><p>That service causes the launch of programs via keyboard shortcuts to lag by about three seconds. Launch by mouse click is instantaneous.</p>

    <title>Cannot access windows store - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john watson 67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot access windows store</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 8.1 from windows 8. I had no problems accessing the windows store after the installation. All the Apps currently on my PC I can use with no problems, but now when I try to access the store I get the message that there is no connection
 with the server and please try later. </p>
<p>I have tried every solution I have found on the forums and elswhere, including disabling&nbsp; the proxy server, clearing the store cache, downloading and running the microsoft Apps fixer, checking the time and date etc etc etc.&nbsp; no fix&nbsp; that I have found works.
 After&nbsp; clearing the store cache I get to the store Apps, but if I click on any App I then get the message of no connection&nbsp; to the server. I have even tried changing my microsoft account password but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of options. Is there anything new I can try&nbsp; without refreshing the the PC, it's only 3 weeks old !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks if you&nbsp; can help </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried EVERYTHING in the link you gave me. The problem remains the same. The App store opens in&nbsp; the home page, but when I click on any App&nbsp; I get the same message that&nbsp; I gave you in my 1st post.&nbsp; The only thing I have done since the
 time I could access the Apps store is to change my password. </p>
<p>But this new password gives me acceess to everything when I am asked for it.&nbsp; Did the error code I gave you give you any clue as to what is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Could you please do the following. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click the Start button and go to Control Panel. If you have the Category view, change it to "Small&nbsp; icons" via the link top right and then click the Windows Update link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, click the link called "View update history" and then see if you have <span>
<strong>KB2911106 </strong>installed, It fixed many issues with the Windows Store and was published in January this year.
</span>See this article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2911106/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2911106/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, could you please check system time and date as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the clock on the right hand side of the Taskbar and go to "Change date and time settings".
</li><li>In the next menu, click the "Internet time" tab and then click the "Change settings" button.</li><li>It should look like you see it in the screenshot. If anything differs, make corrections and then click the "Update now" button.<br />
</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/634e99f0-b6eb-493a-949b-952eede8f33d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Has this problem just started, or have you had it for longer than say a month? If you were able to connect recently and now this issue as arisen, you could try running System Restore to wind back the clock to a time prior to the problem occurring like this.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to System.</li><li>Next, click the link top left to "System Protection" and then click the System Restore button.</li><li>In the next menu, checkmark the alternative option at the bottom to "Choose another Restore point" and then click Next.</li><li>From the calendar which appears, choose a date when you didn't have a problem accessing the store.(Checkmark the box at the bottom to get more Restore points if you can't go back far enough). Click Next to go ahead and then confirm when you see the final
 warning. <br />
</li></ol>
<p>It can take around ten minutes of so to run during which time the machine will reboot. At some particular point, you'll be faced with a plain black screen where nothing appears to be happening. But don't interrupt the process and eventually you'll get the
 usual login screen again.</p>

            <p>Hi Xircal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KB2911106 was installed&nbsp; on 18/03/2014 via windows updates. </p>
<p>Internet&nbsp; time settings. My server&nbsp; was on Time-b.nist.gov&nbsp; I changed&nbsp; this to time.windows.com and updated it. I received the following message. An error ocurred while windows was synchronizing with time.windows.com This operation returned because the timeout
 period expired.&nbsp; I then repeated the change and updated again. Then got the message that the clock was successfully synchronized with time.windows.&nbsp; I then rebooted the PC and went to the Windows store. unfortunately the problem remains the same.&nbsp; I get the
 Windows store home page and a list of subjects. I cannot scroll the page to view other Apps, but can see on the edge of the screen that they are grayed out. When&nbsp; I click on a subject it takes me to that home page, but if I then click on the App&nbsp; it takes
 me back to the original message, no connection to server.&nbsp; </p>
<p>When I first&nbsp; click on Windows store it takes me to the Green screen with a picture of a shopping bag? and then the circle of green dots starts to circle, but&nbsp; always ends up at the "no connection to server" message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not carry out a "System Restore" as there is only one restore point and that had todays date on it 28/03/2014. So I could not get to the calendar to retreive a past restore point. It seems I only have the one restore point.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems we are running out of options??? Here's hoping you&nbsp; can still find the solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>Frustrating indeed because your error code is time &amp; date related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you check the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + i to open the side panel and then click "Change PC Settings".</li><li>Click the link to "Time and Language" and then in the next menu, click "Date and Time".</li></ol>
<p>Here's a screenshot. I've ringed the important settings in red.&nbsp; Where it concerns your time zone, obviously, you need to select the correct one for your own zone. I live in the Netherlands which is why you see it displayed that way in the screenshot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seemed to recall that the US doesn't use daylight saving time, so that won't affect you if you're located in that part of the world.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As regards the single System&nbsp; Restore point, open the menu to it again and then click the "Configure" button at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have mine setup like you see it in the screenshot, but up to you how much space you allocate to it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you've only allocated say 5GB, then that's only going to be enough for a single Restore point which will be deleted as soon as Windows creates another one.</p>

            <p>Hi Xircal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for working so hard on this for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My date and time were exactly&nbsp; like yours. set time automatically was ON. </p>
<p>My time zone was set to Paris (as I live in France). </p>
<p>Automatic daylight saving is ON.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; cannot remember when I was in&nbsp; the initial setup of windows if it asked me for my location, and if it did I may have entered UK.&nbsp; Also when asked for my location in other circumstances, like web pages. I usually put my location as UK. The reason being
 that I am English but live in France and don't want all my pages loading in French. Thinking this could be causing the problem I changed my time zone to London and resynchronized the Internet Time. At first it came up with the error mesasge that the peer was
 unreachable, but after I rebooted and then synchronized the Internet time again it accepted the change ok. But&nbsp; unfortunately whether I put the UK time zone or the Paris time zone, the end&nbsp; result is still the same. I still cannot access the Windows store.
</p>
<p>Regarding the restore points. My setting was at 953.17MB which must have been automatically set by windows.&nbsp; I have reset that to 2% (36.92GB) so hopefully I will get many more restore points to choose from in the future. Many thanks for that advice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will change my time zone back to Paris and resync the internet time because that's the way it was when I could access windows App store.
</p>
<p>Not sure where we go from here, but I really do appreciate your efforts in trying to solve this problem.
</p>
<p>What next I wonder!</p>

<p>Hi John, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you need to have your time zone set the the one you're actually in, not the UK because that's one hour behind CET. I can't imagine that it'll make any difference to the Store, but you never know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try and login with a local account and then see if you can access the Windows Store. You won't be able to download anything with a local account, but at least it might provide a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can access the store with a local account, click a freebie link to download after which you should get the invitation to switch to a Microsoft account. But click the link at the bottom which I've arrowed in red in the screenshot to download a singlle
 app. That gets you the option to add your Microsoft account. Use that and then see whether it works to download the freebie.</p>

It's a problem with Incredimail. Incredimail IS a problem, in fact some people liken it to a virus....the best thing you can do is to try to persuade them to ditch it.

<p>Who knows why when you choose to compress a drive/volume Windows compresses files that probably shouldn't be compressed...&nbsp; so this is not a new problem in the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are going to have to boot your system on something else (CD/DVD or USB thumb drive) to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens often enough on HP systems that they have composed a solution on their WWW support site that you can read about here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c02510149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c02510149</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The link to the Roxio page they say to use appears to be afflicted but another source for the fix can be found in this topic in their online community:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://forums.support.roxio.com/topic/77076-back-on-track-repair-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.support.roxio.com/topic/77076-back-on-track-repair-kit/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not ever used that solution, don't know if it works, have no way to test it but it looks like a good place to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP support community also has some topics you can look through to see what works (and the wild goose chase ideas that don't work)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you recreated the problem on your system and tested any of those suggestions to see if they work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a common issue so can you find and post the link to any topic in the Microsoft community where any of those suggestions resolved this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to see where your suggestion actually worked to resolve the issue like those in the HP Community using the Roxio method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One very big reason why your suggestion is unlikely to help is the afflicted system is an OEM system and those generally do not come with bootable Windows installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since every one of the "methods" starts with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Insert the Windows installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next reply from the OP is likely to be "I don't have a Windows installation disc - my system didn't come with one."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So replies that are likely to help will be those that do not require a Windows installation disc or you need to also include instructions on how to create same if that is your only idea.</p>

    <title>Isolating a PC from home network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> assafmalki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Isolating a PC from home network</h2>
                    I have a laptop, 2 desktops and few mobile devices on my home network.<br />
<br />
I would like to setup remote desktop (using port forwarding) on one of the PCs so I will be able to connect to it over the internet.<br />
<br />
Obviously I will choose an insane password an a weird port.<br />
<br />
However, I would like to totally isolate this computer from my home network so if an attacker do goes through, he won't be able to see any other computer or device.<br />
<br />
I'm going to work on this PC using remote desktop. All that is going to be connected to it is power and Ethernet.<br />
<br />
Any ideas about how to isolate it (so the attacker won't be able to change it once connected)?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Assaf

    <title>Using Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 Education edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slacker384  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 Education edition</h2>
                    <div>I'm trying to create an installer on a USB thumb drive for Windows 10 Education using the Media Creation Tool but I'm having a little trouble.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I run the tool and get to this screen:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2a391fe-eb54-44e2-a6fa-f3a0ecbc8bbc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2a391fe-eb54-44e2-a6fa-f3a0ecbc8bbc?upload=true" /></a><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is no other option under the dropdown for "Edition". It just shows "Windows 10".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know in the past that the Education edition wasn't included in the tool but it was supposedly included in an update as of November according to a comment in this post:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>https://superuser.com/questions/1090881/media-creation-tool-and-windows-10-education-edition</div>
<p>
</p><p>But the weird thing is, it doesn't show any of the options like Home or Pro.</p>

<br />
<br />So, on the screen you provided, if you click Windows 10, then click 'Next' do you then not get the opportunity to pick 'Education' as shown in the image below?
<br />
<br />If not, 
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that document 
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save Aa, at the bottom of the Save As dialog, change file type to 'All Files' then save that file as ei.cfg (note you must manually add the cfg file extension) 
<br />
<br />Then copy that ei.cfg file into the Sources folder in your Installation Media 
<br />
<br />Then when you begin the Installation, you should be asked which Edition you want to install . . .

 reformatted my surface but I was beginning to encounter bouts of black screens after being logged on for a few minutes. So I figured that I need to reformat again. Now as I'm reformatting, the screen keeps on fading to the black screen with no response unless
 I do a hard reset. Now I'm having difficulty because my setup's now stuck at "<strong>Just a Momen</strong>t" after which the system resets and I'm back at language selection. It's been going on like this for like 2 hours now</span>
