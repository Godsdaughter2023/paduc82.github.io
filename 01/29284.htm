<h2>            Windows 10 - microphone on headset is connected, but not working &#40;headphones work&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title states, the microphone on my headset says it's connected but isn't working. I have tried using it on another computer and it works, so the issue isn't with the headset. It was also working on my computer just 3 days ago so I'm not sure why it's
 stopped working suddenly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>1. ensuring nothing is muted and turned up the volume</p>
<p>2. followed these instructions to make sure the device is set properly:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/plug-in-headset-microphone-on-windows-7-detected/bf9a108e-f534-4337-ba55-aea384134210</p>
<p>3. updating the driver, uninstalling and re-installing the driver (Realtek High Definition Audio)</p>
<p>4. troubleshooting Hardware and Devices as well as Recording Audio</p>
<p>5. disconnected it from the jacks and reconnected it, as well as using the jacks in the front and the back of my tower</p>
<p>6. restarted my computer after each of these steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows that it's connected, but no matter how loudly I speak into the microphone no green bars show up. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Have you attempted to wipe the game w/ a soft cloth? Roughly how deep is the circle in the disk? I would actually try the toothpaste trick...</p>
<p>"Polish the CD. Though counterintuitive, polishing a disc can repair a scratched CD by removing some of the outer plastic coating and thus making existing scratches shallower. A number of common household products can be used to polish the CD, but toothpaste
 â especially baking soda toothpaste â and Brasso are probably the most tried and true. You can also use a fine-grit polishing compound that's used for cars or hard finishes.</p>
<p>1. Apply a small amount of toothpaste (must be paste, not gel) or Brasso to a soft, clean, lint-free (old undershirt) cloth: an eyeglass-cleaning cloth works well.</p>
<p>2. Gently rub the cloth on the scratch or scuff in a radial motion, (start at the center and rub out to the edge, like spokes on a wheel). Do this 10 or 12 times all around the CD. Rubbing in a circular motion can cause small scratches that throw off the
 laser tracking system in the player. Try to focus your efforts solely on the scratch or scratches youâve identified (if possible).</p>
<p>3. Polish in this manner for a couple of minutes, reapplying Brasso or toothpaste to the cloth as necessary. Be careful not to apply much pressure, although you will still be able to feel the cloth gently scratching the CD as it polishes." Other then that
 I would have to suggest picking up another copy of GTA4 (they are fairly cheap now).</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jared</p>

<p>I'd suggest you go to a local BlockBuster or Video Store (if they still exist). These stores have professional disc cleaners which can hopefully fix the problem! They usually only charge a dollar or two as well!</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I thought you were broke. If the scratch you are referring to is the one done when you move the console when it is on and it circle scratches the disc then it is usually too deep to be fully removed. The usual recourse it to purchase
 another copy of the game. Also, be sure not to move the console when it is on and there is a disc inside it. If it happened when the unit was not moved, then there is an issue with the disc reader and you should contact support for a repair. If you want to
 confirm this then put a blank/music cd in the tray and try playing it. If a scratch appears call support, if not then you should be safe to use a game in it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>yeah that type of scratch from a console that was jostled or moved when the 360 is on usually can't be fixed 100% cause they are usually deep. &nbsp;getting another copy of that game sadly may be your ONLY option. &nbsp;nobody on the forums or support will be able
 to help you, sorry.</p>

<h2>            Data Execution Prevention has ended Half Life 2 &#40;hl2.exe&#41;</h2>
                    I just bought half life 2, and installed it on my new Vista pc. So, I finish the installation, and I open half life 2. It takes an oddly long time to load, and the second it seems to finish loading, it quits, saying that there was a problem and hl2.exe
 needed to be closed. Then in my taskbar, a little message pops up, saying that data execution prevention has ended half life 2, click here for more details. So I clicked on the little bubble, and it showed a bunch of things about data execution prevention.
 And so I tried to disable it for hl2.exe and hl2_launch.exe, and then I restarted my computer. Once my computer restarted, I opened up hl2.exe again. Same thing happened, data execution prevention blocked hl2.exe. (And I'm sitting at my desk thinking, 'Hold
 on. Didn't I just put hl2.exe and hl2_launch.exe as&nbsp;exceptions&nbsp;in data execution prevention??') So then, I searched around on google until I found another way to help. So I went into cmd, ran it as&nbsp;administrator, and copied and pasted this code from a help
 page-&nbsp;<span>bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff</span>
<div><span><span><span>and pressed enter. I restarted
 my computer again. When it had restarted, I opened up half life 2, and whadd'ya know,
<strong>I GOT THE SAME PROBLEM. </strong>So what the heck is going on? Is it my computer? Or is it just Bill Gates??? Please help. It seems that I can't turn off DEP, and I can't add a program as an exception, even though my computer says I can. Oh yea, and
 I'm the administrator, with all admin&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;to my computer.&nbsp;</span></span></span></div>

<h3> taklop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD &#40;driver irql, clock watchdog&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a relatively new system running W10. When I first got it around 6 months ago it would BSOD and I thought nothing of it as the hardware was brand new and so was the OS, and as such expected a few teething issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the issues still continue. My PC BSODs at various times, specifically : while playing games (Rust and Diablo, but also a few others), and also more occasionally at boot. (Causing the system to reboot again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>While playing games it BSODs frequently, often hourly or even more frequently than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These BSODs are mostly: driver irql_less_or_not_equal, or clock watchdog timeout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are up to date, and so is my windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running stress tests and memory diagnostics, and it doesn't seem to be a hardware fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>

            <p>Both Drivers have now been updated. BSOD crashes are far more infrequent but the freezing/lockups/hangs, remain, and they don't provide a dump file as far as I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game I was playing at the time (Rust) recovered from one of them and created a few files, including a .dmp, I will upload all of the files in a zip and maybe that will help you diagnose it. (This is the first time it has recovered from the freeze, and
 actually generated anything,it normally results in a reboot)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the dumpfiles generated by the game: http://1drv.ms/1R0Kbmu </p>

    <title>Locked out of Windows 10 on Lenovo Yoga 700 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> indranildasgupta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Windows 10 on Lenovo Yoga 700</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter is locked out of her Windows 10. The picture password stopped working all of a sudden with the following cryptic message: "Your picture password enrollment contains an old password". Her text password is also not working and after a few tries,
 windows no longer even prompts for the picture password. After a few google searches it became clear to me that other people have seen this problem - but I see no clear solution offered from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting from a USB drive to somehow create a new account didn't work as Windows 10 showed me a blue screen that said due to ACPI non compliance of BIOS, Windows was shutting down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is definitely not a case of an incorrect password. Something else is going on. Unfortunately my daughter didn't create a password reset disc for the machine - but I am not even sure if that would have worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am extremely disappointed with the capriciousness of the OS.&nbsp; It seems that our only option is to wipe out Windows 10 and lose all her local data. If this happens then I will have zero interest in buying a Microsoft product ever, which seems poised to
 lose in the last area it still has some dominance and that is sad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any remedies for the situation will be highly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Enabled group policy settings are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. This
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2805935/sign-on-with-picture-password-option-not-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>suggests that if the group policy setting "Do not display last user name" is enabled, picture passwords cannot be used for signing on to Windows. Our next option is to use the alternative password. If you are using a Microsoft account password,
 you use this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026971/microsoft-account-how-to-reset-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to reset the password, then try again to sign in.<br />
<br />
If you're using a local account, our best option to access the computer again is to reset the PC. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer, then press <strong>F8</strong> while booting to access
<strong>System Recovery Options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select<strong> Reset your PC</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select<strong> Keep my files</strong> (If available).<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to post your query any time.</p>

<p>There is a single user and account on this laptop and the picture password not only was failing, it stopped being prompted for after a while (during which no settings could have been changed by user as there was no successful login).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did in fact try to reset the PC as that seemed the only option. Unfortunately that prompts me to select a user and password for the user. Given that there is a single locked out user, this just brings me back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on what one can try next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>BSOD DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE upon entering sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reiniern  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE upon entering sleep mode</h2>
                    I got a BSOD of a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE twice upon entering sleep mode yesterday, while it had never occurred to me before on this computer. I would really like to know what's causing it. I checked system restore for my most recent restore point,
 which is 2 days ago and by which 2 applications would be affected: Google Talk Plugin and Microsoft Remote Desktop-services.
<br />
<br />
I hope you could help me which drivers play a role in this problem and whether it could be easily resolved by restoring the system to the mentioned restore point. I uploaded the dump file here: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=D7F969912F322753!403.
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help in advance!<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You said the BSOD were Bug_Check 9F however both the minidumps were Bug_Check 124. So here<br />
is the analysis of the two 124 and in a later reply will be a 9F troubleshooter. However both of those are<br />
probably related - suspect power supply or even the new hard drive. Or you might have dislogded some-<br />
thing when the new hard drive was installed. Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and<br />
cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check were both 124 CAUSE hardware.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 124, {0, fffffa80081a6038, 0, 0}<br />
Probably caused by : hardware<br />

<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check the processor seatting, heat sink, and the compound between the processor and<br />
the heat sink which are common causes.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check the power supply - also ensure it has the needed capacity (possibly the new hard drive pushed<br />
it into the RED.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> You said BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers were up to<br />
date however you might want to re-check those. Manual driver update methods in the next message.<br />
<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Use the other methods in the troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner? Heat related<br />
does not always mean too much heat as it is very possible that something too sensitive<br />
to even normal levels of heat<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is<br />
"possible" that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory<br />
and cables (on both ends) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure<br />
the system has adequate ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully<br />
inspect the motherboard and other cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>
fatal hardware <br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other 4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />

BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

            Hi Gerry,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your reply and sorry I couldn't respond earlier myself. My version of AVG is 2013.0.3408. My Zone Alarm version is as follows:<br />
ZoneAlarm Free Firewall version: 11.0.000.504<br />
Vsmon version: 11.0.000.504<br />
Driver version: 11.0.000.026<br />
Web Identity Protections version: 1.5.393.22<br />
<br />
My computer is a custom one. My motherboard is MSI P67A-GD65.<br />
<br />
I will download and run Driver View as soon as I get back home in a couple of hours. I will then provide the report and also provide the copy of my System Information file you requested.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your help so far and your willingness to help me further!<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Reinier<br />

<h2>            Excel switches desktop&#58; how do I stop it&#63;</h2>
                    If I've been working in Excel and then swap desktops to work on another item, it often follows back and forth when I hit Ctrl+WinKey+--&gt; or &lt;--. What's going on I have no idea and would be very grateful for help as it is very irritating.

    <title>Profile Hacking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> le sephiclo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Profile Hacking</h2>
                    
<p>I have matched up with player profile <strong>[Mod Removed] - Do not name and shame on the forums.</strong> &nbsp;in the past and I have noticed the connection was very laggy, chopping frames in an otherwise smooth game (fight night champion). I had submitted
 a negative player review so I could identify this player in the future and not play with him. Today 8/25/2014, I realized that I the negative smiley which usually pops up when I submit a negative review isn't there and I was matched with him again, and the
 same issues occurred.</p>
<p>As I have explained to Jeremy in phone support, how far you guys decide to take this (he was explaining ddos a bit) is up to you, what I'm really concerned about is getting that negative smiley face next to his name so I can identify him as a problem player.
 If you could please send me an email once that has been done it would mean so much to me. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey mate, if you're indicating that your profile was hacked to get rid of the unhappy smiley from your review then I don't think this would have been the case at all. For example there are plenty of friends I have preferred as a player on my list, yet months
 later it's gone.</p>
<p>I can only assume from my experience that it must reset some how and if you would like to get the unhappy smiley back on his profile, all you should need to do is submit another player review as that is what I have done for my friends missing preferred status.</p>

<h2>            Windows XP Pro and WPS</h2>
                    <p>HI there</p>
<p>AT home I have a windows 8 desktop, a windows xp pro laptop, a windows phone 8 and a Kindle Fire HD.</p>
<p>Everything is connected to my netgear&nbsp;WNDR3400v3 router and works great except for my windows xp pro laptop.</p>
<p>The connection speed of the laptop which is in my basement is very low, so I purchased a netgear wifi extender WN2000RPTv2.</p>
<p>The extender works with everything in my home except the windows xp pro laptop. I was told it is because windows xp don't support the latest wifi security connection type.</p>
<p>I don't know for sure but I think it is wps or wpe or wpa?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is, can anyone tell me if Microsoft have some kind of patch or update that allows windows xp pro to connect to the latest wifi security out there?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10 stuck at startup occasional wdf_violation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck at startup occasional wdf_violation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated to windows 10 from windows 7 home premium, four days ago and it worked fine initially. Today, while I was using my laptop, the desktop picture disappeared and was replaced by a light blue solid color background. With that all my desktop icons also
 went away, except for "My Computer" and "Recycle Bin". I tried clicking start but the laptop hanged. I had to hard shut down the laptop. When I restarted it, the same background and icons were there and windows started throwing error messages about missing
 important files and it froze again. I had to hard shut down it again.</p>
<p>Next time I try to start the laptop, it freezes at the login screen itself. It reaches the login screen in around 5 minutes and hangs. I unplugged all external USB devices from the laptop and tried restarting, but it didn't work. I disabled the external
 ports from the BIOS and started the laptop but to no avail. I tried pressing Ctrl + Shift + Esc at all possible locations from startup till the login but it never even once brought up task manager. I tried recovery from my windows 7 disks by setting boot location
 to dvd drive and my 1st boot priority as "Diskette Drive" but in first attempt, it launched windows 10 Automatic Repair Loop which showed the blue screen error WDF_Violation and then it restarted. While it was restarting, I again tried booting from dvd disk
 and it started the recovery and repair of c drive. That reached to 58% and stopped. The screen changed back to windows 10 startup screen and I was again back in the loop.</p>
<p>At the login screen, it either hangs when I click on the password field/wifi option/battery option/power options or it lets me enter my password but when I click enter, either the screen just refreshes to the same login page or I get a black screen with
 mouse pointer and nothing happens after that.</p>
<p>I have tried many solutions available on different forums. I am stuck with a brick laptop.</p>
<p>Please help me fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I am done with windows 10. Please suggest a way to recover back to windows 7.</p>
<p />

            <p>Thank you for the response. I went through the link that you suggested. The solution offered is based on task manager starting up. As I mentioned in the question, ctrl+shift+esc is not launching the task manager up to the point where laptop hangs. So, any
 solution linked to task manager can not be implemented.</p>
<p>The solution for updating the video drivers can not be used without logging in to the system. I am unable to start windows in safe mode with networking because I can not change the settings without the task manager and without logging in the system.</p>

            <p>Try the repair again, it got to 58%, run it again and see if it gets closer to completion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already set the boot order to cd-rom 1st, if necessary , you could reinstall the upgrade if you have to.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks Andrew P Jones. Turns out there was something wrong with my recovery media. I downloaded windows 7 on another laptop&nbsp;and then used that windows to reinstall the window from scratch. I had the license key at the back of my laptop. I used that to activate
 my windows but then again I had to activate&nbsp;it by calling on the toll-free number (something that needs to be done for windows pre-installed devices).</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
1. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue<br />
It rarely happens that MFT becomes corrupted. NTFS stores a copy of MFT that is called MFT mirror. If problem occurs, NTFS tries to synchronize these copies.<br />
You may follow the suggestions and check.<br />
<strong>Method 1<br />
Step 1:</strong><br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
You may run Check Disk to scan for errors on the drive.<br />
Check a drive for errors<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a></p>
<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong><br />
If the issue exists, you may run Check Disk from Windows Recovery Environment using Windows 7 installation disc.<br />
What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a><br />
a. Select Command Prompt from Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
b. Type CHKDSK /R and press ENTER.</p>
<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>

            <p>One of my hard disk in a server had to be replaced. I wanted to use this hard disk as external storage. So I delete all the volume on it, did a quick format and ran chkdsk /F /R on it.

<p>
</p><p>After few hours at stage 5: Looking for bad, free clusters, it gave the below error:<br />
Correcting errors in the Master File Table (MFT) mirror,<br />
Insufficient disk space to repair master file table (MFT) mirror<br />
CHKDSK aborted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be the reason? How could there be insufficient disk on quick formatted drive?</p>

<h2>            Horrible sound with headphones after updating to new build</h2>
                    <p>Speakers are working fine, but when I plug headphones in - sound gets horrible. I can mostly hear background noises, voices, that should be heard clearly, are mute or very silent. Sound is crispy, unclean, just impossible to listen to.
</p>
<p>Now quite a lot of backstory:</p>
<p>This started when my Win10 updated to new built in October. It was working fine before the update and it suddenly got horrible afterwards. I tried all fixes I could find online, I won't be able to remember them all, but I tried not pushing headphone jack
 all the way in, enabling audio effects, reinstalling drivers and lots more. So when nothing worked I went back to earlier build and problem disappeared.</p>
<p>But yesterday I reset my pc deleting all files, wiping drivers clean and when I turned it on again - headphone problem was back. I can't go back on earlier build because of the reset.
</p>
<p>I am thankful for any kind of help, because I can't listen to anything without headphones since I don't live alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home 1511</p>
<p>OS Build - 10586,63</p>
<p>Laptop - Dell Inspiron</p>
<p>Sound driver - High Definition Audio Device (after reseting it was Conexant SmartAudio HD, but with it sound kept crashing, videos would stop playing even without headphones)</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I would suggest you plug in that headset into another pc to check the status.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Update may have updated drivers available that may be relevant to your current issue. Many times, updated drivers are listed in the "Optional" section of Windows Update. Install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.
<div>&nbsp; </div>
<div><br />
Method 1:</div>
<div>Make sure that the Microphone is not disabled and is set as default.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure that the microphone that you are using is not disabled and is set as default in the computer. Follow these steps to check this:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Right click on the volume icon and select âRecording devicesâ.</div>
<div>b) Now, right click on an empty space and select, âShow disconnected devicesâ and âShow disabled devicesâ.</div>
<div>c) Select âMicrophoneâ and click on âPropertiesâ&nbsp; and make sure that the microphone is enabled.</div>
<div>d) You may also check if the microphone that you are using is set as default.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, check the issue. If it is already enabled, then try the next method and check the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2: Update the Sound Card Drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1: Try updating the drivers from the Device Manager.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press âWindows Logoâ + âXâ keys on the keyboard.</div>
<div>b) Click on âDevice Managerâ.</div>
<div>c) Search for the Sound Card from the device list and right click on it and select âUpdate Driver Softwareâ.</div>
<div>d) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the installation of the latest driver.</div>
<div>e) If no driver updates are available, you may also search for the updated sound card drivers in the âDriversâ and âDriver Storeâ folders in the location âC:/Windows/System32â by selecting the option âBrowse my computer for Driver Softwareâ.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 2: If the issue persists you can also try to Update Driver Software from the Manufacturerâs website:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to the computer or sound card manufacturerâs website and search for the latest Windows 10 audio drivers available for the sound card model and then install it by following the instructions given in the website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. Feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows, weâll be glad to assist you.

            <p>Thank you for the answer. <br />
My headphones work fine with other devices. </p>
<p>There are no updates possible, it's up to date.</p>
<p>Method 1: I have no problem with microphone so I guess you copied wrong part, but I did check speakers just in case. All enabled devices can be seen. Headphones, when I plug them in, are shown as default device.
</p>
<p>Method 2: All drivers are up to date. If I update it through Driver Store folder that you mentioned it just goes back to using Conexant SmartAudio HD, which makes matter even worse, so I switched it back to High Definition Audio.
</p>
<p>Right now I am downloading newest audio driver from Dell page, but I don't think it will help, since Conexant seem to just make matter worse. I will write here if it fixes the problem.

    <title>Xbox Video and Audio problems connected to a reciever with multiple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twisted harmony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Video and Audio problems connected to a reciever with multiple inputs, cablebox, and TV.</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to use the Xbox one as intended and it seems I am just constantly plagued with issues related to video /audio. Specifically, if reciever is not available when the xbox one turns on. Using the Xbox 360( and other consoles), Computer, or other
 devices has never been a problem. I have posted my work-arounds/temporary fixes/repairs to help any others experienceing these problems. Basically the Xbox One is not handling input transitions smoothly and is not functioning as intended otherwise. Please
 patch the system to more gracefully handle this situation.</p>
<p><em>1. Reproducable problem:</em><br />
<strong>Switching Reciever input to another system(like our Xbox 360 or Computer) causes the Xbox One to no longer process audio and video properly upon tuning back to the input which the Xbox One is on</strong>. Errors include No Video, No Audio, Audio juddering,
 bad audio (silent with choppy interruptions to the silence. Reciver input may swapping may occur while in the middle of gameplay or app use by errant remote control presses or manually changing inputs at the reciever(I have a toddler, things happen). Frequency:
 Most times input is swapped.</p>
<p><em>1a. Fix</em>: Continuing to cycle between input the Xbox one will eventually get audio and video in sync. This may take 2 trys, may take 20-30 minutes. Completely unplugging the Xbox one from the reciever and reconnecting it will generally fix the issue.
 These are frustrating and unacceptable fixes just to use my syste, swapping inputs on my reciever may take a fair while to get back.</p>
<p><em>2. Reproducable Problem:</em><br />
<strong>Xbox one gets out of sync and sends power off / on sisgnals in reverse.</strong> This occurs when any system is not in sync with the Xbox One's power state. Frequency: uncommon(we generally try to keep them in sync).</p>
<p><em>2a.Fix:</em><br />
Manually turn them all to the same state. Usually this results in missing TV/Video. so the systems must be cycled off and on again to resume operations.</p>
<p><em>3. Random Problem:</em><br />
<strong>Xbox One displays full Audio and "strobes" or flashes the video from the cablebox/DVR</strong>. Our fix may include multiple reboots and/or unplugging and replugging the cablebox hdmi cable to get the xbox to re-aquire it. May happen concurrently with
 reciever input changes. Frequency: A few times.</p>
<p><em>4.Random Problem:</em> <strong>Xbox one does not recieve the stream of video from the cablebox/DVR.</strong> Fixes include activating the watch TV app multiple times or turning everything off and back on again. May happen concurrently with reciever input
 changes. Frequency: Daily.</p>
<p>---------<br />
<strong>Additional Details:</strong><br />
All my devices are recognized and controllable via the Xbox One.<br />
Xbox will send power signals for on/off to Reciever/TV, we told it not to send signals to the cablebox/DVR.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Equipment:</em></span></strong><br />
Xbox One: <strong>Day One Edition</strong><br />
TV/Internet service provider: <strong>Verizon FIOS</strong><br />
Cablebox type: Verizon provided <strong>Motorola DVR</strong><br />
Regular TV Viewing: <strong>High Definition</strong><br />
Reciever Type: <strong>Pioneer VSX-823</strong> (multiple inputs in use for multiple devices)<br />
TV type: <strong>Panasonic Viera Panasonic Viera TC</strong> (3dTV/65inch)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Connections:</strong></em></span><br />
My cables are not an issue as they are high end and have reliably supported all other devices conections and 3D playback without ever having a hiccup.<br />
HDMI Cable from Cablebox to Xbox One: <strong>HDMI Cable shipped with Xbox One</strong>.<br />
HDMI Cable from Xbox One to Reciever:&nbsp; <strong>AudioQuest Chocolate</strong> (High-speed 1080p/120Hz-4K-3D)<br />
HDMI Cable from reciever to TV: <strong>AudioQuest Chocolate</strong> (High-speed 1080p/120Hz-4K-3D)<br />
<em>Network Connection</em>: <strong>Wired</strong> (6 feet from Router)</p>

<p>In regards to problem #2 with the on/off commands being out of sync...it might be that some of your devices use an on/off toggle command (ie, it sends the same signal for both on and off). All it's doing is blasting the IR signal for all of your configured
 devices, so if any of your devices use the same IR command for on and off (and a lot do), there's no way around this. &nbsp;The XBone/Kinect ccan only send the IR command that it knows...it has no knowledge of the current on/off state of the connected devices.</p>
<p>Here's my setup:</p>
<p>- DirecTV receiver connected to Xbox One</p>
<p>- Xbox One connected to Pioneer A/V receiver</p>
<p>- A/V receiver connected to my Vizio TV.</p>
<p>- All connected via HDMI (obviously).</p>
<p>The only device in the chain that has separate IR commands for on/off is the DirecTV receiver (I know this because there are separate buttons for on/off on the DirecTV remote).</p>
<p>Here's &nbsp;a common situation:</p>
<p>My son wants to play the Wii U, so he turns on the TV, the A/V receiver, and the Wii U, then changes the A/V receiver input to the Wii U and starts playing. He never touches the XBone. An hour later, I want to play some Forza, so I give him some B.S. chore
 to do so I can take over the TV. I turn on the Xbox One and the "instant on" feature turns on the DirecTV receiver, but it turns off the A/V Receiver and the TV. Since the Xbox was turned on, it sent the "on" command to the DirecTV receiver. However, it sent
 the on/off toggle command to the TV and A/V receiver (again, that's all it knows). &nbsp;Because they were already on, they get toggled off and I have to turn them on individually. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you just have to teach everyone in your house to always turn the TV on by turning on the Xbox One, even if they aren't using it specifically. That way, they're always kept in sync.</p>

<p>Yeah, the getting out of sync is annoying but not the worst of the problems I would assume the xbox may be able to detect "on" state using the HDMI, but if it is just acting like remote I get it. The other problems are really frustrating though.</p>

<p>The audio bug is very annoying. I found going back to settings and toggling the audio from DTS to 5.1 would fix the audio until the next time it was disrupted. Easier than unplugging and restarting. This better be addressed quickly.

<p>Not trying to install Windows, trying to install a game (Rise of Legends).&nbsp; During the install at the end of the 4th disk it gives the 1305 error saying that a video file cannot be found and to verify that it does exists.&nbsp; The file does exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing this under a different user and made sure that they where also a system administrator.</p>
<p>I have made sure that the file was not hidden or protected and that all access to it was allowed.</p>
<p>I have made sure that all 4 disks are in good condition as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an older game and requires DirectX 9.0, Windows 10 uses DirectX 12.0 if I recall so this should not be a problem either.&nbsp; All other requirements are met.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you future inputs.</p>

<p>Just to give you a heads up, we may refer you to the game developer's support. This may happen when the installer or the installation pack has a missing file. Usually, the missing game files that are necessary for running the game are the DLL files. Are
 you installing the game via Microsoft Store or via game installer?</p>

<p>Some files may have been corrupted on your installation disk. If you just bought the installation disk recently, kindly ask for a replacement from the store. You could also just download the file from the internet. For further questions and support, we highly
 recommend contacting your <strong>game developer's support</strong>. You could also try posting your issue to the

<h2>            Bluedio R&#43; Wireless headphone&#39;s bluetooth driver for Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi <br />
</p>
<p>Please help me find the Driver for Bluedio R+ Wireless headphone for Windows 7.<br />
</p>
<p>I updated Windows 7 with latest updates on 11/4/2014. Then I installed CSR8510 A10 Bluetooth adapter successfully in my computer as my computer does not have a bluetooth. I was able to detect my R+ through Control Panel -&gt; Devices and Printers -&gt; Add a Device.
 R+ was detected and when I chose it, it searched for the proper drivers. It seems there are 4 drivers as I see 4 rows that says "Bluetooth Peripheral Device
<strong>X</strong> No Driver Found".</p>
<p>Any help or link to the driver files or suggestion to get this working would be really really appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
                </div>

            Check the Bluetooth Network Connection (control panel&gt;network and sharing center&gt;Change adapter settings).&nbsp; If it shows
<strong>Not connected</strong> then Not Connected will be the bluetooth status in the task manager.&nbsp; I believe only tcpip connections are monitored by the task manager.&nbsp; On the other hand if one shows connected and the other Not connected then your point is
 valid.

<h2>            Windows Recovery fails after SSD install</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a desktop PC that came with an internal 2TB HDD. &nbsp;I have cloned a SSD and am now using it as the primary drive. &nbsp;The 2TB is still installed. &nbsp;The OEM recovery partition is still located on the 2TB drive (approx 15GB). &nbsp;When I enter the windows recovery
 tools (PC refresh &amp; reset) it fails and says there is no recovery media. &nbsp;I am trying to find a way to point windows to the recovery partition on the 2TB drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unhidden Recovery Partition &amp; assigned a Letter (F). &nbsp;In an admin command prompt:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>C:\Windows\system32&gt;reagentc /setosimage /path F:\\recoveryimage /target C:\windows /index 1</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Directory set to: \\?\GLOBALROOT\device\harddisk1\partition2\recoveryimage</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>REAGENTIC.EXE: Operation Successful</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From here I check reagentc /info and it shows that my Windows RE status is disabled. &nbsp;The recovery image location appears to be correct. &nbsp;When I attempt to enable the Windows RE status with reagentc /enable it says the windows RE image was not found.</div>

<div>All the above steps have come from digging through internet forums, in no way am I a subject matter expert. &nbsp;In fact I really have no idea what I'm doing. &nbsp;I would prefer to keep the recovery partition on the 2TB drive to save space on my 120GB SSD. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help</div>

</div>
<div>Cheers</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You kind of lost me with some of the things you listed... I have never used any of these.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One thing that comes to mind though, is the partition or disk numbering associated with the Recovery Partition... For instance... did you delete the Windows partition on the 2TB drive?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or... it may be that it is being looked for on the wrong disk... Disk #1 instead of Disk #0, for example.</p>
<p>Is the 2TB in it's original SATA port, or did it get switched with the SSD ?</p>
        </p>

            The 15GB OEM recovery partition is still on the 2TB drive. &nbsp;I installed the SSD on the SATA port that the 2TB drive was installed in and moved the HDD to another port.
<div><br />
<div>I'm guessing that windows recovery is looking in the wrong place for the recovery media, which makes sense. &nbsp;So I need to point it in the right direction. &nbsp;Also I've come to discover that the winre.wim file is non-existent. &nbsp;Can't find it anywhere in my
 system files. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            I found the Windows RE Tools. &nbsp;ASUS has created an 800MB partition for them. &nbsp;When I cloned the OS this partition was brought over to the SSD. &nbsp;I deleted the original from the 2TB drive. &nbsp;In my partition manager the 800MB partition shows up, but when I
 go into the command prompt and use DISKPART the partition does not show up. &nbsp;It is labelled as "unused" in the partition manager. &nbsp;I can explore the partition though from within the partition manager and the winre.wim file is there.
<div><br />
<div>I somehow need to point windows to this partition to get my recovery options back (refresh &amp; reset to name a few).</div>

            Found the 800MB partition in diskpart. &nbsp;No volume associated with it though so I can't assign it a drive letter to try and point windows in its direction.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm still just guessing, for one reason... I've never used DiskPart... but you might try switching the&nbsp;2TB drive back to the SATA port it was originally on...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This may or may not cause problems with your SSD booting...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm thinking that it is looking for something on Disk #0, for instance, when what it is actually &nbsp;looking for is now on Disk #1...</p>
        </p>

            Tried that, unfortunately the SSD doesn't boot when I do.&nbsp; Windows RE Tools is an 800MB partition that was cloned to the SSD.&nbsp; The Recovery Partition 15GB is still on the original 2TB drive.&nbsp; My next attempt will be to clone the SSD back to a partition
 on the 2TB drive, unplug the SSD, and boot from the 2TB drive.&nbsp; Hopefully everything will work as it should then and I'll be able to create my recovery media (which I should have done in the first place).......<br />
