<h2>            Cloning HDD having Windows 10 to SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>If I clone HDD having windows 10 to SSD then will it also copy the drivers and all?</p>
<p>I am thinking to use cloning software available on internet like EaseUS, Partionwizard, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone confirms that If I clone then will I get everything as it is there in HDD with driver&nbsp;and when I boot SSD then do I need to reinstall the driver again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p />

<p>When you clone the HDD to the SSD all of the information is moved from the HDD to the SSD so all of the drivers and all else is moved.</p>
<p>I used EaseUS ToDo Backup on my desktop and it worked.</p>
<p>Make sure that the HDD is unattached when you boot the SSD.</p>
<p>Then you can reattach the HDD and format it and re-partition it or as I did was just to keep it as a backup.

<br />
<br />Cloning is an exact copy. No need to install drivers or else. We recommend cloning using Macrium Reflect, a freeware.

                    <p>I want to change my email signature in my Mail App on Windows 2016. On the web, instructions say to find &gt;Signature under Settings. For some reason my version, has no Signature option at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Help, it explains how to add or change a signature in Outlook, but this is not the format of the Mail App. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>There is no such thing as Windows 2016, you have Windows 10 at a specific version/build. To check your version type winver in Cortana search and select the top result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when you open Mail and select the gear icon you cannot see the Signature setting.</p>

    <title>Getting the Details for my Windows 10 License - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike302  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting the Details for my Windows 10 License</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am making a big move soon, and taking my laptop with me. The laptop originally came with Windows 8, but was upgraded to Windows 10. I understand that Windows 10 won't be free forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I suspect that I will lose the licensing paperwork (I probably already have) when I move. So I am trying to be proactive, since my laptop will be very important to me when I move: how can I get my licensing details for my current Windows 10 installation,
 and what would I have to do in the future if I had a problem that required me to format and reinstall Windows 10? Can I make a bootable USB or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for any help you can provide,<br />
<br />
Mike</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license
 you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. </p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 came preinstalled on my computer, how do I find the product key?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Command Prompt (admin)</p>
<p>Enter the following command:</p>
<span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey</strong></p>
</span>
<p>Hit Enter </p>
<p>The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security
</strong>&gt;<strong> Activation</strong> &gt; <strong>Change the product key</strong> then enter the new product key then click
<strong>Next </strong>to Activate</p>

    <title>Upgrade to 4k but forced to downgrade to dvd sound - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade to 4k but forced to downgrade to dvd sound quaility&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys.</p>



<p>Despite having an amp that claimed to be 4K compatible (Sony) I came to learn that, now being the owner of a 4K TV and a Xbox One S, I m forced to choose between two scenarios:</p>



<p>1) Play the console in 4K that upscales everything and looks really nice by HDMI directly to the TV, but since my "4K compatible" receiver does not support 4K, I am forced to use an optical cable to have any sound. I can now relive the days of PCM 2.0 with Dolby Pro Logic 2, the lossy Dolby Digital 5.1 (640kps) or DTS 5.1 (768Kps) and have wonderful&nbsp;lip sync issues.</p>



<p>2) Play the console in 1080p through my receiver and enjoy PCM 5.1 Uncompressed, Dolby TrueHD and DTS Master Audio. I have been watching Blu-Rays since 2007 and have upgraded my receiver only about three&nbsp;years ago.&nbsp; I have become used to lossless and uncompressed audio which is far superior.</p>



<p>I wanted to buy a Xbox One X, but now it seems I must buy a new receiver first, or get a working HDMI Splitter - which is virtually impossible. I am not happy with this.....</p>



<p>IN&nbsp;ORDER&nbsp;TO&nbsp;BE&nbsp;ABLE&nbsp;TO&nbsp;ENJOY&nbsp;4K ON&nbsp;THE&nbsp;XBOX&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;S OR&nbsp;X&nbsp;FOR&nbsp;THAT&nbsp;MATTER I&nbsp;MUST&nbsp;BE&nbsp;WILLING&nbsp;TO&nbsp;ACCEPT&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DOWNGRADE&nbsp;MY&nbsp;AUDIO&nbsp;TO&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;QUALITY&nbsp;WHICH&nbsp;IS&nbsp;A&nbsp;STEP&nbsp;OF&nbsp;15 YEARS&nbsp;BACKWARD!!!</p>



<p>If anybody feel the same or could help, I will appreciate your input. I was never told about HDMI 2.2, I was only told about 4K and HDR... Lastly I can add that HDMI Arc is also useless and full of crackling, lip syncing related issues while also being limited to DVD quality audio. No use for me.</p>

(DTS Master Audio, Dolby TrueHD, PCM Uncompressed 5.1 and 7.1) Now I have to upgrade my amp to have THE&nbsp;SAME audio, since I do not care for Dolby Atmos or DTX X... Its not worth it actually since I looked long and hard and could not find a difference between the Xbox One S upscaling to 4K and my TV. The only notable difference is that older videos look worse with One S upscaling. So on second though I might not upgrade my amp at all and rather get a 4K Blu-Ray player with two HDMI outputs - one for video and one for audio only (for older amps like mine - see pic below). This way, when it comes to movies and videos at least, I will have 4K picture (native or upscaled) along with full uncompressed or lossless sound. Xbox One S or X for that matter, fails as possible all-in-one media centre for me.</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?

            <p>im also suffering with this issue on a different and more up to date set up&nbsp;using a yamaha CX-a5100 xbox one x and the 2018 samsung Q7F. It all worked fine with my previous 6 year old 42" samsung through my receiver but now i go via the one connect box it doesnt. I went out and bought new cables and it wont work. I also got the tv for the freesync capabilities. So if i go through my receiver first instead of the tv i loose HDR and also the ability for free sync which is shame especially as the receiver is yamaha's very expensive 4K HDR capable&nbsp;flagship model CX-A5100. Im also getting a slight audio lag when going through the one connect (with the xbox one source but no lag with any of the apps built into the tv ie youtube) but if i go straight into the receiver no problems at all but loose most of the features the tv is capable of as i said before. Its all rather frustrating. I have heard there is an update coming for dolby atmos pass through on the tv. </p>
<p>Im wondering if i am missing something cause i cant see a HDMI pass through option on the tv menu, i just see bitstream and dolby digital. Also i noticed that with the xbox one x source it will only allow dolby digital, but with the tv plus app it allows dolby digital plus but just wont allow it with the xbox. So confusing.</p>
<p>Ok further update, i found while playing around with the xbox settings that this weird thing happens and this is while changing nothing with the physical connection set up, i.e. xbox one x&nbsp;into the tvs one connect box on HDMI 1 and the av receiver using HDMI port 4(arc).</p>
<p>Ok so If i turn off auto detect in the display settings of the xbox one, i can then use dolby atmos in the audio settings but then this does not allow the xbox to detect that i have a 4k cappable tv and will only give me&nbsp;1080p resolution... but then when i turn on&nbsp;auto detect i can not get dolby atmos and receive the error code 0x80db0009, but can have all the 4K and VRR capabilities back. I also that having it in HDMI mode will only allow 1080p but this shows my rig is configured correctly and there is an issue with the xbox both for audio sync and the actual functionality it was designed to do.</p>
<p>Anyone else gettig these results? Or found a fix?</p>

<p>I was up to 70% yesterday but now I'm down to 68%.</p>
<p>Does the % go down if you aren't gaining it?&nbsp; Or is it because you are progessing further in the story?</p>
<p>I use both the Mass Effect Datapad and the Infiltrator game aswell.&nbsp; I'm focusing on the Earth systems at the moment and had it to 91% before it went back down to 89%.</p>

<p>If you are referring to Defender, yes once all theatres are at 100%, the achievement will pop up. Unlocks once it gives you the "+xx% Galactic Readiness" slide after the game.</p>

<p>This is one of the most pathetic things I've ever seen. What a cheap ploy by game development company.<br />
<br />
I was up all night trying to get to 100% galactic readiness, got screwed out of what I earned the first time by a ridiculous multiplayer match save glitch WHICH NEEDS TO BE PATCHED, then had to spend another 2 hours just to get back to the 100% I'd rightfully
 earned. I went to bed at 3AM this morning, &amp; now I wake up at 9AM &amp; my galactic readiness has already lost 2% for each region. I lost galactic readiness due to SLEEP.<br />
<br />
I cannot even begin to express the amount of discontent I have for the people who came up with that idea in the first place. I will never buy another game from EA or BioWare ever again because of cheap bullshit like this.</p>

<h2>            Pressing the calculator button on the keyboard opens calc twice.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am using windows 7 32bit ultimate edition, version 6.1, build 7600.<br />
I have a multimedia keyboard with additional dedicated buttons.<br />
One of this buttons is used to open up the windows calculator application.<br />
Under windows vista 32bit ultimate all been well. Now under windows 7, when I press this button, instead of one, there are two calculator windows opens up. There is no such problem under windows vista 32bit ultimate.<br />
Is there a solution or a work around to this problem?<br />
BTW, my keyboard's brand is "Müller".<br />
<br />
I will appreciate any help!

<h2>            Missed Calls on Skype App</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the skype app on android and I have the latest version with all notifications ticked, and skype is left signed in all the time ... I miss frequent calls where the phone does not ring, nor does it tell me I have missed calls ... but if I log in online
 I see a list of missed calls, and even had it listed missed when I actually picked up the call. How do I remedy this?</p>

            If you are signed into Skype on another device, then calls might be going there.
<br />
<br />Try signing out of Skype on any other device and also disable Call Forwarding if you have it setup:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />    Sign in to your account.
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />    In the Manage Features section, select Call forwarding.
<br />    Select the green button to disable call forwarding.

            This could be a newly introduced bug. I am going to ask that you file a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />    From your profile tap Help &amp; Feedback, then tap Give feedback.
<br />    Let us know what you'd like to tell us and tap Send.
<br />
<br />
<br />In Skype on Android (6.0+) and iPhone, you can also enable Shake to send feedback from your profile by tapping Help and Feedback &gt; Shake to send feedback. This will allow you to shake your device at any time in the Skype app to generate a report, including a log file and screenshot of what you are seeing. This is helpful if you see a specific issue and want to share it with us.

<h2>            Windows could not update computer&#39;s boot configuration. Installation cannot proceed</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to upgrade from Windows XP home edition to Vista Home premium, 32 bit. First I have read all the applicable information in the knowledge base and the threads. To make this upgrade successful I have done:&nbsp; I first ran the Vista advisor and it
 says my computer is good to go. I have used the fix-me-link 3 times after failed installations. Then I followed the manual procedures specified in Article ID: 931697 which provides step by step instructions on using regedit.&nbsp; When I got to the value data box
 "PartMgr" was there as it is suppose to be. I clicked OK, closed the registry editor then restarted my computer. I tried to upgrade again and received the same error message.&nbsp;The problem occurs during the expanding process and it stops at about 21%.&nbsp; I've
 run out of options. If I can't get help with the problem, the only thing&nbsp;left is to write&nbsp;Vista off as a bad purchase and forget the idea of upgrading to Vista.&nbsp;</p>

            Have you attempted backing up your files and performing a clean installation of Windows Vista by booting from the Windows Vista installation DVD? Once you have booted from the installation DVD you can select "clean installation" and then format a partition
 of your choice to install Windows to. This should result in the operating system being installed correctly.

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/774fa1ae-019e-4d20-852c-1c958f71bfba" title="hrhoggworth">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;explained in this FAQ: <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I check the status of my Skype order?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong>Refused payment</strong>&nbsp;may mean&nbsp;that most likely the payment was rejected by our payment provider, not by Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can occur for a number of reasons, including:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Insufficient funds</strong> on your card or in your bank account to complete the transaction.</li><li>Using an <strong>anonymous proxy</strong> to access the internet.</li><li>Verified by <strong>Visa/MasterCard SecureCode failure</strong>.</li><li>Purchasing from, or using a credit card issued in, a <strong>restricted country</strong>.</li><li><strong>Other unknown issues </strong>with your credit card details.</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, we suggest you try using another <a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA12323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>It’s also possible that your payment has been refused by Skype because <strong>
you have used the same credit card for more than two different Skype accounts</strong>. If this is the case, you can
<strong>try using another credit card</strong>, <strong>use one of your other Skype accounts,
</strong>or <strong>try a different payment method</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, I am pretty dumb. I tried entering my student ID and student password like I regularly do to get on the internet. I put those in the additional settings area. However, I just "restored factory defaults" and I can now connect. I'm downloading an update
 right now. All is well!</p>

<h2>            Headphone jack problem after upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows7</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem with Windows 10 is kind of a unique one, not asked until now i guess. I own a Dell inspiron 3520 laptop.</p>
<p>After the upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, the headphones jack DO work but give out a relatively POOR quality music with no bass (inspite of using finest quality/branded headphones), whereas the speakers are working just fine as in Windows 7. Such a
 problem with the audio jack didn't exist while using Windows 7. The audio driver from Cirrus Logic is the latest one that is installed (released probably in 2012-13). I even inquired about this problem with Dell Tech Support but there is nothing they can do
 about it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since there is no other issues with any hardware/software yet, I am kind of at loss considering if I should revert back to Windows 7 and see if this works fine again but I dont want to discontinue Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help as I require it for my study &amp;work purposes, and also I am an ardent lover of music.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I had&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;issue.&nbsp;Instead of low quality,&nbsp;the headphone jacket&nbsp;has no sound at all.&nbsp;I think its&nbsp;because windows automatically update drivers which may not work.&nbsp;I solved it. Here is my solution, you can try it:</p>

            Thank you everyone for your help.. I got it fixed by simply uninstalling the current audio driver and then restarting the PC.<br />
The PC reinstalled the preferred driver (in my case Cirrus Logic High Definition Audio) again and the issue was resolved. It seems this method works for both audio and video drivers (especially for ones with dedicated GPUs) when such OS upgrades in general
 are performed.

            <p>Hi ofannafo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>From your description, I understand before the Windows sign in page you get the error message "driver_power_state_failure".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like you to answer few questions to understand the issue well:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you able to sign in to Windows 8?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When did the issue start?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might have happened due to bad driver problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Run Power troubleshooter</b></p>
<p>Follow these steps to run Power troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>windows key+W</b> and type
<b>troubleshooting</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Run <b>Power troubleshooter</b>.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b>Run memory Diagnostic tool.</b></p>
<p>Follow these steps to Run memory Diagnostic tool.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key +W</b> and type
<b>Memory Diagnostic</b>.</p>

</span></span></span>Select <b>Diagnose your computer’s memory problems</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Select Restart now and check for the problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to go to manufacturer’s website and download the updated drivers for your computer. Here is the link for your reference.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.acer.com/us/en/product/default.aspx?modelId=3636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.acer.com/us/en/product/default.aspx?modelId=3636</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to check for the Event Viewer files.</p>
<p>Follow the step to go to event viewer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press Windows key + X and select Event Viewer.</p>
<p>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error.
 Whenever these types of events occur, Windows records the event in an event log that you can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with Windows and other programs.</p>
<p>Event Viewer tracks information in several different logs. Windows Logs include:</p>
<p>•Application (program) events. Events are classified as error, warning, or information, depending on the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem,
 such as loss of data. A warning is an event that isn't necessarily significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information event describes the successful operation of a program, driver, or service.</p>
<p>•Security-related events. These events are called audits and are described as successful or failed depending on the event, such as whether a user trying to log
 on to Windows was successful.</p>
<p>•Setup events. Computers that are configured as domain controllers will have additional logs displayed here.</p>
<p>•System events. System events are logged by Windows and Windows system services, and are classified as error, warning, or information.</p>
<p>•Forwarded events. These events are forwarded to this log by other computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications and Services Logs vary. They include separate logs about the programs that run on your computer, as well as more detailed logs that pertain to specific
 Windows services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> steve fitzpatrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Testing the Surface Pro 3&#39;s Battery Life&#59; I&#39;ve been let down.</h2>
                    <p>--NOTE: Please read thoroughly. I am completely sure that I've provided enough information as for Microsoft Support not to ask questions such as "Did you make sure your device is fully updated?" or "What do you use your device for?"</p>
<p>English is not my native language, so bear with me...--</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a problem since day one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in possession of two devices; the already mentioned Surface Pro 3, and a Toshiba Satellite. The Toshiba has a full charge capacity of 42,000mWh, has Windows 10 installed, use it for heavy tasks, such as graphic design and media editing, and is over
 a year old.</p>
<p>My Surface Pro 3 has approximately the same capacity - 41,400mWh, has Windows 8 installed, use it for light-to-medium tasks, such as creating presentations, sending and receiving SketchUp models, checking my e-mail, drawing, &amp; graphic designs which I send
 over to my other computer, and is three months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've of course read the reviews before buying the Surface Pro 3, and I was at first reluctant to buy it due to issues regarding the battery. That was before I was told firmware updates fixed those issues, so I bought&nbsp;the Intel Core i3 Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to test its battery life after I installed the latest updates. I set a timer for five minutes, with my device fully charged&nbsp;(100%, if I wasn't clear enough)&nbsp;and watched cat videos (yes, I love cats). After five minutes, I saw that the charge went
 from 100% to 93%. Let's throw some math in. If every five minutes, battery discharges by -7%, then battery percentage decreases at a rate of -1.4% every minute. That'd mean that in 60 minutes, battery would decrease by -84%; that is, battery would decrease
 from a full charge (100%) to 16% of remaining battery - again, within only one hour. I can do heavy tasks in my Toshiba, and its battery will last 6 or 7 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft claimed that this device could hold up to 9 or 10 hours of web browsing, or I don't remember. But this device was marketed with having&nbsp;a greater battery life than this! Only one hour from my device, out of eight hours the device was marketed with?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After ranting about my experience, which I'm sure is the exact same as millions of Surface Pro 3 users around the globe, I will proceed to ask: How may I work around this problem?</p>

    <title>Possible to have Movie Maker x64 and x86 versions BOTH installed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Possible to have Movie Maker x64 and x86 versions BOTH installed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>(On x64 Vista, of course.) Is it? Even if it takes some healthy tweaking? I found this download:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d6ba5972-328e-4df7-8f9d-068fc0f80cfc&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=d6ba5972-328e-4df7-8f9d-068fc0f80cfc&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>
<p>But it looks like it would replace the currently installed version, and I don't want that to happen. Also it's not clear if it's x64 or x86, so I'm assuming the installer would detect and match one's OS architecture it (?)--which would be no good.</p>
<p>The reason I want this BTW, is because I want to manipulate a clip made with a video codec (ZMBV), and I have a trustworthy 32-bit codec installer (actually an .INF with a rundll32.exe shortcut and the DLL), but not the 64-bit one. (The clips play in Windows
 Media Player, because the version in x64 Windows is actually a x86 app, but not in Movie Maker which matches the OS architecture.) So in addition, if you know where to find the codec (with confidence that it's not malware), or any other way to get around this
 (besides using the Movie Maker in a 32-bit virtual machine, which is my current workaround and last resort), it would also help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your quick reply, it was helpful. After taking a look though those two solutions look a little like hacks and for now, I'd rather stay with my current workaround via virtualization (as I now say in my first post which I edited a bit), for
 the very little volume I'll work with this codec--it's very clumsy but it's clean. :(</p>
<p>Also the download I linked above, I don't really know if it's 32 or 64-bit. Since those things are systematically mentioned in MS download, I'm going to assume that the installer is going to detect your OS architecture and match it, and there's nothing you
 can do about it--so a different version number wouldn't really help. (??)</p>

<p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For computer and some tablet versions of Skype, Skype users have an option to share screens with anyone on Skype. Here’s a steps on how to share screen on Skype.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Start a voice or video call with a single person or a group.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>During the call, tap or click the
<strong>plus icon</strong> in the call bar, then choose <strong>Share screen</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>If you're using more than one screen, select the screen you want to share.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Use the
<strong>Share your screen</strong> drop-down to choose what to share - either your full screen or a specific window, then choose
<strong>Start</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>Stop sharing</strong> when you're finished.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, sometimes you can encounter problems with screen sharing. Use this FAQ link for more information on Screen sharing:
