    <title>USB device &#40;smartphone&#41; not recognized - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mysticpest  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB device &#40;smartphone&#41; not recognized</h2>
                    I have&nbsp; an HTC Desire HD smartphone, my problem is that Windows 8 does not see it when I plug the device into any (3.0 or 2.0) of my USB ports.&nbsp; It does charge, however.&nbsp; Previous versions of Windows recognize the phone fine.<br />
<br />
HTC has an application called HTC Sync which I have reinstalled (without any anti-virus / firewall software running) that is used to sync files between your system and the phone.&nbsp; The manufacturer had me do this - to no avail.&nbsp; I have run the program in various
 compatibility modes - again no result.&nbsp; The device does not show up in the list of storage devices / drives - basically it's like it doesn't exist.&nbsp; Android has settings on the phone to connect to a PC and I've tried those ("HTC Sync", "Disk Drive", "USB Tether")
 all to no avail.&nbsp; Basically, it's a brick with Window's 8.<br />
<br />
About the only success I had was pairing it via bluetooth, which allowed me to transfer files - albeit VERY slowly.&nbsp; I am basically out of ideas.<br />
<br />
Any help you can offer - much appreciated.&nbsp; So far, not too happy with Windows 8...<br />
<br />

<h2>            Bluetooth stopped working - Windows 7 &#40;64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've used bluetooth with my computer for quite some time without incident. &nbsp;Just recently, it stopped working. &nbsp;Right now if you look in device manager, it shows "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" with an exclamation point next to it. &nbsp;It will pair devices just
 fine, but when you go to the device from the Bluetooth menu, and try to click on "Listen to music" or "Forward VOIP calls", it just spins indefinitely, even if you click cancel. &nbsp;I went back and un-installed updates KB2830477 and KB2923545, just in case, as
 those were about the time it stopped working, but no luck so far. &nbsp;I've rebooted multiple times, un-installed the driver multiple times, deleted and repaired the device. &nbsp;I even went out and bought a new bluetooth headset, just in case it was device specific.
 &nbsp;However, I seem to get the same results no matter what bluetooth device I connect.</p>
<p>I'm happy to gather and submit whatever logs or data necessary to help resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers,</p>
<p>Bryan Graham</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As per the description I understand that suddenly Bluetooth devices on your computer have stopped working. There is an exclamation mark at “Bluetooth peripheral devices” in Device Manager. You tried couple
 of troubleshooting steps like uninstalling recent two updates, uninstalling and reinstalling the Bluetooth drivers etc. but issue remains the same.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>A yellow exclamation point next to a device in Device Manager means that Windows has identified some kind of problem with that device. The yellow
 exclamation mark provides an indication of a device's current status and could mean that there is a

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To remove this conflict remove all devices with exclamation mark and any "Other devices" from Device Manager by highlighting them and pressing the delete key on the keyboard. Once they've all been removed reboot
 the computer and allow Windows to re-detect the devices.</span></p>
<p><span>If after rebooting the computer the Device Manager remains the same Windows is not installing the devices because it lacks the proper driver support. You'll need to manually

            <p>First off I'll go through the methods recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Downloaded the hotfix, but got this message when I tried to run it "The update is not applicable to your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Tried that, windows update can't find a driver for it. &nbsp;The manufacturer doesn't have drivers for their bluetooth devices, because it's supposed to be plug-and-play</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3:</p>
<p>The first and third link don't seem to go anywhere, but I have tried changing my bluetooth settings, and the devices have no problems pairing with the computer, so I'm not sure if those would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Information:</p>
<p>My laptop is:</p>
<p>Alienware M17XR4</p>
<p>Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-3610QM CPU</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit OS Version 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for significant hardware or software changes, last Thursday (2/27/14) a windows update decided that it had a better driver for my video cards (the laptop has 2 cards with configurable graphics), and it totally hosed up my graphics drivers. &nbsp;Now, I consulted
 with a specialist and did some work on my own, and got all the graphics stuff working fine. &nbsp;Most importantly, even after several reboots, bluetooth was still working both Friday (2/28) and Saturday (3/1) all day, without any difficulties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I came to work Monday (3/3) bluetooth wouldn't connect. &nbsp;I went ahead and did "Remove device" from the bluetooth menu and re-paired it, because that's all I've ever had to do if there was ever a problem. &nbsp;That's when I started seeing "Bluetooth
 Peripheral Device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device that I was originally trying to connect to (and connected fine to all day Friday and Saturday), is an LG HBS-730 bluetooth headset. &nbsp;When I had continued difficulty, I went to Best Buy and bought a simple "Jabra Classic" just so that I could rule
 out the device as the cause (despite the fact that the LG still worked fine with my phone and tablet). &nbsp;However, I get the same results with the Jabra that I did with the LG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also mention that I've already tried the method where I download Windows 6.1 Mobile-based device support and change the driver for "Bluetooth Peripheral Device" to Bluetooth Radio -&gt; Microsoft Corporation -&gt; Windows Mobile-based device support instead.
 &nbsp;And sure, that makes the exclamation go away, but when I try to connect to the device to "Listen to Music" or "Forward VOIP calls", it just spins indefinitely without ever connecting to anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only things that changed between it working on Saturday and not working Monday was "Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2923545) and "Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.167.1095.0)"</p>
<p>Now, I've read about the update for the first, and I know it's supposed to only affect RDesktop stuff, so I don't REALLY think it's the cause, but since it was the only real change made, I un-installed it, but, as expected, it doesn't seem to have changed
 anything.</p>

            <p>Alas, due to the aforementioned graphics issue, I was forced to re-install my system on Friday. &nbsp;It didn't actually do a lot for the graphics issue, but it did solve the bluetooth issue. &nbsp;Thus, I can't further diagnose what the original problem was, but
 the it works now.</p>

                    <p>I recently opened my Xbox One up, which is well outside of warranty, in order to clean it.&nbsp; When I removed the ribbon cable for the faceplate a tab broke on the small clip that holds the cable into the socket.&nbsp; Does anyone has any idea where I can find a

    <title>WIA scanner drivers not compatible with Photo Programs in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sagatious  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIA scanner drivers not compatible with Photo Programs in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Running Win 7 Pro 64.</p>
<p>Have legacy camera and scanner and am forced to use "update" for WIA drivers , no TWAIN drivers available from mfg's.</p>
<p>Tried using Serif PhotoPlusX3, would not import from scanner or camera. Had to shut down the program from Task manger.</p>
<p>Installed Corel Draw Graphics Suite X5 it will scan but will not place image on the work space.</p>
<p>Both programs have the same problems.</p>
<p>A dialog box comes up "This action cannot be completed because the "other program" is busy. Choose "switch to" to activate the busy program and correct the problem.</p>
<p>Choosing "switch to" only takes me to my Start list of programs with nothing being indicated which one is the "busy" one.</p>
<p>I am unable to close the dialog box because the "X" doesn't work and the "cancel" button is grayed out. I have to go to task manager to shut down the program.</p>
<p>So is this a correctable problem or bad stuff from Serif and Corel or Microsoft? (wiawow64.exe)</p>
<p>*original title - WIA scanner drivers not compatible with Photo Programs? or Thunking WIA APIS from 32 to 64?*</p>

<p>Any drivers in the Windows Update are minimal functionality drivers supplied by the manufacturer.&nbsp; In many cases they are not actually Windows 7 drivers, but drivers that have been found to be compatible to some extent.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what you think an MS engineer is going to tell you since the drivers in question are not written by MS.</p>

<h2>            I Need Help With The Xfinity App, Please.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to setup the Xfinity app and I keep getting errors and time-outs when I enter my information. Is there another way I can set this thing up? Also, it's probably worth mentioning that the Xfinity website, Xfinitytv.comcast.com, is also not working.
 Has anyone else gotten it to work?</p>

<p>Yeah - Comcast seems to be working on these issues. I was able to get in only by going into the guide and that's after attempting 10 times to sign in with no success, but once I exited, I wasn't able to get back in. I got a server down message, which is
 new to the frustrating process.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's all the same or not if it is then I'll never use it. HBO Go on the other hand has a much larger library than HBO On-Demand offers, however Xfinity doesn't allow their paying customers the option of using HBO Go on XBL. I'm hoping Xfinity
 on XBL offers more than Xfinity On-Demand because if it doesn't what's the point of it and why doesn't Xfinity allow us to use HBO Go on XBL?</p>

<p>You can only get On Demand through Comcast if you have one of their set-top boxes. &nbsp;For those on cable-card solutions, (Tivo, Centon, HDHomerun, etc.), you lose out on any On Demand content. &nbsp;Hope that helps.</p>

<p>It makes sense to use this app if you want to watch on demand in a room that doesn't have a cable box, or has one of the free non digital boxes. That way on demand can be watched in another room, also it can be watched in HD on the xbox if you have the digital
 non-hd box from comcast. (Its a way to watch free hd from comcast as well. </p>

<p>Hi....I did defragmentation yesterday and it didn't finish even after 5hours for 250GB harddisk. I stopped it as I had some work to do. then I found that the free disk space got reduced from 123GB to 108GB!!!
<br />
I deleted all the restore point but the last one and I deleted all the unneccesary things by using disk cleanup but its still there<br />
NB I am using windows vista home premium and its up-to-date.<br />
<br />
Can anybody help me please???</p>

<h2>            Cannot Restart Network Location Awareness service on Local Computer, Error 1051</h2>
                    Hi, all. So my problem is this: when I attempt to restart Network Awareness Service (which sometimes comes up as a solution to fix connectivity issues with Microsoft services such as Microsoft Store through VPN or for other reasons), I get the message
 "Windows could not stop the Network Location Awareness service on local computer" followed by "Error 1051: A stop control has been sent to a service which other running services are dependent on." I have tried all of the solutions here and here.&nbsp; In short:
 stopping the dependent services first does not work, nor does the powershell command. I always receive an error that Windows cannot restart it. My question then, is twofold: a) Why can I not restart this service when so many others seem to have no problem?
 and b) Is there any way for me to be able to restart this service?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!

            HI CR.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Could be a program conflict, corruption of account or WIndows.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag from sticker on PC.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro &#40;Retail&#41; Installation Fails At Beginning Of Stage 2 With Error Code&#58; 0xC0000005</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader2">Problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I attempt to install Windows 8.1 Pro onto my Digitial Storm Slade, the installation makes it through Stage 1: Collecting Information, but then fails shortly after starting Stage 2: Installing Windows, with the following message.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Windows installation encountered an unexpected error.

<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Verify that the installation sources are accessible, and restart the installation.

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thinking that my installation DVD might be corrupt I used the product key to download another copy of the installation .iso file. I burned a new DVD and tried the installation again and received the same results. Next I created an installation USB and again
 received the same results. Since my PC was built as a high-end gaming machine, I downloaded and ran the Upgrade Assistant to ensure that all of my equipment was compatible with Window 8.1 and it passed. ((A few of my older games will not run on Windows 8.1,
 but that's fine.))<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Hardware:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>MB:&nbsp; ASRock Z87 Extreme9</li><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 4930K 3.4GHz overclocked to 4.0GHz</li><li>RAM: 16GB DDR3 1866MHz Corsair Dominator Platinum DHX</li><li>PSU: 1050W Corsair Pro Silver 1050HX</li><li>GPU: EVGA GeForce GTX 780 3GB (x 2)</li><li>OPT: ASUS DRW-24F1ST</li><li>SSD: 480GB Corsair Neutron GTX</li><li>HDD: 1TB Western Digital Caviar Black (x 4)</li><li>OS:&nbsp; Windows 7 Ultimate (Retail), CentOS 6.5, Debian 7, Fedora 20, openSUSE 13.1, and SteamOS 1.0<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I first received my PC the SSD and all four of the HDDs were formatted MBR. I converted them to GPT so that I could create multiple primary partitions for multi-booting. I installed Window 7 to a 120 GB partition on the SSD and the other OSs are installed
 in 20 GB partitions on the fourth HDD, with the exception of SteamOS which has a 500 GB partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my GPT formatted disks have a 100 MB ESP as the first partition (formatted as FAT32), a 128 MB MSR as the second partition (unformatted), and the remainder of the disk is either primary partitions (various formats - e.g. NTFS, ext4, etc.), or free
 space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reserved the first HDD for Windows 8.1 Pro so it is empty except for four partitions created by Windows 8.1 Install: 300 MB Recovery, 100 MB ESP, 128 MB MSR, and the remainder of the drive is a primary partition for Windows 8. I usually clean the
 HDD with DISKPART and convert it to GPT during Stage 1 of the Windows 8.1 installation so that the install program can allocate and format partitions for Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to install Window 8.1, I ensure that the target HDD is marked as bootable in UEFI (BIOS).</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Observations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Install is obsessed with the first HDD. During my earliest attempts, I tried to install it on an HDD that already had partitions used by Windows 7. Regardless of where I tried to install Windows 8.1, it would create a Recovery Partition, an ESP partition,
 and an MSR partition on the first HDD -- even though the first HDD already had both an ESP and MSR partitions. I finally gave up and moved everything off of the first HDD, and reserved it for Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing from a DVD, I can observe the DVD LED flickering during Stage 1, but the LED remains off once Stage 2 begins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point, I removed all of the Linux distributions, leaving only Windows 7 installed, but that did not seem to have any impact on the problem so I have reinstalled all of the Linux distributions again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am not certain how to proceed. I have searched the internet, this community, and Microsoft's Technical web sites, but have not found any similar errors for the 8.1 Pro Install program, nor have I found any information on how to debug such
 a failure. I can find paths to Window 7 Install logs but nothing on Window 8.1 Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />

            <p>Thank you for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only external connections on the PC are the Logitech K120 keyboard, a Microsoft 3-button mouse, a pair of Altec 2.0 speakers and a CAT5 cable for the internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggested, I disconnected the speakers, internet, and mouse, then tried the installation again.</p>
<p>The results were the same. I reconnected the mouse and moved the keyboard and mouse from the rear USB 2.0 ports and plugged them into forward facing USB 3.0 ports and tried again. Same failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a failed installation attempt I tried again, but directed the Windows 8.1 Installer to use the primary partition that it had created on the previous attempt. The program indicated that it might create even more partitions so I canceled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm puzzled as to why Windows 8.1 Pro Installer will not use the Recovery, ESP, MSR, and Primary Partition that it created and formatted on a prior run, I am much more concerned as to why it keeps abending with a 0xC0000005 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that there was an option to load drivers on the partition setup screen so I loaded just about ever driver on the ASRock Driver/Utility DVD and tried the installation yet again. Same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that with all of the abnormal ends that the "Copying Windows files" status message always showed 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all of the failed attempts, I shut down the PC, reconnected the internet, speakers, and plugged the keyboard and mouse back into their customary USB 2.0 ports. Thankfully Windows 7 boots and runs like a champ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know where I might find any logs or error messages produced by the Windows 8.1 Pro Installation program and what program or programs I need to read the logs?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for information on the clean boot, I shall add that to my "tool box" in preparation for when I encounter an issues with an already installed OS. Unfortunately, I have yet to get Window 8.1 Pro to install even once. Windows 7 Ultimate, and several
 'Unix Like' OSs install and run just fine. I just can not get Windows 8.1 to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct that the 'clean boot' will not help me diagnose the 0xC0000005 error that occurs shortly after the Windows 8.1 Pro Installation program starts
<strong>Stage 2: Installing Windows</strong>? Since I am booting off of the Windows 8.1 Pro Installation disk, there are no processes other than Windows processes running during the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any logs that I might review or diagnostic utility programs that I might execute to determine what the Windows 8.1 Pro Installation program was attempting to perform when it failed?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another install process, perhaps used by enterprise customers, that an individual might use in place of the commercial (retail) Windows 8.1 Pro installation process? I am open, to learning something new, if it will allow me to install Windows 8.1
 Pro on to my multi-boot machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I hate to waste the money I spent for the Windows 8.1 Pro software, I am also considering skipping Window 8 and waiting for Windows 9 or whatever the next version of Windows is called.

            This has to be the least helpful series of support messages that I've ever seen. How hard is it to understand that he can't install Windows? He can't boot windows in 'clean boot' mode if it isn't installed, and he can't repair windows if it isn't installed.
 He tried to tell you that nicely, even though it was patently obvious, but then you ignored him again and copy-pasted some worthless unrelated advice. &nbsp;I'm encountering the same problem as the original poster when trying to install the windows 10 tech preview,
 and search results like this are just confirming for me that I should just stick with Linux and not give Microsoft another chance after Windows 8.

<h2>            Lost Partitions and All Files while updating windows.</h2>
                    Today, windows 10 asked me to update, it took around 2 hours for update and when it got completed, it deleted all my partitions and files. I only have C drive now. It protected files of c drive only :)<br />
<br />
Please anyone, tell me is there any way to get my files back? I lost around 750GBs of data. :)<br />
It never asked me for format or delete partitin. I did not even touched once it started. Two of my drives were locked with bitlocker and two were not.<br />
<br />
Please help me :)<br />
<br />
Please reply soon.

            <p>Befor update i had 5 partitions. I knnow there is no chance of deleting partition while updating windows, so i did. I got all files of C drive, it is where it was. Out of 5 partitions, 2 were protected with bitlocker, and othere were not. There was enough
 free space for windows to create temporary files, similarly, it has 8GB RAM.<br />
<br />
It got updated to Windows 10 pro Insider preview, Evaluation copy, build 11082.</p>
<p>But when update got completed, there was only C drive with 150GB (same as before) and all remaining partitions got merged as one (with size of 750GB). When i check in computer management, it shows as free space, with green color. Still, i havent assigned
 any drive letter because i want to get my files back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop model is HP Pavilion PC 15 Notebook with AMD Quad core.<br />
<br />
Please provide me any way to recover my drives. I dont want to use apps like power data recovery :(</p>
<p>It will take around 2 days to scan all, and even after that, i will get corrupted files.</p>
<p>I lost all of my clients datas. :(</p>
<p>Now, windows is giving me this message.<br />

            Lets start when i installed an update this started the were missing network protocols but I fixed it manually so then i have access but after a few minutes it says that the dns address could not be found on every website i go on. I tried troubleshooting
 my connection and adapter but nothing came up wrong. &nbsp;I was only able to download minitools by luck, the connection came back after i tried your method for the 3rd time. When i finished your instructions only google chrome started to work but opera (my main)
 didn't leading me to believe it was a problem with opera but then google chrome &nbsp;came with the same message as oprea dns address not found. In addition ipconfig refused to work leaving me unable to complete your method presumably

    <title>Voicemail gone &#61; Skype no longer usable for businesses - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Voicemail gone &#61; Skype no longer usable for businesses</h2>
                    <p>I have used two skype accounts (and have for probably 10 years now) to run my businesses. &nbsp;Suddenly, you remove the voicemail greeting feature and I only find out because I suddenly had a strange decrease in voicemails and one of my customers commented on
 the new generic message. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Now, everyone who calls me after hours or when I'm on another call thinks I'm out of business!</strong> &nbsp;No wonder they're not leaving messages!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely unacceptable! &nbsp;Please add this feature back or I, and probably many other people, are going to have to find another phone service.</p>

            Well this 10+ year customer is already looking for new phone providers. &nbsp;I am totally shocked that such a significant and deal breaking change could be made to an integral feature without warning. &nbsp;It's truly shameful.

<p>I've used Skype for my business for about three years now. This voicemail change is an absolute deal-breaker for business use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless I get some indication that this situation will be fixed VERY soon, I'll have to change phone providers (after having paid to use Skype).</p>

<p>This is a total joke. &nbsp;First you trash voicemail messages. &nbsp;Second, you "upgrade" the phone app to this new goofball version that seems to be designed more for teenagers to think it's cute than for professionals to make use of it. &nbsp;Then, today I get another
 "upgrade" to my desktop software and now listening to a voicemail makes me log in to a website every single time I hit play? &nbsp;I can't listen to a voicemail in the application now? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is apparently desperate to get rid of all of their long term customers here.</p>

            I also am&nbsp;astonished by the dropping of the voicemail greeting facility. I use my Skype online number for business calls and it is fundamental that I am able to customise voicemail. It is particularly important if I go on holiday so that callers will understand
 that I won't be able to contact them for some days. This is a very bad and inexcusable move and needs to be sorted out soon. Meanwhile I will be investigating alternatives.

<p>This feature is a deal-breaker. I've been a paid Skype Number account-holder for almost ten years and this is the most vital feature for my business. Bring it back, please. Now that Skype has imposed this on its users, I've started looking for alternatives
 so I can cancel this account as soon as I can.</p>

<p>I thought I'd post an update since people still seem to be following my old post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been many complaints about this in other threads.&nbsp; Many others said they had switched to Voiply as an alternative.&nbsp; I did this last summer and have been pleased with it.&nbsp; They give you a free desktop phone per line, you can still get calls through
 a phone app, and the price is reasonable (though nothing is as cheap as Skype was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would imagine that by now, most of the business customers who previously used Skype have moved on to other services.&nbsp; I canceled all of my Skype subscriptions and was able to port both of my business phone numbers from Skype to Voiply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand the reason, but I think it was Microsoft's intent to get rid of the business users.&nbsp; I see no other logic behind their decision process here other than to get rid of customers they didn't want.&nbsp; This is further supported by the fact that
 the mobile app "updates" over the past year have made it progressively worse... less professional and more cheesy as if they're trying to shift their target audience to a younger, purely recreational use crowd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Skype still has some value for video conferencing, but&nbsp;it is no longer viable as a phone line.&nbsp; You should move on if you haven't already.</p>

            I totally agree. I ported my business Skype number to Jive. Skype is still good for video conferencing, but not much else. Every recent update has made the program worse in a number of ways.

<p>I have this same problem. But let me tell you that actually since I wanted to have the update as soon as possible I downloaded the MediaCreationToolx64 file in order to force the download since the "get windows 10" icon only said that in a few weeks I should
 have my copy ready but wasn´t progressing anything. So I tried to "force it" and that didn´t work. I didn´t create a DVD with that tool or a USB installation drive, I just used the "upgrade this computer" option, and then chosed to "keep all my files and programs"
 and actually I did that two times and it failed. And then Windows 7 was restored. I have an original activated copy of Home premium (in case it matters)</p>
and it was only today that I noticed that Windows update was downloading a large file (and I thought that maybe it was the Windows 10 upgrade and I was right) but then that failed too.

            <p>can I use the .iso file to install Windows10? I have tried with the "get windows 10 app" but it gave error and restored to Windows 7 2 times, and then used the option of waiting until Windows update confirmed that a big update was being downloaded, and then
 it couldn´t finish again. The error this time was code named: </p>
<p>C1900101-4001E</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don´t have DVDs to burn the .iso file to them now, but I have internal and external Hard Drive space. I also have some USB Flash drives, but I want to know if i could just load the .iso file to a software like Daemon Tools and run the installation from
 there from the internal or external hard drive.</p>
<p>or if it works or not with the flash drive</p>

<h2>            Simplified Chinese IME by pinyin</h2>
                    I have 2 "simplified" Chinese pinyin IMEs working on my Windows 7 laptop.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the fonts are not complete, and most of the menu options that come up in pinyin are TRADITIONAL! Sometimes it's possible after scrolling through dozens of options
 to find the simplified character I want, but it's very time-consuming and not reliable. Is there a way to install an IME that is ONLY simplified?

            The problem was just my failure to find the resources. I finally went to the language help screen, and found under Customize (why Customize? It should be much more basic!) and then Advanced (likewise!) found character set. Finally! So, I'm instructed to
 go to the property sheet (why is that in blue? I click on that, and then nothing. I finally try in desperation to go to where I originally installed my language inputs,went to Chinese, and then Advanced again. BINGO! I must say, you don't make it easy. But
 at least I finally got what I wanted, and could select between traditional, simplified, and extended.&nbsp;

https://www.gog.com/forum/general/dosbox_keyboard_input_in_windows_10</a> and another similar post, which led to this page on DosBox
<a href="http://www.dosbox.com/DOSBoxManual.html#BackslashWin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dosbox.com/DOSBoxManual.html#BackslashWin</a> which has three keyboard fixes that were claimed to have helped. I guess you would need to enter any commands in the DosBox configuration files so they are read and activated on when you open DosBox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also see Sections 7 and 8 ( Keyboard Mapper and Layout ).</p>

<p>Hey there DeNcH,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues updating your game.<br />
<br />
That page you linked is for system updates to the console itself, not software updates for individual titles.<br />
<br />
Since I'm not sure which 3 steps you tried from that page, here are the steps that I would recommend:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/downloadable-content/uninstall-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall the game</a> from your console
</li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Power cycle your console</a>
</li><li>Check your Network connection </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/games/install-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reinstall the game</a>&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know how those steps work for you and we'll go from there.</p>

<p>Hey Mister Fizzle... thanks for you reply.. I uninstalled fifa 14 and then power cycled my xbox one. I've got a wired connection and when I tested connection it it said everything is good. My connection has always been really good. I then installed fifa
 14 again. But for some reason it still says there was a problem with the update.. I've been playing on the 360 lately because I simply love fifa 14 and cant get enough of it... I dont know what else to do... I've got 3 year warranty on the xbox one. &nbsp;But there
 out of stock until after christmas. Thank you anyway Mister Fizzle for taking your time to reply. Much appreciated mate.</p>

</p><p>I found a version in C:\Windows\SysWOW64 on by 64 bit system, and it has the size 6,376,960 bytes</p>
<p>Which you indicate is the 32 bit version. Thanks, that info was most useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try and run it on my 32 bit Windows 7, it pops up the message:</p>
<p>"Unable to create new document"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a download for something that called itself "mspaint" - and it checked out OK in a virus scan</p>
<p>This did work. I suspect it's a real old version maybe for XP or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks again. If you know why it might be "Unable to create new document" that would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>David.</p>

<p>There is at least one and probably more dll files that need to be used by mspaint.exe.&nbsp; Whatever caused your file to go missing probably messed with other things as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why it's probably a reasonable idea to use sfc /scannow -- it won't hurt and might even help.</p>

<p>I confirmed that sfc&nbsp; /scannow will replace a missing mspaint.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I attempt to launch 64-but mspaint.exe on a 32-bit system I see:</p>

<p>
</p><p>What do you see on the version you downloaded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think that the 32-bit version of mspaint is the same for all 32-bit versions of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you tell us the edition (Home, Pro, etc.) of your 32-bit Windows 7 installation I can extract the mspaint.exe from the installation CD and put it on my OneDrive where you can download it.</p>

<h2>            my account &#38;quot&#59;a Potadoe&#38;quot&#59; banned unrightfully</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I've done a few other posts and none have actually helped me, i just want this to be answered. At first i asked why my account is banned and how can i get it unbanned, because i cant access my email. I was told why i was banned. And i replyied by
 saying this: "&nbsp;<span>What happened was i was searching online on mw2 and a game on rust (the best map BY FAR) came up, but my game disconnected before it started, so i joined someone session, and someone was hacking. I was automatically ranked up to the top
 prestigue and level 70. In no way at all would i ever WANT HACKS. what you said about the player's hard work being deminished, is true, I HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE HACK. I dont want them! In fact, can you please put me back to level one on that game? Its a really
 good game, and i dont want some guy who thinks hes all it to get everyone up levels. I dont hack, i hate it, please can you unban me, i haven't done any of the things you said, and the one thing i do, i did it on accident." This is what happened. When people
 hack you up it makes your game worthless, theres now no point me even playing it. Please unban me, i haven't done anything wrong, i really dont like hackers, so i just want my levels to be put back to lvl 1, and for me to be unbanned.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>So what&#39;s the catch with Xbox Ultimate Game Pass&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aragonbattlebone  say:</h3>
<h2>            So what&#39;s the catch with Xbox Ultimate Game Pass&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So what is the catch with it?</p>
<p>I purchased it on accident. But now I'm kinda regretting it... I don't put my credit card on microsoft. So I can't "subscribe." in the way most people do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I buy the 12 month Gold membership cards from the only place in 30 miles of where I live to get xbox gold... and that's just for the free games every month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never really liked Xbox Game Pass cause it was temporally and very expensive. and plus MS could take out games as they wished. whenever they wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So wasn't a good deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I'm worried that if I want to continue my gold membership I'm gonna have to buy the Incredible more expensive option of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate... Which would really suck. At that point I would probably switch over to PS4 or Nintendo... that's one
 of the main reasons I stay away from MMOs is cause of the ridiculous fees that can stack up over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a shame to watch all the money I poured into xbox go to waste. since most of my games are digital.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the end I would lose more money in 10 years of XGPU then just switching over to the superior PS4. or start a whole new brand with Nintendo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But for my question. What Is The Catch? MS wouldn't do something like this out of the goodness of there heart. The big red flag for me was when I looked to see when I needed to renew my subscription to xbox gold. it said it was cancelled. and XGPU was now
 there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems awfully shady. I think what's gonna happen is that MS combines the two. makes it super cheap. and offer a long term plan. I.e. converting your gold plan to their new plan. Then after your time is up. they charge 20/40/60 bucks a month. with no
 yearlong plan. and you have to put in a credit card....</p>
<p>
</p><p>And since they no longer have any gold/gamepass any games you have gotten for free you will have to repurchase. any fun games you got with gamepass you'll have to purchase yourself without a discount. And NO mulitplayer either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They will probably implement some other stuff that only god would know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question again. "What Is The Catch?"</p>

            If you bought the $1 promotion, anything you already had on your account was upgraded to Ultimate. So yes, if you cancel, you will lose the gold you had since it's now an Ultimate subscription. You can turn off auto-renewal and once your current subscription
 ends, you can just purchase a regular gold subscription instead of Ultimate.&nbsp;

<p>The offer is straight up dude without so much drama. You get xbox live membership and game pass membership in the same price&nbsp;<span>14.99 a month.
</span><span>Currently, there's a promotion that'll get you </span>Game Pass<span>for PC for only $4.99 for your first month, or you can try out
</span>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate<span> </span><span>for the super low </span>price<span>of $1 for the first month.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Give it a try if you don't like it you can always cancel.&nbsp;</span></p>

            The Gamepass Ultimate is a way of combining both services into one (xbox live and gamepass). Plus it extends to PC!&nbsp; You can do the promo they have now and see if you like it, if not you can go back to just buying one or the other. &nbsp;

You can cancel Game Pass Ultimate membership at any time: Sign in at&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/services</a>.
 Under Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, select&nbsp;<strong>Payment &amp; Billing</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Cancel</strong>.
 You’ll have an option to end your subscription on its expiration date. Depending on your subscription’s status, you may also have an option to end it immediately with a refund of the price you paid for Ultimate only. Please note, the upgrade of any prepaid
 time cannot be reverted to Xbox Live Gold or other Xbox Game Pass plans and is not eligible for refund.</p>

<p>Lol there is no catch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one hand...you can stick with just buying gold and not worry about game pass at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand you can buy gamepass as well and have access to 100+ games, you wont own them so if removed which is announced beforehand, you can&nbsp; buy at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or a 3rd option now is to buy ultimate which combines both the above, for a cheaper combined rate AND they throw in gamepass for pc so if you want you can continue to game away on the pc plus theres different games as well on the PC pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and as you mentioned with that 1st deal it converted all your gold into ultimate...poss a 3yr deal for a pound !!!!! Amazing</p>

            There definitely isn't a catch. Unlike Nintendo and Sony, the Ultimate Game Pass also provides access to Game Pass for PC, which is a pretty unique thing. Also, we are definitely moving more towards a streaming type games service and Xbox is already a
 leader in it. The PS4 might be superior technically to the old Xbox One but it has nothing on the X. But it's your choice, man. You have a lot of months there to use and see if you like it.&nbsp;

            There is no catch here, I looked into it myself when determining whether it was the best deal for me and I found that combining the two bills into one made it so much easier for me to keep track of and I actually lost nothing in terms of Live or Gamepass
 by using it.

            You can subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and deactivate the recurring renewal. This does not dissuade the subscription but continues until the expiration date.

            There is no catch thus far but keep in mind you don't have to get gamepass ultimate that is a convenient and less expensive way to have both live gold and gamepass. If you do not want gamepass ultimate and still only have live gold keep on using that it
 is not going away but if you have live gold and gamepass it may auto upgrade and convert yourml prepaid subscriptions to it if you have both. You can have just your live gold and if you do not want that and only want game pass without live&nbsp; gold you can do
 that too provided you have one or the other not both at once.

<p>Honestly the catch in my opinion is to get more people on the xbox ecosystem.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's a great value and a great way to get first party games.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yes they have the ability to remove games as they wish, but Netflix does the same things with movies and TV shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really like the game you can purchase it at a discounted rate before it leaves the service.&nbsp; You can't do that with TV shows or movies on netflix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall I think it's a great value and worth the price of admission.&nbsp;</p>
