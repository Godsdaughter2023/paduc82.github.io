    <title>Elevating&#47;Accquiring the Admin Token in Administrator vs Standard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Elevating&#47;Accquiring the Admin Token in Administrator vs Standard Accounts in Windows</h2>
                    <p>I've recently been confused by how UAC works between Standard accounts and Administrator accounts,<br />
<br />
As we all know, when UAC is turned on, UAC allows Standard Accounts or Administrator accounts in Admin Approval Mode to gain access to the administrator token in order to perform tasks that require administrative access to the machine - allowing us to switch
 tokens without switching users,<br />
<br />
However, it appears that switching tokens is not really what happens: A while ago, I ran an application that would modify the shell (explorer.exe). I ran the program in a Standard Account, but it needed elevated access: therefore, I used UAC to supply admin
 credentials so it could complete. I did not seen any change to the shell; I then logged into the administrator account whose credentials I used and I saw that the shell in that account had been changed, which was obviously not what I wanted<br />
<br />
It appeared to me that UAC was just basically a "Run-as user" type deal where it actually ran the program as that user. This meant that I wasn't just running it elevated: I was literally running the program as that user,<br />
<br />
My question is: is it possible for a standard account to use the administrator token but actually run the program as a standard user and use the current user's profile? Otherwise, it seems to me that if you need to do any administrator tasks, you are pretty
 much required to log in to an administrator account which defeats the whole purpose of UAC - since UAC runs a program as the administrator, rather than using just the administrator rights,<br />
<br />
Is this separation of token and profile possible? Or do all users just have to be administrators in that case? It seems to me this would account for many organizations just granting full administrator access to all users,<br />
<br />
Can someone please shed some light on this?<br />
<br />
I would like to know if it would have been possible to supply an administrator token to the said program, but run that program in the current user account, not the user account of the administrator whose credentials were supplied - in other words, would it
 have been possible to modify the shell in the Standard account with that program? The goal would be to launch the process as the logged in user (regardless of current privileges) with administrative rights, not as a process under an account with admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not referring to Admin Approval Mode or how UAC works. I already know that if UAC is set to a secure setting, even Administrators will be prompted and unless it is turned off, administrators use the standard token by default. I am talking about when
 the administrator token is gained, is it possible to still run the process as the logged in user, just with the admin token? (not using Run As 'user' but maybe something like run as/with 'token'), etc... In this way, it would be using generic administrative
 privileges rather than one user's administrative privileges.<br />
<br />
Is this at all possible, or have I just pointed out a feature not in Windows by design or something?<br />
<br />
Would I, to achieve the goal described here, have to perhaps turn the standard account into an administrator account any time anything that requires elevation needs to be done, and then turn it back into a standard account when done? Based on comments, it appears
 that this is not possible and that seems to be a flaw in the OS because it makes UAC basically useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this makes sense,</p>

<p>I noticed previous failure to install windows update:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">KB4056887
</span></p>
<p>I run windows update to check for updates and after awhile got the status:" your device is up to date : last checked 12.1.2018" I run it on 16.1.18</p>
<p>tried restarting and still have the issue with blue screen for 12 hours until it comes up to desktop, this is crazy....</p>

<p>Yes - it is connected to Internet</p>
<p>Yesterday after 12 hours wait the PC got back to the desktop after reading some of the old threads around this issue here and I tried following:</p>
<p>disconnected network cable from pc, disabled wifi, verified no network available, I then selected from start menu:
<strong>SHUT DOWN</strong> (not restart)</p>
<p>then disconnected power cable and other usb devices and pressed the power button 30 sec, waited 2 min and then reconnected power cable and pressed power button---&gt; the desktop came up immidiately&nbsp;</p>
<p>now, I repeated all same steps except that I selected from start menu : <strong>
RESTART</strong> (no connection to network) ---&gt; the blue screen with " windows getting ready" message&nbsp; was back to another 12 hours&nbsp; :(</p>
<p>What now???</p>

In this case, we suggest performing a System Restore to get your computer back to its previous state. To do so, you may check

<h2>            HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-T40N ATA Device is working as a CD drive. It is supposed to be a DVD Drive&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
First of all I would like to thank you in advance for your help.<br />
<br />
I had the problem of my HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GSA-T40N ATA Device not reading anything in the drive and removed the filters. It still did not work properly and it was a rare occasion when it did (after hitting it enough lol) and I needed it to work again. I disabled
 the device and restarted before reenabling it. Although it now works it has unfortunately backfired. It is now installed only as a CD-Drive and it used to be a DVD-Drive. Before it stopped working it played DVDs 100% fine so therefore it should be fine.<br />
<br />
Here is some info about my laptop:<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You could have drive issue as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and CD and DVD read).<br />
So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others do so properly.
<br />

Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope these help and Happy Holidays!<br />

<h2>            Earphones&#47;Speakers not recognized when plugged on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys, this has been posted before because I browsed a lot before finally deciding to make my own question. I am using an ASUS laptop, Windows 10 and Realtek HD Audio Manager is what was installed by default. What I've gotten from other threads is to
 update the drivers (done so), others have some editing of files and commands that I don't really feel like's going to do anything for me besides creating more future errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong><em>Game, video and sound controllers</em></strong> I have <strong>
<em>Nvidia Virtual Audio Device (Wave Extensible)(WDM)</em></strong> and <strong>
<em>Realtek High Definition Audio</em></strong>. Both updated, the Realtek one I've tried two ways, I've updated to the latest drive and after realizing it didn't work, I followed a video on youtube that adviced to install from computer device controllers and
 picking the <em>Audio High definiton device</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In <em><strong>Audio inputs &amp; outputs</strong></em> I've got <strong>Speakers (Device of High Definition Audio)</strong> and
<strong>Microphone&nbsp;(Device of High Definition Audio)</strong>, both have also been updated to their latest version. Inside
<strong><em>Realtek HD Audio Mananger</em></strong> I've enabled the option to show a pop-up after recognizing a new input like most fixes have shown and it changed nothing either as it has always been on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all of that and nothing has worked so far.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had mentioned, I tried all of those steps listed in the link you've sent me and none worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Windows Update, I've been updating Windows regularly but this time, when you adviced me to I've come across this very quick update, which is always the same, no matter how many times I check for updates which goes by the name of&nbsp;"Microsoft Visual
 C++ 2012 Update 4 Redistributable Package (KB3119142)". In an hour I've managed to get this same update everytime I checked for updates and it takes like 5 seconds to update, but it never does update since it's always downloading the same thing, am I right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'll keep trying to do repeat steps with as many variants as possible, I think I'm reaching a point that rubbing a few sticks and stones and throwing them on my keyboard will help fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to seem annoyed or rude to you, you're being as helpful as you can, it's just that my whole activity in my laptop is GREATLY music related, be it listening or producing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you for your time and I hope that either I fix this in the meantime or you give me an answer that's going to definitely fix.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I really hit the jackpot on Windows 10. Earphones are not recognized, toolbar keeps freezing/blocking and i have to terminate and initiate explorer.exe again, now this Microsoft Visual C++ thing... The best part is that I have tried to fix all these errors
 using only Microsoft support and nothing gets fixed, at all.</p>

    <title>CO-OP ERROR MESSAGES WITH HALO&#58; CE, HALO 3, AND HALO 4. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h33zayy  say:</h3>
<h2>            CO-OP ERROR MESSAGES WITH HALO&#58; CE, HALO 3, AND HALO 4.</h2>
                    <p><span>I want to apologize a head of time for this extremely long and detailed some of you are about to read.&nbsp; Prior to this conversation, I have spoken to 2 other chat agents, and also requested a refund form as I was instructed to by the previous
 agent name Jann A.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The backstory( and I will try to sum it up as much as possible} is in the last 2-3 weeks I purchased Halo CE, Halo 3, and&nbsp; Halo 4.&nbsp; They being BC, I was also able to play them with a friend on the Xbox one ( the original release one) I have
 a Xbox 360 currently.&nbsp; Halo CE was refunded to me via chat agent because I informed him that I accidentally purchase the wrong Halo CE game ( my XB1 friend only had the MCC and that unfortunately not BC.&nbsp; I informed him of this, stating that I own bought this
 games again solely to play online co-op.&nbsp; I have previously beaten and owned almost all of the Halo's, but they were purchased on an account from 2009 that I no longer have access to.&nbsp; I love the Halo Franchise, and was excited to finally play it co-op because
 obviously co-op is better with halo ( in my opinion) He informed me that he was unable to do this, as I had a refund back in January of 2017 for a similar issue.&nbsp; He did not proceed to tell me the game, as I was confused as to what it could be.&nbsp; I didn't doubt
 him regardless, but ask how does that play into this?&nbsp; Apparently if you use the "accidentally purchase a wrong game" you can only use that reason once.&nbsp; Forever.&nbsp; I pitched a fit, stating I was literally just buying another halo game, and that he could credit
 my Microsoft account so he knows I will buy another game.&nbsp; After much headache and waiting 10 minutes, he informed me that he in fact could do that refund for me today.&nbsp; He stated he could only do it on the card that it was purchased from. I was like fine,
 whatever, that's totally better than not getting it at all.&nbsp; Instead he just ended up adding it to my Microsoft account.&nbsp; So cool, I can buy Halo 3 finally.&nbsp; Little did I know, two days later my friend actually buys Halo: CE.&nbsp; So that worked out nicely.&nbsp; We
 started playing, and as soon as the beginning of 85% of the missions (regardless of alpha&nbsp; rally points A and B) it would freeze and kick out as and give an error message "<strong>You have an error occurred while playing co-op campaign. Please try again later</strong>).
 So we're thinking maybe somehow it's our connection, me being host, etc.&nbsp; We reset our modem/routers. We re-downloaded our profiles, and also redownloaded the games just in case.&nbsp; Then he went to host (because he was on XB1 so maybe that would somehow may
 a difference).&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; Same issues.&nbsp; Same missions.&nbsp; I think we were able to almost successfully finish the floodgate mission up until the last 10 minutes.&nbsp; Very frustrating.&nbsp; So we give it a day, and downloaded Halo 4.&nbsp; We were hoping out that maybe, just
 maybe, since it's the somewhat new Halo (besides Halo 5} maybe it wouldn't be a as bad.&nbsp; Maybe the servers are fixed and MAYBE the BC issue wouldn't arise in this.&nbsp; Who was I kidding.&nbsp; First three missions it did it again with an error "<strong>You lost connection
 to the other players in the game.&nbsp; Please try again later</strong>"&nbsp; So we're thinking obviously this is just a coincidence with the Halo franchise.&nbsp; We tried Left 4 Dead 2, Black Ops 2, etc.&nbsp; Those game did not and never have given us the same issue.&nbsp; I report
 back to Microsoft chat agent again. ( Mind you the last agent Jann A. informed me that we cold do a refund for the inconvenience, to just feel out a refund request and explain what happened).&nbsp; I received and email stating "We regret to inform you but this
 claim has been denied}. Totally, totally understand if I was some skeevy person and tried to get a refund for games I've played for months and was just like "meh, lemme get some of my money back" But this wasn't the case considering I've been with Xbox for
 over 11+ years.&nbsp; Bought 40+, countless of live subscriptions, etc.&nbsp; I know a LOT of you have probably been in the same boat as me, as&nbsp; I read all of the time online on different forums that people are having the same issue.&nbsp; The second chat agent stated "it's
 a developer issue and they are aware it's an in-game issue"&nbsp; That would be all fine and dandy if they actually announced they acknowledge it and were working towards a solution that we can know about it.&nbsp; Tonight's chat agent basically told me the same.&nbsp; That
 she cannot refund me because it's a policy issue, and that I would have to put in ANOTHER request form explaining my situation ( even though I did just that) So I apologize for all of this extremely long ranting, but does ANYONE have any idea of what's going
 on? Or if this can somehow be fixed through us gamers?&nbsp; I love Halo; one of my favorite franchises, but this is definitely turning me off of it solely because Microsoft won't take any responsibility nor will they offer solutions.&nbsp; I was a smart ass at the
 end and informed them that I would totally not mind if they sent me a new Xbox S/X for the inconvenience.&nbsp; She shot that right down lol.&nbsp; Thank you for reading and I appreciate at your feedback.</span></p>

<p>From my research, the Xbox One Master Chief Collection is not backwards compatible with the xbox 360/original xbox version of the games, you must both have the Master Chief Collection and have an Xbox One to play CoOp online or locally.</p>

<p>Ok I understand now. That makes more sense. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would make sure that each of you has open NAT on your console in Settings &gt; Network and if not, to troubleshoot that with the following pages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox One: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox 360: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/nat-error-solution</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For further help I would make sure that you are both on a wired connection so that wireless signal strength does not cause issues and if that still doesn't fix the issue, the issue may be with the game. I assume you have tried switching hosts from you to
 the other person to see if that helps.</p>

            <p>Which game or games are you wanting to play using your Intel HD4400 integrated graphics ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Intel HD4400 graphics is a decent performer as far as integrated graphics goes, but
</p>
<p>updating a graphics driver does not make your graphics processor more suitable for newer games.</p>
<p>Newer drivers sometimes fix issues with a new release game, but if the processor does not meet the
</p>
<p>system requirements of the game there is nothing you can do.</p>
<p>- Nvidia and AMD drivers are suitable only for their respective graphics processors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to install an Intel driver manually rather than allow Win10 to select and install the driver via</p>
<p>Windows updates, the best driver for your Intel HD4400 would be the one offered by HP.
</p>
<p>The driver offered by Intel may suit, but is not optimised for HP system. </p>
<p>You can try the driver from the Intel site, but if you have issues go back to whatever HP has to offer on their site,</p>
<p>or allow Windows update to reinstall it's choice.</p>
<p>(Allowing Windows to install drivers does not extend to dedicated Nvidia or AMD cards though.</p>
<p>With these it is still best to manually install the driver of your choice.)</p>
<p><br />
- I have Intel HD4000 as well as Nvidia graphics, and the current Intel graphics driver ( 10.18.10.4276)&nbsp;</p>
<p>works as well as previous drivers. I'm actually not sure if Win10 reinstalled my Intel HD graphics driver</p>
<p>after I did the 1511 update (because msinfo32 and Device manager use a different numbering system to</p>
<p>the version number on a driver download), but was using a rather old driver from AsRock (my motherboard mfg)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>on Win7 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel graphics do not get updated as frequently as Nvidia or AMD, and they don't need to because the</p>
<p>processor does not have as many functions (high end visual effects such as ambient occlusion)
</p>
<p>as Nvidia or AMD dedicated&nbsp; graphics processors .</p>
<p>Nvidia and AMD also release a new series graphics card far more frequently, and new series processors are</p>
<p>more likely to need 'tweaks' in the drivers than an older series processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: - If you want to prevent Win10 from updating drivers use the tool below.
</p>
<p>I believe (form memory) it is best to go offline after uninstalling the current driver. Reboot.</p>
<p>Reinstall the driver of your choice before going back on line.&nbsp; Then run the tool to prevent future Intel HD updates&nbsp; -</p>

                    <p>I saw this article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2981681/event-id-10317-is-logged-when-you-turn-on-a-mobile-broadband-device-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2981681/event-id-10317-is-logged-when-you-turn-on-a-mobile-broadband-device-or</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However it does not apply to my situation as my situation relates to a wireless LAN that connects to a wired LAN and is not connecting to mobile broadband connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The content of the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Miniport Qualcomm QCA61x4A 802.11ac Wireless Adapter, {ef1507ea-0a55-4ee0-baae-35605d74c10f}, had event Fatal error: The miniport has detected an internal error</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Dell Laptop. Using their Support Assist tool to detect driver updates this is what was recommended:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4798914-eaa6-4876-b19f-82928ac400a2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4798914-eaa6-4876-b19f-82928ac400a2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once these drivers and the BIOS was updated the issue still occurred. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally I ran the report found in this article:</p>

<p>
</p><p>The report said, "No WLAN events were found on this system."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where to go. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The error that you're getting may be related to compatibility issues after installing updates. Try to remove the installed updates and if you're still getting the same problem, we recommend contacting the manufacturer of your device for further assistance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for other Windows concerns.

<h2>            Mouse changes volume and does not scroll</h2>
                    <p>I have the iBUYPOWER mouse that comes with their computers.</p>
<p>I would approximate that every 2 minutes, this mouse changes the volume, and then the next 2 minutes, it actually scrolls.</p>
<p>This has been a problem since I got it about a week ago.</p>
<p>I have tried holding the DPI button for 3 seconds, but again, after 2 minutes it goes back to changing the volume.</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting and have ran a virus detector, which showed no viruses. I have unplugged it from the computer and uninstalled the software in the device management place. And no, I cannot remove the batteries, it is a wired mouse.</p>
<p>Thank you for you time and help.</p>

<h2>            How do i stop icons from flashing on the taskbar&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So i installed window 7 ultimate the other day and whenever I have multiple windows open icons start flashing for no appearant reason. Is there a setting somewhere to turn off icon flashing? if not is there a registry fix?.I found info on another forum that
 was able to change the number of flashes from the registry. I tried deleting the registry that contained the number of flashes but that didn't help? Can you people help me out here?</p>
I guess i need to clarify my post. let me explain what i am talking about. when i am working on something like right now while in this forum in firefox i have windows media player open behind it and yahoo messenger behind that and my music folder open also.
 I have three lit up program icons (media player.yahoo,and my music folder) in my task bar for no reason. I want to disable the flashing if possible. that is what i am trying to do. I don't think that the best solution is just to try not to keep the window
 for that applications or applications open. the flashing icons are annoying and obtrusive. none of these programs or folders need attention just because i switch to a different window.. it's rediculous.

            I know it can be turned off somehow, like you said It is a feature of windows. It isn't a core system service or something that is needed for windows to function properly. Don't worry though there is some third party software that can do the job. I just
 didn't want to have to go that route. I am using tuneup utilities 2010 and I havent had a flash since.

I'll wager you have an HP printer since there is an HP PML driver that produces this nuissance effect. It is only a nuissance, and you should still be able to make your msconfig changes, and they should stick. However, if it's really bugging you, you may want

<h2>            RIP Skype</h2>
                    I have been reading all of the complaints regarding the new skype and have come to the following conclusions<br />
1.Microsoft has essentially abandoned a working program and they are not going to bring the program back to anything even closely resembling it.<br />
2.The moderators not only do they not answer questions properly they put off and make absurd suggestions ,excuses etc...<br />
3.They know the majority of people will give up and give into the new program so they just have to wait it out<br />
4.Very few updates will be forthcoming<br />
5.I recommend everybody who has money on Skype credit to get your money back&nbsp; for the quality and functionality has fallen from grace and most assuredly not what anyone in their right mind would pay for....<br />
6.Please start a thread to see if Microsoft is willing to refund your money due to no longer offering what we all payed for but no longer get....<br />
<br />
7.If they do not refund your money a class action suit will be necessary and recovery will be relatively easy as there are laws against this and I am sure an attorney would gladly to this on a contingency basis<br />
<br />
8.Stop wasting your time talking with the moderators its will go nowhere!

<p>Jess,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you've read "all" of the complaints, I hope you feel better. Usually, it only serves to cause more anxiety. Please remember:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact of life -</p>
<p>When someone gives you something, it makes you happy.</p>
<p>When they take it away, it makes you sad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be said of Skype Classic if you can't seem to get over the 'newness' of the Skype 8 application.&nbsp; That is a collective 'you' that refers to all of 'us'.&nbsp; Although I am not a moderator, I know the project is a huge undertaking (from a software specialist's
 standpoint).&nbsp; Anything new is born, needs to grow and mature and finally becomes (hopefully) mature and (fully?) developed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Case in point:&nbsp; Windows XP, Windows Vista (gulp) and now Windows 10.&nbsp; It was a long time getting here, but look how far we've come...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jess, I wish you well, as with all of the rest of us, in getting used to Skype 8 since Skype Classic IS headed for Gehenna whether we like it or not :-)&nbsp; This is just another 'bump in the road' that we will overcome and perhaps we will 'see' how things turn
 out together (just had to drop that one in there...)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good one... forgetting the absurd new UI for Skype, the calling features just don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I terminated my subscription today because every time a call comes into my Skype from a phone number, I cannot EVER answer quickly enough before it terminates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, the Mac and Android Skype apps don't seem to be able to connect an incoming phone number with my contacts ... so, I never know who is calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, the idiots at Skype removed the custom voicemail feature, making Skype worthless as a business phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, as a corollary to the above, I purchased Office 365 E3 for my co-workers and I to gain access to Skype for Business. But guess what? We can't use it to call people outside of our little group, making it worthless as a business phone without connecting
 it to a dedicated VoIP system (in which case, why do I need Skype?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, the updated Skype UI was designed by morons and is unusable.</p>

    <title>Computer won&#39;t boot with exFAT 3TB internal drive connected. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cyriouslydylan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer won&#39;t boot with exFAT 3TB internal drive connected.</h2>
                    I recently purchased a 3TB Seagate Barracuda drive to use on my 64-bit Windows 8 system. I want it to be used on both a Windows and Mac system, and has to have files over 4GB so exFAT is really my only option. Windows at first did not recognize the drive,
 so it plugged it into a Mac system running Mountain Lion 10.8.2, and formatted it to exFAT no problem. But after doing so my computer would not boot or even let me access the bios - it freezes on the loading screen. Its a GPT partition as opposed to MBR. I
 also unplugged every drive except this new one to see if I can boot into BIOS but to no avail.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see it is by switching one of my sata ports to hot swappable, and plugging it in after windows boots, where I can see and access it immediately and with no issues - I just can't boot with it connected.

            I saw that link before posting, and my drive is partitioned GPT already, yet I still cannot boot. I believe that post speaks about EXTERNAL drives - I have a 1TB external that uses the exFAT partition system and it's fine. But internally connecting this
 3TB drive seems to create a boot lock.

            I understand that generally its used for smaller devices, and it's a risk I'm willing to take - I keep the data backed up on an NTFS drive for stability. What I need is to be able to share and read/write files larger than 4GB on a MAC and a PC, as I do
 video editing with it on a MAC and I need the space and to be able to access large files on it.<br />
<br />
What I need to know is if there is a reason that's actually preventing me from booting with an exFAT drive connected directly to my motherboard via a SATA cable.

            Haha I am actually the last post in that thread, and I tried the cmd command the last guy in that thread posted, but not working. I really do appreciate your help, and hopefully we can find a solution.<br />
<br />
The computer in question is actually a hackintosh that dual-boots Windows and OSX, which is why the cross-platform compatibility is so important.<br />
<br />
I get windows not being able to recognize the drive - but even when I completely disconnect the windows drive from the system I still cannot get past the boot screen or into bios.

            I had windows installed first, then installed OSX. They are on completely separate hard drives though, and neither is this 3TB drive. I have a 120GB OCZ SSD for OSX, and a 240GB Kingston HyperX SSD for Windows 8. Then I have an NTFS RAID1 with 2 WD 500GB
 drives set up, which this 3TB drive was supposed to replace.
<div><br />
<div>I'd even be open to "downgrading" back to Windows 7 if it meant I could boot with a exFAT drive connected, but I'd still like to discover why it locks on boot like it does.</div>

SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)
This is a very common bugcheck.  Usually the exception address pinpoints
the driver/function that caused the problem.  Always note this address
as well as the link date of the driver/image that contains this address.
Some common problems are exception code 0x80000003.  This means a hard
coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but this system was booted
/NODEBUG.  This is not supposed to happen as developers should never have
hardcoded breakpoints in retail code, but ...
If this happens, make sure a debugger gets connected, and the
system is booted /DEBUG.  This will let us see why this breakpoint is
happening.
Arguments:
Arg1: ffffffff80000003, The exception code that was not handled
Arg2: fffff800b5ecee75, The address that the exception occurred at
Arg3: ffffee068f9166a8, Exception Record Address
Arg4: ffffee068f915ef0, Context Record Address

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the date of birth on your Microsoft account shows that you're under 18 years old, Microsoft is required to request parental consent for you. If you're an adult, but you got a message asking for parental consent, it's because you're a child in your Microsoft
 family. Even if you're over the age of 18, you can still be a child in Microsoft family. If you're over the age of 18, have your parent remove you from the family. They'll have to sign in to
<a href="http://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com/family</a>, select your profile, and select remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try changing the birth date of your Microsoft account. <span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in to Your info on the Microsoft account website,</a> choose
<strong>Edit your personal info</strong>, and select the right birth date. When you’re done, select
<strong>Save</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the birth date on a Microsoft account says that it belongs to a child, there are different steps to take in regions that regulate what children can do online. See:

<p>Windows embedded 7 -- after power off and on.. re-boot stops at the problem boot screen for 30 seconds.&nbsp; I have tried MSCONFIG setting it to 3 seconds and it's always 30 seconds.</p>
<p>I would like to know if I can set something so it works like WXPe used to.. Clean boot after power OFF -&gt; ON.. Faster.&nbsp; As a minimum how to lower the wait time to 3 seconds?</p>

            <p>Hello <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7e70c626-c78e-4242-982a-12dc95d657db" title="RitamDutta">
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you've tried updating software and driver, you might try resetting the camera app. First
<strong>backup your photos </strong>and try resetting the Camera app. To reset the Camera app, go to Settings --&gt; System --&gt; Apps &amp; features. Find Camera, click on it, then click on Advanced options. On this page, click on the Reset button, and then the subsequent
 confirmation Reset button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure you've checked for Windows Camera app updates in the Store, here's how:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;From apps menu, Launch Store</p>
<p>2. Click on your user picture in the upper right, select Downloads and Updates</p>
<p>3. Click check for updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you said you updated drivers, but when you reinstalled your driver, did you check the option to delete the driver? This is an often overlooked step, here's a troubleshooting document to guide you:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-can-not-find-or-start-the-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-can-not-find-or-start-the-camera</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, could you tell us what version of the Windows Camera app you are using (...</p>
<p>&gt;Settings&gt;About this app). Also please post up a DxDiag report:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">To run a DxDiag Report:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press Window + R key
</p>
<p>2. Type "DxDiag"</p>
<p>3. Let the tool run, once progress bar on left completes, click "Save All Information"
</p>
<p>4. Save that file somewhere you can find it easily.
</p>
<p>5. Double click the saved DxDiag file, it should open in Notepad
</p>
<p>6. Copy the top section "System Information" and paste into a reply on this thread</p>
<p>7. Press Ctrl-F and in find dialog, type "Video Capture Devices"
</p>
<p>8. Please copy and paste the information contained under the "Video Capture Devices" section to this thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>
        </p>

                    <p>Original title: IRQL NOT OR LESS EQUAL (BSOD) Help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I've been experiencing this *IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL* problem irregularly starting January 2. This happened after doing some tinkering with registry files of Windows Media Player (but I made sure to revert it to default options once I am done and I also provided
 a backup copy) since it's randomly generating album art files and I am looking for a way to stop it. I also deleted Windows Media Library Files (wmdb). I don't know if this has anything to do with the BSOD. This error has been happening at random intervals,
 sometimes after opening my laptop it will BSOD sometimes it won't happen after hours of long use. Hope you can help me with this.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Attached is a copy of my DMP files which you seem to require for troubleshooting.&nbsp;<a href="http://s000.tinyupload.com/?file_id=00258211343160019323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dump</a><br />

<h2>            Missing Gold Crowns in Solitaire Star Club Tripeaks and Pyramid</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I am playing the Srar Club collection on the Solitaire Collection app.&nbsp; I completed successfully the Pyramid and Tripeaks games (40/40) but I am not able to see the Gold Crown for either game.&nbsp; I uninstalled the app, reset the cache, reinstalled the app.
 This is not critical but rather disappointing. By the way, running on Windows 10 desktop.&nbsp; Help! Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused but rest assured we are here to help. We do however need a bit more information on this matter. What console is this happening on? To be on the same page, the issue is that physical copies of games don't

            I do not believe those games are available digitally. Maybe try cleaning the discs with a cleaner kit or microfiber cloth and try again. Thanks

<h2>            Video quality not good after installing Windows 7</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> videos have lost its quality,sometimes plays like 240p; 720p bluray videos doesn't play smoothly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I performed a custom installation of windows 7 ultimate(64 bit) from windows xp professional(32bit). win7 worked well,but when I played a video file,which was playing very well in xp smoothly with nice quality, it is int playing well as it was in xp. some
 videos which were 720p bluray (brrip) files isnt playing smoothly. I also noticed that microsoft had provided me a display adapter which earlier was matrox millineum g series in xp. Sound, video,game controllers were also changed to microsoft's device. Though
 a total of 143 recommended updates were automatically installed and verified by windows, i have the problem still. Should I need to install win xp or should I upgrade my graphics device?My windows experience rating is 1.0.In win 7, internet&nbsp;videos play well
 smoothly.Should I try making win7(64bit) to win7(32bit). thanks for the help.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender Offline Scan Issue With BitLocker And USB Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender Offline Scan Issue With BitLocker And USB Keyboard</h2>
                    Just installed Windows 10 Insider Enterprise 10.0.15063 Build 15063 and found that there was no Health report available in Windows Defender. Looked at some of the suggested fixes and tried to run the offline scan. I have BitLocker set up using a recovery
 key that requires typing. However I am unable to use my USB keyboards (I have tried two different ones) to type in the recovery key as none of the keys work whenever the offline scan is scheduled to run. I have no issues typing in the recovery key if no offline
 scan has been set to run. Could this be a bug that needs to be fixed.
