<h2>            Games for Windows - Tinker __bug at level 19 set 7</h2>
                    This game has a bug at level 19 in last set. You cant do it at 100% beacuse the energy req. is set at "-1". And even if you will have more than that and the game give you 3 stars after all the level will be still uncompleted.<br />
<br />
Please fix this!

<h2>            Keyboard Shortcuts for Remote Desktop App</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone have a link to a page showing the keyboard shortcuts for the Remote Desktop Windows Store app ? &nbsp;I'm running it on Windows 10 x64. &nbsp;The help option is a dead link as MS haven't bothered writing its documentation. &nbsp;They are not the same as the
 shortcuts for the desktop Remote Desktop app (MSTSC.exe). &nbsp;They also seem to vary according to target O/S. &nbsp;I'm running it in windowed mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't direct me to another thread as they relate to the desktop app and / or Windows 8.</p>

    <title>Console Not Recognizing Ethernet Cable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xkcd423  say:</h3>
<h2>            Console Not Recognizing Ethernet Cable</h2>
                    
<p>Title. Console has been in the same set-up for three months, no problems until this morning, when the console decided not to recognize the Ethernet cable that has been plugged into it for those three months. Not an issue of 'can't connect to the internet
 through this cable', but rather, the console doesn't recognize that there is a cable plugged in at all.
<br />
<br />
I've tried a hard reset, unplugging the cable from both the console and the wall, and unplugging everything and re-plugging it back in. No dice. Nothing I know has changed from yesterday, when it was working perfectly.</p>

<p>Hey there NuklearRaver,</p>
<p>Due to the age of this thread and that the OP hasn't come back to post up, I would suggest creating a new thread with any Xbox Support related questions you may have. This way we can cater our support specifically to you.</p>
<p>If you are still wondering about Bluetooth compatibility with Xbox One, you're welcome to post up those ideas on our
<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Feedback</a>&nbsp;site. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Itermittent Wi-Fi connection, showing full strength of network</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Wifi connection at 4 bar strength, but unable to connect on my Acer PC&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I'm having intermittent problems connecting to my WIFI connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every 9 days or so, my computer seems to shut off my WIFI. I connect through a USB wifi amplifier, which is connected to a Realtek RTL8192CU Wireless LAN 802.11n USB 2.0 Network Adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try and connect to my available network connection via the available connections bar, but after trying to connect it just says "Cannot connect to this network", and leaves me with the 0 bar icon, with the " * " at the top of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the driver updates for my computer, and there are no network adapter updates available. So I guess I'm up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this sound familiar to anyone else?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are experiencing intermittent Wi-Fi connection. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue. Like computer wasn't assigned a valid IP address, incorrect network settings, conflicts from any third party security program or wireless network drivers are corrupted. &nbsp;Let’s try to identify the
 actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the model number of the computer?</span></p>

<h2>            Eraser on Surface Pro 4 Pen Doesn&#39;t Work Anymore</h2>
                    <p>Last Weekend, I updated my Surface. I noticed that after that, when using either my drawing program or Sketchpad, the eraser function did not work anymore (where the top button can erase lines without having to specifically Change any Settings). I did not
 find a Setting to manage this, so I assume the problem is with the pen? Everything else is working fine, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the batteries last week and did try reconnecting the pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love advice as this makes the process of making art or taking notes last longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance.</p>

            I did look at those before too, but my problem isn't listed. I tried the diagnostic tool kit but it didn't help with the issue at Hand, it only made the update history vanish. One particular update from November can't be installed somehow, I don't know
 if that has to do with anything?&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            What to do about the Windows 10 disaster&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has been a disaster for us. Updates we can not refuse change settings that cause our business software to stop working, repeatedly. A printer I had just installed stopped working. It took me a while to figure out the port had been changed by an
 update. A laptop suddenly would no longer boot. We are having far too many problems. For our business to survive I think we need to migrate off Windows 10 and back to XP. This means going back to older versions of all the software we use and reentering all
 the data since the beginning of the year. This is a nightmare. I'm desperate for ideas.</p>

<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 5:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 6:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-uninstall-windows-10-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/defer-block-un...</a>
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.

<p>None of these silly chat forums help a bit when one has a real, honest to goodness problem with Skype.</p>
<p>My old computer crashed.. lost my old Slype.</p>
<p>Recently downloaded "new" Skype on this computer - don't know my old Skype name, don't know the Skype name of old contacts.</p>
<p>I can't find any of my contacts even though I know they have a Skype account.</p>
<p>No one can find me because when they try to Skype me they only have my old Skype name and that does not work anymore - some how is this entire mess my information has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want to talk to someone live who can resolve this problem.</p>

<p>We do understand your frustration regarding this matter. However, the only way for us to locate your old Skype account is through the "Reset password link" I've provided you on my initial response. From that link, you can enter the exact&nbsp;Skype name or email
 address associated with your old Skype account.&nbsp;You need to make sure&nbsp;that the information you'll be providing to your friends, relatives, family, is the correct information you entered when you initially created your Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Thank You Jannine - again - for trying to help.&nbsp; Nothing works I've already done as recommended on the Microsoft website and combined the old Skype with a "new" microsoft account!!&nbsp; Everything is wiped out now - can't even access my former Outlook files
 or any of my former Skype contacts).&nbsp; Spent most of this day learning how drastically my computer is now screwed up - tried to hire to a professional who is "supposedly" microsoft certified and then talked to another professional who has taught IT and programming
 at a university&nbsp; for 15 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither one could help and I must say that neither one had anything good to say about microsoft or their total lack of interest in customer support.&nbsp; Nothing for praise for the people who try to help other people on the communication
 boards :-)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Auto-Installing Apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psychoticswag95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Auto-Installing Apps</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago, I signed into Windows 10, and upon conclusion of the boot, noticed that there was less space on my hard drive than normal. I always check this upon startup, just in case something unwanted has managed to make it through my firewalls and nest
 in my PC. I figured it might have been an update to Windows, but noted that I hadn't seen any "Updating Windows" screens during the boot sequence. So I pulled up Event Viewer, and found a good number of things being downloaded, none of which I wanted. Candy
 Crush, Witch Saga, Minecraft, etc. Upon further investigation, I found they were coming from the Microsoft Store, which I have never once used. Ever. I get my software from third-party sources. So, for the first time, I opened the application, browsed through
 the settings, and found only these settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Update apps automatically (I switched this off)</p>
<p>- Show products on tile (The start menu tiles ; This setting was also promptly disabled)</p>
<p>- Play videos automatically (Also switched this off)</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the other following options were valid, as I didn't have a Microsoft account signed in anywhere locally. I have Local Accounts on my PC, and none are linked to my Microsoft Account in any way, shape or form. After this minor nuisance, I uninstalled
 the unwanted software, and went about my business, but made a note to keep an eye on my drive, because Microsoft has done things like this in the past. Cortana being my prime reference here. Cortana, something else I don't want and never will, is so thoroughly
 implanted through the process trees and various registries that removing all of its keys and components would render the system inoperable. Microsoft has done something similar with Internet Explorer when Netscape sued them, and they integrated IE into Windows
 so they could claim that it was "part of the Operating System". However, you could then do very, very little without going through Internet Explorer, which was a pain in the neck. I'm getting off topic. Moving on..</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day or two later, I booted up my PC again, and lo and behold, right I was to keep an eye on things. The programs were not installed, but upon looking in Event Viewer, they WERE downloaded again. Upon opening the Store, I found them in the "Waiting to Be
 Installed" tab under Games and Software. I do not want these programs, nor will I ever want these programs, and while each is only between 10-150 MBs this adds up quickly, with almost 20 programs occupying space I don't want taken. I do have 850GB of free
 space on my drives, however, I intend to use this space for dual-booting Linux, Windows 10, and Ubuntu Server for a home server network. I do NOT want Microsoft Store to steal space, because I need every last bit if I'm going to have three separate OS's on
 my drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft intend to return to helping its users, or is this just another "Innovative Feature" created by Microsoft, which affects the unwary and unaware users who don't notice these things? The series of "Features" that have failed or been detrimental
 is growing. Windows Vista was a catastrophic failure full of bugs, glitches, sluggish operation, poorly implemented requirements, and a disturbing variety of Editions that has been going on for a while. Windows 7 had so many Editions that some people couldn't
 figure out what to get, and when they got the wrong one, oh well. The last three OS's with Home Edition have been missing the secpol.msc service, and for those who don't know what that is, it's a Microsoft Service Console that allows for customizing of Security
 Policies which is very, very useful for homegroups, home servers, and PC's with multiple outgoing and incoming connections, including Remote Desktop. You would have to buy Premium, Ultimate, Enterprise, or Professional to get those features. The difference
 between each Edition was the services you had included, or if you prefer to think of it in a more negative way, the services kept from you. I've used every edition of Windows from Windows 95, I've used DOS (which was actually amazing, and GDISK which is based
 off of DOS is a miracle worker for a computer technician when you have to format and partition multiple PC's in a workplace). Sadly, the quality of Windows is slowly dropping at a steady pace. Is there any chance of a bounceback, or is Microsoft determined
 to keep this up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my final question for Microsoft is: Is there any way to possibly disable the automatic download of these unwanted apps, or am I going to have to simply not use Windows? There are some "fixes" that involve going into the registry and creating your own
 keys, but while I'm a competent user with fairly extensive knowledge, not every Windows user is, and a proper fix that can be accessed by normal, untrained users. A simple, understandable solution would be very beneficial to the users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In hopes of avoiding the constant copy/paste responses of disinterested Microsoft employees and moderators, I'll address some of the most common points I've seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've disabled automatic updates. No, I do not have a Microsoft account attached to the store. Yes, I have edited the Windows Registry as suggested in another thread. No, that clearly didn't help, otherwise I wouldn't be posting.

    <title>Win 10 Display turns off after 2mins of idle regardless of power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daryl_lish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Display turns off after 2mins of idle regardless of power settings.</h2>
                    I am currently running a Asus G750J Laptop with windows 10 home 64-bit. <br />
<br />
I have got every single power and sleep option set to "never / off". I have checked my bios settings too. With every single power mode option for display turn off or sleep set to never, my laptop is still continuously turning itself off after 2 minutes of inactivity.
 I can wake my laptop up by key stroke or moving the mouse. It is driving me mental because my wifi keeps disconnecting when it turns itself off / to sleep. My wifi has to identify to the network.

<p>Andei lendo o suporte da Microsoft, eles dizem que se você conecta na Live, não precisaria fazer atualização manual do seu console. Bastava encaixar o chatpad no joystick e tudo certo! Porém, estou com o mesmo problema que você! Comprei meu chatpad hoje
 e não consegui fazê-lo funcionar, mesmo tentando atualizar o console manualmente através de um pendrive com os arquivos de updating. Você conseguiu resolver o seu problema?</p>

<p>estava com o mesmo problema, mas consegui resolver. A conexao sao 3 encaixes: o pino que voce visualiza bem, tem dois em encaixes que sao moveis ( de cada lado do pino), por isso tem que abaixa ou levantar para ter o encaixe perfeito.</p>

<p>"Ping" is always enabled but the device at the far end might have a firewall setting the prevents it from responding.</p>
<p>From your post it is unclear what your setup is. I suggest you start by posting a detailed description.</p>

            Hello, Harkanwar - &nbsp;I attempted to follow the &nbsp;directions below.<br />
<br />
Regarding Step 1 - Windows 10 does not use support Internet Explorer. &nbsp;Instead, a new browser "Edge" is included. &nbsp;Unfortunately, that browser doesn't have a Tools button.<br />
Nonetheless, I opened the Windows 10 Settings menu and eventually found the Proxy serve settings and turned the Proxy Server off, as you suggested.<br />
<br />
The Store icon that used to be on the toolbar disappeared weeks ago, so I clicked the Store tile in my Windows 10 Apps and, as before, nothing happened. &nbsp;I still cannot acces Store on this machine, although Store under Windows 10 is functioning correctly on
 two other computers in my home.<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying. &nbsp;I think the Windows Store files are missing or corrupted on this computer.<br />
<br />
I created another identity as has been suggested in another post. &nbsp;The Store Icon is visible, but when I click it, I get a popup window, indicating that the store cannot be accessed.<br />
<br />
Alan

            <p>Hi Nedrea,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those all seem to be symptoms of the system temporarily and briefly freezing up.&nbsp; When you move the mouse the system freezes and then when it recovers it puts the pointer wherever it would have been had it not frozen.&nbsp; Spell check hangs because the system
 freezes up doing it and so work on spell checking is temporarily suspended until the system recovers.&nbsp; Sometimes the monitor fades to white (not entirely white but a distinctly white tint like a cloud over the screen) and the mouse is an hour glass because
 the program or the system has frozen and it stays that way until it recovers (I've had this happen to me on occasion when trying to do too many things with too many programs open at the same time&nbsp;- and so I spend a moment closing what I don't really need any
 more but just didn't bother to close at the time and then all is fine again).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While these could be caused by malware (almost anything can be caused by malware and if what follows doesn't help then reply back and we'll look into a possible malware infection and getting that resolved (as well as some other troubleshooting alternatives).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, I strongly suspect what you need is a bit of maintenance that perhaps you've overlooked or backburnered or procrastinated doing (yes, I know it's sort of like housework, but the computer does want attention paid to it from time to time to
 work properly).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed (you can ignore the speed ones if you want, but often they are closely related and it won’t hurt to address both anyway) in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference
 articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested on XP or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other
 things of value that you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually - I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do
 procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over
 the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance, but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily
 improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span> in Vista or </span>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>

<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a><span> in Vista or

 them - many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to
 save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:

<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster or check automatically for updates and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help
 a lot in making your system faster (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered
 no ill effects – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
<strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE (or some other
 AV programs), you don't&nbsp;need Defender and MSE will deactivate it or uninstall it&nbsp;when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). I would also suggest downloading the free
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not post back and we'll check&nbsp;for malware, take a closer look at your system files and hard drive for corruption, check your hard drive and RAM to make sure they are working fine, confirm your device drivers are updated, and some other
 options to try to identify the cause of the problems so we can target in on some possible solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> You can also try connecting the camera on a different port and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong>&nbsp; You can also try by changing the normal mode to Print/ptp mode in camera where you can print directly from camera by connecting it to printer directly using usb cable.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information helps.</p>

<h2>            Music and Hidden Album Art in Folders</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I was wondering, if at all possible, if there is any way to prevent hidden album art pictures from appearing in folders whenever a song is played for a few seconds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked a similar question less than a year ago about this (link below) and got an answer on how to find the files and erase them, however, I want to know if there is any way to stop them from appearing at all?</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-pictures/windows-81-album-art-in-folder/4c78fe83-6917-4a47-a369-a9e77ebaddb6<br />

<p>As you can see, these hidden files keep getting created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help and any answers/replies are greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi again Darryl.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure what you want to do here, The hidden files you have shown are created by wmp as part of the link to the database - there's&nbsp;art large -art small -&nbsp;and folder plus 'desktop' which is a hidden system file. If it is incorrect you can overwrite
 it via wmp but those files will always appear in the folder (except they are only visible&nbsp;by your choice) - can you clarify a bit more? - Regards, Ric.</p>

            <p>Delighted to be speaking with you again Ric.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is only a slight problem, however, it seems that whenever a file is played on Windows Media Player, these hidden files replace the original clear album art, and it becomes blurry and will not revert unless the hidden files are deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there was any way for the hidden album art files to not appear any time a song is played a couple of times on windows media player.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/766ac349-7234-409d-8d15-284223975672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/766ac349-7234-409d-8d15-284223975672" /></a></p>
<p>As you may see above, it is fine and clear. However...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/294c2703-0643-474b-b7fe-4719e22b4779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/294c2703-0643-474b-b7fe-4719e22b4779" /></a></p>
<p>After it is played a couple of times, it becomes blurry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can provide, will be greatly appreciated :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again Ric.</p>

            <p>I can see the difference! A few more questions - where is the top artwork from...and where was the screenshot taken? Is this WMP or another player? It does rather look like the artwork is being overwritten but even with the&nbsp;meagre 200x200 image created by
 WMP it doesn't usually go blurry like that. The lower image seems to have a different colour quality so it may be taking a new (unwanted) version coming from the online database.</p>
<p>Just re-check your 'Organize' - 'Options' settings in the 'library' and 'privacy' tabs and make sure boxes in the marked areas match mine shown below... Cheers, R.</p>

<ol>
<li>The album art is from a program that captures high quality album art from internet databases, iTunes quality etc.</li><li>I took the screen shot using snipping tool.</li><li>I took the screen shot in Windows Media Player.</li></ol>
<p>I will try that now and let you know what happens :)</p>

            <p>I tried this a couple of times, in a couple of different folders and it seems to be only in folders that the files contained are .wma, It also happens at other times with .mp3 files.</p>

 this picture above, you can see that it is clear and no hidden files are shown...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below, you can see that the hidden files are visible, and the album art is blurry again.</p>

            <p>Again the wma image is clearly a different one - and there are no system files visible in the mp3 folder so nothing has been overwritten. Interesting that it only seems to affect wma... I don't use wma much - nothing wrong with it but it just doesn't fit
 in with my streaming set-up - I use 'Airplay' (iTunes) and wma files don't work in iTunes!</p>
<p>Let me know if the settings showed anything... Ric.</p>

            <p>Sincere apologies for the delay, Ric.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings did not show anything out of the ordinary, and after a couple more tests, it seems to effect every file type, not just .wma.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have also noticed is that the problem temporarily fades after selecting every song in the folder, in that every album art is completely fixed if every song is played through Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I sincerely apologise for the delay in my reply.</p>

            Well I've been working on a new trick to overcome the problem of white borders on folder images in Windows 10 - It is still work in progress but it may prove useful in correcting your issue. I'll get back to you when I have run a few more checks on this.
 It may be a few days because I'm still playing catch-up!&nbsp; Cheers, R.

    <title>How To Remove A Second Desktop&#47;Icons Created In Error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#40;r&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Remove A Second Desktop&#47;Icons Created In Error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When shutting down my computer, Windows 7 sent a program upgrade, however, when re-starting the computer a couple of hours later my desktop and shortcut icons&nbsp; disappeared.&nbsp; The Windows program upgrade did indicate as "successful."&nbsp; My entire screen was
 light blue with a windows symbol, and when I opened the internet, my default browser and homepage were gone too, which I successfully resolved by resetting.&nbsp; I then created another desktop, but with only a couple of the same icons from the original desktop.&nbsp;
 Unbeknown to me creating this second desktop was a mistake to do because the next morning, my original desktop reappeared.&nbsp; I cannot open the icons on my original desktop because this message appears "The item 'Document Name' that this shortcut refers to has
 been changed or moved, so this shortcut will not longer work properly.&nbsp; Do you want to delete this shortcut?" &nbsp; I'm very hesitant to delete these icons from the original desktop.&nbsp; I tried to search for the Microsoft files that lie within the shortcuts by using
 the Windows key, but they are missing.&nbsp; I'm thinking since I now have two desktops with the same shortcuts, the second desktop and icons need to be deleted, but I cannot locate this second desktop to to delete it meanwhile I lost access to the Microsoft Word
 2013 document files that lie within this Icon.&nbsp; Is the second desktop now lying embedded behind the original desktop?</p>

Melchizedek Qui, Thank you for your prompt reply I will respond back when my husband tries your suggestion.&nbsp; Should I just search for the name of the folder or can I search for a document within the folder?&nbsp; Will I ever be able to locate the "second" desktop
 I created so that I can delete it?&nbsp; Many thanks again.

<p>Hello Melchizedek Qui,&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for attempting to assist me, but I was unsuccessful via your suggestion in recapturing my MS 2013 Word document folder.&nbsp; As I stated above, this MS Word document folder I created another shortcut for on the "second" desktop created on April
 4th are now lost.&nbsp; I did not duplicate my original desktop entirely and those other particular files and shortcuts were unaffected.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, April 7th, I ran a full virus scan with no issues and I tried two system restores using prior April and March dates and both were unsuccessful.&nbsp; By the way, the Security Update that took place on April 4th was for Windows KB100480. This Security Update
 made update attempts on prior dates this week indicating failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that since my original desktop returned the day <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
after </span>(April 5th) the Windows Security Update that the "second" desktop created on April 4th is still somewhere within the computer, but the original desktop is overriding it somehow preventing it from appearing?&nbsp;
