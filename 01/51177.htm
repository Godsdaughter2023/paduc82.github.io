<h2>            My laptop is suddenly EXTREMELY slow.</h2>
                    <p>As in, even trying to type something in the start bar takes several minutes.</p>
<p>I'm able to start Windows but it takes like 15 minutes to even get past the Windows logo. It's like everything is in slow motion.</p>
<p>But task manager says the usage is at 0% or 1%. No programs are open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to open folders, right-click on anything, or even move a folder results in the whole screen turning lighter (like a window does when it crashes) and says "Windows Explorer is not responding."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting and it says "Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause." and recommends Launch Startup Repair. The first time I was able to launch startup repair, but it didn't seem to solve anything. Now it won't
 even launch startup repair, attempting to do so brings me to a new screen that says "Windows has encountered a problem communicating with a device connected to your computer." I don't have anything connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This apparently started when I uninstalled an old version of Gimp and downloaded paint.net. (But I didn't run the installer. The slowness started even before the download finished.) But it was fine yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to open safe mode so I could run Malwarebytes but I can't open safe mode. Pressing F8 just makes it scream this high-pitched beep noise and takes me to the "Windows failed to start" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No clue what to do now. Help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: Okay, this time when I tried to start Windows it brought me to a new screen: "Checking file system on C: &nbsp;one of your disks needs to be checked for consistency" It's still at 1%</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit2: Five hours later, it's still at 1%. It says "File segment record 41579" is unreadable" and says the same thing for every segment record number as far back as it's letting me see (which is 41559 but probably the ones before that are unreadable too)
 It's taking about 20 seconds to scan each file, and it says "of 225792" so if it continues at this rate the scan would take 42 days! What do I do??</p>

            <p>A lot has happened since I posted the original message, now I'm pretty sure the hard drive is dead. When the scan finally finished (took about 20 hours) I was able to restart the computer and after a couple hours it went back to normal speed. I thought it
 was fixed but then it restarted itself and said "Hard drive not exist"</p>

<p>
</p><p>So is the problem a bad hard drive? Should I order a new one or try to repair this one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a backup ("system image") saved on an external drive from a few months ago, so I'm not really worried about data loss, but I'd rather not lose the OS altogether if I can avoid it, because I don't think I have the Windows 7 disks.</p>

<h2>            Wolf&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Rather Hasty Guide To The Basics Of Combat - Guest Starring Absolutely Nobody</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><em>Wolf's Rather Hasty Guide To The Basics Of Combat - Guest Starring Absolutely Nobody</em></span></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em>Welcome to my basic guide to prodding some serious buttock in Assassin's Creed 3. Now, this is a very quickly written guide, so there may be things I have missed, tactics I personally don't know about etc. If you find something missing please feel free
 to share it with the class. Obviously this little guide won't be perfect, but hopefully it'll help a few people out. Oh, and the names of enemies are probably wrong, for all I know.
</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em>Combat in Creed 3 is primarily based around going on the offensive, despite the fact that counters are so damn easy. The second thing it's built around is the concept of momentum, basically meaning you want to get a smooth rythm going so that you can
 flow through combat, also known as a "Chain"</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The Basics:</span> X to attack, B to block or roll, Y to use your secondary weapon and A to break the defense of an opponent which spins them around. Tapping A a second time straight after a disarm results in Connor tripping
 up his target, leaving them open to a ground finish.</em><br />
<em>Using Block and its options: When a red marker appears above an enemy, tap B to block. This actives the slow-motion block and then opens up some options, depending on the enemy type: a simple tap of X results in a kill, depending on the enemy types. A standard
 Redcoat will die, whereas an officer will block your counter strike. Tap A for a disarm, which is self explanatory, really. Tap B for a throw.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Double Counters:</span> These occur when two enemies are blocked at the same time, initiating a beautifully little animation in which Connor destroys them both. Double Counters are great because they insta-kill any enemy,
 regardless of type.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Chains</span>: a chain refers to a chain of attacks without ever getting broken, which occurs if you're shot, hit, or simple fail to use the right button combination. At the most basic level chains are performed on basic soldiers,
 detailed below. At this level a chain allows you to use an "Insta-Kill" (I'll be using that term throughout this, It will refer to killing a target by holding X during a chain) another soldier by simply holding X in their direction As you get better a chain
 can incorporate other enemy types by using the correct actions. More on that after we move through the different enemy types. A chain can be broken by being hit, getting shot or simply taking too long between attacks.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><em>The enemies:</em></span></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Redcoats/Bluecoats</span>: the basic of the basic. These guys can be killed in any fashion you desire and pose little threat except when there's a tonne of them. They form the basis of your chains: simply counter and kill one
 using B and then X to start a "chain". As the kill animation is performed highlight another basic Red/Blue coat with the analog stick and hold down X as the animation finished. Provided your selected target is within range Connor will leap/run/roll over to
 them and take them down in a single move. Repeat the process to keep your chain going. Chains can also be started by simply killing a standard a Redcoat with repeated attacks. Counter kills are just the simplest method. I'll get back to streaks later and how
 to incorporate other enemy types into them.</em><br />
<em>When a yellow icon appears above a Redcoat, he's going to shoot you, so hold A in the direction of an enemy to use him as a meatshield - Sometimes Redcoats will form a firing line, simply take a meat-shield by tapping A on a nearby enemy once again. Or
 run away. Never be afraid to do that. (Cont. in next post)</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Captain</span>: These guys can be identified by their ornate hats and&nbsp;by the fact they wield a sword, unlike regular soldiers who have a musket. There's usually one in every patrol, right at the front. They're the next step
 up from a basic soldier and as such as a little bit harder to take down, but not much. FIrstly a Captain can be insta-killed as part of a chain: just take down a normal soldier, and while the animation is occuring press and hold X in the direction of the Captain.
 Simples. Captains can and will block your standard X button attacks, so other than a&nbsp;chain here are your options: use the defense break by tapping A and then following up with some attacks. Or wait until they attack, block the attack with B and then use the
 disarm option, followed up again by an attack or a trip up and then attack. Or just shoot them in the face. At first Captains cannot be killed using a counter kill (B then X) but if you weaken them somewhat they will become vulnrable to them.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Highlanders/Grenadiers</span>: also lovingly referred to as Brutes, you can't miss these kilt-wearing kin of mine on the Redcoats side. Can't remember what the Bluecoat version looks like, but he also has a massive axe.....So
 you'll work it out. There's also a variant that uses just a musket. Usually, though&nbsp;they wield freakin' huge axes and are a pain to take down. Bullet to the face. Easy. But if that doesn't sound good then listen, or read, up: Brutes will block every basic
 attack, cannot be insta-killed as part of a&nbsp;chain by simple holding X and cannot be killed by blocking and then tapping X, unless, like the captain, they're severaly weakened first. Option 1: use A to break their defense and follow up with a couple of basic
 X attacks. Repeat until dead. Option 2: block their strike and disrm arm, again followed by a few basic attacks. Repeat until dead. Option 3: when a yellow icon pops up above their head they're going for a big strike, simply tap Bto roll out of the way. Get
 your roll right, by rolling past them, and follow it up by holding X and Connor will slit their throat etc. Easy. Also, you can use your rope dart by using Y to yank them to the ground.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Generals:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Actually know as Jagers these</span></span>&nbsp;these&nbsp;German mercs&nbsp;wear browncoats and happily don't pop up too often, usually only when you've been fighting for a good while. Again, bullet,
 or arrow, to the face. Other than that these guys are butt-holes to fight as only two tactics work against them: break their defense with A and follow up with attacks, or counter, disarm and attack. Basic attacks, insta-kills, counter-kills and throws will
 not work against them. Generals also have a habit of attacking in pairs, allowing you to use the double-counter kill against them. Handy.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Those Little Dodgy Dudes:</span> I have no name for them, but they wield tiny little knives and wear furry hats. These guys have an irritating move where they roll over you. Tap B to dodge 'em when they flash yellow. Block
 followed by a throw (B) seems to work well on them as they have a nasty habit of blocking most attacks and even defensive breaks. I've not actually encountered them much and so haven't built up much of a tactic for them. Anybody out there got more ideas?</em></em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">How To Incorportate Different Enemy Types Into a Chain</span>: Alright, so performing a chain on basic soldiers is easy peasy, you just press the direction stick toward another soldier during the killing animation and either
 hold X or just hammer away at it. There is a correct time to press it, but hammering away is just so much more satisfying. But what about other enemy types, like the Highlander/Grenadier? Or even generals? These guys can still be incorporated into a streak,
 you just have to use the correct methods. Let's have an example: 3 soldiers, one captain, one Highlander and one General:</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em>The first soldier attacks, so we block with B and perform a counter kill by pressing X. As the animation finishes we point toward the next soldier and hammer X. Connor leaps over and slices him up. We've got a chain going now. Once again we highlight the
 next soldier and hammer X to perform another chain kill. Next up is the Captain: he's not problem, though, as the captain is susceptible to a chain kill. As the last soldier dies we once again press toward the captain and hammer X. Connor performs another
 takedown. The Highlander is up next. Now, we know a standard X button chain kill won't work, so what we do is while the kill animation on the captain finishes up we press toward the Highlander and hammer A instead of X for a defensive break. Connor leaps forth.
 As that animation plays we hammer X. Connor responds with instant death for the Highlander. As that animation is finishing up we're readying for the General....but crap, he's attacking! No problem, a block can be incorporated into the chain as well. As the
 kill animation on the Highlander finishes we point toward the general but this time hammer B. We follow up by hitting A and then by pressing X. Because we performed this as part of an unbroken chain Connor again responds with a instant kill on the General.
 We're out of enemies now, so that's 6 enemies dead in one unbroken, flowing move. Not bad. This concept can be applied to huge numbers of enemies in a single group. The key is to stay calm and remember the moves required for each enemy type, which can be tricky.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Random tips</span>: always remember that you've got useful gear stored away. The pistol and bow are obviously great to use, and can actually be incororated into certain moves. The rope dart is great for yanking enemies of their
 feet, and the smoke bomb can allow you to take down loads of enemies quickly.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em>Chain kills take precendence over enemy attacks. If you're in the middle of a chain and the enemy you're away to strike is attacking you, your attack will take precedence over there's, which is always handy to remember.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em>There is a correct timing during a chain, but it's tricky to master. Holding the button seems to work the majority of the time, but some people have reporting this doesn't work that well for them. If it doesn't, hammer away.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em>You can pick up a weapon on the ground, like a Musket, in the middle of combat by holding RT and pressing B when standing over it. Muskets are always a good options as they're usually loaded, allowing you to pick it up, select a target and hit Y for a quick
 kill. Drop it again by pressing B.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em>Change up your weapons. This is mostly just for fun as different weapons result in different kills.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em><br />
<br />
<em>Perform a counter and long ranged kill at the same time. Tricky to do, but when you've got the pistol equipped to why, block an opponent and hit X then quickly highlight another target and press Y. Do it correctly and Connor will pull out his gun and shoot
 the second target as he kills the first. Don't highlight a target and Connor will use the gun on the enemy you've countered.</em></p>
<p><em>Snitches: drummers in a patrol, or just some enemies, especially if they're on a horse, will often run away to try and get help. Take them out fast if you don't want more guards on your butt. Or let him run if you want some extra fun.</em></p>
<p><em>-</em></p>
<p><em>Alright, so there we have it. I hope you found this useful!</em></p>

<p>Nice work but if you want to keep it simple, you could just equip hidden blades and the bow. When they attack just hit B then X Or B then Y for higher level enemies. &nbsp;One of these 2 moves will kill all the enemies you mentioned, including Jagers. Don't forget
 to loot the bodies to get your arrows back. Boring maybe, but effective. </p>
<p>Also that bit about hitting the A button when they line up to shoot at you is useful, not to mention it's one of the achievements.

<h2>            Dishonored DLCs Rip-Off - US DLC not compatible with PAL consoles</h2>
                    
<p>I used to have a US account on my PAL console due to having moved there to live there for a few years. As such, I downloaded all kinds of DLC for my PAL games (US NTSC games didn't work) and never had a problem with any of it.</p>

<p>Sometimes I could not Download a full game because it was NTSC coded, but the Console always, ALWAYS told me that the game I wanted to buy was not compatible with my console and I hadn't been charged.</p>

<p>In July I bought two Dishonored DLCs, Knife of Dunwall and Dunwall City Trials. I paid for those, downloaded them, but never had a chance to play it. Then I moved back to Germany, migrated my Xbox profile to Germany. Just today, I installed Dishonored again
 to the HDD and tried to play the DLCs for the first time, and I get the dreaded "The Disc is unreadable - clean it with a soft cloth" Error and get booted to the Dashboard. The Disc. With DLC.</p>

<p>So I did the usual, cleared cache, reinstalled game, nothing.</p>

<p>Then I tried to re-download the DLC... and couldn't.</p>

<p>I am now on the German Xbox Live (and thank you for forcing us to suffer through a German Dashboard translated by Google Translate), and apparently, the DLC is different or something, because it asked me to pay for it again. I checked my download history,
 and it showed both purchases, but when I try to access the DLC through the Download History I get an Error: "There was a problem with the Xbox Service, try again later, Error Code 800700E8"</p>

<p>On the off-chance, I tried using another US account from my partner that's still US, but to no avail. The same thing happened (Disc Read Error).</p>

<p>So I checked online, on Xbox.com, checked my download history there, and both are there - but again, when I try to click on them, or add them to my Download Queue I get an error, this time: "Unfortunately, the Content is not available"</p>

<p>Finally, I deleted my profile from the console, downloaded it, tried to access the DLCs through my Download History again, and it's still the same problem. I can't use the DLC, and I can't download it again from the Download History or from Xbox.com, and
 going to it on the Marketplace, it wants me to pay the money I already paid for it - my purchase history is proof of that.</p>

<p>I finally found some info on the web, on this forum, where it says that if you downloaded the DLCs with a US account on a PAL console, you got the NTSC version and that wouldn't work: http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/8/p/758385/2988639.aspx#2988639
 - and that since the US and PAL version are different (not by content, just out of spite), you having downloaded the US version (that won't work on your console and that you shouldn't have been allowed to download at all) would NOT allow you to delete that
 and (after migrating to a PAL country) download the PAL version again.</p>

<p>So I contacted MS support, who were less than helpful, basically telling me that some licenses get lost in migration. To the fact that I never could've played the NTSC DLC on my PAL console and that they sold me content I could never have used, they remained
 silent. No reimbursement, no unlocking the PAL DLC.</p>

<p>I have paid for this, I have proof of that. The content is identical except for the PAL version featuring support for more languages, it was bought at the same price than the PAL content was sold, and it does not violate any German censorship laws.</p>

<p>Suffice to say, I am not amused.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;P4NCH0theD0G,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about this situation. It sounds quite frustrating. Well let's see what we can do here.
<br />
<br />
One thing to note in our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the Region of your Xbox LIVE Account</a>&nbsp;support article, is that DLC is not guaranteed to work after a region change.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As for troubleshooting steps, have you tried transferring your license? This has been known to alleviate DLC issues caused by region changes. Here is our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox License Transfer</a>&nbsp;support article which has steps on how to complete that process.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>I understood that DLC might not work after a transfer, but nothing was said about not being able to download that content again, if it's available. It's not like it's censored content that's "Not available in your location", the content is exactly the same,
 just with more languages in the PAL version (thus the bigger size). I mean, I can still play my Dead Rising 2 Case Zero DLC, and that is not available here in Germany at all.</p>
<p>And the funny thing is, I downloaded that content with my US account while I already was in Germany (my region transfer had issues and it took almost a month until it was complete), so the IP check should've prevented me from getting the incompatible NTSC
 version for my PAL console in the first place. </p>
<p>Anyway... I am unsure about the License Transfer, as it seems to me that I need another Xbox for that. I don't have easy access to another Xbox 360. Can I do that even if it's already on the console? I mean on the same console I have issues on using said
 DLC? I already tried deleting and re-downloading my profile with no success.</p>

<p>Yeah, okay, I tried the License Transfer. Then it told me my Licenses were updated online, and to go to my Download History and download the stuff again to update it on the console.</p>
<p>Same problem still remains: I choose one of the two DLCs, press A, empty pop-up window, loading, then Error: "There was a Problem with the Xbox Service, please try again later, for more info on Error Code 800700E8 check..."</p>
<p>I can't even get to the actual name of the DLC.</p>
<p>So, what now? I tried adding the DLCs to the queue via Xbox.com, but it only says: The content is not available anymore. And when I click on the Content Link "Dunwall City Trials" (<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/de-DE/Product/Dunwall-City-Trials/a155c37d-4acd-4f84-abee-77607ddd504e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">marketplace.xbox.com/.../a155c37d-4acd-4f84-abee-77607ddd504e</a>)
 I get a Error page: Hoops, you found a glitch in the system...</p>

<p>But when I replace the German parts in the Link (de-DE) with US parts (en-US), I get to this page here:

marketplace.xbox.com/.../a155c37d-4acd-4f84-abee-77607ddd504e</a> &nbsp;and the page works. It also tells me I already downloaded that content. When I try to add it to the queue, though, it says: The content is not available in your region.</p>
<p>I'm running out of things to do here...</p>

<p>I also don't understand why it is not possible for MS/Xbox Support to simply revoke the license for the US content and give me the license for the PAL content.</p>
<p>It's the same content, I paid for the content, yet I was never able to play it since I was sold content that was not compatible with my region/version of the game. Even before the Migration I couldn't have used it. That`s really not my fault.</p>
<p>I moved to Germany, I initiated the migration of my account to Germany. MS had issues with the transfer, it took almost a month. I remained during that time on a US account, but MS support assured me, that I could use the account and the points on it with
 no restrictions. During that time I downloaded both DLCs, from a PAL console with a German IP, yet I got the NTSC version.</p>
<p>Is there really nothing that can be done about this?</p>

<p>Hey there P4NCHO,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear you're having issues playing your DLC.<br />
<br />
The marketplace you access is determined by your account region not by the IP or console type, so while your region was being transferred, you most likely were accessing the US marketplace.<br />
<br />
The reason that the English <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Dunwall-City-Trials/a155c37d-4acd-4f84-abee-77607ddd504e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dunwall City Trials</a> shows as purchased is that your account was accessing the US marketplace when you purchased it. The German marketplace
<a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/de-DE/Product/Dunwall-City-Trials/dfbd98d2-0b77-4e70-b557-af0259773db7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dunwall City Trials</a>&nbsp;has a different code altogether than the US one, so simply replacing the region designation with de-DE is what led you to the broken link.<br />
<br />
The PAL version of many games in Germany, Poland, and Russia is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>very</strong></span> specific to those regions and I know that Dishonored NTSC in particular is not PAL compatible. You most likely will need to repurchase the correct regional version of that DLC.<br />
<br />
You may be able to contact your local <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Phone Support</a> and explore the possibility of a refund..<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>@Whales -</strong> If you're account is in a different region from your physical location, you most likely are experiencing a similar issue with having a region locked copy of the DLC. You can also try contacting
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone Support</a> to pursue a refund.</p>

<p>P4NCH0theD0G, I think the point that Mister Ohnaka was making is that because you have migrated your account from US to Germany it means the DLC is no longer valid. As your account is now on the German locale it means your account is trying to access the
 German Xbox Marketplace where you "don't own" the DLC instead of the USA one where you bought it.</p>
<p>Also, the DLC may be region locked based on your IP. Some Publishers/Developers impose this (Treyarch and Capcom to name a couple) which would explain why your other USA account couldn't download either as your IP is German and the account American.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Flight Sim&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tfs lysander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Flight Sim&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>There are very few flight simulators or the Xbox 360, but those few go extremely unaccredited. &nbsp;Birds of Steel, Over G Fighters are arguable the most realistic flight sim's for the 360. &nbsp;Whats the chances of there being a flight simulator on Xbox One, a
 new system with new amazing abilities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I think if Microsoft decided to create an Xbox exclusive Flight Simulator kinda like Microsoft Flight. &nbsp;I think Microsoft Flight was a good idea, especially if it had the same scale as Flight Simulator X (which im sure could be ran on an Xbox
 One)</p>
<p>Or, maybe even a combat flight simulator like Over G Fighters, but with updated graphics and airplanes.</p>
<p>....Maybe im over thinking it, the flight sim genre hasn't been the most popular in this recent gaming industry.</p>
<p>But I know for sure that im not the only fan of aviation that also loves to play xbox.</p>

<p>I've been wishing for this for some time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are too many controls to make an accurate flight sim carryover to the console space.</p>
<p>Believe me. The flight sim crowd wants everything in this game and will raise heck if they don't get it. (I used to be one myself)</p>
<p>How it could possibly work though would be to use the Kinect voice commands.</p>
<p>Say you want to tune to the next radio frequency as your leaving an air space you would say something like "radio stack" and you would get all of your radio options. This could work for all of the systems of an airplane. But is Microsoft willing to put in
 money and resources to develop it?</p>

                    <p>I cannot find any way to set a default "reply to" address in Windows 10 Mail &amp; Calendar app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook and gmail accounts set up successfully in the mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need replies to mail I send from that app to go to my domain email address rather than the address from which I'm sending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the appropriate Outlook or gmail web mail in a browser, I can set up the necessary "reply to" address, so than when I send an email using web mail, replies go to my domain address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I send from either account using Windows 10 Mail app, replies go to the address from which I'm actually sending, which is not what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's no way to do this, is it possible to still use dear old Outlook Express in Win 10?</p>

    <title>How Can I Just Block Downloads - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How Can I Just Block Downloads</h2>
                    <p>I could tear out my hair!</p>
<p>This is the third time I've decided to give Family Safety a shot. I'm totally frustrated by web filtering. I turned it on "General Interest" and "Block File Downloads from the Web." My son complained he could not go anywhere on the internet. I got into the
 settings and saw that the Block &amp; Allow List was set to ON with the statement below it; "</p>
<div>Use the Allow and Block buttons to specify what Xxx&nbsp;can see online.</div>
<div>
<p>If you don't add any allowed websites, and Xxx's restriction level is set to Allow list only, Xxx&nbsp;won't be able to use the Internet."</p>
<p>I clicked it off.</p>
<p>That action <strong>turned off web filtering completely</strong>.</p>
<p>I fought with it for a few hours but I've already come to expect that if a MS product is whacked, even a week isn't going to fix it.</p>
<p>(Ex. I tried to post here as I was already logged in with the username and email I've used here for 9 years. I was asked to create a Username &amp; enter my email to
<strong>sign up</strong>. ??</p>
<p>The spots were pre-filled correctly so I just clicked <strong>submit </strong>
only to be told that username was taken. <strong>Duh.</strong> I'm not fighting with Stupid for an hour to post a question under the username I'm already registered and signed in with so I added my birth year and posted.</p>
<p>This is the type of stupid problems that caused me to drop Family Safety the last two times. So I installed tried and true free Blue Coat k9 security software to do my filtering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anyway to just use&nbsp;"Block File Downloads from the Web?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>pre-dial terminal screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bungzilla  say:</h3>
<h2>            pre-dial terminal screen</h2>
                    <p>I use good ol' modems as back doors into terminal servers, we've been having issues with dialing into some of them so we use a pre-dial terminal screen to enter some INIT strings.&nbsp; Recently (yeah my company is slow) I got a new laptop with windows 7.&nbsp; When
 I try and bring up the pre-dial window, it flashes like mad and causes the backgrounds of other apps like outlook to turn black and causes many instabilities.&nbsp; We use SecureCRT to dial out, but I also downloaded hyperterminal for win7 and they all seem to
 use a native pre-dial window that causes the same problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone assist me to troubleshoot this, not sure what logs are needed.&nbsp; Also all my coworkers have the same issue, so 10 or so laptops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can give me.</p>

                    Cannot start Windows 7 Firewall. Get Error 08x007042c.<br />
<br />
More information I have found on the the problem.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The error log indicates: The Windows Firewall service depends on the Base Filtering Engine service which failed to start because of the following error:
<br />
Access is denied Event ID 7001.<br />
<br />
The error logs indicate the Base Filtering Engine service terminated with the following error:
<br />
Access is denied Event ID 7023. <br />
<br />
Also I checked the dependent services Remote Procedure Call (RPC), DCOM Service Process Launcher and RPC Endpoint Mapper are both started.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

            Hey! If you have this crappy problem just do this: run-services.msc-base filtering engine: double click-make sure u have the local service, and empty password under LOGIN button. do the same on windows firewall in services. then go to regedit http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943996/en-us
 do that AND!!!! give another user to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services user must be called: NT Service\bfe with full control! Then you can start bfe, and then you can start that firewall in services.msc! cheers!

<p>Resolved this on Windows 2008 x64 using the above mentioned guide by abellos and the following:</p>
<div>Trying to start the "Base Filtering Engine"&nbsp;resulted in more Access is Denied errors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Using SysInternals ProcMon.exe I discovered that HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\BFE\Parameters\Policy\Persistent and HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\BFE\Parameters\Policy\BootTime\Filter where the cause of the Access Denied messages.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Strange thing is that the NT AUTHORITY\System is given Full Access to both entries. adding the "NT Service\MpsSvc" group with Full Control seems to provide a fix for me.</div>

(The steps are the same for Windows 7 or Windows 8), except you are not creating a Repair disc but a full installation DVD)</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Always use high quality DVD+R media and the slowest burn speed (4x or 6x) if offered a choice.</p>
<p><br />
====================== <strong>Keyless Install</strong> ================================</p>
<p>How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows:</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD disc you created and start the installation process.</p>
<p><br />
After you enter user name and password you will be asked to:<br />
'Type your Windows product key',&nbsp; do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark<br />
to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p><br />
You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows. </p>
<p><br />
During this 30 day grace period you can try resolving your problems.&nbsp; <br />
After you are satisfied all problems have been resovled then activate Windows.</p>
<p><br />
====================== <strong>Device Drivers</strong> ===============================</p>
<p><br />
Go to your computer manufacture's support web site and check for Windows 7 drivers for your specific model number.</p>
<p><br />
If there are Windows 7 drivers, then download to a folder on your hard drive and install all of them, starting with the Motherboard/chipset drivers, SATA, LAN, Audio, USB, Graphics, Webcam, Etc., and so on.</p>

            Probably a FAT formatted stick would be no good because of the file size limitation, use an ntfs format

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You trying to extend Camtasia Software? Well that is not the key and we can't help with pirating efforts, if that is what you are trying to do. If needed re-install the program which will correct any required keys. Check with the Support for the software involved.<br />
<br />
Never work in the Registry without making a Restore Point and export any key first. It is possible to cause Windows to fail to properly run if at all.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Touch Issues when placed in certain positions... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> todd_n94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Touch Issues when placed in certain positions... Doesn&#39;t work when placed vertical...</h2>
                    <p>I've had my SP4 i5/8GB/256GB for 3 months now. I absolutely love it because its fits my needs to a T. I'm a nursing major taking my pre-reqs, and it is so helpful when taking notes and recording lectures. However, the touch can be a little pain in the butt
 when I have the orientation of the SP4 is certain positions. For example, the touch refuses to work when I have it oriented to where I'm using the stand on my UAG case cover. If I have it where the SP4 is slightly vertical or even sometimes horizontal, the
 touch wont work UNLESS I have one or both hands touching the sides of the SP4. If I use the stand without touching the sides, and I try and tap or scroll using my finger on a webpage or OneNote (actually nothing works; even the desktop), it's like the screen
 doesn't even recognize that I'm touching it; again, it seems to only work when one or both hands is touching the sides of the SP4. This issue also occurs when I have the stand closed, and I have the SP4 leaning on something (For example, on my headboard of
 my bed when watching Netflix and I'm laying down). This issue is such a pain in the butt. Is there any settings or something that I can change to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a ZAGG InvisaShield HD Glass screen protector, but I highly doubt this is the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    HELP! My windows media player won't turn on. None of my music will play. I can't get any of my .mov files to run from my memory card in either windows media player or the media center. What can I do??????

<p>okaaay...i have done the first two things you have suggested...no luck, my media player still does not even open. I have also updated my version of quicktime &amp; also have just downloaded the convert thing from microsoft windows. Nothing works. I have used
 my media player in the past, but it has been a long time. I just don't understand why it has quit working! I'm not sure what you mean by a third party player??? When I go into the media center &amp; go to the music &amp; click, it says "a necessary component of windows
 media center is currently not available"....what does that mean? Also, if I have my memory card from my camera in &amp; am in the media center, it will not recognize any of my movie files...just assuming that is because they are .mov files?</p>
<p>Still need help...obviously I'm not very good at this stuff....so please any other ideas would be great. Thank you so much. :)</p>

<p><span><span>Hi daisygirl88,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Have you installed any third party players?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Did you try to make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Are you getting any error messages or error codes?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try the following steps to
<strong>rebuild the Windows Media Player Library database</strong> and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;Select all the files in the folder, and then click
<strong>Delete</strong> on the <strong>File</strong> menu.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Restart Windows Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Exit Windows Media Player.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;If you are running Windows Vista, click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;Select the
<strong>Media Player</strong> folder, and then click <strong>Delete</strong> on the
<strong>File</strong> menu. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Restart Windows Media Player.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, you may refer the following article:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to
<strong>install quicktime</strong> and then media player might use the codec to play .mov files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may
