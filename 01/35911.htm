<h2>            Startup error after incomplete factory restore</h2>
                    <font><span>I have an HP tx2500z AMD Turion laptop with Windows Vista Home Premium. I am trying to restore it to factory condition but the restore fails. It overheats while installing custom HP software &amp; shuts down. I've
 tried it some 8-10 times.</span></font>

<font><span>When I try to start it after restore, I get the error. :&nbsp;</span></font><span>"Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart
 the installation."</span>

<font><span>As mentioned in another post, when I get the error, I use Shift+F10 option, start control panel from command line and add a new user. Now each time I restart, I get this error message. I am still able to use the
 computer by hitting CTRL+ALT+DELETE &amp; switching the user. How can I remove this message forever?&nbsp;</span></font>

<span>When I shutdown the computer, I get a message that another user is logged on i.e. "Administrator" which confirms the above error message on startup.</span>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For errors and problems with the Manufacturer's&nbsp;Recovery to Factory Settings Software you will have to contact them.</p>

I'm not asking how to fix overheating. I've dealt with that&nbsp;ad infinitum with HP. In short, HP won't own up the mistake. So I'm stuck with a laptop which won't let me install Windows Vista completely from the recovery disk.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>However, I'm still able to make it work. My question is, there's an Administrator user that throws an error on startup each time. I can use the laptop when I switch the user on startup. How can I get rid of this error.</div>

            Sorry, I have to say you aren't trying to understand the question. I have a machine where Windows is throwing error messages and I am looking for a way to fix that. I am able to log in by switching user &amp; everything works fine. Just that error message
 that makes Windows think that something is wrong. I need to get rid of that.&nbsp;
<div>Please stop suggesting me to contact HP or re-install Windows. I'm on this board for a Windows specific problem. I don't think an error message that doesn't affect functionality should warrant a re-installation.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you mean to tell that it is buffering?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What type of Internet connection do you use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the possible reasons could be the internet speed due to which the time it may take to buffer. It has to one or more of the following that could cause this;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I assume when you use the term "upgrade" that you actually performed a clean install. In other words, you booted from the Windows 7 disc and completely wiped the Windows Xp partition. That is the only way to go from Xp to Windows 7 as there is no upgrade
 path for that. <br />
<br />
If I am correct above, and you now have Windows 7 installed, are you able to connect to the internet? If so, you should navigate to Windows Update from Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Windows Update. Choose to check of updates. The updates for most drivers will appear
 in the "Optional" or "Recommended" update list as opposed to the "Important" update list.

<p><br />
By, "I have updated all the drivers I can find" you mean you confirmed the hardware components in your system were supported by their respective manufacturers under Windows 7 (they supply drivers for Windows 7 for their products) and downloaded them and saved
 them to external media to use later <em>before</em> you did the clean installation required to go from Windows XP to Windows 7?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
All hardware support including the software and drivers necessary for the hardware to function under any given operating system always has and likely always will come from the hardware manufacturers.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You need the drivers for the motherboard chipset, network device(s), video device, audio device and so on.&nbsp; You need to know what the manufacturer is for each of those and get them manually.&nbsp; If your machine originally came with Windows XP it is entirely probable
 that the manufacturers do not supply Windows 7 drivers for the hardware and you would have been better off sticking with Windows XP on that particular hardware setup.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
What is the make &amp; model of the machine in question?<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>As for not mentioning the company name - I don't know why not.&nbsp; If they did not tell you something similar to what I just did, then their service is lacking.</p>

            <p>My computer is a Dell XPS 625, and I went to Dell to upgrade all the recommended drivers.&nbsp; I continue to get the message that the WIndows 7 installation cannot find an AMD AHCI Compatible RAID controller.&nbsp; So I cannot install.</p>

<p>I am beginning to think that my CD/DVD player may be the problem.&nbsp; Maybe that is why it says the "floppy is not connected and the audio cable is not connected.&nbsp;

<p>I have followed the directions with the WIndows 7 disk about copying by current files and I have all my original installation disks--so I think I should be able to upgrade any drivers I need to after the installation.&nbsp; I just can't install the WIndows 7.</p>

            Go into your bios (system settings) and disable Raid/AHCI. Now reboot the computer and boot from the Windows 7 disc. You should now be able to install Windows 7. If you are not able please provide the complete make/model number of your motherboard. We'll
 then need to locate the drivers, place them on a usb drive then point setup to the drivers during the installation.

<br />
You updated the drivers on your computer BEFORE you attempted to use the Windows 7 install DVD?&nbsp; If so, that was not necessary, and may explain your problem if you somehow installed Windows 7 drivers in your current Windows XP system (although other than the
 video drivers, most of the Windows 7 downloads for the XPS 625 seem to be non-OS-specific firmware updates rather than driver updates, so using these ought to have been OK).<br />

<h2>            Using my USA xbox 360 in the UK</h2>
                    
<p>i purchased a USA XBOX 360 about 12 months ago from best buy. &nbsp;i am now moving to the UK and i am trying to work out if the newer Xbox 360 will work in the UK or not. &nbsp;i understand i will need to change the plug / power cable and i may need to change the
 power adapter, but i saw something about TV compatibility issues too. can someone shed any light on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>i know i need to set up a new gamer tag if i want a gold subscription, (as i had this issue when i came over here)</p>
<p>i have a Sony TV, about 3 - 4 years old in the UK that i will be linking to.</p>
<p>i just dont want to lug my xbox all the way to the UK if it is not going to work.</p>
<p>thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>tv's in Europe use a different plug for analog audio/video but you should have no problem using HDMI.</p>
<p>Other issues with be Region Locked games and you won't be able to play any of the PAL disc based games that you would find locally. Another issue may be dealing with warranty service being that you have a USA console and will be in the UK.</p>
<p>Good luck abroad. Be safe.</p>

<p>To use a US 360 in the UK you will need to be aware of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>BUY A NEW UK COMPATIBLE POWER BRICK FROM XBOX CUSTOMER SERVICE! - Sorry for the caps, but this is the most important thing. The US power brick will not work in the UK and will be damaged if you plug it in.
</li><li>If you are connecting via HD cables (component or HDMI) you shouldn't have an issue. 720p and above are standard both in the US and the UK. Lower video resolutions do differ, but most newer UK TVs are multi-standard and should work.
</li><li>DVD Movie playback on the US Xbox will be Region 1, so you will not be able to play UK DVDs. Any US Region 1 DVDs (or region free DVDs) will continue to work fine.
</li><li>Game discs are a little trickier. Microsoft leaves region coding up to individual publishers and DOES NOT advertise region status on the box. As a general rule, most first party games are region free as are many third party games where one publisher distributes
 the game in every territory. A region free "PAL" labeled game will play just fine in your "NTSC" US Xbox 360. A region locked game will fail to boot. You'll probably want to rent (or check compatibility lists online) before buying.
</li><li>Your US based Xbox Live account/Gamertag will continue to work just fine (and you will be able to connect to the US version of Xbox Live from within the UK). If you wish to keep using it, you can, but you will need to purchase Gold time and MSP from US
 sellers, such as Amazon.com. Older Gold codes are generally region free, but there have been reports of newer Gold codes being region locked. MSP codes are ALWAYS region locked.&nbsp;
</li><li>Digital items purchased on your US account and downloaded to your Xbox 360 will continue to work. Digital items purchased on your US account while you are in the UK will probably download just fine (as the two territories have a lot of licensing crossover),
 but there is always the possibility that a specific download will be blocked in the UK if the US publisher of it does not have distribution rights there. Really, this is the same thing that US and UK players with Japanese accounts (for purchasing items released
 only in Japan) have to deal with today. </li><li>You have the option of creating a new UK account (and thus having two Gamertags) or converting your US account to a UK account. If you convert, current points, time and items will transfer over, though there is a disclaimer on the Microsoft site that some
 digital items will not make the transfer due to licening restrictions. </li><li>So long as a UK game boots up in your US Xbox 360, you can use your US Gamertag to log in, play online and earn achievements. Achievements are based on game ID and are not impacted by region.
</li><li>No matter what you do with your account, you will not have access to region restricted US apps. On the flipside, you WILL have access to region restricted UK apps, even if you keep your US account.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that covers most of it. Hopefully that gives you an idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>Hi OllyBush81,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We really recommend using a console from the region you are located in in order to play without any issues. There is the issue with the power supply but there will also be constant issues with region based content and many games purchased in the UK will
 not work on a console from North America. There will also be issues with an account based in the US when playing in the UK. If you are going to be living in the UK for an extended period of time, then you might ant to consider a
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
region migration</a>. Hope this helps clear some things up. Thanks!</p>

            Hi Rik.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />All ways are here to enable the hidden Built-in Admin to Create a new Local Admin  account, sign into it, move your files over, check all programs run from it or reinstall them as needed, then when ready delete the old account and hide the Built in Admin again since it's only used for emergencies:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create bootable media to access Command Prompt to enable Built-in Admin or if that fails do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt to try Option Five to enable the hidden Admin account to create your new account.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />If you need to rescue your files use this method:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi rikhamrick 
<br />
<br />If you purchased that device and it is locked by the previous owner, you best option is to clean install Windows 10 on that device to set that up as your own . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Why does Windows 10 not load properly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Windows 10 a few days ago, and it worked fine for about 2 days.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, all of a sudden, out of nowhere, a message came asking me for my password.&nbsp; I tried to type it in, but I could not.&nbsp; The computer then shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every since, I have had nothing but grief.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I get is a screen, with the Windows 10 logo on it.&nbsp; Underneath, are a few white stars , that rotate for about 1 minute, and then I et a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Tuesday evening I spent looking at that blank screen.&nbsp; Nothing was happening at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do have the Windows 10 installation files on USB, and tried to install from them.&nbsp; With some help, I managed to 'kick-start' the system, so it would install Windows 10 from my USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system re-set the whole computer, and this morning I had a completely bare Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; But my thought was, I needed to re-start the machine, and load in Windows 10., since I cannot keep the machine switched on all the time. &nbsp; This did not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to launch the operating system, it does not work.&nbsp; I am on an infinite loop, where Windows 10 thinks the operating system is NOT on the computer.&nbsp; I try to install it, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Dear Krishna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;Sadly, a reset of the machine does not work. &nbsp;It is so frustrating, when I know the machine has Windows 10 installed on it, and yet does not start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most progress I have had is to say to 'Install Windows'. &nbsp;The system teases me, but then, just as I am about to get the thing done, it asks for a product key. &nbsp;(As I understand it, Windows 10 should NOT ask for this, as it is a free upgrade). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the system still does not launch. &nbsp;My machine ha been ide for the last week. &nbsp;I have called Microsoft Support, but they do not get me any further either. &nbsp;3 calls all today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please, PLEASE help me with the launching of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours</p>
<p>Marek</p>
        </p>

            On the Xbox store there is usually a section that tells you which platforms a game can be played on. As others have said it is an Xbox only game so the section will only have the Xbox console on it.

<p>At the moment RDR2 is not available on PC and I'm sure it will be sometime as it was with GTA V.

<p>
</p><p>But i highly doubt that it would be on Microsoft store rather it would be on steam I guess. But you would still be able to use your Xbox Controller.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Be aware that if you buy a Xbox Game through the Xbox Marketplace, that you get the Xbox console version of the game.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is (not yet) available on PC. So the only way to play it on PC is to stream it from a Xbox One in your home network to the Xbox App on your PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you can use a controller to play the game. In fact, you'll have to use a controller, as you play the game on the console that way.</p>

    <title>Voicechat being cancelled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rozn90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Voicechat being cancelled</h2>
                    <p>When I start a voice message on my mobile apple device, the standby mode activates after a few seconds and the voice message that I was creating is cancelled/just disappears. This means that the function does not overrule standby mode, like with normal calling.
 Is there a solution to this, other then prolonging the timeout of standby from my device? Or is this something that is to be changed by Skype?</p>
<p>Ty in advance!<br />

<p>Well, instead of typing you can send a voice message. When it is recording and phone goes into auto standby the message just disappears as you never started recording the voice message...</p>

                    I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1&nbsp;to windows 10 (Oct 31) on my new Asus laptop.&nbsp; I have been waiting for the upgrade to version 1511 notification that I can upgrade and nothing yet.&nbsp; My husband has gotten the notification and has successfully upgraded.&nbsp;
 Should I have received that upgrade to version 1511 by now and if so how do I get it?

<p>Quickest way to Get Windows 10 is to just click the Windows 10 link below then click the Blue "Upgrade Now" button top left of the page.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Blue Screen of Death &#40;BSOD&#41; from BugCheck 0x0000003b</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Recently I've encountered several Blue Screens of Death (BugCheck 0x0000003b) while my system has been idle. Here are the hardware details:</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div style="margin-left: 30px">motherboard - Asus P6T SE<br />
motherboard bios - 0908<br />
processor - Intel Core I7-930<br />
memory - 12GB<br />
disk - SanDisk Extreme Pro (SDSSDXPS-480G-G25 –480GB)<br />
disk firmware - X21200RL<br />
video - ATI Radeon HD 4550<br />
network - Realtek 8111C</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered similar crashes awhile back. These were caused by Cisco's acsock64.sys kernel driver. An update to Cisco's AnyConnect VPN software (to version 3.1.13015) seemed to resolve the problem as I went several weeks with no crashes.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>The crashes returned today just after I installed JabraDirect version 3.4 for my Jabra Biz 2400 USB headset. I've since removed the Jabra software. Anyway, I'd like to know if this BugCheck was again caused by the acsock64.sys driver or something else.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Complete memory dump from the most recent BugCheck 0x0000003b is here:</p>

<h2>            How can I undo OneDrive&#39;s changes of redirecting &#34;This PC &#62; Pictures&#34; location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I tried OneDrive and have since unlinked it from my computer. I have rebooted several times, but "This PC &gt; Pictures" still directs to the OneDrive folder location instead of my User accounts pictures folder (same for Documents).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried setting up OneDrive again and changing it's folder location, as well as disabling syncing documents and pictures before unlinking and rebooting again. I have also tried deleting the OneDrive folders entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Example:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"This PC &gt; Pictures"&nbsp; Goes to "C:\Users\Me\OneDrive\Pictures"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change it back to go to "C:\Users\Me\Pictures"&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Chris.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I also root my User folders in OneDrive for years without problem here, but have learned how to recover User folders on occasion which is covered most thoroughly here so you can always get it back by whichever method works there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Pictures folder &gt; Properties &gt; Location Tab doesn't have a Restore Default Location button, or there is no Location tab, then use the method to restore it and after you have the shell User folder present under  C:Users\Your User Name with the Picture icon on it signifying it's the official Shell User folder, you can transfer from any other Pictures folder to it and delete the duplicate Pictures folders.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>WLANUHN.sys Driver Bad - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p. m. bingham  say:</h3>
<h2>            WLANUHN.sys Driver Bad</h2>
                    Hello, thanks for taking time to help me. Windows XP Pro SP3. I keep getting a blue screen error, it shows the above mentioned file as the culprit, (page in non-page). I used device manager to update the driver (it belongs to my wireless USB on&nbsp; my old
 computer that connects it wirelessly to my modem), it did do an update, but I still get the blue screen error. What will happen if I uninstall this driver, unplug the wireless USB and plug it back in again? Will it just find the update it already did? Do I
 need to get with my service provider for an original driver file? This happened after the recent March Updates. Nothing else has changed, except an update to Adobe Reader. I am about ready to turn this old spare computer into extra storage, it is really a
 headache ;-)) By the way, I do have restore points, and a backup, anybody know how I can pull just this driver from the backup? I would hate to do 2 months worth of updates just to fix this. THANKS!

</li><li><span>Step4:</span> Click Repair to fix dll error and other found PC errors in seconds.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
WLANUHN.sys error can be caused by any of the below possibilities.
<ul>
<li>You installed certain program that caused the WLANUHN.sys file was overwrote with an older version or a version which is incompatible with the current setting.</li><li>A bad or incomplete installation of certain program which cause the WLANUHN.sys file missing or incomplete.</li><li>The WLANUHN.sys file or its related registry entries was deleted maliciously or mistakenly by virus/spyware or other users.</li></ul>
<p><br />

<h2>            Log off windows user</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious how to log off other users on a windows10 machine.</p>
<p>Former versions of windows I could log off users using the task manager. I no longer see this ability on windows10.</p>
<p>I have users log on then walk away. If I want to log them off I have to change user to their account and then log them out.</p>
<p>Please tell me how to log them off using admin privileges.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I did actually say what I was using, "Contacts". It is accessed from Start &gt; Then type Contacts in the search box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit &gt; I have found the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have Windows Contacts open in Windows 7, any created groups are listed right there in amongst the Contacts, they have a slightly different icon to show they are a group though instead of an individual contact. Double clicking on that brings up the
 group of contacts, and also a link to Group help page in Win 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is good now, as I use Windows Contacts to sync with my iPhone Address Book and now I can maintain the groups on the desktop or on the iPhone :o)</p>

    <title>New Skype design for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kalex10  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype design for Mac</h2>
                    <p>In the classical version of Skype it was very convenient to select the contents of the main window: the history or contacts (Onlline, All,...). The only problem is that on one failed day all contacts began to appear offline,&nbsp;although in fact they are online.</p>
<p>In Skype 22.03.02 version the contacts appear just in &nbsp;pop up window&nbsp;and it is very inconvenient. In addition, the program does not remember the user. Every time while opening the program, you have to re-enter the user name and password. These innovations
 discourage the desire to use the program which was very convenient once.<br />

<p>Hi Daphne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons why the microphone of your Windows 7 laptop is not working and you are getting the error message
<strong>"An error occurred when trying to get access to microphone. Media Constraints not met."
</strong>when making a video call on Facebook. It can be because of changes made in the settings, compatibility or hardware issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For us to better assist you with this concern, we need to ask a few questions:</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you accessing the Facebook application or using a browser? </li><li>Were there any changes made prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you checked if the microphone is plugged correctly and not on mute?</li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?<br />
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For further assistance, you can also contact Facebook Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>if its still acting up , try this below.....</p>
<p>go into settings and accounts and remove all the profiles , (make sure you have the email and password to get them back ) after you remove the profiles , shut the xbox down by holding the xbox logo on the console for 8 seconds till it powers down , while
 it is off , unplug your modem and router for 30 seconds to clear them also , plug the modem and router back up and when they are online , turn the xbox back on , when it is all the way up , re add your main profile ...it may sit there and sync a little while
 but all SHOULD be good afterwards ...</p>

            Hi shirleyvacca,
<br />
<br />The USB ports on the Surface and the dock don't have enough power for some peripherals. You need to use a POWERED USB hub most likely.
<br />
<br />As well:
<br />
<br />-Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter
<br />- Uninstall the USB Drivers
<br />- Make sure your connection is not obstructed by anything
<br />- Make sure the USB external drive is powered
<br />- Unplug Everything from the Surface and Restart it
<br />- Check for recent Microsoft updates
<br />- Try another USB drive (if you have access to one), thumb drive, etc. to make sure other USB devices are working
<br />- Plug in the USB external drive to another computer and see if it works
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need more help       
        </p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with my computer's disk space. I recently had gone to task manager to figure out why my PC was running so slowly. Apparently, my disk space is at 100% and some weird processes are clogging it up. I have found programs like "Microsoft
 Edge (11)", "Cortana (2)", "Windows Shell Experience Host", "Windows.WARP.JITService.exe", "PnkBstrA.exe", and "System interrupts". The main reason I am trying to find info about these processes is because none of them have publishers, and most of them are
 named after real Microsoft applications or considered Background Processes or Windows process. I don't know if these are part of new windows updates or they are viruses</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could occur if there are changes in system settings. For us to isolate and identify the issue better, kindly try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong><span><span>: We </span></span><span><span>suggest that you perform the system maintenance troubleshooter. It will resolve the common system problems:<br />
1. Click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Search bar</strong>.<br />
2. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without the quotes and click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
3. Then click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>System and Security.</strong><br />
4. Click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>System Maintenance</strong>.<br />
5. Click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the&nbsp;issue still persist, refer to the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><strong>Perform a clean boot.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Perform a Disk cleanup.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To delete temporary files:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search for<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Disk cleanup</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>from the taskbar and select it from the list of results.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Files to delete</strong>, select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you need to free up more space, you can also delete system files:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Disk cleanup, select&nbsp;<strong>Clean up system files</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 4: Scan for any viruses.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Defender and Windows Firewall are on your device to help protect it from viruses and other malicious software. But if you think they've missed something, download and run the<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Malicious

<h3> dariomeloni  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History on a Network drive isn&#39;t backed up automatically</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 on two computers, on a desktop and on a laptop.</p>
<p>The desktop stores the file history on a spare (local) disk without any problem and is always up to date with the recent file history changes.</p>
<p>The laptop has instead some problems. It's setup to store the file history on a network drive shared on the my home network, but it is never actually done. It just stores all the history on the laptop itself and I have to manually force a synchronization
 in the file history settings to get it to actually send the data to the network drive.</p>
<p>Also the laptop is mostly used at home, and the drive has always been accessible via the wireless connection, I don't understand why is it not working.</p>

<h2>            Is there a video editing program that I could use.</h2>
                    I've been asked to edit a video together. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 and Office 2010. &nbsp;Is there a simple video editing program in there?

            <p>Same answer.&nbsp; Those other video editors don't have support for importing a AVS4YOU project file.&nbsp; The only thing you could export is the final movie from there and then treat it as a video file in another video editing app.&nbsp; But the constituent parts would
 not be accessible, just the combined video and audio.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you want to be able to work on a project and continue working on another PC, your best bet is to have exactly the same software on both computers.&nbsp; You would also need to have identical folder layouts in order to transfer the source files (videos, photos,
 audio) and make them available in the same locations on the other PC.</p>

            <p>I did add more detail to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-wlinstall/movie-maker-wont-launch/e0692afa-40e4-4429-a47c-7323b8b950d3">
your prior thread</a> if you would like to further diagnose your issue with Movie Maker.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for your current question about AVS4YOU, my guess would be that the VPS is a project file that is unique to that program.&nbsp; In other words, the other person that would continue editing your project would have to have the same editing program, the project
 file and all the source files in the same locations on their PC.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All video editing programs are probably very similar in this respect.&nbsp; For example, in Movie Maker, when you are adding items to your project, adding transitions, etc.&nbsp;they are getting recorded in your project file.&nbsp; In the case of Movie Maker, this is a
 .wlmp file.&nbsp; A project file doesn't contain any actual video, photos or music, just the current editing state of your project.&nbsp; It will contain a
<em>list</em> of all your source files (the folder and file name of the relevant media file) along with details on the edits made, transitions/effects/titles/captions added, etc.&nbsp; But it is not a file that can be understood by other video editing programs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In order to share the results of your edits, you would have to save the resulting movie into a video file.&nbsp; There are numerous formats to choose from.&nbsp; For example, the latest version of Movie Maker can save in MP4 or WMV format.&nbsp; That can be used in other
 programs.&nbsp; AVS4YOU lists a number of formats too.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, that would result in a single video file with all your edits incorporated.&nbsp; It wouldn't have the split points, individual videos/photos, transitions, etc.&nbsp; So basically, once you start editing in one video editor, you can't really transfer that
 session to another video editor except as a completed movie.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are some exceptions, for example Adobe makes it so their other products understand Photoshop and Illustrator files, or that&nbsp;part of a project&nbsp;in Premiere can be linked to an After&nbsp;Effects project.&nbsp; Another example is that a Movie Maker project can
 be imported into Nero Video 2014 for further processing.&nbsp;But it has to be designed for and isn't common&nbsp;when going to another&nbsp;video editing program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us a little more information about your system? What's the make and model of your PC? Can you tell us the driver that's loaded for your camera? When you say it's not working, does that mean if you launch the Windows Camera app your camera isn't
 shown? Or are you receiving and error when you launch the Window Camera app? Or is it another app you are trying to use that doesn't work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some troubleshooting steps you can try and a walk through of how to get more information on your camera:</p>
