<h2>            Bug&#58; after installing any antivirus in windows 8, vpn can not connect anymore&#33;</h2>
                    <p>this is a <strong>big bug</strong> that too many people have in windows 8 and i dont know why no body try to fix it in microsoft!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>simple: vpn could connect easily on a clear windows 8 but when you install any antivirus(Avast,kaspersky,nod32,...) that has a firewall it cant connect anymore!!!</p>
<p>i used almost any protocol(PPTP,LTP,SSTP) to connect but the result is one of these :</p>
<p>1 error 619</p>
<p>2 error 809 </p>
<p>3 error 720</p>
<p>4 it connect but no internet access!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>please just search and see how many people reported the same problem on the forums!</p>
<p>and please fix it...</p>
<p>thank you.</p>

            <p>Which VPN system are you using that cannot route through 3rd party firewall programs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, did the Windows built-in firewall ever ask you to approve the VPN you use, or was it automatically configured to pass through?</p>

            I do not recall being asked to approve the VPN I use. I just got a new computer with windows 8. The very first day, I accepted a trial period of full Avast protection and all &nbsp;was going smoothly with the VPN, using it every day almost. Then the trial period
 was over and I went back to free avast protection. After I restarted the computer the VPN connection did not work. I have tried every solution I could find out there (apart from something to do with IP range athingamajing that I don´t understand), nothing
 has worked, including uninstalling Avast and deleting everything from the registry, avast-related. Did not work.&nbsp;

<h2>            Freezing and Stuttering PC &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    I recently added a water cooler to my pc and&nbsp;a few days later it started to at random moments. The first this I did was to check the CPU for any hardware conflicts and or error, nothing showed up on any of the reports. Next, I did a scan on the memory,
 again nothing unusual&nbsp;or out of the ordinary was reported. From there I went through a slew load of tests (<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">mdsched.exe,</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">SFC,
 HD and registry defrag, etc...)&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;still nothing came up. Then I did a "Fresh Start" and&nbsp;the system froze and crashed when I restarted&nbsp;it again. The Fresh Start couldn't proceed, it had to revert back to its original&nbsp;state, don't know what else to do
 from this point.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi
</span>Arod_Bx<span>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The power supply is the most overlooked computer component. If you installed something that is not compatible with your power supply and motherboard, your
 computer will operate in an unusual behavior. In most cases, the issue will not be easily detected through software troubleshooting. It will require a physical check-up on your computer hardware part installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>To ensure that we can provide the appropriate resolution for your concerns with your computer, we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Does your computer overheat prior and after installing the new water cooling system?</span></li><li><span>What is the exact make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>What is the brand and model of your new water cooling system?</span></li><li><span>What is the voltage requirement of your water cooling system?</span></li><li><span>What is the total wattage capacity of your power supply?</span></li><li><span>Do you have a program that can check the temperature of your CPU and GPU?</span></li><li><span>What were the recent changes made on your computer’s software side (ex. installing programs, changing Windows Settings, etc.) before you experienced this issue?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far on your end?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Did you receive any error messages?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

            I was in the process of running Fresh-Start again to recreate the error message and this time around it went through completely with no errors along the way. It appears&nbsp;that things running smoothly again with none of the issues I've had beforehand. I've
 been running multiple programs at the same time and things seem to be running smooth. I would still like to know what was the cause in order from it happening again. But for now, it's to&nbsp;be continued.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p><span>This happens if you assembled a computer with different hardware parts with different brand and specifications. Some motherboards do not work with other devices and recognize it
 as unknown. Hence, making your whole computer setup became complicated or not to work properly at all.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regardless if you perform any software troubleshooting or
</span><span>even reinstalling the whole operating system</span><span>, performance issues like freezing and desktop
 stuttering will still persist due to hardware incompatibility on your computer setup. Having a clean install is a fresh start and should have no errors anymore unless the operating system files became corrupted again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You will need to determine how your motherboard communicates before looking on the software side</span><span>.
 To avoid a complicated setup, we suggest that you <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">contact your motherboard/computer manufacturer</span></strong> and confirm what are the hardware parts that are compatible with each other when combined (CPU
 or processors, hard disk, RAM, power supply, network adapter, sound card, video cards, etc.).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once they provided the information, have a clean install of Windows again and tell us what happens. Usually, they will suggest to use hardware parts that were approved by them for
 standard computer setup.</span></p>

<p>I knew it was too good to be true, after three days and during a bios update things took a&nbsp; turn for the worse.
</p>
<p>It happened during a bios update out of nowhere&nbsp;a BSoD (<strong>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</strong>) and add more injury to the situation it is now freezing on the Welcome Screen (while in Safe Mode as well).&nbsp; Found two restore point to choose as
 options but both attempts&nbsp;failed. </p>

            Just wanted to follow up from&nbsp;where I left off. Last week opened up the box and reseated all the components and removed an&nbsp;old CD/DVD&nbsp;drive from the system. A week in already and everything seems to be in order (<strong><em>fingers and toes crossed</em></strong>)
 boot-time has even increased as well. There were no other conflicts with the parts and the motherboard as per ASUS' site.&nbsp;

<h2>            Touchpad Drag and Drop</h2>
                    <p>I just got my new computer, the Inspiron 15 5000 Gaming laptop, and I'm trying to change my touchpad settings. I was to be able to double tap, drag, lift my finger off the key pad for a second, then continue to drag. I can't find the Dell Touchpad settings
 link. Is there any way to change this?</p>

</p><p>Sounds like the feature you're looking for is ClickLock or Drag Lock. &nbsp;Those are special features of some touchpads, so the options aren't part of Windows itself, but if Dell still does it the way I remember, they put their touchpad options here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;Right-click Start and choose Run</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Type MAIN.CPL and click OK</p>

    <title>Case Review not working. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Case Review not working.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>So I got suspended from Xbox Live in an unfair/excessive manner (it has a lot to do with going from Good to Avoid Me in one day, due to cheaters reporting me for calling them out on it), and now I'm trying to submit a Case Review to make my point, but I
 can't access the questionnaire...when I click it it, and then accept the terms, it just says "null", and then two buttons: Submit or Exit. Am I not allowed to do this, or is this a technical issue?<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>FCPCatalyst,</p>
<p>&nbsp;You can only submit a Case Review when you've had an Enforcement action placed against you by the Xbox Live Enforcement team like an Account Ban, Communication Suspension, etc.. There is not currently a process in place to do a Case Review against your
 current reputation status.</p>

<p>I appreciate the reply.</p>
<p>I have a suspension on my main account "FCPCatalyst", this one "FCPCatalyst93" is just an account I created to be able to access the forums.</p>
<p>In my other account it says I'm not eligible for a Case Review "yet", and that I have to fill a questionnaire, but then when I click it there's a bug on the page, it just says "null". Maybe this is because Case Reviews are still in a sort of beta mode?</p>
<p>I'd really like to be able to get my point across to moderators, I really think I have a chance of averting this suspension. It was really harsh considering the context of the situation.</p>

<p>Have you tried a different Web browser to see if you get the same error? Some Case Reviews require you too review the code of conduct before you can submit one but I'm wondering if the NULL error is browser related or something specific to your case. I know
 other users have submitted case reviews and received responses back. </p>

<p>Yes, I've tried with Chrome, Firefox and IE, still get an error.</p>
<p>This whole situation is strange tbh, first I went from Good reputation to Avoid Me in one day, then Enforcement permanently suspends me for calling a cheater "***", which, while not a good thing, is hardly worthy of a complete suspension...and now I can't
 even explain what happened, or ask for a more detailed explanation. You don't just ban someone with 9 years of XBL for communication stuff, especially if there were no threats involved. I was an ambassador aswell, which makes it worse.</p>

<p>Same thing happened to me, 10 year veteran - green then red in one day, with 7 reports in 6 &nbsp;months. And no explanation, just canned responses to my inquiries. Taken to social media, reddit, sent a dispute to microsoft legal, polygon, IGN, etc. I suggest

<p>The worst problem of it all is a got a permanent suspension because of that "Avoid Me" stuff. I had 3 temporary communication-only suspensions before, one back in April 2013, one in November 2014 and one in March this year, now they think that I did something
 very wrong because of the false "Avoid Me" and banned me. I'm 99% sure of it.</p>

<p>I wanted to check in to make sure you are signing into your suspended account when you try to submit a Case Review? Since you are posting from a secondary account, double check that you are signed into the suspended account when you attempt the Case Review and let me know if the results are the same. </p>

    <title>Wacom Stylet Precision with Surface Pro 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wacom Stylet Precision with Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>What is your Wacom Stylet precision with Surface Pro 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience shows an imprecision up to 3.5mm. This imprecision is unacceptable for photographic applications (like Adobe Suite, including Photoshop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contacting Surface Support, after a replacement Stylet and after a replacement Surface Pro 2, the imprecision problem up to 3.5 mm still perciste. My service call to Microsoft has been closed without any solution. Hoping that Microsoft's engineers
 come with a solution quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have the same imprecision with your Surface Pro 2? Please note that most for the screen surface is accurate to ±1mm. The largest discrapencies are located on the right side of the screen (1st 20% of screen area).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following picture shows the areas found imprecise with the two tablettes tested. Pointing to the black dots with the stylet leaves a read dot as indicated in the picture.</p>

            <p>NorthMan07,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see about what you see as far as offset goes but I observe the greatest imprecision to the left of the screen.&nbsp; I am right handed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the Surface Pro 2 with my favorite painting software, My Paint http://mypaint.intilinux.com/</p>
<p>the offset is an outrageous 5 - 7 cm even with calibration.&nbsp; See my post here - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfhardware/surface-pro-2-with-wacom-drivers-not-working-with/f4718580-483f-4fa5-a319-54fde25ed778</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely hope that Microsoft attends to this problem.&nbsp; I purchased this tablet for digital art and sketching, this offset issue is completely unacceptable and reason enough to return the Surface Pro 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />So just to make sure I am on the same page. The save as option as shown in the screenshot by you is not available on two surfaces?
<br />
<br />The first thing I would check is what version of windows each device is on. 
<br />
<br />To do that you can open the settings app &gt; system &gt; about
<br />Then look at the version. 
<br />
<br />Would you be able to check what version the two surrfaces that are not working are on as well as the devices that do work and let me know. 
<br />
<br />The other thing to try is to repair the photos app on the devices that are not working. 
<br />
<br />To do this you can:
<br />Open settings &gt;apps
<br />Search for "Microsoft photos" and select it
<br />Click advanced options
<br />Then click "repair"
<br />
<br />If it still does not work after the repair then I would suggest to do the same steps except choose "reset" this time.

<h2>            How do I open a Word document with Word Web App, from the Skydrive app in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    My children have Windows 8 laptops.
<div>They used to tap on the metro Skydrive app, see a list of their documents, and tap on the one they wanted. &nbsp;They then clicked on an Edit link and were given the option to edit either in the Word Web App or in locally installed Word.</div>
<div>Now, they're not given such an option: the desktop comes up and displays a dialog saying that they need to subscribe to Office 365.</div>
<div>How can they use the Word Web App directly from the Skydrive metro app?</div>
<div>This is really frustrating - there seem to be several major things that now don't work intuitively (or at all) following the upgrade to Windows 8.1.</div>
<div>I'm really hoping I'm just missing something.</div>

            <p>My metro app has always launched my locally-installed Office to open a file, but maybe that's because I've never tried using it without Office installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would think of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you don't plan on buying the Office programs to use on your computer, I'd recommend just uninstalling them.&nbsp; Then they won't be there to open by default at all.<br />
</li><li>Visit SkyDrive.com (you can pin it as a Start screen tile even).&nbsp; It looks a lot like the metro app, but it's 100% guaranteed to launch any file you open via the web editor.</li></ol>

<div>Your second suggestion is particularly helpful. However, I'd be really grateful if someone could tell me how to get the SkyDrive tile working properly. Surely it should be integrated with the web apps as it used to be...</div>

            <p>Hello Lori,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is format of DVD that you use?</li><li>Was the DVD working before on this computer?</li><li>Is the issue specific to this particular DVD?</li></ol>
<p>The issue might arise with the specific DVD with corrupt sectors or incorrect format to be run on Windows Media Player. In order to diagnose the root cause of the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>To rule out the possibility of a <em>bad </em>CD/DVD, try to play the discs in another system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, please check for the media format of the discs you're are using to know if the CD/DVD drive supports those file systems. There are many different formats and if you’re using a burned CD/DVD from someone else, the format used to burn it could
 be incompatible with your computer. To check for the formats, please refer to the link below:</p>
<p><span><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-cd-dvd-format#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Which CD or DVD format should I use?'</span></a></em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p>Try to run the following troubleshooter that helps you fix problems relating to CD/DVD drives not reading discs.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/cd_dvd_drive_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Fix problems with CD or DVD drives that can’t read or write media</span></a></em></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to run the Hardware troubleshooter do check if there is any device issue.</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us?entrypoint=lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I share an internet connection&#63;</h2>
                    Currently my Windows 7 laptop computer is hooked up to my Windows Vista desktop computer with a CAT 5 cable, as to share internet. For hours I've been trying to find a way to connect the desktop PC to the internet, but even after following the same instructions
 from different sites over and over, my desktop cannot connect to the internet. I know it's possible, so what am I doing wrong?

            If I were you, I'd follow Smitty's advice and get a wifi adapter for your desktop. IMO, one with a cable (either a USB cable or a cable to a detachable antenna) is more desirable because otherwise the antenna is stuck between the back of the desktop computer
 and the wall.<br />
<br />
For example: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=33-166-056&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=5&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Keywords=%28keywords%29&amp;Page=2#scrollFullInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=33-166-056&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=5&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Keywords=%28keywords%29&amp;Page=2#scrollFullInfo
</a><br />
<br />
This one is for an internal PCI slot, with 100 cm remote antenna cable: <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=33-166-020&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=5&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Keywords=%28keywords%29&amp;Page=1#scrollFullInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=33-166-020&amp;SortField=0&amp;SummaryType=0&amp;Pagesize=10&amp;PurchaseMark=&amp;SelectedRating=5&amp;VideoOnlyMark=False&amp;VendorMark=&amp;IsFeedbackTab=true&amp;Keywords=%28keywords%29&amp;Page=1#scrollFullInfo</a><br />
<br />
Note that the first of the two above is wireless-N but the second is only wireless-G.&nbsp; We don't know what type of wireless router you have.&nbsp; Wireless-N is backwards compatible with wireless-G routers.<br />

<h2>            Doppelte Downloads nach DRM &#38;&#35;220&#59;bertragung&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ich habe soeben meine DLCs an meine neue Xbox 360 S 250 GB Konsole gebunden und klicke auf Xbox.com nun meine Inhalte in die Downloadwarteschlange um sie an die neue Konsole zu binden. Ich beginne mit den Arcade Games, welche ich wie alle anderen Inhalte
 von meiner 120GB HDD auf die neue 250GB HDD mit dem Transfer Kit kopiert habe, und da wird erstmal Limbo erneut heruntergeladen und jetzt auch Trials HD obwohl die sich auf HDD befinden. Limbo habe ich nun doppelt. Einmal mit Datum von 2010 und einmal mit
 Datum von heute. Hat das was mit den Marktplatzeinstellungen zu tun die nicht beim Festplattentransfer kopiert werden? Das war aber bei 2 Bekannten auch schon so als ich für die den Festplatten und DRM Transfer gemacht habe das diese Datei nicht kopiert bzw
 verschoben werden konnte. Vielleicht weiß ja jemand hier mehr darüber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warum wird etwas nochmals komplett heruntergeladen obwohl ich es schon auf der Festplatte habe? Nur um ein Spiel an die neue Konsolen ID zu binden werden die Downloads gestartet, erreichen sofort 100% Download da sie schon auf der Festplatte sind. Nach Limbo
 und Trials HD lädt jetzt auch noch Shadow Complex mit über 800 MB. Und ja... ich habe lahmes Internet, DSL 1000.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffrontforen.de%2fwcf%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fsmile.png" /><br />
<br />
Aber dennoch die Frage warum das ganze und kann ich die doppelte Datei mit dem alten Datum dann löschen? Bin mal gespannt wer mir das genau beantworten kann.
</p>
<p>Sogar einige Rock Band Songpacks werden, obwohl schon auf Festplatte vorhanden, erneut heruntergeladen.</p>
<p>Ich versteh das alles nicht. :(</p>

<p>Oo Normalerweise wird da doch nur die Lizenz heruntergeladen, nicht nochmal das gesamte Spiel.</p>
<p>Den Thread werde ich weiter verfolgen und bin mal auf Antworten gespannt. Muss das demnächst nämlich auch machen, wenn ich mir ne neue Konsole zulege.</p>

<h2>            BURNING A DVD ON WINDOWS PLAYER</h2>
                    I have some home movies shot on mini discs using a Sony Handycam. Can I edit parts of each disc and burn them onto DVD using Windows Media Player. I had to finalise these discs so they would play on my DVD player, so I don't think I can edit them on my
 camcorder. Would appreciate a simple step by step instruction if I can.

            Windows 8 can't natively burn these type of DVDs. You need to install Windows Media Center or a third party App such as Cyberlink's Power DVD or VLC Player. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.

<br />
<div>========================================<br />
I'm afraid this will be a very long answer.&nbsp; There will be <br />
several steps between the Sony DVD and your completed <br />
Video DVD.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player is a viewer...it cannot edit video <br />
and it cannot burn a Video DVD that would play on a<br />
free standing DVD Player. <br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
First, the video files on the DVDs should be copied to a<br />
folder on your hard drive. The following article explains <br />
how to access the drives on your Windows 8 PC.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 - RT - How to work with files and folders<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/files-folders-windows-explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/files-folders-windows-explorer</a><br />
(Begin at&nbsp; :&nbsp; Windows Part - 1. Navigation Pane)<br />
<br />
These following steps apply to non-copy protected DVDs.<br />
(FWIW...breaking the copy protection on a commercial <br />
DVD is illegal)<br />
<br />
Right click the drive letter of the drive the DVD is in and <br />
from the menu choose...Open or Explore. This will display <br />
the directory of the DVD. <br />
<br />
Open the VIDEO_TS folder and copy the .VOB files to<br />
a folder on your hard drive. <br />
<br />
FWIW...if editing was not required...you could import<br />
the VOB files directly from the DVD into Freemake Video <br />
Converter and burn a Video DVD.<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
As for editing the video...Movie Maker may be worth a try...<br />
it is included if you download and install Windows Essentials.<br />
<br />
Get Movie Maker<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/get-movie-maker-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/get-movie-maker-download</a><br />
(Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8)<br />
<br />
It is possible that you may be able to import the VOB <br />
files into Movie Maker just as they are but if problems<br />
arise you may need to convert them to the .WMV format <br />
before importing.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available on the net...<br />
some free, some retail...the following freeware&nbsp; <br />
is just one example that works well for me.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 )<br />
(***Carefully read *all* the install screens...there <br />
may be some items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
Once you have the editing completed, save your <br />
project in the .WMV or MP4 video format in a folder <br />
on your hard drive..<br />
<br />
===<br />
<br />
As you have discovered...DVD Maker is not included in<br />
Windows 8 as it was in Vista and 7...so you need to acquire<br />
DVD Authoring software from a third party source.<br />
<br />
(the easiest method may be Freemake Video Converter...<br />
find info included at the end of this message)<br />
<br />
There are many DVD Authoring programs available<br />
on the net...some free, some retail...<br />
<br />
The following article offers comparisons of several retail<br />
DVD Authoring programs.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 causing Blue Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzzls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 causing Blue Screen</h2>
                    I have been using this Mouse on Windows 8 and then 8.1 for a long time. &nbsp;The last few days I have been having connectivity issues with the mouse, and have changed the batteries several times. &nbsp;Today, for the first time on this computer, I had a blue screen
 appear. &nbsp; This has happened 4 times today, and tends to happen when the mouse appears to be running out of the power, and I am trying to power it on and off. &nbsp; I contacted Geek Squad and they tuned up the computer (cleaned up the temporary files, startup files
 and registries, etc) and installed updates. &nbsp;However, the blue screen appeared again. &nbsp; Unlike past instances of the blue screen of death (BSOD) with older versions of Windows, my computer starts up again. &nbsp;However, the problem is very annoying and possibly
 damaging to the system, and makes me not want to use the mouse, which I find invaluable. &nbsp; Is there a way to fix this problem?

            <p>Thanks for the quick and very detailed reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my responses to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you receive any error codes or messages when the blue screen occurs? &nbsp;Yes - it said&nbsp;<span>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>2. Are you able to connect and use other Bluetooth devices without any issues? &nbsp; I can pair my smartphone, but haven't been able to send files. &nbsp;I'll try my bluetooth keyboard later.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. What is the make and model of the computer? &nbsp; Acer&nbsp;</span>Aspire M5-481PT. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Do you remember making any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to the issue? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;I contacted Geek Squad and they ran a tune up and installed updates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I searched the Event Viewer yesterday and found a system log relating to a reboot without a clean shutdown, which seemed to have been recorded at roughly the same time as my last blue screen. &nbsp;The general description for the log is
 "</span>The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly<span>." &nbsp;It reads:</span></p>

    <title>System and Memory Compression &#40;ntoskrnl.exe&#41; weird behavior - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> broax  say:</h3>
<h2>            System and Memory Compression &#40;ntoskrnl.exe&#41; weird behavior &#40;high CPU usage&#41; regarding some webpages</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have this weird problem. Sometimes my computer starts to slowdown a bit and I couldn't figure what was causing it. It was more noticeable when I was browsing facebook but I couldn't figure a pattern.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">What happens is that the whole system begins to lag pausing everything that is happening (for example resulting in choppy video playback) for a split second. So today I decided it was time for a fix. First I did the usual, ran ccleaner,
 malware bytes, etc. But it didn't fix it. So I dug deeper and I saw that the "System and Memory Compression" process was getting a very high CPU usage (35% and even up to 60%).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">After trying everything I could find to fix it I noticed that this only happens when I start to scroll down on my facebook feed. Then I tried it on another website that keeps loading content as you scroll down (9gag) and the same thing
 happen. I tried it on firefox and it's even worse there. The thing is&nbsp;<span>AS SOON AS I CLOSE THE TAB&nbsp;</span>then system memory compression's CPU usage goes back to normal and the system responsiveness goes back to normal!</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I can replicate this 100% of the time. I start scrolling down fast (the faster you go the better), chrome's CPU and memory starts to go up and then after a short while chrome's CPU/memory usage go down and System Memory Compression's
 CPU usage goes up and stays up even if I stop scrolling. From that moment forward the system is laggy and unresponsive until I close that specific tab (I don't even need to close chrome). After the tab is closed everything goes immediately back to normal.
 Like I said with firefox it's even worse. I just need to open facebook and System Memory Compression's CPU usage jumps to ~35% and the system slows down.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Every other program seems to run fine as far as I can tell. Games run well, and everything is smooth. It's just when I scroll down on these types of webpages (that load content as you scroll down) that I get this weird behavior...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I seriously tried everything I could find online. I went through dozens of google results but nothing was able to fix this. It doesn't seem to be a memory leak as memory usage both on the browser and on this system process seem "normal"
 (~200MB).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p>My system specs: </p>
<ul>
<li>OS: Windows 10 </li><li>CPU: Intel core2quad Q6600 @ 3.0GHZ </li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 560ti </li><li>RAM: 8GB DDR2</li><li>Everything that is being used (OS and relevant programs) are all installed on an SSD.</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span>TL;DR:</span>&nbsp;Whenever I scroll down on pages that load content as you scroll (like facebook or 9gag) System Memory and Compression's CPU usage skyrockets and the system becomes slow and unresponsive. Closing only that tab completely
 fixes everything.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>EDIT: </strong>I just tried to replicate this issue on my office computer and it only happen when the facebook tab was using over 1.5GB of memory (this computer only has 4GB of RAM). My home computer has 8GB of RAM and this
 issue can happen with as little memory usage 100MB or something silly like that... It really looks like the memory compression isn't working properly and instead of compressing data when my memory usage is high it does it randomly... At least with web browsers
 (everything else seems to work fine).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>EDIT2: </strong>I'd like to add that another strange behavior is how the CPU usage for this process remains low (raising and falling between 0% and ~5%) until it seems to "jump" to over 25% and then it gets stuck with high CPU
 usage until I close the problematic tab. It's as if there the process got caught in some sort of loop where it isn't doing anything significantly useful (at least apparently) other then using CPU cycles.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>EDIT3: </strong>For the sake of being detailed I'd just like to go on record saying that I've uninstalled any useless program from my computer (you know? the sort of program you install to use once and then forget about it...),
 ran system file integrity check, ran CCleaner with the usual maintenance tasks and ran a scan with malware bytes. Everything came back OK. I also tried to disable MemoryDiacnostic tasks, SuperFetch and other "popular" fixes... Nothing did the trick... :( Also
 since I've always had "lackluster" computers I tend to be very selective with which startup processes I leave enabled and I'm very careful about what I do with my computer... I'm not one of those persons that celebrates his luck while opening that suspicious
 "Congratulations [WINDOWS USER #14213]! You won an iPhone!!" banner...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><strong>EDIT4: </strong>Quick note for future reference. Apparently in Safe Mode everything works normally... So there must be some setting/program/file/process that is causing this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p><strong>EDIT5 (final edit I hope):</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;Y</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>ou just need to launch Chrome, go the the address bar
 and type "chrome://flags" and then search (ctrl+F) for "#disable-accelerated-video-decode". By default this should be "off" but if you turn it "on" you disable it (you turn on "DISABLE" so that's why "on means off"). Disabling hardware accelerated video decoding
 should fix this issue with minimal&nbsp;collateral&nbsp;problems. See the last&nbsp;reply for more information.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">So, after busting my head around this I found a way to "fix" this problem.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">First the problem: Apparently Chrome uses the video card memory instead of system memory to store the videos (and perhaps other stuff) on your feed. The problem arises when Windows System and Memory Compression tries to do its magic
 on the video memory (which I can only guess it's unable to do). When the video memory gets close to full the System and Memory Compression process CPU usage shoots up and stays up (apparently forever). The video memory isn't compressed and I can only guess
 the process keeps trying to compress it.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">That's why the test ran fine in Safe Mode. Because in safe mode display drivers aren't loaded and instead uses it's generic drivers. And that's also why when you disable WebGL everything works fine. But WebGL is awesome and very
 useful in many sites so I didn't want to disable it and I also didn't want to try rolling back my video drivers unless I didn't have a choice so here is a way to fix this problem. Instead of disabling WebGL altogether just disable hardware accelerated video
 decoding on google chrome.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">To do this you just need to launch Chrome, go the the address bar and type "chrome://flags" and then search (ctrl+F) for "#disable-accelerated-video-decode". By default this should be "off" but if you turn it "on" you disable it
 (you turn on "DISABLE" so that's why "on means off").&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Here's my results after multiple tests:&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">As you can see with&nbsp;#disable-accelerated-video-decode ON I was able to scroll down on facebook until I reached the tab memory limit and the page just stopped loading. With the flag on it's default position (off) the System and Memory
 Compression process bugged just over 400MB. Also if you see with the flag "on" the video memory isn't affected while I scroll but with the flag "off" as I scroll the video memory usage goes up finally bugging why I'm about reaching the memory limit.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I tried some WebGL enabled pages and everything seems to be working fine and even with hardware video acceleration disabled I'm still able to view 1080p@60 youtube videos without any significant performance problem.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>The thing is disabling this feature is only a temporary fix. There is clearly a bug that affects at least some users with video cards that have 1GB or less of memory which I would love to see fixed but I have no clue if
 the problem is with chrome, webgl, nvidia or microsoft... So to whom should I forward all this information? Can anybody help me with that?</strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Either way at least now my computer is working as expected... I'm leaving all this here because 5 other people are claiming to have the same problem and I hope this can help them. :)&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>EDIT:</strong> Btw, I can't mark my own posts as answers so if any mod wants to mark this post as an "answer" feel free to do so... :) If some mod could suggest to whom I should report this bug that would also be awesome!

            <p>If you have a router, the odds are very high that no one is accessing your computer -- unless there is malware
<strong>already </strong>installed on your computer.&nbsp; The connections you see have been established by various processes running on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The numbers following the colon (:) are port numbers.&nbsp; There are various lists of common ports and what they are used for, such as:&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>You can also use the -o switch with netstat (for example, netstat -a -o).&nbsp; This will show you the process ID (PID) associated with each entry.&nbsp; If you then run Task Manager with the PID column showing, you can see what is using each port (if you don't see
 a PID column in Task Manager, click View &gt; Select Columns).</p>

<h2>            My Xbox live game won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t completely download to my Xbox 360.</h2>
                    
<p>This summer I purchased Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas off of Xbox Live. I went to go download the games and&nbsp;they&nbsp;download to 79% and then I receive a message that reads "Can't download game". I went round and round with Xbox Support trying to figure things
 out. I deleted the corrupt data and ran the hard drive clean up and re-downloaded the games, still 79% and I received the same message. I have not received an error code at any point. While working with Xbox Support we trouble shot and determined that my hard
 drive was corrupt. I replaced/upgraded my hard drive from 250gb to 500gb brand new Microsoft product, not the aftermarket hard drives. I downloaded my profile and all 36 games (all ranging from 100mb to 8gb per game) I already had with out a problem. In the
 same day I attempted to download Fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas, Civilization, Rainbow Six New Vegas and Red Faction Guerrilla all giving me the same error message at 79%. I even tried everything while my internet was hardwired into my Xbox 360. I also have
 300+ GB free of space. Please help. It's super frustrating, especially when I have spent a day and a half talking to Xbox Support and purchased a $75 new hard drive.</p>

<p>This is typical when you account region doesn't match your physical location. Certain games are region locked and can't be downloaded by simply changing your account region. Can you confirm your account region versus your current location?</p>

<p>Hi Lorien,</p>
<p>What I meant was system restore. I had lost some work about a month ago (it just vanished and was not even in the recycle bin) and stupidly thought that a system restore would help to get it back - obviously that was the wrong way to go about it anyway.
 The message I now get 2 or three times a day is that the last backup&nbsp;failed (not that I actually knew the computer did backups) - the error code is 0x810000ED. What I'd like to do is reverse my system restore attempt because according to the message that is
 the problem. I don't know if that's enough detail - as you can imagine I'm far from being an expert!</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<p>It can be done but I don't know if it will work after all this time.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:

<p>Here's a link to a thread that discusses pretty much the same problem (same error code at least) and the solution marked as an asnwer may work for you as well (though I have my doubts if you aren't doing backups but it's worth a try).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try to find some other solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi Loren,</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's not working. When I go into system restore and press "next", all I see is "confirm your restore point". I can't find "undo system restore" at all. Maybe&nbsp;the following&nbsp;will help&nbsp;- when I get the message that the back up was unsuccessful
 I also get the message "system restore changed your backup setting. Review your backup setting (0x810000ED)." But I just can't see what to do.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Alan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.I have looked at the back up and restore centre (having clicked on the control panel) but can't see that this can help either. What I don't understand about the whole thing is that I&nbsp;don't do backups (I know I should) so why do I get the message that
 the last backup failed and that I should review my settiings? I hope I am making sense.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the effort to get a solution on this situation.&nbsp; I spent hours going through the process as described by HansV MVP and unfortunately my problem still exists.&nbsp; Let me go a little deeper into my situation to see if anyone can come up with something
 for me.........</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all let me say that Microsoft Word and Excel are working perfectly for me, no problems as far as creating documents.&nbsp; My problem is that when I try to save a document in "save as"&nbsp; the program goes to "not responding" and I have to exit it and restart
 the program.&nbsp; Also let me repeat that my wife's side of the computer has no problems like this at all.&nbsp; She would be using the same settings as I am as far as the registry and I can't figure why I'm having trouble and she's not.&nbsp; I am leery of changing too
 much as she's not having trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another item that may or may not be related to the problem with Word, I use Windows Live Email and sometimes when I start a new email and attempt to add an attachment I also get a message that Windows Live has stopped working and I have to restart
 that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems aren't terrible and I can usually work around them which is what I've been doing.&nbsp; It would seem to me that this should be a simple solution, all that's needed is to find that solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all your help!</p>

            <p>This is also happening me and I have lost unsaved data. When I click save as and try to select a destination Word closes down and restarts, without saving anything. I've never experienced this before. Please help.</p>

            <p>Yes, I upgraded to Windows 10 last week. I should also mention that Word only shuts down and restarts when I select 'Save As' and then try to browse in my 'OneDrive' folder, it does not happen when I browse 'Computer'.</p>
<p>

            <p>My problems started after my upgrade to Windows 10 also.&nbsp; It seems that there were many bugs in this upgrade and we are being left to work them out.&nbsp; I ran Windows 7 for years without a problem and as soon as I upgraded to Windows 10 I've had trouble with
 "Save as".&nbsp; I honestly believe this to be a Windows problem now and hope they come up with a solution.</p>

            "save as" causes several apps to simply stop and shut down.&nbsp; I know other people with the same problem. We are waiting for a solution and are actively proclaiming STAY AWAY FROM WINDOWS 10 - IT IS DISFUNCTIONAL

            Thanks Jettdriver, I've learned some things about Windows 10 and if I had to do it over again I never would have upgraded.

<p>Hi Ratandeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the effort to get a solution on this situation.&nbsp; I spent hours going through the process as described by HansV MVP and unfortunately my problem still exists.&nbsp; Let me go a little deeper into my situation to see if anyone can come up with something
 for me.........</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all let me say that Microsoft Word and Excel are working perfectly for me, no problems as far as creating documents.&nbsp; My problem is that when I try to save a document in "save as"&nbsp; the program goes to "not responding" and I have to exit it and restart
 the program.&nbsp; Also let me repeat that my wife's side of the computer has no problems like this at all.&nbsp; She would be using the same settings as I am as far as the registry and I can't figure why I'm having trouble and she's not.&nbsp; I am leery of changing too
 much as she's not having trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another item that may or may not be related to the problem with Word, I use Windows Live Email and sometimes when I start a new email and attempt to add an attachment I also get a message that Windows Live has stopped working and I have to restart
 that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems aren't terrible and I can usually work around them which is what I've been doing.&nbsp; It would seem to me that this should be a simple solution, all that's needed is to find that solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all your help!</p>
<p>Dave</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Me too. I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and this not responding business has happened many times in Microsoft programs, especially Live. emails. If I open an added attachment before sending, to check what's on it or to amend something, that's the finish
 of it. The program freezes, stops responding, won't save and won't even close.&nbsp; Windows pops up with that ancient furphy about looking for a solution, but it's lost.&nbsp; I just have to try to remember to copy the email first, and to check the files before adding
 them as attachments.</p>
<p>I've asked for assistance in another thread but have had nothing but irrelevant questions so far.</p>

<h2>            Fallout 3 not running on win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm running win10 on an HP pavilion 15 and fallout 3 won't run at all. I checked the requirements for the game and the only issue I may have is my video card, but I doubt that's the problem because it hasn't stopped me playing anything like skyrim, borderlands,
 farcry etc.</p>
<p>I've tried running both the game and my laptop in compatibility mode and run the game as an admin and it crashes as soon as I select new game, I've tried running it on several different win drivers back to XP and it's still not working. I can't run it through
 games for windows marketplace either because the application doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>Is there any possible solution for this or should I give up? Thanks!!</p>

            <p><em>"the only issue I may have is my video card, "</em></p>
<p>The only issue ? Well, if it can run Skyrim it can run FO3. Just out of curiosity... What brand and model graphics card ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- FO3 has <em>always</em> been problematic, and there are a number of fixes/tweaks to help make it more stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; (This applies to the retail disk version) </p>
<p><em>Install</em> using Vista sp1 compatibility mode (you can select Vista sp1 after installing, but installing with</p>
<p>Vista sp1 may work better).<br />
- To install in compatibility mode close the install/setup window after autorun&nbsp; launches the installer .<br />
Then&nbsp; go to - <em>Start / Computer .</em> Next,&nbsp; R/click on the DVD drive, and click open - and R/click -
<em>setup.exe</em>&nbsp; - then <em>Properties</em> ,&nbsp; and set compatibility to&nbsp; <em>Vista sp1</em> .
<br />
Tick <em>run as administrator</em> as well... just for luck. ;D<br />
Now start the install directly from the <em>setup.exe </em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a) There can be benefits to not installing to the default location - <em>Program Files( X86</em>).
</p>
<p>Make a new folder for your games. In the C: drive will do, but if you have another Partition or HDD use that option.<br />
The main benefit is to avoid 'permissions' problems, especially when modding games, but it can help with other issues as well.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; b) Patch the game. I have only gone as far as 1.5, but they go to 1.7. Be sure to use the correct language version (there is a UK and US English version). Patch 1.6 &amp; 1.7 mostly address issues with&nbsp; Mothership Zeta &amp; Point Lookout expansion packs.<br />
<br />
2) (All versions) - The game has a problem with quad-core processors. </p>
<p>This will cause the game to lock-up at the Birthday part, if not sooner.</p>
<p>- Open up the&nbsp; fallout.ini&nbsp; file in&nbsp;&nbsp; My Documents\My Games\Fallout3&nbsp; (make a copy first for backup)<br />
Find the line:<br />
bUseThreadedAI=0&nbsp;&nbsp; (Open the ini file with notepad - Click Edit - then find - copy this line
</p>
<p>and paste it into the find what&nbsp; box)<br />
<br />
change it to:&nbsp; bUseThreadedAI=1<br />
<br />
Add another line (hit Enter on keyboard)&nbsp; after it and insert:&nbsp;&nbsp; (copy and paste the next line)<br />
iNumHWThreads=2<br />
<br />
This will limit the game to 2 cores and prevent the engine bug from causing the game to freeze.<br />
------- For people who still crash --------<br />
Instead of iNumHWThreads=2, change it to iNumHWThreads=1<br />
<br />
3) Download and install the Windows 7 Codec Pack (works on Win10 too). This will fix an issue with
<em>ffdshow codec.</em><br />
<a href="http://www.windows7codecs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windows7codecs.com/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
- If you still have problems visit&nbsp; FO3 Nexus - the best site for all things FO3 and Bethesda.</p>
<p>There should be a patch/fix at the Nexus that addresses issues with GFWL,&nbsp; if that continues to be an issue.</p>
<p>- The Nexus also has Unofficial patches, which fix a lot of bugs in the game.</p>
