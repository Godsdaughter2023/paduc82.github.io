<h2>            Internet connection constantly dropping during certain activities. Please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've recently run into an issue where whenever I have Youtube or streaming services running like Twitch.tv, my internet connection will cut off shortly after I enter the site. The internet icon will have the yellow sign with the ! on it. This happens
 sometimes on text based sites like forums and emails but not nearly as quickly or frequently as these streaming sites. Sometimes unplugging and replugging the adapter in works, other times I have to restart the PC to get the internet connection back. When
 I unplug/replug it sometimes the icon will go from the PC screen with an X over it, to the bars with an X over them, to the bars with the yellow dot over them and flash between them. I've looked up various things online and have tried everything I've found
 via Google so far (23 attempted fixes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a NETGEAR WNDA3100v2 N600 Wireless Dual Band USB Adapter that is only a couple months old, and I've switched it out with another USB adapter to make sure it wasn't just that adapter being faulty. I've also tried using different USB ports. So far
 this is my list of attempted fixes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Reset router.<br />
2. Switch wireless adapters.<br />
3. Switch USB ports.<br />
4. Uninstall/reinstall drivers for every USB port with keyboard.<br />
5. Uninstall/reinstall drivers for every USB port with mouse.<br />
6. Disable/enable sound card.<br />
7. Disable/enable CD drive.<br />
6. Attempt to update graphics driver, sound, USB, everything.<br />
7. Flush DNS.<br />
8. Reset IP.<br />
9. Clean Boot.<br />
10. Make Computer Browser service active.<br />
11. Old hotfix (no longer works with my pc).<br />
12. Disable IP Helper service.<br />
13. Looked for GUID registry.<br />
14. Disabled “Wake Up” on wireless router.<br />
15. Disabled IPv6.<br />
16. Disabled WMM/Short GI.<br />
17. Disabled Bonjour.<br />
18. Uninstalled Bonjour.<br />
19. Disabled Computer Browser service.<br />
20. Disable Net Bios service.<br />
21. Disable Net Bios on router.<br />
22. Switched to Google DNS.</p>
<p>23. Disabled firewalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not very tech savvy, this is just what I've found on Google and I've had no success in fixing the issue. I'm running out of options so I'm hoping someone here can help me. I'm not opposed to trying any of the things I've already tried if someone thinks
 I may have done it wrong or missed something. If you want an event log please tell me how to create and show you one because I forget unfortunately. Thank you.</p>

<div>Well I managed to find a long cat5 cable and plug it directly into the modem. It worked then, I tried a few more things and decided to try getting a PCI card. It's been around 20 hours now and it's been fine so hopefully it has been fixed. Crossing my
 fingers that this headache is over. Thank you for trying to help.<br />

</p><p>If you provided an incorrect email address and cannot recover your account, I highly suggest to answer the recovery form:

<p>
</p><p>To help you on this, please check the following tips on how to pass the verification:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi
 or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred. </li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes.
</li><li>The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity and also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the
 best of your knowledge. </li><li>You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</li></ul>

            Hi, Connie,
<br />
<br />Did you see this symbol while charging the battery?
<br />
<br />It means the battery or charger are not recognized. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried using a different charger?
<br />Do you have another battery for testing purposes?

            Hi Connie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Check the manufacturer's Support web page for your full model number to  see if there is a battery issue or recall for it.   
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you might need to replace the battery. However I will tell you that most OEM after-market batteries and chargers have problems so I would only buy the official manufacturer's battery from the PC maker to be sure.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

<h2>            Help. Please. How to get to &#34;My Documents&#34; via a desktop shortcut...&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>I organise my work/files in a manner that LIBRARIES, with its approach to separation via file format, cannot accomodate.</p>
<p>I don't have the option of backtracking to XP's function-over-style approach. Sadly.</p>
<p>How do I put a shortcut icon on the desktop, so that when I click it, it just opens Windows Explorer at the "My Documents" level, avoiding the multiple clicks and scrolls it takes to get there in Win7?</p>
<p>I can live (if I have to) with Win7 taking stock of my stuff and shuffling it to destruction in LIBRARIES - although I'd rather switch the whole thing off - but I do need to be able to access my files quickly and efficiently from their original folders and
 subfolders.</p>
<p>I need a "My Documents" shortcut/folder, on the desktop. Or an equivalent solution.</p>
<p>I'm not a techie, so the simpler the instructions, the greater my sigh of relief.</p>
<p>All help, suggestions, thankfully received, because this is driving me nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Unless you're using a different folder than the default Documents folder, that functionality already exists when clicking the&nbsp;"Documents" link on the start menu. In case&nbsp;you don't have the Documents link enabled, right click on the&nbsp;Start button and select Properties.&nbsp;On
 the Start Menu tab click Customize and then look down the list of items for Documents and select "Display as a&nbsp;link". Clicking Documents from the Start menu opens the Documents folder directly.</p>
<p>If you still want a&nbsp;desktop shortcut to the Documents folder&nbsp;you can right-click the Documents link in the Start menu and then select "Send to -&nbsp;Desktop (create shortcut)".&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is still not quite what you want, you should be able to create a desktop shortcut&nbsp;to&nbsp;any desired folder by right-clicking on&nbsp;the folder&nbsp;in the left-hand pane of Windows Explorer and select "Send to - Desktop".</p>

<p>Wherever you might be able to turn for help, the "Microsoft Community" is not the place.&nbsp; Although these forums are hosted by Microsoft, those of us who answer questions -- particularly in the Windows 7 area -- are volunteers who are not related to Microsoft
 at all.&nbsp; This is so even for those with "Volunteer Moderator" or "MVP" labels next to their names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I think you are on the right track by having reported this issue to your local police and by considering small claims court.&nbsp; However, for what it's worth, I don't believe your argument that it's "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft's
 responsibility to make sure the items delivered to the right person at the right place" is a winner unless you can prove that the package was mis-addressed by Microsoft.&nbsp; If I were defending Microsoft, I would argue that your loss is Fedex's fault:&nbsp; either
 the package was delivered to the wrong address or the Fedex driver failed to ascertain that the person signing the package was authorized to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is your address easily confused with some other address?&nbsp; For example, if you live at 123 Apple Street, is there a 123 Apple Lane, 123 Apple Avenue, 123 Apple Court, 123 Apple Circle, etc., in your town?&nbsp;
 If so, perhaps you can get in touch with whoever might be living at an address similar to yours (depending on the type and price of the item, people may be more or less willing to admit having received it in error).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do a little research to find the proper procedure in your state for filing a claim in small claims court.&nbsp; I suggest naming both Microsoft and Fedex as defendants, and let them fight it out to determine
 who is responsible.&nbsp; See, for example, this advice regarding filing a small claims action in California (but each state has different laws concerning small claims actions):&nbsp;

            Thank you for your help and suggestion! I really appreciate it. As I consulted to the attorney, Microsoft is responsible since Microsoft hired Fedex to deliver the items. He suggest me to get a resolution with MS first before ending in small claim court.&nbsp;
 So I'm seeking suggestion here with the hope someone can guide me to the right place where I can file a complaint.

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>- I am getting no other problems after these updates were installed</p>
<p>- I don't get an error message, if I recall my computer says I am still connected to the network, but no pages in Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge or Firefox will load - and running diagnostics in those programs says that they're unable to connect to the
 network</p>
<p>- I have no other devices on the same network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the updates are causing the problem because I was unable to connect to the internet, and I called Telstra (my internet provider). They could find no problem. I then uninstalled the most recent updates on my computer which were a Flash Security
 Update and the Windows 10 update. This solved the problem with internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no option to 'Choose how updates are installed'. Instead I have 'Choose how updates are delivered' and there is no further option to 'Never check for updates.'</p>
<p>

            It turns out this update was conflicting with McAfee. There were some files corrupted in McAfee or it wasn't update, so I had to uninstall and then reinstall it. Either way, the problem was in McAfee, it was freezing every time I lost internet access.<br />

    <title>Photo Gallery - Date Taken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rau1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Gallery - Date Taken</h2>
                    <p>I have numerous .MOV files (recorded with iPad or iPhone).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are typically stored on a NAS, and the folders are included in Photo Gallery.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photo Gallery displays information about each file in a panel on the right hand side of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the top there are People Tags, then Geotag, Caption and Descriptive Tags.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Further down, there is a heading "Information" under which is various data
 including "Date Taken".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, I assume the Date Taken field comes straight from the embedded date/time info in the file.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I can examine the file with the MediaInfo tool to confirm this is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curiously, if&nbsp;I <strong>copy</strong> a .MOV file to another folder (also part of the Gallery), Photo Gallery&nbsp;(for the copied file) displays a
<u>different</u>&nbsp;value for Date Taken &nbsp;- it Displays the Date/Time that Windows Explorer shows as the&nbsp;Date modified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The particular&nbsp;date/time displayed&nbsp;is not meaningful to me (it is some months after the actual Date Taken, and many weeks before today).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Note that windows shows the same&nbsp;"date modified" value for both the original and the copied file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why does Photo Gallery display the wrong value for Data Taken for a file copied to another location?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can this be corrected - ie force Photo Gallery to look inside the file to get the correct value?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div><br />
Thank you for the information that you've provided. We would like to inform you that &nbsp;<b>Recorded date
</b>and <strong>Date Taken </strong>are different metadatas. Photo Gallery only takes information based on the Date Taken that can be viewed on the said column within the Properties section of the photo. As mentioned before, if the photo does not have a Date
 Taken metadata, it will use the Date created information.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Let us know if you have other inquiries regarding Photo Gallery.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 SP1 crashes with blue screen and error code 0x00000034 after restoring system with system repair disc and system image</h2>
                    <p><span>The hard disc on the Macbook pro had been repartioned, all boot camp and other drivers updated and Windows installed from the installation DVD. All available Windows updates from 2012 (installation disc is from 2012) until today were installed and
 restoring was started with a system repair disc and system image from an external hard disc. Once Windows loads after the log-in screen, it crashes. A blue screen appears with the error code 0x00000034 and mentioning cache_manager.... Windows restarts and
 I can only run it in safe mode which means that I can neither download nor install updates or programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Analysing the dmp-file from the first crash with Windows Debugger Tool showed that the problem seems to lie with</span></p>
<p><span>AppleHFS.sys and svchost.exe, with Bug Check 34 {107, ffffffffc0000420,0,0}.</span></p>

<li>in method 1 computer found no errors</li><li>in method 2 with &gt;bootrec /rebuildBcd we got the message: "Total number of identified Windows installations: 0"</li><li>in method 3 we got this message (translated from German with Google Translate):

            <p>Hi Jean, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the third bullet, there are some files and components that is corrupted. I strongly suggest that you back up all your files and clear re-install your operating system.
</p>
<p>Please make sure to not interrupt the installation. Remove your internet connections during the process.&nbsp; Please put it back as soon as the installation is complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp; you, </p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>perhaps the message translation in bullet 3 was not as conclusive as it should have been. In German it referred clearly to the installation disc and errors on that media. Removing the present installation, Boot Camp and Windows, and restoring again Boot
 Camp, Windows 7 system with installation disc, Boot Camp updates, system image etc would be now the 3rd time and I am quite sure we would end up with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the analysis of the dmp-file from the first and later-on from subsequent crashes, which always showed the same results, we followed another thread which led us to a solution in Apple Communities posted by David 888888 on March 22 2011 https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2780698?start=0&amp;tstart=0
 :</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"I was getting the BSOD when rebooting into Boot Camp 3.1 after attempting to update Windows 7 64-bit security patches in Windows Update. I found a solution that was posted by an IT Consultant. The problem is with the Apple system drivers for mounting
 HFS volumes. These files are AppleHFS.sys and AppleMNT.sys. Apple needs to fix these drivers to resolve the BSOD issues. In the meantime, here is what you can do to fix the problem:<br />
<br />
1) Boot into Windows Safe Mode (at black screen before startup continue to press F2, then press F8 for safe mode)<br />
2) Navigate to c:\windows\system32\drivers\<br />
3) Rename AppleHFS.sys to AppleHFS.sys.BACKUP<br />
4) Rename AppleMNT.sys to AppleMNT.sys.BACKUP<br />
5) Reboot into normal Windows mode<br />
<br />
You may notice after rebooting that Windows will no longer mount your HFS OS X volumes because these HFS system drivers are now disabled. One solution is to install MacDrive which does a better job than Apple's driver at mounting HFS volumes."</span></p>
<p>We renamed both files in our system and our problem was solved. The only drawback is that Windows does not recognize the mac partition and an exchange of files is no more possible, however this does not hamper us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will notice that in the Apple Communities discussions older Boot Camp partitions, 3.1 and 3.2, are quoted where 3.2 brought the solution. We are running now BC 5.1.5621 and the same bug seems to reappear. In our former installation we ran an older BC
 version which did not provoke the discussed issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We sort of destroyed that installation by trying to reduce the size of the mac partition to get more space for Windows. We did this with Mac disc utilities. After reduction, a new partition was created from that space and Windows disappeared and was not
 recoverable again. We had to repartition the whole internal disc and reinstall everything which led in the Windows part to our above named problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last but not least, every body should be aware, that when you install a Windows partition you have to be careful in allotting space, because you will not be able to change the distribution afterwards without deinstalling Boot Camp/Windows, repartition your
 hard disc and reinstall Boot Camp/Windows again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us we consider our problem as solved. Many thanks for your time and suggestions.</p>
<p>All the best</p>

    <title>Console thinks a headset is connected when one isn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Console thinks a headset is connected when one isn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t</h2>
                    
<p>A problem just started today. I was playing Destiny and it was showing the headset icon on my banner in game, even though no headset was connected. I connected my headset to see if it would work, and it did, then unplugged it and the icon disappeared. But
 the next time a screen loaded, the icon was back. I quit and reloaded the game several times, and it still happened. Then I restarted the console, and it still did it. So I power cycled the console, and it still is doing it. What am I supposed to do to fix
 this? Why is the console telling the game I'm using a headset when I'm not?</p>

<p>[quote user="Any1GotADollar"]How would I go about updating the controller?[/quote]</p>
<p>You'll need to connect the controller with a micro USB and to the console a standard USB 3.0</p>
<p>Something similar to this</p>

<p>Once connected to the console and controller go to settings - kinect &amp; devices - devices &amp; accessories - xbox one wireless controller - update</p>

<p>Have you tried the steps provided above by Squid CA? If not, please try that first. Does the issue persist across multiple games or specifically only Destiny? Do you have another controller you can try using?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue continues to occur and a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycle</a> does not help, I would suggest trying to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a> your console choosing the "keep my games and apps" option.</p>

<h2>            Lost cursor Toshiba laptop Windows 10 after factory reset</h2>
                    I have a new Toshiba Satellite laptop and was having continuous warnings from Avira about a virus, this would not go away and informed me that the system was locked so I couldn't uninstall the program causing the problem. I was advised to do a System Restore.
 On completion of this my laptop, which is not a touchpad screen, goes through the opening set up correctly but I then have no cursor to enable me to use my laptop. I have closed the lid and started again several times and it goes through the opening process
 but still the same.

    <title>Since the update, my X1 can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t reliably log me in or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew vosper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Since the update, my X1 can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t reliably log me in or connect to Live.</h2>
                    
<p>When I log in, I usually get either a&nbsp;0x87DD0017 or&nbsp;0x87DD0019 error. When I can finally get logged in, the system doesn't seem to be able to connect to Live. If I go to the network settings menu to run a connection test, it tells me everything is good to
 go. It even says my NAT is open. In the rare case that I can both log in and appear to get connected to Live, everything (the store, friends, what have you) seem to work only intermittently. I've done the ten second reboot, I've reset it to factory settings,
 I've used the offline diagnostic tool, I've reset all my networking hardware, and tried a wired and wireless connection. I've even left it unplugged for several hours. All of this gave the same results.</p>
<p>This is the only device that I'm having any sort of trouble with. I can also log in with my account anywhere else that I've tried (a 360 and two PCs). I spent nearly two hours on the phone with support and didn't make much of anything in the way of progress.
 I'm not sure what to do at this point.</p>

<p>exactly the same for me man. called them and they linked me this port forwarding thing but I can't make any sense of it. extremely hard to understand, and really, after paying an inane amount of money for this console, I shouldn't have to understand it,
 it should just work. nothing but trouble from day one. let me know if you have any luck sorting it out man.</p>

<p>I am having the exact same issue. Ever since i downloaded the update the other day I have not been able to connect reliably or play anything without difficulty. Once logged on, when i actually can, almost nothing is available from online multiplayers to
 apps like nexflix. everything just tries to synk with the app and fails. Im getting really frustrated with this because none of my other friends are having this issue, but I'm glad I'm not the only one so maybe this will get fixed asap. Destiny comes out tomorrow
 and I would like to play it!</p>

<p>Same with me. &nbsp;Downloaded Minecraft; have not been able to play it yet. &nbsp;When I do get into xbox live, it treats me like I'm trying to cheat them out of the game saying they want the disk, and is it really me that's trying to get into the game. &nbsp;I checked
 the billing, they were sure quick to charge my account. &nbsp;Glad (and not so glad) that other people are having problems and it's not my rig that's bad. &nbsp;Really frustrating! &nbsp;I haven't called them yet, but from prior posts, doesn't sound like it would help anyway.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you perform the system file checker scan as the administrator?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you have any security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform check disk and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click on
<b>start</b><br />
b. Type <b>cmd</b> in start search box<br />
c. <b>Right click on cmd.exe</b> in the Program list and then select the option
<b>Run as administrator</b>. If you are prompted for an<br />
administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click <b>
Continue</b><br />
d. In the command prompt Window, type the following command and press enter <b>
Chkdsk /R X:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: In this command,
<b>X</b>: is a placeholder that represents the <b>drive letter of the volume that you want to check.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press Y when you are prompted to check the disk the next time that the system restarts.<br />
b. Close all applications, and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>After the computer restarts, repeat steps a through d for the other volume, and then check if the Disc cleanup works.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:
</b>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, any data available on that might be lost</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also refer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Check a drive for errors</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try running the System file checker scan in administrator mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also perform a complete virus scan using the
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to do an online scan of your computer by visiting the link mentioned below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: There is a chance of data loss if any files are infected and which may be deleted in the clean up process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps and keep us posted.</p>

<h2>            X1 Elite Controller not Charging</h2>
                    Hi there. I recently got an elite controller about a month ago and it has been working fine so far. I have been using the reachargable batteries and they have ran out for the first time. However, when i tried to charge the controller nothing happens. I
 have tried to charge it with the usb cable coming with the controller and with other cables. Nothing works. Any advice?

</p><blockquote>I have been using the regular reachargable AA batteries that come with the wireless x1 elite controller. It isnt the play and charge kit.[...]</blockquote>
<p>The AA Batteries that came with my Elite controller are NON-rechargeable Duracell batteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using rechargeable AA batteries, they will also NOT charge through the USB cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the specific battery pack of the Play and Charge kit can be charged via USB. If you look into the battery compartment, between the battery contacts, you should see three "golden" contacts. These are for the Play and Charge battery pack, and only those
 contacts provide the charging capacity for the Play and Charge battery pack. No charging current is sent to the AA battery contacts, as the controller can't know if you inserted standard non-rechargeable AA batteries (which might explode if charged), or if
 you are using rechargeable AA batteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore it's not possible to charge AA batteries inside any Xbox One controller.</p>

            Hi Stephen, your keyboard language needs changing
<br />
<br />Your keyboard is UK English but is set to US English
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Language
<br />Click Options on the right hand side of your current language setup
<br />
<br />If US and UK English is showing, set UK English as the default and delete US English
<br />
<br />Otherwise, click 'Add' input language
<br />
<br />Add UK English, then set as default and delete US English

            <p><span>Hi otev,</span></p>
<p><span>Before proceeding with the windows updates follow these methods.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Reset the Windows Update components.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span>
</span><span>Disable the<span>
</span></span><span>security software</span><span> temporarily.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect
 your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected
 to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b><span>Put the computer in </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Clean Boot</span></a><span> state
</span><span>before proceeding with the update installation
</span><span>to see if there is any software conflict as clean boot helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, return the computer to
<b>Normal startup mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also install the updates (KB number) manually by downloading from Microsoft download center.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description I understand that On-Screen Keyboard appear on your desktop whenever you click on magnifier and whenever you try to type something from On-Screen
 Keyboard it removes the cursor. It seems like the issue is related either with the inconsistency with the system files or due to missing updates. We need few more details to understand the cause of the issue better.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error message while using on screen keyboard?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently?</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer the links:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-is/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to check Windows update history</a></span></p>
<p><span>In the mean time
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if you get the error while using On-Screen Keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to boot in safe mode. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode of a computer operating system (OS). It can also refer to a mode of operation by application software.
 Safe mode is intended to fix most, if not all problems within an operating system. It is also widely used for removing rogue security software.<br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode without any errors, I would suggest you to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from
 the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to
 start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you still face the issue please follow method 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure that all the Windows Updates are installed on your computer as the issue may be occurring due to some missing security updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps to install available Windows Updates. Make sure you run the Windows Updates while your mouse is connected to your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the
<strong>Start </strong>button, type <strong>Windows Update </strong>in the Search box, then click
<strong>Windows Update</strong> in the results pane.</span></li><li><span>Click
<strong>Check for Updates</strong>. After the scan is&nbsp;&nbsp;complete, click <strong>Review optional updates</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click the check box next to the updates, then click&nbsp;<strong>Install updates</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If prompted, review the license agreement, then click
<strong>I&nbsp;Accept</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the onscreen instructions to download and&nbsp;install the updates.
</span><span>If prompted, reboot your computer.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also go through the following article based on
<strong>On-Screen Keyboard</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 Support Engineers" respond with for every question, it's better you just don't say anything.&nbsp; Sounds like you've never used the OSK, and with a response like that I wouldn't be surprised if you were a computer program, designed to give the same response every
 time and shift blame away.&nbsp; You get these poor naïve people in here, with maybe not much computer experience, asking questions and because they don't know any better, you probably don't either, you'll have them jumping hoops for days.&nbsp; Have them disabling
 startup programs one by one, running DISM, SFC, system restore, uninstalling virus software, and when it all fails, because it will, because these things have nothing to do with the problem being that the software is ****, you're going to say: "I strongly
 suggest and believe reinstalling windows is the only other solution."&nbsp; They'll do it, because they think you know what you're talking about, (you apparently don't)&nbsp; and all that happens is they waste days jumping your hoops between their jobs and kids, lose
 everything thats accumulated on their computer and be left with frustration because it didn't work.&nbsp; And other people are going to see your worthless response and go through the same ****.&nbsp; You should be ashamed, no telling how many people and hours of theirs
 you've likely wasted.&nbsp; To <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c15ba615-ed6f-448d-9e12-0bc700ca5aee" title="marisolguerrero45">
 icon it'll pull up whatever was the focus when you've minimized it.&nbsp; Isn't it great when you want to type in a box and you click the icon and it brings back the task manager?&nbsp; It doesn't go away like it should, or come back like it should.&nbsp; It's just a big
 clunky bastard.&nbsp; Oh, the best part?&nbsp; The daily notification for the "important updates" to the dictionary. Because people can't wait for the monthly updates, i guess?&nbsp; No, we can't delay another second.&nbsp; It's very important, when the user types 't-w-e-r' it
 we must make sure it suggests "twerk" or "twerking."&nbsp; "Great job guys, now get working on tomorrow's word so we can inform the users of the important update."&nbsp; In case you can't tell by now, this OSK bugs the s**t out of me.

 things work good and right, the best thing to do is just pin it to the taskbar and close it everytime you leave the current page, and re-open it the next time you need it.&nbsp; Don't leave it 'on.'
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I suppose there is a difference between our systems. My OSK experiences are on Windows 8, in case you one day decide it might solve you problems.&nbsp; The amount of frustration this OS has given me since it's introduction, when I impulse bought&nbsp;the "upgrade"&nbsp;with
 their limited time sale.&nbsp; Its probably taken at least a year off my life, and I am almost jealous of your 7 because I know the **** I've dealt with, mostly solved by now, mostly, wouldn't have taken place if I had saved that 15 bucks.&nbsp; Sorry all who paid the
 40 in the beginning.&nbsp; Or if you paid extra for the bastard named Media Center</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2:&nbsp; Well ****,&nbsp; I'm probably wrong, in that Win 7 keyboard is probably&nbsp;better than Win 8. Microsoft.&nbsp; Guess I should have expected it</p>

            <p>hi, i just want to say that this problem started the moment i bought this computer. i checked Windows Update and i have all of the updates installed.</p>
<p>non of them failed.</p>
<p>and ive gotten no error messages due to this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;i re-started my pc in safe mode and it still has this problem. this might be a bug everyone else has, but up to now ive only found two other people nagging about it in the internet (no unswers yet).</p>
<p>as per doing a &nbsp;clean boot, i dont see the necesity, this problem didnt get started by any software i installed recently.</p>
<p>i posted this problem as marisolguerrero45 &nbsp;by mistake, we share the same pc.</p>

<h2>            Offline Update for Windows Defender Antimalware Server 2016</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone please help me out? I have a standalone network with no outside connectivity, our vulnerability scanner keeps hitting our Server 2016 box with a hit regarding the Antimalware Malware version being outdated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to find a place I can download the full offline update, but all I can find is automated ways to update the engine which obviously won't work for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Called Microsoft, they want me to pay $500 to pay for a single support ticket to solve what should be an incredibly simple issue.
</p>
<p>
