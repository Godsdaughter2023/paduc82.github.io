<h2>            Skype constantly setting me to Available</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I check Skype on my Android phone, it changes my status on my desktop version of Skype to Available.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to prevent it from doing this?&nbsp; It is getting to the point where it is likely better to just uninstall it from my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the categories listed at the bottom are comically bad.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hewo!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my computer has been freezing alot, it always freezes at random times and after a random amount of seconds it un-freezes.</p>
<p>Sometimes when the computer freezes for over 10 seconds the internet disconnects and i need to re-plug it, and if over 60 seconds it can sometimes crash with the error "watchdog violation". The only thing i could of thought of causing this was a corrupted
 windows update.</p>
<p>The only thing I've tried to do to fix this is increasing the virtual memory and doing memory diagonstic. None of those worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>List of things computer does while frozen:</p>
<p>Any sound playing in the background at the time of freeze will stutter,</p>
<p>Keyboard won't work,</p>
<p>Mouse won't move</p>
<p>and the display with freeze.</p>
<p>

            Hi Cata<br /><br />I am afraid that the best solution at this point is to perform a clean installation of Windows 10 using the steps in the guide below. <br /><br />you will have to reinstall any of your applications and set up your preferences and settings. But all of your files should go into a folder labeled windows.old<br />So that you do not lose any important data<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/all/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>

<h2>            Unable to download Assassins Creed Syndicate</h2>
                    
<p>I've been trying to download assassins creed all day, but it only reaches 5% before it stops and says installation. I received error code 0x87e0000f. I've tried restarting the download 4 times, waiting a few hours, turning the xbox on and off, I've moved
 the xbox from my living room to my bedroom to use a wired connection, deleting my xbox profile and power cycling my xbox and router.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What else can I do? Or is it an xbox store problem?</p>

<p>Hey guys. For some reason users in Australia are experiencing these issues when downloading games. Many people have been able to fix this by changing their DNS server:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4270/t/2058155.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> omenguide  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Ok, the way I have ended up fixing the issue it to change my DNS in my network settings from automatic to manual:</p>
<p>Primary: 8.8.8.8</p>
<p>Secondary: 8.8.4.4</p>
<p>This is the Google DNS. Be aware that you will be using up your quota on Iinet doing this method, however if you call them up you can explain the situation and receive a data pack from them. Until Iinet fixes the issue, most of the problem will be in downloading
 so switching back after you finish is best if you want to save your quota. Also if you download something and run your network statistics while it is downloading you should see that you have a 0% packet loss. Before I was getting up to 38% packet loss.</p>

link to castleminer</a> click on download asks you&nbsp; to download to pc or 360. As for download to the&nbsp; 360 seems to be not available any longer. Could be something the developer decided or Microsoft. Even on
<a href="http://www.digitaldnagames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">main website for developer</a> game is only offered for PC. The website even says available for Xbox you could check back with the website see if available maybe just being moved at
 the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>DPI Scaling issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> me and noone  say:</h3>
<h2>            DPI Scaling issue</h2>
                    <p>So I've bounced around between three live support chat employees and all of them have ended up restarting my pc making me lose connection with them while trying to get a remote session active which isn't the best start.</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10 on 100% scaling and apps such as Discord or Spotify appear to have fuzzy-looking text and icons. I searched into this and apparently it can be fixed by changing your scaling factor to 125%, 150% and so on. This is due to monitor resolutions.
 Thing is though, 125% and above messes up all of my displays (task bar half way accross the screen, desktop unresponsive...). Is there any way of keeping 100% scaling and fixing this DPI issue with program resolution?</p>

<p>It may be due to an incorrect display driver being used..There are 3 methods to correct the display driver here. Reboot after changing the display driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1</p>
<p>Right click on start menu and open "Device manager", scroll down to "display adapter", double click<br />
&nbsp;on the adapter shown in display adapter. The dialogue box has 5 tabs - choose driver tab.
<br />
Then choose "update driver", then choose "browse my computer", then choose "let me pick",
<br />
then choose one of the drivers shown that is not the current driver that windows is using now.</p>
<p>It is a buggy driver update. Hope one of these solutions may help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2</p>
<p>From Microsoft</p>
<p><strong>Download correct driver from your pcc manufacturerfor your video card </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>or chip. If you have intel and Nvidia M&nbsp; install&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>intel driver first then Nvidia. Do express install not custom.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We are aware of a problem that resulted in an incorrect driver update for some
<br />
AMD Radeon HD 2000, 3000, and 4000 series adapters. The driver update has been <br />
corrected. If you were impacted by the incorrect driver, follow these steps for <br />
all versions of Windows 10 to delete the 22.19.128.0 driver from the system and <br />
recover the recommended driver version (8.970.100.9001): FROM MICROSOFT</p>
<p>1.Start Device Manager. To do this, press and hold (or right-click) the Start Menu icon,<br />
&nbsp;and then select Device Manager.<br />
2.Expand Display adapters, and right-click the adapter that has the problem driver
<br />
installed, and then select Properties.<br />
3.Select the Driver tab and verify driver version is 22.19.128.0.<br />
4.Select Uninstall Device.<br />
5.Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” This step is
<br />
important and will prevent the problematic driver from reinstalling in the future.<br />
6.The system may require a reboot at this point. Reboot if needed, then reopen&nbsp; Device Manager.<br />
7.Select any device, then click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.<br />
8.If the recommended driver (8.970.100.9001) is re-installed and this resolves your graphics
<br />
problems, you can stop here. (Repeat steps 1-3 to verify that the correct driver version is installed).<br />
&nbsp;Otherwise follow the next step to check for the driver using Windows Update.<br />
9.Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Download correct driver from your pcc manufacturerfor your video card
</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>or chip. If you have intel and Nvidia M&nbsp; install&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>intel driver first then Nvidia. Do express install not custom.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not work then try this<br />
suggest downloading the drivers for your device from the Microsoft update catalog and installing
<br />
that driver. <br />
1.Go to the Microsoft Update Catalog website page at http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com
<br />
2. Do a search for your driver for older drivers that are not supported anymore. Or download
<br />
from your PC / laptop manufacturer<br />
3.If you are using a laptop or an all-in-one PC you will want the Mobility driver, otherwise
<br />
you probably want the one that doesn't include Mobility.<br />
4. I<strong>f you were using customized drivers and windows does not find it then download it
</strong><br />
<strong>from your computer manufacturer.</strong><br />
•If you are running 32-bit Windows, download the smaller of the two files shown for your device,<br />
&nbsp;otherwise download the larger.<br />
•Create a new folder in your downloads folder called "Video driver"<br />
•Double click on the CAB file you downloaded to open it and then drag its contents into the
<br />
"Video driver" folder. Or run the exe file that you downloaded from your computer manufacturer.<br />
•Go to Device Manager and Display Adapters, select the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter, right
<br />
click and select Update Driver<br />
•Click on "Browse my computer for driver software"<br />
•Browse to the "Video driver" folder you previously created and press OK and Next<br />
•Hopefully this will install the 2015 version of the drive and you'll be back up and running or<br />
&nbsp;your computer manufacturers driver <br />
If you find and download your driver . Back it up to a usb or cd/dvd</p>

            Method 1 didn't work out for me and I don't have an AMD Radeon graphics card so it wouldn't make sense to try Method 2. What drivers would I need to search for in Method 3? Device manager says I've got an Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600 and an NVIDIA GeForce

<p>Are you trying here? Have you opened the intel graphics panel. Sorry I don't want to go over old stuff but just want to make sure you have checked here and intel graphics&nbsp; settings from old control panel..</p>
<p>on the taskbar&nbsp; click on the window symbol on the left side. Then&nbsp; click on the settings ( it looks like a gear) open system it is the first icon. Then open display. Check settings on the right hand side . In method 2 you need to have your drivers for the
 intel and nvidia. Do you have a laptop or desktop? Go to your laptop or desktop manufacturer and look for the
<strong>model </strong>of your computer. Do the intel driver first and then nvidia . Use express settings for the install. You may also check the microsoft update catalog but it would be best to download and install the newest drivers from
<strong>Manufacturer.. Dell, asus , acer Hp etc.</strong>what ever your computer is. Also you may post in the help forums there to receive custom help&nbsp; for your device. Here is what you are looking for in the settings.</p>

    <title>HDMI Port Stopped Working on a Lenovo Thinkpad E470 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaredc89  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Port Stopped Working on a Lenovo Thinkpad E470</h2>
                    I use a Lenovo Thinkpad E470 for work and always use a second monitor connected by an HDMI cord. My computer seemingly updated last night, and as of this morning it seems my HDMI port is no longer working. I confirmed that it's not the cord and it isn't
 the monitor, so it must be the port. It doesn't register that there's another screen connected. I tried both updating and rolling back my display drivers, and that did nothing. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

            Hi JaredC89,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />My immediate response is that something has happened with the drivers.  My experience with troubleshooting Lenovo system has been very good using their update utility.
<br />
<br />Try downloading the utility from the following link and see if this resolves your issues.

<h2>            So whoever designed the build 10586 update went full retard.</h2>
                    <p>Because people who use Veracrypt or other not-**** open source encryption/security software can't update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not spending hours decrypting my drive (which leaves unencrypted data everywhere) just for an update, of which more are sure to come, just because **** is too retarded to code properly what gnu/Linux distributions (particularly rolling releases) have

                    <p>I've been a member of the Xbox community for over 9+ years and it's been all good fun, but there&nbsp;is an issue that needs more attention. The enforcement system Microsoft has created is a broken, how you may ask? Well let me enlighten you with my personal experience, for starters i am a call of duty player. In fact i am a call of duty Youtuber, so obviously i play the game. More specifically, Call Of Duty Black Ops 2. Now if you played cod bo2 or hell any call of duty you know that there are a lot of sore losers who will either trash talk or false report you. Now for me this has happened twice with in two weeks. Why would i get a false report and have my account taken when iv'e done nothing wrong. This unfair to me, and it's unfair to anyone who enjoys these games. I get one report from a random 11 year old and i get banned for days. I put money into this account through memberships, plus my Youtube career is effected as well. I stress the point that the enforcement team make a chang

            <p>And this is exactly what i mean, people still are ignorant to the fact that yes the enforcement system is very broken and yes i've been suspended for a false report. obviously you have no idea&nbsp;that stuff like this does happen as microsoft themselves have admitted this. I filed a case review and even though i am obviously innocent my suspension is still uphold by these people. Only gave it five to ten minutes before they made they're **** judgement. In anycase i'm done with xbox, you say there is nothing wrong with the system but lets see you say that when you get banned for no reason.<br /></p>

<h2>            Removing programs that don&#39;t appear in Add or Remove Programs</h2>
                    <p>Because I used to telecommute, software from my employer was installed on my system along with the software I already had.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Dell PC had some issues when I first bought it in about 2004, and to resolve the problem, a Dell technician partitioned my C Drive so that there are duplicate applications, etc., in the Program Files folder, Windows folder and folders within those folders.
 This makes it impossible for the Search feature to find apps, extensions, files, and so on that I know are installed, so I'll have to manually find and install them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have 2 Western Digital expandable hard drives that I could use to transfer everything to in order to "clean up" my system, but I'm not sure how to get started. I've done web design and a bit of programming, but not enough to
<em>not </em>make a mistake that could ruin my system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, my questions are as follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>How can I remove programs that don't appear in the Add or Remove Programs feature of the Control Panel?
</li><li>And is there any way I can "organize" these programs so that the Search function can find what I need?
</li></ol>
<p>I'm running Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition Version 5.1 (Version 2002)&nbsp;Service Pack 3. The available Windows physical memory available is 1,046,624 KB and the computer has 1.00 GB of RAM.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>You can go in to each program’s folder in question and look for “unwise” or “uninstall”, run that program to uninstall.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Or you can simply select the folder in question and delete it. However with this last way you might have to manually go around and delete short cuts and
 even edit the registry to remove all parts of the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Organize? No, nothing that will allow you to differentiate the programs.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest getting the necessary software burned to a disk, then formatting your system and set it up correctly. Will save you time and energy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>&nbsp;Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Recover Files From my Previous Back-Up&#47; Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanperez2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Recover Files From my Previous Back-Up&#47; Account</h2>
                    <p>So about a month or so I had my computer backed-up since it was being sent in for some repairs. It finally arrived just the other day and I wanted to transfer my old files from the back up that's in my terabyte storage. I plugged in the terabyte, signed
 into the same account my computer was on before repairs, turned on file history and when I went to "Restore Personal Files", it read that there isn't any history of my files and such, along with "File History can't save copies of files that are encrypted with
 Encrypting File System, on a network location, or on a drive that doesn't use the NTFS file system." Naturally, I created a current back up at the moment to see if it working fine and it was, just my previous back up can't be accessed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention the repair thing because when I turned on my laptop after it arrived It logged into the ACER account (they did the repairs) and from there I signed into my account and the back up that I made after i discovered my predicament reads the user as
 ACER and not as the current signed in account. I'm not sure if this changes anything, but I felt like it was worth mentioning just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this was enough information to get my situation out clearly and that the issue can be resolved. Thank you for your time.</p>

            See Glen Gailey’s reply here: 
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/file-history-and-restore-to-another-pc/fb69aacd-eac7-41fe-869d-a7000b0e21f8?msgId=bf71482c-0b25-4a61-bffc-7e8578ffc285&amp;page=5&amp;tab=AllReplies">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />The answer is still good for Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />He states: 
<br />I just had to try to do this, and I was able to (on a new Win8 machine) point at the previous backup by clicking Drives and then selecting my backup drive (a network share in my case). Then I was able to check "I want to use a previous backup on this File History drive" and it displayed my existing backups on that drive. Finally, I was able to do the regular (if not very intuitive) restore files by clicking the settings icon in the upper right of File History. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<h3> w8u  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;Windows 10 version 1709 Bug&#42; - Touch Keyboard does not supports Standard Keyboard layout with most keyboard layouts</h2>
                    <p>Prior to upgrading to Windows 10 version 1709 I was able to successfully use the Touch Keyboard with the Standard Keyboard layout option and the United Kingdom QWERTY keyboard layout. Following the upgrade to version 1709 upgrade this no longer works, and
 the Standard Keyboard layout option now only appears to work if/when the US QWERTY keyboard layout is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have upgraded to Windows 10 version 1709 and are/were using the Touch Keyboard with the Standard Keyboard option and a non US QUERTY keyboard, please join this discussion and let people know what is or isn't working for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in the Windows Insider program and were one if the people who provided feedback to Microsoft that the Touch Keyboard with Standard Keyboard option was broken, please join this discussion and hopefully we can get this fixed.</p>

<p>As another UK user who was happy with he full size touch keyboard, I found it incredible that Microsoft would actually remove it. It's like Windows 8 is happening again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worry that it's been months since this was known and protested about, and yet Microsoft has only reinstated cetain regions' full size touch keyboard, even now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet on the logon screen, there's the full size touch keyboard. NONE OF THIS MAKES SENSE.</p>

<p>i personaly love the way it was, every key was there and it was much quicker to type, i'm making so many mistakes with this crappy one its frustrating. the usa version is okay but the return/enter button is so small i tend to tap back space,</p>
<p>
</p><p>please activate the advanced keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>its available in the lock screen so its not removed. i'm tired of microsoft removing features for little to no reason, if people use it and its doing no ham please leave it. i love windows 10, please dont make it a chore to use</p>

            Hi Hadi, 
<br />
<br />That is a curious one for sure. Just a couple questions, are the PC’s win 10 that are printing to them? 
<br />
<br />And do you have multiple printers setup? Happening on all of them? 
<br />
<br />Let me know and I’ll do whatever I can to help.

<p>Hello Charlie Klausen,</p>
<p>Our employees use different types of Operating Systems such, Win10, Win7, Win8.1.</p>
<p>We use many types of printer models ( HP, Muratic, Canon ) and we have installed all these printers over Windows Server 2012 r2 Datacenter with using print server management services. the employees can send print jobs but after printing jobs successfully,
 the completed print jobs remain in print queue with the status 'sent to printer'.
</p>
<p>Recently due to high amount of "completed print jobs in queue" counts, the print spooler crashes and stops working. We start the print spooler services manually. Any solution for this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

 the completed print jobs remain in print queue with the status 'sent to printer'.
</p>
<p>Recently due to high amount of "completed print jobs in queue" counts, the print spooler crashes and stops working. We start the print spooler services manually. Any solution for this problem?</p>
<p>

            Hi Denice.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1)  Update the sound driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Next try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back the version in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />14) Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Run Crucial System Scanner to check the RAM is properly spec'd and configured:  <a href="https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/systemscanner?cm_re=us-footer-_-us-upgrade-_-us-upgrade-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/systemscanner?cm...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Installed programs not showing up in Control Panel &#62; Uninstall Programs List</h2>
                    I noticed a couple of weeks ago that most of my installed programs, mainly the ones that I installed myself (but not all), do not show up in my Uninstall portion of the Control Panel. &nbsp;They are all on my computer, and I can use them all. &nbsp;I also noticed
 that most of the programs that do NOT show up are in the Program Files (x86) folder in the C drive. &nbsp;The programs that DO show up seem to be ones that came installed on the computer when I bought it (this is not the case for all of them), and are in the regular
 Program Files folder on the C drive. &nbsp;Any idea what the problem may be, and how to fix it?<br />
<br />
Here is what is showing up (notice there are not times/dates listed in the 'Last Used On' column. &nbsp;These used to show up).

            <span>Hi GraceBowers,<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Which programs you are not able to see under uninstall programs List?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>You will not be able to see all the installed programs under uninstall programs list like Internet Explorer, Windows Media player etc. If you want to see the location of the program try the steps.<br />
a. Right click on the program.<br />
b. Click on the properties.<br />
c. Check for the location of the program where it was installed.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
I would suggest you to try the manual steps from the following link.<br />
<br />
Add/Remove Programs tool displays installed programs incorrectly (Applies to Windows 7)<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/266668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/266668</a><br />

Note: Manual steps will work even for Windows 7.<br />

<h2>            Procedure to setup Homegroup in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Homegroup problem</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to set up a new Homegroup in Windows 10, probably needing to remove all references to an old Homegroup that used to exist on the network before moving from Win7 to Win10 but does not seem to work in Win10. At least none of the machines
 can manage to connect to it.</p>
<p>All previous posts about Homegroup problems in 10 seem to refer to Win8 and I cannot make the solutions work.</p>

<li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you don't have IPv6 (e.g. at least a functioning tunnel via ISATAP).&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you would be in the same boat as I was when I was trying to use my ISP's modem for its router.</p>

</p><p>Again, that sounds like some of the inanity that I saw with both the HG and its troubleshooter ignoring the fact that there was no IPv6 local connectivity.</p>

<p>Close both machines and restart. Still no HomeGroup on Desktop, and <strong>Acer cannot see the desktop either</strong>.</p>
