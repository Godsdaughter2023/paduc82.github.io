<h2>            Call of the Dead -Everything you need to know&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>After reading about 500 posts on the same topic, I decided to put everything into one thread.&nbsp; Enjoy!<br />
<b><br />
How to activate the song (Not Ready to Die - A7X)<br />
</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. To the left of where you spawn, there will be a rock on top of a barrel, Press X.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the first floor of the Ship (to the right of where you spawn) there is another rock, Press X.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Now go to the room under the lighthouse, and the floor above where the old crew is being held, there is a clock with another rock under it, Press X and the song should turn on (most people think its the clock but the rock is there).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <b><br />
Solo Easter Egg (Dempsey, Nikolai, Richtofen, Takeo)</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The are located in the room under the lighthouse (not the spiral staircase).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Knife the door a few times until you hear them talking, they will then tell you to find them a fuse.&nbsp; The fuse is in one of three places, one each desk upstairs of that room, or next to the filing cabinet on the floor of the same room.&nbsp; Press X to pick
 it up and bring it back downstairs.&nbsp; To the right of the door, there is a fuse box, press X to put it in there.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Knife the door a few times again and they will tell you about the generators.&nbsp; There are four of them. They must be killed by grenades, and you can buy semtex's at the bow of the boat (semtex makes it easier IMO).&nbsp; The first one is directly behind you,
 so turn around and throw a grenade at it. (The red light will go out). The second one is behind the Stamin-Up building,&nbsp; Open the door at the bottom of the light house and go all the way down to the building and go the the window to the left.&nbsp; Throw a grenade
 at that generator.&nbsp; The third one is off the left side of the boat.&nbsp; From the spawn, run up the first staircase to the boat and run to the left side immediately, don't run up any stairs and no other doors need to be opened.&nbsp; The generator is in the water at
 about 10 o'clock if away from the rest of the boat.&nbsp; The last generator is right where the two boats split in the middle of the rocks.&nbsp; Drop down to the lowest catwalks and toss a grenade at it.&nbsp; Now go back and talk to them again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Richtofen will now ask you to find a Golden Rod.&nbsp; First you have to go to the Power room at the top of the ship.&nbsp; Turn the wheel until the brown handle is in the bottom right corner.&nbsp; Go to the left of the wheel and you will see three levers.&nbsp; Press the
 one on the left, once.&nbsp; The middle one is not turned.&nbsp; The one on the right is pressed three times.&nbsp; You should then see a green light at the bottom of the lighthouse.&nbsp; Go to the bottom of the lighthouse WITH A ZOMBIE and the V-R11 and turn the zombie into
 a human.&nbsp; The zombie/human will run to the green light and start floating up, kill the Zombie/human before he reaches the top and the golden rod will be down.&nbsp; Bring the rod back to the door and a short dialogue will ensue and the Easter Egg is complete and
 you will get the "Stand-In" Achievement for sending the crew to Paradise.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<b>Co-Op Easter Egg</b><br />
<br />
The First three steps of the solo easter egg (fuse, generators) are the same as in Co-Op.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. After killing the generators, Nikolai will ask for Vodka.&nbsp; Vodka is located on a railing either right outside the room or somewhere on the ship. It looks like a giant block of ice on a railing.&nbsp; One person will stand next to the vodka on the railing and
 the other will stand below it.&nbsp; The person above, should knife the vodka until it falls and the other person catches it.&nbsp; If it falls to the ground, it was spawn in another spot immediately.&nbsp; Bring the Vodka back to Nikolai.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Richtofen then asks you to find his Golden Rod.&nbsp; The broken radios play morse code, after associating them with letters, it spells out "VRIL" or V-R11.&nbsp; If you press them in chronological order you hear a foghorn noise and if you do it wrong, you hear
 the sound of the box moving.&nbsp; Next, turn the dials in the proper order, the dials should read 2, 7, 4, 6 from top to bottom.&nbsp; This step just takes time messing around with the dials but you will get it eventually.&nbsp; The next step is to play the foghorns in
 the right order.&nbsp; The order is the one at the bottom of the ledge, then the one next to speed cola, then the one by the lighthouse door, and finally the one behind the rock on the other side of the ledge.&nbsp; A green light should appear from the submarine and
 shine into the light house.&nbsp; Finally, bring the crawler or any zombie to the bottom of the light house and zap him with the VR-11 (doesn't need to be PaP'd).&nbsp; He SHOULD start floating up the middle of the light house.&nbsp; Once he gets to the top, the golden rod
 should appear at the bottom.&nbsp; Bring the golden rod back to the door and listen.&nbsp; Once the fuse box starts sparking, knife it and you will hear them being warped to "Paradise".&nbsp; You then get the wunderwaffe and the Achievements.<br />
<b><br />
Perk Machines</b><br />
<br />
Quick Revive - Right at the spawn, go through the water to a small island. (1500 pts)<br />
Juggernog - Under the bow of the boat.&nbsp; (2500 pts)<br />
Double Tap Root Beer - At the back of the boat (2000 pts)<br />
Speed Cola - Down the Ice Slide at the bottom of the lighthouse out the back door and to the right. (3000 pts)<br />
Deadshot Daiquiri - At the top of the lighthouse. More accurate hipfire and auto-aim to head when ADS (1500 pts)<br />
Phd Flopper - In the room above Dempsey, Takeo, Richtofen, and Nikolai (2000 pts)<br />
Stamin-up - Go out the back door of the lighthouse and straight down the stairs and through the water. (2000 pts)<br />
<br />
<b>New Wonder Weapons</b><br />
<br />
V-R11 - Turns zombies into humans and makes zombies follow it away.&nbsp; Doesn't kill the follower zombies but it does take a load off your back for&nbsp; a while.&nbsp; If shot at George while aggressive, he calms down for&nbsp; few minutes.
<br />
V-R11 Lazarus - The only difference I see is that when shooting George in water, he goes down the staircase he came in from and stays there for the remainder of the round.<br />
<br />
Scavenger - A sniper rifle that shoots sticky electro-bullets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It will stick to a zombie and then explode, killing all zombies in the area.<br />
PaP'd Scavenger (Don't remember name) - More powerful and more ammo.&nbsp; Other than Death machine, is the most effective way of killing George.<br />
<b><br />
George Romero</b><br />
<br />
Easiest way to kill him, every time you get a death machine, put him in a lake and unload the entire death machine on him.&nbsp; it takes at least 4 death machines to take him out.&nbsp; The other most effective way I have found is to PaP the Scavenger and hit him with
 that.&nbsp; It's also best that George is in the water already so he doesn't get angry.
<br />
<br />
If you have the V-R11, you can shoot him with it to calm him down.&nbsp; If you have the PaP'd V-R11, and shoot him while he's in water, he will go back to his staircase that he came up in for the remainder of the round, but you will not get the achievement.<br />
<br />
If I forgot anything or have any questions, don't be afraid to ask!</p>

<p>Your CO-OP instructions fail to mention that you have to kill the human after shooting the zombie with the VR-11. The Golden Rod will not drop down to the bottom of the lighthouse unless the human is killed. (Scavenger /Ray Guns work well)</p>

            <p>OK. I found it in the "hidden devices". In the window there it says that the device isn't connected. I don't understand this because this is an HP Pavilion "touch screen" laptop, the DVD player is built in. How can it not be connected? Is there a way to
 do this?</p>

            <p>There was&nbsp;uninstall information&nbsp;in the second link I already gave you.</p>
<p>
To update the driver, search for the driver on the device manufacturer's website, and then follow the installation instructions on the website.<br />
<br />
To reinstall the driver, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>Press the Windows logo key + R to open the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box.</li><li>Type <span>devmgmt.msc</span> in the <strong>Run</strong> dialog box, then press Enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong></li><li>In Device Manager, expand <strong>DVD/CD-ROM drives</strong>, right-click the CD and DVD devices, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click <strong>
OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart the computer.</li></ol>
After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed. <br />
<br />
If your problem is not solved, try the next resolution.

            I have uninstalled the driver from the hidden devices menu. It did not automatically reinstall on restart. I went to the manufacturers website but they only want to send me a disk that I can;t use. How can I use a disk to fix a disk drive that won't open
 in the first place? I tried to open it with a paperclip but it didn't work. I have no idea what to do next.

<p>If it will not open after following the paperclip method, replace the Optical DVD Drive.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have two separate problems...&nbsp; The stuck disk is one problem...</p>
<p>The fact that the drive is not showing up in Device Manager is another...</p>
<p>
</p><p>They might be related, but there have been a lot of issues with the drive not showing up in Device Manager in quite a few machines when the drive was perfectly functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still need to know of your machine uses AMD or Intel CPU... There are some possible fixes that are different depending on Which type of CPU...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try this...</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>1. Run Command Prompt as an Administrator. Right click&nbsp;on the lower left corner.</p>
<p>It will be on the list that opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Type or Copy and Paste the following and hit enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg.exe add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\atapi\Controller0" /f /v EnumDevice1 /t REG_DWORD /d 0x00000001</p>
<p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model number of the flash drive?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some pen drive brands have formatting tools. You could visit their website and use them if any.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Are you formating in NTSF or FAT32?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it is NTFS, you need to restart your computer after format.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps resolve the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Please backup your data before formatting your pen drive</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First, try formatting in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open a DOS prompt (Start &gt;&gt; Run &gt;&gt; Type "cmd") and type:<br />
attrib -r -h -s ./s x:\*.*</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This will change the attributes of all of the files on the pen drive. Readonly, hidden, and system attributes will be removed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Replace the X: with your pen drive's drive letter. Now you will be able to see them in Explorer, and delete them, without formatting anything.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Format with DOS commands</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open the DOS prompt (Start &gt;&gt; Run &gt;&gt; Type "cmd" in the box)</div>
<div>b. Type:</div>
<div>FORMAT X: /FS:FAT32 /Q /V:PenDrive</div>
<div>This will reformat the Pen drive, using the FAT32 file system, and label the drive PenDrive. Replace X: with the actual drive letter of your Pen Drive. For more help on this command, type:</div>
<div>FORMAT /?</div>
<div>at the command prompt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 4:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There could be a virus that may stop you formatting your pen drive. I'd have you run a virus chack using your security software once before attempting format again.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Line-in audio no longer honors the default device update anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>The audio in no longer uses the 'default audio device' for sound output after anniversary update. Even after manually setting&nbsp;the default device, it continues to use the same sound source (even though a different item is clearly marked as default). I have
 speakers and a headset as my two sound devices and I switch between. I have an alternative sound input source which uses the line-in on the motherboard. It passes through fine to the speakers but after the update I can't get the line-in to go the headset.

            <p>Realtek High Definition Audio and Wireless Stereo Headset (Generic USB Audio) are the two output devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I switch between both as the default device depending on whether I want to use my speakers or headset. The Line-In only is guided to the speakers for some reason, regardless if the Wireless Stereo is set as the default audio device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine until the Windows 10 Anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the drivers, they are all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT -&nbsp;I should note that Windows audio works fine for both speakers or headset (when changed to default device). It's just the Line-In (which is Line in Realtek High Definition Audio) which doesn't guide to the correct device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely looks like a bug.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you trying to backup to the drive over a wireless network, by chance?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any third-party backup utility installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re trying to backup to the private network using wireless connection, I’d suggest you to try and use a wired connection instead and try
 backing up the data. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Few users have fixed the issue by using a wired connection to backup the data over a network.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Uninstall</span></a> the third-party
 backup utility, if any and check if that fixes the issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re using a wired connection, start your computer in a clean boot state and perform the backup. Check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows
 Vista or in Windows 7</span></a> for instructions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer
 to start as usual as mentioned in <strong>Step 7</strong> in the above KB article.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us with the information, Jessica.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know if you tried using the method provided by the MVP I've mentioned in my previous post? If you haven't tried it yet, we recommend that you do so. However, if you already have tried it, what you can from here would be to use third-party programs
 or software so you can recover those deleted files. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a reset on your Windows device would wipe out all the files saved there unless otherwise, you made a backup. And since you mentioned that the backup from OneDrive is not showing, it would be best to use third-party software to work this up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need anything else, please don't hesitate to post back. We're always here to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Spinning Blue Circle next to Mouse Pointer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Spinning Blue Circle next to Mouse Pointer</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 a couple days ago and it was running great. Then today after walking away from my PC I came back to a solid black screen with a spinning blinking blue circle next to the mouse pointer. I forced it to power off. When booting up it
 came to a black screen with a blue Windows logo and then reverted to that same black screen with spinning blue circle next to mouse pointer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried pressing all of the keys one at a time, and CTRL+alt+delete, and alt+tab, and nothing brings it out of that state.</p>

            <p>I have this exact same problem on my ASUS UL80V that was upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Immediately after upgrading, the PC worked perfectly.&nbsp; But after the system updates were applied, the PC will no longer boot properly.&nbsp; It will start to boot
 and show the ASUS logo followed by the blue Windows 10 logo and under that a white spinning progress circle.&nbsp; After a few seconds, the screen turns black and there is only a white cursor and blue spinning circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the CTRL followed by password and spacebar followed by password, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the CTRL + WIN + B, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the CTRL + P + arrow down, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the CTRL + SHIFT + ESC, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ASUS does have an Nvidia GeForce G 210M, Intel Core 2 Duo, 320GB HDD, and 4GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can boot the ASUS using the Express Gate instant boot up which bypasses Windows OS but that gives the PC only limited web browsing capability.</p>

            Spinning blue circle shows up mostly for me while using Face Book. Horribly annoying and sometimes the only way to post or comment in FB requires me to close the program and reopen. Sometimes it causes the text I am typing to copy itself, and sometimes
 it moves the first letter I type to the second and them the typing becomes crazy. At times, it them will not allow the enter button to work to post a comment.

            I am having this exact same problem. It causes what I am posting to recreate and&nbsp; then I can only delete part of it. I have to go completely out of facebook and then back in. The blue circle never goes away. very annoying.

            <p>On My HP I had Windows 7 and then upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>For sometime now I Have had this blue circle problem. Up to yesterday I could not open the internet or go anywhere on the laptop.</p>
<p>I decided to uninstall the free version of the AVG virus protection. The blue circle disappeared instantly. The PC is faster and I have no problems,</p>
<p>I have the Defender installed and working, the only problem is it tells me &nbsp;that the PC is "Potentially Unprotected.</p>
<p>Hoe this helps</p>

            I had a similar problem with the blue circle pulsing next to the mouse pointer. &nbsp; After reading this chain I turned off my Zone alarm anti-virus and firewall for a minute or so and then turned them back on. &nbsp;Voila, no more pulsing!

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - Inbox in constant loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using windows 10 and Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon opening WLM I have recently experienced failure notices when the programme try's to download new emails.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled MS Essentials 2012 a few times.</p>
<p>Occasionally WLM would fully open and download, but mostly it would fail.</p>
<p>But now, upon opening WLM, it downloads new messages, but then it appears to proceed to a loop whereby the Inbox "unread" number clocks up by "1" every second, indefinitely but no further emails are arriving; ie it appears to be in a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can send emails through WLM without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any comments would be gratefully received!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>This sounds like a problem with your mailbox. What type of account is involved - POP3, IMAP or EAS?

If you're not sure, right-click on&nbsp;an account name in the folder pane and select <span style="font-style: italic">

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
There is probably a message in the mailbox at the server that Windows Live Mail can't or won't download for some reason - it's too big, it contains malicious code or it's just plain dodgy. If you can access the account in webmail using a browser,

If the fault recurs, we now know which half of the messages the bad one is in. Repeat the process, taking half of the messages each time until the dodgy message can be identified and dealt with in webmail.<br />

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In future, don't use the webmail inbox as a storage folder. Move any messages for keeping on the server&nbsp;into archive folders, leaving only a few days' worth of messages in the inbox

<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server and typical error message is as follows:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Unable to send or receive messages for the Btinternet account. Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems or a long period of inactivity.</div>
<div>Server: 'mail.btinternet.com'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC0F<br />
Protocol: POP3<br />
Port: 110<br />
Secure(SSL): No</div>
<p>
</p><p>My webmail is BT Yahoo Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, today I getting the above error messages rather than dropping into the loop previously described.&nbsp; It seems to change from one to the other for no known reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had spotted your previous advice to another person regarding your suggested Inbox clearing method. I had started the process that you set out. I reached the point of transferring emails out of my Inbox to the new folder. I transferred about 2 months of
 emails and because the problem occurred about a week ago, I wondered if 2 months of transfers was sufficient? I could keep going? I noted that it seems that I can only transfer in batches of 50 emails and the total must run into quite a few thousand running
 back... I don't know how many years?&nbsp; If I need to transfer them all, do you know a quick way? It probably makes sense to bite the bullet and delete all the contents of my Inbox as I have the emails on WLM and also backed up on separate drive., perhaps I should
 "reset" my webmail account; not sure how to go about this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be pleased to have your view before I take further steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<p>I have not been able to resolve this problem but the behaviour has changed which may raise a clue to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon opening the current emails are loaded and then blank emails arrive at the rate of one email per second. Each blank email has the same date and time recorded, ie it replicates without stopping until the app is closed.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to resolve this issue. I still hope to find a resolution, but for now I have moved to MS Outlook.&nbsp; I am able to send and receive emails in Outlook, but upon opening Outlook , it hangs on "Checking for new mail in subscribed folders".
 I suspect the problem may lie with my Yahoo mail account.&nbsp; I have spoken to Yahoo, but they have only guided me with basic adjustments so no progress has been made.... &nbsp; ??</p>

<h2>            I want to move all my files in HDD to SSD &#40;except OS&#41;,</h2>
                    <p>So we know SSD is a great for keeping files and HDD is good for OS. I want to move all my files in HDD to SSD (except OS), and make my computer continue to automatically save files to SSD while OS stays in HDD. Is this possible? If so, how? Diagrams/Photos
 would be great. Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>"Error 08x80070035 The network path was not found" is a familiar error and I have seen many helpful ideas to solve the problem but my problem is a little different.</p>
<p>Every time I try access am open/save dialog box in certain software (some are recent installs) I get the above network error where on old path that is no longer on my network (and that I no mapped drives to) appears and says "Windows cannot access...."</p>

<p>I have searched the registry for references to the named device with no success.</p>
<p>Could someone please let me know if there is some way to purge this historic reference from my machine?</p>

            Hi Pete.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />    Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt, choose Run As Administrator, Open, enter the following commands each followed by Enter key:
<br />        netsh winsock reset
<br />        netsh int ip reset
<br />        ipconfig /release
<br />        ipconfig /renew
<br />
<br />    After running these commands, restart your PC and check if the issue still persists.
<br />
<br />If the issue still persists, you can try to configure IP address:
<br />
<br />    Open “Network and Sharing Center” and click “Change adapter settings”.
<br />    Right-click your Wi-Fi adapter and click “Properties”.
<br />    Select “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)” and click “Properties”.
<br />    Click “Obtain an IP address automatically”.
<br />

<p>Hi Greg,<br />
I successfully ran the commands in the admin command prompt and restarted the pc, I retried the software with the same result. I also changed the TCP/IPv4 settings on both the inactive WiFi device and the active Ethernet connection, retried the software with
 no change.</p>
<p>I will check the other suggestions at the supplied url later.</p>

<p>I've been wondering all along what files the program might be looking for and if these files are still around. To find out I would do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rename your PC to FortyHome.</li><li>Create the folder C:\Videos and put some dummy file inside, e.g. test.avi.</li><li>Create the share "Videos".</li><li>Check if test.avi is visible when running this console command:<br />
dir \\FortyHome\Vidoes</li><li>See what your video program has to say.</li></ol>

<p>Kapil,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking time to look at my issue.</p>
<p>All the advise in the article appears to be solving the problem where a device is not accessible, i.e. user has a NAS but cannot access it.
My problem is that my machine is <strong>trying to access </strong><strong>a device that does not exist anymore</strong>, I have replaced it. I have removed the old network mapped drives so that they do not appear anywhere in file explorer (which is exactly
 what I want).<br />
But some some software is still trying to access the old mapped drive (not by the drive letter but by the path name), which doesn't exist and doesn't appear in my mapped drive list.
<strong>There must be some buried place where this old drive mapping is being stored</strong> otherwise the
<p>I think this must be something either in the "open file/save/save as" dialog box code or more likely something that code is utilising. File explorer opens fine, it does moan about not being able to see the old share.</p>
<p>The new software knows nothing of my old network, I believe it is the call to the Windows dialog box control that causes the problem. The app successfully opens the 'save as' dialog box with a legitimate location (the last location I saved a file to from
 this app), but it also pops up the error dialog box on top of that.</p>
<p>I can simply cancel the error dialog and continue using the app without any problems - this error is
<p>The old device was a Windows Home Server. I have uninstalled all of the WHS connection software.</p>
<p>Thanks again to you Kapil and all of you that have taken time to suggest solutions,</p>
<p>Peter.</p>

<p>I'm not dismissing your idea as one that will not hide the error, I'm sure it would, but that's not a solution, is it?</p>

            It persisted even in safe mode.&nbsp; I did more searching and found a discussion about a failed system update leaving behind a log file in the C:\System\logs\CBS.&nbsp; Some how the existence of the log file triggers this problem.&nbsp; I used the sys internals Process
 Monitor tool and found the log file that makecab.exe was referencing.&nbsp; Once I deleted the log file the problem was resolved.<br />

<h3> blueanswers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Media Player won&#39;t play a rented DVD</h2>
                    When I put the DVD into play a window popped up saying there was a problem with digital copy protection between my DVD drive, decoder, and video card.&nbsp; Then when I clicked on web for advice it said try installing an updated driver for my video card.&nbsp; So,
 I did that but it still won't play the Rented DVD from Redbox.&nbsp; The movie was "Internal Affairs" with Richard Gere.&nbsp; And I have been playing Redbox DVDs on this media player for a year now and suddenly one won't work.&nbsp; Help please!

            <p>No guarantees...but I'm thinking it may be a codec issue <br />
and installing a codec pack may be worth a try.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
***Proceed At Your Own Risk***<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Codec Pack<br />
<a href="http://www.windows7codecs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windows7codecs.com/</a><br />
<br />
Or as an alternative you could try the freeware VLC Media Player (it will <br />
play just about anything).<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows Lost the Administrator&#39;s Profile, how may I recover from this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings from the GREAT State of TEXAS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a very unusual problem on Win7 PRO SP1 x64 system with all of the UPDATES as of 06/25/2015 last update before this issue arose.&nbsp; Attempt to login as Admin and Windows tells me, "The User Profile Service service failed the logon.&nbsp; User profile cannot
 be loaded."&nbsp; Over the preceding weeks. about three (3) wks, only a couple of times my system would not shut-down when going to bed.&nbsp; Did not discover this until the next morning when the 'tower' was still 'ON.'&nbsp; Just pressed the ON/OFF button for 4-5 sec and
 it turned off.&nbsp; Wait about 5 to 15 minutes before restarting.&nbsp; Boot up would go just fine even login worked AOK.&nbsp; Several times the Choose Options screen "Safe Mode" or other options and I chose the Safe Mode logging in as Limited user, open a program to confirm
 normal operations.&nbsp; Reboot into Normal Boot-Up and go on from there.&nbsp; This last time was given the option of "Repair Boot System" and ran that NOT finding any issues.&nbsp; That is when I discovered MBAM Chameleon would not start because the file had the '.pif'
 removed and when I attempted to rename it, "Windows cannot find 'C:\Users\{Limited User Name]\Desktop\MBAM-ChameleonAdmin.pif'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."&nbsp; Dsicovered not able to rename nor execute any file within "Explorer"
 nor from an ICON if requiring Admin Privileges or a CMD prompt.&nbsp; Was afraid may be infected, but; have changed this to maybe "MBR" may have been corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think of this issue and how would I be able to replace the MBR from one of the Back-up copies?&nbsp; This is one operation I have never done, HELP! PLEASE?</p>
<p />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>This issue could be due to corrupt or damaged system files.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the issue persists after installation of Windows Updates, I suggest you to perform a System Restore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To perform a System Restore, you may refer to the article below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/system-restore</span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> The System Restore restores the computer back to an earlier point
 in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers and also reset the recently changed settings on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this will fix the issue, if not let us know with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>You could try booting from&nbsp;a System repair disk / installation disk and running repairs using that.&nbsp; If you don't have one then see if
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/6883d1f9-4081-4323-985e-0b5f40ec544c?threadId=57783894-56ae-4782-a4db-3b1e7ffb46b9">
these links</a> still have System repair disk ISOs available.&nbsp; If not then borrow a System repair disk from somebody else with Windows 7 x64 [it does not have to be Pro].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not hold out much hope that you will be successful as too much time has passed for you to follow up with a System restore.&nbsp; I imagine that you do not have a system image available or you would have tried that already.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, even if SRD helps to fix the startup issues you will still be left with the corrupted user profile problem.&nbsp; That is likely to have been caused by using the power button to force the computer off when you found it hanging there in the morning.&nbsp;
 And then you'd still know that damage had been done by whatever was causing that hanging and whatever corrupted Chameleon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guidance on the user profile problem is at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-corrupted-user-profile#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix a corrupted user profile - Windows Help</a> and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/kb/947215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
You receive a The User Profile Service failed the logon” error message</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you will end up just trying to rescue your own files from the computer and then reinstalling Windows 7 from scratch.&nbsp; Booting from the SRD then choosing its Advanced menu &amp; opening a Command prompt window&nbsp;will give you unfettered access to the computer's
 drives for you to copy your files to an external HDD.&nbsp; You can also&nbsp;run Notepad using the Command prompt window then use Notepad as a rudimentary file explorer by typing *.* in its Open dialog&nbsp;then pressing Return; it's quite handy once you get used to it.&nbsp;
 Note that you will have to identify each drive for yourself as the temporary OS established by the SRD makes its own decisions about which drive letters to assign to which drives so you cannot rely on C being the OS, D being data or however you normally have
 things set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 ISOs are no longer available online so you'll have to borrow a Prox64&nbsp;installation disk if you do not already have one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but that's my conclusion from reading your posts.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am a member of Windows Secrets Paid version and just recently there was a report about 'Hidden Administrator" which was used and now my Admin is this 'HA' AND have gone in as this HA in "Safe Mode" doing a little investigating.&nbsp; Device Manager gave me
 a clue, displaying the 'Hidden Devices' about half way through the list was one, 'Security Processor Loader' with a report of, "This device is not present, is not working properly, or does not have all of its drivers installed. (Code 24)"&nbsp;

            <p>You need to reinstall Windows 7.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what "Windows Secrets Paid" is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Built-In Admin is sometimes referred to as the Default Admin.&nbsp; You referred to it as&nbsp;the Hidden Admin &amp; the Hidden Master Admin, okay.&nbsp; Its account user name is Administrator.&nbsp; It is included in the system for one reason and that is to appear to the
 user on the logon screen in Safe mode if the system ever identifies the fact that there are no functioning Admin accounts in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deliberately using the Built-In Admin for a short period can be useful in recovering from problems.&nbsp; Its use&nbsp;should normally be limited to creating two new Admin accounts [that are then used to do anything else that is required] and then the Built-In Admin
 should be&nbsp;disabled again in order to protect its integrity.&nbsp; <em>Any user account can be afflicted with user profile corruption; this corruption happens in use not when&nbsp;an account is disabled.&nbsp; If the Built-In Admin account suffers corruption it cannot&nbsp;be
 repaired or replaced.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Built-In Admin bypasses a very important safety mechanism called UAC.&nbsp; If you have been running as the Built-In Admin then your actions, the actions of applications and the actions of any hacker who has infiltrated your computer are not challenged -
 the "Admin prompt", "Elevation UI" / "Consent UI" prompt does not appear when something is attempting to change system items that affect all users.&nbsp; Malware could easily take over control of your system under these conditions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to complete this explanation and to guide you in the reinstallation, you ought to make two password-protected Admin accounts in addition to the individual password-protected Standard user accounts belonging to each user of the computer for their day-to-day
 computer tasks.&nbsp; If you, as the owner of the computer, want to use an Admin account instead of a Standard account then fine, go ahead.&nbsp; But make sure it is password-protected, make sure it is in addition to the two Admin accounts I mentioned&nbsp;and use an account
 you have created not the Built-In Admin.&nbsp; See my further comments about using these additional Admin accounts in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-security/there-is-no-greater-risk-of-malware-infection-for/00282c2c-a222-44ef-8c83-cf9e34731c06" title="My aim is to answer this question - Is it always correct to advise computer owners to log in for day-to-day computer activities as Standard users rather than as Admin users as a system security measure? This article is an extract from a longer report that was originally posted in a thread in this forum in 2013. The report has been reviewed [17 May 2015] and is available in pdf format. The operating system considered during the investigation was Windows 7. Windows 10 users cannot assume that the same considerations apply. There are some differences in the behaviour of the Built-In Admin account in Windows 10 so there might well be other changes affecting the current topic [in Windows 10, the Built-In Admin is designed not to be able to access Settings].">
<p>
</p><p>I do not think that the individual items that you are chasing will solve your problems.&nbsp; You need to reinstall Windows 7.&nbsp; You have the installation disk.&nbsp; You need to back up your own files, any application installation files, any product registration /
 activation numbers you have been given.&nbsp; Then just do it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some notes:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that you have explained that you normally run in the Built-In Admin account, I can understand that the hard stops to your system made by holding the power button down were endangering the Built-In Admin account not just any old account.&nbsp; So the "The
 User Profile Service failed the logon.&nbsp; User profile cannot be loaded." messages you saw were referring to the Built-In Admin and telling you that its profile had been corrupted.&nbsp; I think you would be wasting your time chasing this issue down even further
 anyway given that you need to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot create the Built-In Admin account.&nbsp; It is created by the system during installation.&nbsp; So I do not know what you meant by "create the HMA account" in your earlier post.&nbsp;
<em>It is possible that you have also been using a special sort of account called the System account but I would have thought you would have mentioned that.&nbsp; I once had to use that account for a total of ten minutes to correct a Registry fault.&nbsp; It is a risky
 thing to do; any mistakes&nbsp;can be irreparable without reinstalling Windows.&nbsp; </em>
I think you would be wasting your time chasing this issue down even further anyway given that you need to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device manager can display hidden items in any account not just the Built-In Admin account.&nbsp; I have no idea what the Security Processor Loader does but I think it is a Windows component [just judging by the information in Device manager].&nbsp; Windows does not
 load all device drivers in Safe mode so there might be no significance to your discovery at all.&nbsp; I think you would be wasting your time chasing this issue down even further anyway given that you need to reinstall Windows.</p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>"Was </strong><strong>also looking for a post from you where you mentioned you are unaware of "Windows Secrets Paid," this is a News Letter put out FREE but also has a paid version with information on
 solving issues within Windows and suggestions on how to handle WUD that cause problems.&nbsp; An EXCELLENT expense especially if you are Novice as well as IT even programmers.&nbsp; I have picked-up much from them.&nbsp; If you would like the links to these two (2) let me
 know"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I must apologize to you because you have misunderstood what my post is about.&nbsp; I very seldom use 'Admin' account only a Limited User Account 99.9% of the time.&nbsp; When my system did not shut down was while using my Limited User.&nbsp;
 That is all the time, except when installing software or doing some troubleshooting.&nbsp; In an article by Fred Langa in Windows Secrets Newsletter Issue 480 Dated 2015/05/14 titled "Activate Windows" hidden, master admin account" where he explains all about the
 use of this special feature and NOT to be left active, must deactivate when no longer needed for special operations. "HIDDEN MASTER ADMINISTRATOR" which is one title given in that article along with some other.&nbsp; Not going into any further explanation, if you
 want to know any more about what was published you will need to go to their website.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">You are accusing me of shutting down my system while running it as admin and that is not true, my system is never online when admin is in operation, even the limited version that does not have full access to all areas of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Sir, I have been on the internet from before the World Wide Web (www) was ever developed nor Windows ever created, DOS 3.1/w black screen using a cmd line.&nbsp; I worked in Unix software to surf using TCP/IP.&nbsp; I am self taught along
 with friends that had the patients to work with me and give me advise.&nbsp; After retirement and working from home using the FORUMS on the net, membership in about fifty five (55) at one time, my experiences have grown.&nbsp; I do troubleshooting for friends that cannot
 afford to pay the Geek prices.&nbsp; I do it for my own pleasure of doing something for another human.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I digress too much, getting away from my issue with my computer.&nbsp; If I may send you a PM to give more of what I am and where I come from.&nbsp; It will not be done unless you approve.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I did do a reboot with F8 System Repair as well as using the original DVD installation but doing the repair from that media.&nbsp; Working OFF LINE created that Special Administrator access in an effort to investigate what could be
 done, if anything.&nbsp; Because this is working in Microsoft software my ERROR is thinking it is all by Microsoft, have since learned that some of the "OEMs" place some of their own driver (*.sys) files on their computers they build.&nbsp; Is this file, "Security Processor
 Loader" (spldr.sys) one of those files placed there by Dell?&nbsp; Because my desktop is a Dell OptiPlex 960 purchased as a refurbished item through Dell.&nbsp;

            <p>MelRowe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for this attempt to assist, must say NO!&nbsp; Not a problem with the password, it is with Windows' "The User Profile Service service failed the logon." AND this is with my regular Admin account which gives me the rights and privileges to do updates
 and installs of software.&nbsp; For NOW it is NOT doing me any good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One strange occurrence is FF v38.0.5 still functions, surf the net.&nbsp; My e-mail client, Pegasus Mail still works just fine, able to read and reply.&nbsp; Seems any program that is within the area that Microsoft has a speical function to INDEX the files for a faster
 search is preventing Windows from finding files to execute, run, plus Explorer cannot even rename any folder or file.&nbsp; Would like to repair the indexing feature, but; that requires the regular Admin password and that cannot be done, yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting and being curious . . may I apologize for the need to say NO to your inquiry.</p>

</p><p>As I have said before and still feel it is very true, Honesty is the best policy and not beating around with sugar coated words just to make it sound nice.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue from this side is controlled by a very curious animal that cannot just jump in and reinstall, a further investigation is needed.&nbsp; Have found other issues and strange occurrences by other features of Windows.&nbsp; That is what keeping going with this
 such as it is . . most all functions of Explorer are not working correctly, like renaming any folder or file, any program executable from an ICON link or direct clicking on the file in Explorer gets an ERROR message that Windows cannot find the file and a
 need to insure the spelling was correctly done even though done by direct contact or through a link that has worked just fine in the past six (6) months or even the last week.&nbsp; Suddenly does not work any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, my Mozilla FireFox v38.0.5 and my e-mail client Pegasus Mail still function normally.&nbsp; FF is on C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\ and Pegasus Mails is on E:\PMAIL\ which E: partition is NOT indexed while C: IS indexed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer to the official website of The sim3 game and then check the&nbsp;compatibility of&nbsp;the game with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If The sim3&nbsp;game is compatible with Windows 8.1, then it might or&nbsp;might not&nbsp;be compatible with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But&nbsp;I suggest you to try to install the game in&nbsp;program compatibility mode.</p>
<p>1. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without the quotes on search box next to
<strong>Start Menu </strong>and click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>View All </strong>the left panel of the screen and then click on
<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>3. Then click on <strong>Next</strong> and follow the instructions to install the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us if you need any further assistance on Windows related issues and we will be glad to help.<span>&nbsp;

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/beac1347-65cb-47b2-b803-613793b2821b" title="JoshFoley1">JoshFoley1</a>,</p>

</p><p>Sorry to hear this but this is the same thing that being happening with my brother's Xbox.&nbsp; Are their any messages popping you stating you reach your set "home" limits? You are allowed to change your home Xbox 5 times a year.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with the issue your having with the your account being removed from "home" on the Xbox&gt;&gt;&gt;I recommend reaching out to Xbox support and request a call back or speak to a live agent about them granting you another set "home" chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/</a>&nbsp;They
 are the only one who can give you another chance.&nbsp; Best of Luck&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I&#39;m having problems with Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Windows Professiol 7 32 bit.</h2>
                    When I open an image from Bridge, the photoshop panel is locked on one side of the monitor.&nbsp; The onle way I can get out of this is to ctrl,alt, delete.&nbsp; The problem continues.&nbsp; I tried to uninstall Adobe and reinstall with no luck.&nbsp; I called Adobe and
 they think there is a problem with the security system in Windows.&nbsp; Please help.

            It's not a problem with Windows7, I have CS4 running fine on my 64 bit Win7 Ultimate desktop.&nbsp; Did you try uninstalling Adobe Bridge (even if only temporarily) to see if ti works correctly without it?<br />
<br />
It may possibly be an issue with the particular security software you have installed on your own PC.&nbsp; My desktop runs NOD32 antivirus and Windows Defender and Firewall, but no third party security software.&nbsp; However many many PCs come with third party security
 software preinstalled so yoiu need to check what you are running.&nbsp; My desktop was a complete build by me and a clean install of Windows 7.

<p>Hey jrcjr,</p>
<p>This could be attributed to many factors such as conflicts among device drivers, applications, operating system settings, hardware, and corrupt elements in specific files.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Troubleshooting<br />
</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Make sure that the computer meets the minimum requirements for Photoshop.<br />
2.&nbsp;Install all the Windows Updates. .<br />
3.&nbsp;Re-create the Photoshop preferences file.<br />
<br />
Re-create the Photoshop preferences file to eliminate problems that a damaged preferences file might cause.<br />
<br />
<strong>To re-create the Photoshop preferences files:<br />
<br />
</strong>1.&nbsp;Quit Photoshop.<br />
2.&nbsp;Rename the Users\[username]\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS4\Adobe Photoshop CS4 Settings\Adobe Photoshop CS4 Prefs.psp file to Adobe Photoshop CS4 Prefs.old.<br />
3.&nbsp;Start Photoshop. Photoshop creates a new Adobe Photoshop CS4 Prefs.psp file.<br />
If the problem continues, then the Photoshop preferences files aren't the cause. To restore custom settings, quit Photoshop, then delete the new Adobe Photoshop CS4 Prefs.psp file and restore the original name of the previous Adobe Photoshop CS4 Prefs.psp file.<br />
<strong><br />
4.&nbsp;Restart Windows in a modified mode<br />
