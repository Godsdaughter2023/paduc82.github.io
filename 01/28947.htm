            Sorry but restore points are only for system files like apps and updates.  Resetting your PC will not bring back old data.
<br />You would have to been doing backups or creating system images.
<br />Were you doing either one of those?
<br />
<br />But also check you recycle bin, they will be in there until you empty your recycle bin.

            Hi Vicki,
<br />
<br />When did you delete them? A reset will your PC (or keep current files) and a system restore will return your PC to a previous system state, but not restore previous versions of your files. 
<br />
<br />I’d entertain these apps first:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-deleted-user-folder-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/file-recovery/recover-de...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva</a>
<br />
<br />You can give both of these a shot. now these are both 3rd party apps, and I trust them. Free to use. They may be able to recover your files. 
<br />

Watch out for ads on the sites that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products).

<h2>            Testing Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>Can I install Windows 10 Home on a laptop to ensure that it works correctly (and that the laptop's owner likes it - because they hate windows 8.1) without having to purchase a license?&nbsp; I would like to install win10 home and let them use it for a week or
 two (or three) to determine if they like it.&nbsp; They are actually requesting that I install windows 7 for them, and I'm trying to talk them out of it, but a win10 test period would help a lot.&nbsp; If they like it, I would just buy the activation code and input
 it, and they could continue on with minimal interruption.&nbsp; I just don't know how long win10 will run without activation, and what limitations they will have before activating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to upgrade from win8.1 home to win10 home, do I need a retail license, or can I perform an in place upgrade with an OEM copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't ask why they didn't just upgrade when it was free, because I don't know.</p>

<h2>            Unable to boot after latest windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with everyone else that has raised their issues with the new windows 10 update, I’m having the same problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the major update, I’m directed to the Window Recovery Environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c9bf892-c1df-436d-8b9d-67cd6e46efb1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c9bf892-c1df-436d-8b9d-67cd6e46efb1?upload=true" /></a><br />

<p>
</p><p>The go back to previous version option doesn’t do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read on the internet to do a manual repair on the bcd.</p>
<p>So here is what I did,</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0bd3824-7d40-4202-8e50-9e608e01621b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0bd3824-7d40-4202-8e50-9e608e01621b?upload=true" /></a><br />
Nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some details that might be useful</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/003297a6-442e-4cec-9a9e-7d9fc9010e35?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/003297a6-442e-4cec-9a9e-7d9fc9010e35?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Laptop build is Asus FX502V</p>
<p>Windows version should be the kne before the latest update,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Random16,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue happens if your computer has missing files that allows your computer to boot normally. To recover from it, you need to have a copy of

                    <p>Re: Netgear R 6400 Router. Received e mail from Netgear to upgrade firmware. However could not access router. Netgear said that because I did not upgrade firmware withing 6 months of purchase I had no security and I would gradually lose function. Wi Fi working
 and internet access working but Netgear phone guy said i would lose it unless I paid Netgear $150.00 for third party software. My computer tells me my drivers are up todate and Microsoft does not have any added drivers available for this router. Sounds like
 a scam and class action waiting to happen. Has anyone experienced this?</p>

            Hi elbashkateb,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to remove Seagate Crystal Reports from your computer using windows cleanup utility. Then download that software again and try installing it in clean boot mode.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Download link for windows cleanup utility: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/290301</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."<br />
<br />
Steps to enter clean boot mode:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
<br />
Now try installing the program and check.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span></a> . Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />

            Hi Gary,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience you are experiencing at this time. 
<br />
<br />Are you saying when you post a question to the Microsoft Community it is immediately locked?
<br />
<br />As for not being able to find contacts or make calls...
<br />
<br />Its possible you have somehow been signed into the wrong Skype account.
<br />
<br />Try signing out, restart your computer, sign in again using the email address and password associated with your Skype ID.
<br />
<br />See if your contacts then show up.
<br />
<br />If they don't...
<br />
<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable view your contacts to send messages. 
<br />
<br />Skype for web
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />As for alternative VoIP services, there are many, this most popular being Viber, WhatsApp is also a popular choice along with Facebook Messenger. It all depends on whether your contacts are also on those services.

            This can happen if you are using files which are incompatible with movie maker or if you don't have the proper codecs installed.<br />
What file types do you have in your movie?<br />
Which version of windows and movie maker are you using?<br />

            I have this error code and i don't have a clue how to understand this answer. &nbsp;I can't tell which version of movie maker I have since there is no where in that program that tells about it. &nbsp;I don't know what a codec is so I can't check them. &nbsp;I have taken
 several hours to put together a memorial montage for my fathers funeral and now can't save it so that it can be used. &nbsp;I have used several video clips and photos from stills so if some of my files are unusable it would be nice if it told me which ones - then
 I could perhaps delete them. &nbsp;but this is not helpful.

            I have exactly the same problem. I have saved many movies without problems but cannot get my latest to save. the save process reaches almost to end (or perhaps the very end) of phase 2 then fails. I have checked all file types are valid against the list
 provided by Helen C, and all are valid. No idea where to go from here.

<h2>            On Screen Keyboard Doesn&#39;t Work Right On WeChat</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire with detachable keyboard, running Windows 10, and I'm having trouble with the on screen keyboard. When I'm using the WeChat app, the on screen keyboard will not auto correct, show suggestions or capitalize the first letter of a sentence,
 even though I have those boxes checked in settings. It's really annoying and slows down my chat response time. This only happens on WeChat. Everywhere else, it works as it should. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I've tried everything I can think of.</p>

            We appreciate your response. The touch keyboard is designed by the application's developer. It has a different set of options/settings that you may need to reconfigure to enable those features that are currently missing. We highly recommend that you visit
 the app developer's support site for further assistance.<br />

Happy Holidays!

<h2>            Autoplay not working even though it is turned on and selected to ask everytime for removable drive and memory card</h2>
                    My autoplay is not working. I made sure it was turned on and settings are set to ask me every time a removable disk or memory card is present. I put in an SD card and nothing happens. I can view the files, but no autoplay. In windows 7 I could right click
 on the SD card and select "open in autoplay", but when I right click now in Windows 10, that option is not there. I've also tried stopping "Plug and Play" and then turning it back on, nothing. Please assist! Thanks!

<p>No, the only change I made was updating to Windows 10. I created a new user ID and nothing changed, then ran the SFC and no issues were found. Autoplay still does not work. Is there anything else I can try?</p>

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hey!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Well firstly allow me to give a brief introduction to the problem. I recently got a brand new system (about a month ago) from Alienware (M15x). One of my relatives have a Mac. I bought a new router about three months ago (Netgear
 N-300 Router WNR2000). We both use the same&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;home network.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now that that's done, I shall address the problem. What's happening is that my internet keeps disconnecting, whereas the Mac seems to be working fine. Even when I play Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, every 5-15 minutes it would
 say "Connection&nbsp;Interrupted" and then i wouldn't be able to play anymore for a long time. Keep in mind that the Mac still seems to be working fine. I ran diagnostics and it found a problem: "Your computer seems to be correctly configured, but the device or
 resource (DNS server) is not responding." I called my internet service provider and they said that it's not their problem, due to understandable reasons that I wish not to share on this post. I called Alienware and they said it's not their problem because
 as long as I get internet, even though I disconnect, the network card is not at fault. So now, I want to know if it's just Windows that's causing the problem. So my question is, who is at fault and how do I fix it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Hi ftosorciM,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>For DNS server follow the below steps and check for any errors listed in event viewer–</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start. Type &nbsp;<strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.&nbsp;<br />
b. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
ipconfig /flushdns (there is a space between ipconfig and /).<br />
It will show the message&nbsp; </span><span><strong>successfully flushed the DNS resolver cache.<br />
c. </strong>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
ipconfig /registerdns (there is a space between ipconfig and /).<br />
<br />
d. At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
ipconfig /all (there is a space between ipconfig and /) <br />
The ipconfig /all command displays Windows TCP/IP settings for all your network adapters.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. If your IP address for your Local Area Connection is either 0.0.0.0 or 169.x.x.x (where x is any number), then your computer is not
 getting an IP address from the router.&nbsp; <br />
If that is the case, try this: <br />
- ipconfig /release in the command prompt and press ENTER<br />
- ipconfig /renew in the command prompt and press ENTER</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Test it again by typing ipconfig /all to see what the address is?&nbsp; (If you are on a home router, it should start with either 192.168.1.x
 or 192.168.0.x or 10.x.x.x)</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may check if the anti-virus or any other security software is causing issues. I would suggest you to temporarily
 disable the security software installed and check if the issue resolves.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>If you temporarily disable any security software for troubleshooting then do not forget to enable it after the troubleshooting
 gets complete </span></strong><strong><span>as your computer will be under risk.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span><br />
</span><span><span>If the issue persists you may refer to the below provided link and check if the steps provided by Shekhar S assist you resolve the issue -</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:<br />
</span></strong><span><span>I would also suggest you to check if you have the updated driver installed for the network adapter. Refer to the below link for installing the latest drivers -<br />

<h2>            Power Options -&#62; Advanced Settings -&#62; No &#34;Battery&#34; Option&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The title pretty much sums it up: under advanced power settings, I don't have an option for "Battery."</p>
<p>I do have a battery attached via USB cable,&nbsp;and the manufacturer's drivers have been installed. The manufacturer's software works perfectly, and the battery does show up appropriately under Device Manager&nbsp;("CyverPower Battery Backup").</p>
<p>So, I guess I'm at a loss why I'm not able to configure power options for it... mostly, I'd just like to be able to specify that the system go to sleep if it's been running on battery power for more than a minute.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions you have,</p>
<p>&nbsp; - Nathan</p>
<p>P.S. This is a Windows 7 x64 install, fully patched, on a Dell T3500.</p>

<h2>            Computer AUTOMATICALLY shuts off during compressing a drive, now I cannot compress or uncompress the drive</h2>
                    I was compressing one of the 7 external drives that I have and my computer automatically shuts off while it was compressing and now I have a drive half compressed and half uncompressed!!! I CANNOT compress the rest of the files as 'compress drive' is already
 checked and I CANNOT uncompress the drive because when I remove the checkbox nothing happens because it thinks the drive is already uncompressed!!! I am STUCK with a drive that is half compressed, half not and there isn't a way I can find that will allow me
 to go one way or another!!!<br />

    <title>Dolby Advanced Audio Driver Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coltonrichter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dolby Advanced Audio Driver Not Working</h2>
                    Hello, I recently updated all my drivers on my computer that could be updated. (I have Windows 8), but now everytime I turn my computer on it says<br />
<br />
<b>The current Dolby audio driver version is 7.2.8000.17 and the software application expects driver version 7.2.7000.7. please install a valid driver and software application combination.</b><br />
<br />
Ever since that happened, I can't watch videos in the Windows Media Player and I can't play some full screen games. Also when I go onto Youtube, I have to wait about 10 seconds before I can watch a video. My computer is an Acer Aspire 5560-8431. If you guys
 could help, that would be great considering this new driver is a pain.<br />

            <blockquote>So then I should delete Dolby Advanced Audio?<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
You are using an operating system that your computer manufacturer doesn't seemingly support.&nbsp; Your choices (as I see them) are:<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<ul>
<li>Figure out the exact make &amp; model of audio device you have in the machine and go straight to that manufacturer for support - you might get lucky and they support that component of your whole system.</li><li>Go back to a supported operating system (it seemingly came with Windows 7) and know that should work since the system was designed around it.</li><li>Do whatever you think is right and makes things work in the manner you want them to.</li></ul>
&nbsp; <br />
Is "deleting" the "Dolby Advanced Audio" the right move?&nbsp; I wouldn't think so - it'd probably break something else.&nbsp; But - it might be for you - as it could just silent the message and that may be your main concern.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
When you upgraded (I assume that is what you did) this system to Windows 8, did you use the Acer supplied and suggested methods?<br />
<a href="http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/windows8-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/windows8-upgrade</a><br />

<a href="http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/upgrade-assistant-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/upgrade-assistant-tool</a><br />

<a href="http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/manually-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acer.ca/ac/en/CA/content/manually-upgrade</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Or did your system *come with* Windows 8?&nbsp; Again - we could have a failure in communications here.&nbsp; Where I am visiting the drivers page for the Acer Aspire 5560 15" laptop - you may have something else all together.&nbsp; What I am seeing shows that the system
 is pretty much only supported by Acer with Windows 7 64-bit.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am appalled that due to the windows 10 upgrade I do not have a working computer anymore. &nbsp;Can anyone help please. &nbsp;It was working perfectly before the upgrade to windows 10 and the subsequent 'go back' to windows 7.</p>

            <p>Thank you Greg and Cbarnhorst for your replies. &nbsp;Unfortunately they may as well be written in klingon to be of much use for me, a non techie. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received my laptop from a friend with no documentation, manuals, discs etc. &nbsp;The upgrade did not instruct me to do anything except press a button, no recovery media etc was mentioned. &nbsp;I do not keep anything on my laptop that requires a back up or recovery
 as I use it mainly for playing poker, so I was quite happy to go ahead with the upgrade without backing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am furious that microsoft did not inform me that upgrading to windows 10 could destroy my computer. &nbsp;I would not have proceeded otherwise. &nbsp;I had heard that it sometimes could cause bugs etc that would be ironed out, &nbsp;but not that is could cause total
 failure of computers. &nbsp;The upgrade worked fine except for compatibility with poker programs, so I do not understand why the 'go back' has ruined my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that Microsoft should pay to get my computer working again. &nbsp;It is just the same as if Microsoft had put a virus or malware on my computer. &nbsp;How such a massive company such as Microsoft could do this I do not know. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I'll be glad to help you fix this if you want to work with me.&nbsp; Since we don't know right now whether you have WIndows 7 or 10 to repair, let's focus on which you'd prefer to have.&nbsp; You said you went back to WIndows 7 because of Compatibility issues, but
 if these were serious enough they would have prevented the offer of the Upgrade to begin with since Get Windows 10 app runs multiple Compatibility checks.&nbsp; Did you ask any one for help with these issues as we could have helped you then, and we can still help
 you if you'd like to try Windows 10 again.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did like windows 10 and with ordinary use it was okay although there were a few glitches, but the main problem was with my poker websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEMS WITH WINDOWS 10 IN NORMAL USE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did not work at all one day so I could not play poker at all. &nbsp;However microsoft said there was an error and it was fixed the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not get onto the internet some of the time. &nbsp;It kept saying something about the adaptor and/ or the isp not recognized. &nbsp;I use a public wifi at the moment, so it could have been something other than windows 10, but it did not happen before, I don't
 think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PROBLEMS WITH WINDOWS 10 AND POKER SITES</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Party Poker I could get the site to work most of the time, but it kept saying it had technical issues and would not let me in. &nbsp;However it then sent a report saying that their site was working fine and the fault was with me. This did not happen I don't
 think before windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Betfair it let me in but then it would not display the log in page properly so I could not log on. &nbsp;I tried the compatibility error and it worked but then the next day it was back to normal again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On William Hill I had the same issues as on Betfair. &nbsp;This is because they both use the same platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pokerstars was okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were other issues, but I cannot think of them at the moment. &nbsp;I am on the computer at the library and do not have much time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back to Windows 7 because I used to play poker on it with no problems. You can imagine that where there is money involved it makes no sense to play on an operating system that I cannot trust. I thought I would go back to Windows 7 until they sorted
 Windows 10 out and then upgrade again. &nbsp;If I go back to Windows 7, HOPEFULLY!, can I then still upgrade to Windows 10 before the end of the upgrade offer? &nbsp;Or do you think I can get windows 10 to work with my poker programs and the internet? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation at the moment is that it begins to load windows 7 with the start up page of windows 7 but then goes to the start up repair as per my initial question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before perhaps the problems were just a coincidence, but with money involved and all the hassle I had with windows 10 the 'go back' &nbsp;to windows 7 was a no brainer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope that you can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>My laptop starts but then goes into a blue screen with writing which I cannot &nbsp;read because it goes off almost immediately. &nbsp;Then it starts like it is going into windows 7 but goes to &nbsp;a start up repair mode. &nbsp;It then tries to fix the fault but eventually
 says that I should contact my administrator or my computer manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What annoys me the most is that it categorically states that the problem &nbsp;relates to a recently installed software i.e the windows 10 update and the resulting 'go back' to windows 7!!!!!!! &nbsp;This is the only software I have installed. &nbsp;So why does not microsoft
 fix my laptop as they broke it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has microsoft not told us that the windows 10 update can ruin our computers? &nbsp;My laptop was working fine until the update and go back. &nbsp;Now I have a useless computer. &nbsp;It is like microsoft put a virus on my laptop. &nbsp;</p>

Clean Reinstall Windows 10</a>.&nbsp; When you are ready to try it again I will work through any issues you have with your websites connecting.&nbsp; First thing I'd try is a different browser to see if the issue replicates.&nbsp; If these are poker programs then check their
 Downloads site to make sure you have the WIndows 10 version or are aware of any issues they have with WIndows 10 which may be fixed now or being worked on by them.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Greg, thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to be quick as I only have 15 minutes on the library computer today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I want to emphasise is that although I would prefer to save what is on my computer, there is not much of it and I would not mind if by losing it I would be able to get my computer working again. &nbsp;Also I have tried looking up your link about 'clean
 reinstall windows 10 update', but it comes back as 'content not found'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the windows 7 tutorial but think it is beyond me. &nbsp;Maybe if I had the time, but I am really busy at this moment, even more with this computer hassle!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Acer Travelmate 3260 &nbsp;with Windows 7. &nbsp;Or rather it used to have!!!!</p>

<h2>            Speech Recognition Error Language Configuration &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Ok this is the first time I asked a question so I hope I get good result...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speech Recognition suddenly gave me an error recently this morning and it couldn't start because of the recognizer language must match the language of the user interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ffca27b-d184-4340-a097-aef50d423523?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ffca27b-d184-4340-a097-aef50d423523?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It also told me to go to the Control Panel&gt;Speech Recognition&gt;Advance Option as said in the prompt. I went there but this is what I got.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7546d29a-4e63-4dc8-84c4-71bf235257d5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7546d29a-4e63-4dc8-84c4-71bf235257d5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no link to the advance options and so I can't fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I would go search for an solution yet I couldn't get any so I post this question. I have tried the following things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Going to run and type "regedit" or Registry Editor. I went to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</p>
<p>and created a new string value "cftmon with CFTMON.EXE as it's Data". Restart</p>
<p>Results: Fail although it helped some people</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Going to Control Panel and going to advance yet it doesn't show so</p>
<p>Results: Fail</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI I accessed this one's and put a check mark on run at startup, so it runs and keeps on giving me the prompt every startup of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tried changing my Region and country and my display language to USA.</p>
<p>Result: Fail</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/910fe251-a833-4453-8bc3-601cddf38ac4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/910fe251-a833-4453-8bc3-601cddf38ac4?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do at this point... I might look at the BIOS and update this later but if I don't then it's also a Fail.</p>
<p>Thank You in Advance...</p>

            This is a question for the printer manufacturer - printing on both sides of a sheet of paper is usually controlled by the printer software and/or drivers.&nbsp; As you didn't include the make, model, and version number of your printer, I can't provide you with
 a link to their support site (but it should be easy enough to find).<br />
<br />
Here's a generic&nbsp;article on how to print double sided in Windows: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2253127_print-double-sided.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ehow.com/how_2253127_print-double-sided.html</a>.<br />
<br />
Here's another article on how to print double-sided in general (how to configure the laptop) and in Word and WordPerfect:
<a href="http://www.law.duke.edu/computing/printing/doublesided" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.law.duke.edu/computing/printing/doublesided</a>.<br />

Here's a final article on how to print double-sided manually (assuming you don't have the equipment to do it automatically):

<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>Desktop toolbar column width too small - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billaustralia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop toolbar column width too small</h2>
                    My new dell screen is 3840x2160. I have the toolbar at the left side with small icons plus text. As with my other windows 10 pcs, the icons arrange into columns depending on the width of the taskbar, but always with the same column width. With my new pc,
 the columns are so narrow that only 3-5 letters appear. In fact each column is only 3 times the width of an icon. On my other pcs, the columns are about 9 times the icon width showing lots of text. How can I increase the column width?

            Right-click on your screen and compare your resolution to your other Windows 10 pcs.&nbsp; Perhaps modifying the 3840 x 2160 is your best solution, although there are procedures offered.&nbsp; Also, have you tried dragging the width to a larger size?

            Thanks. Tried those. Change of resolution makes both the icons and letters bigger so no better. Also my wife got the high res to look at photos so a change in resolution is not an option. Changing the width increases the number of columns with no change
 to the column width.

            I imagine that if you repositioned the toolbar to the bottom of your screen it might act in a similar fashion to all the different toolbars that you can add to an IE browser -- that is, they would stack upon one another.&nbsp; Then you could perhaps autohide
 them, and make them disappear when you did not want to see them.&nbsp; The advantage to having them on the bottom would be that their text would be more than 3-5 letters.

            Thanks but it does not help. When I move the task bar to the bottom, I get the same icons and the same 3-5 letters....

            <p>When you click on the Taskbar properties, there are three choices listed in the
<strong>Taskbar buttons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Always combine, hide buttons</li><li>Combine when taskbar is full</li><li>Never combine</li></ul>
<p>Have you tried playing with those?&nbsp; After selecting the different choices, it seems to me that the one you want is the first; it hides the text.&nbsp; The word "combine" seems to relate to combining the icon with its text.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why the word "button" is used to replace the text is puzzling but that's what happens!&nbsp; So if you have that choice&nbsp;selected than you should not see even 3-5 letters.</p>

            <p>Done that and lots of other variations - no change in letters with each icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drag down border; icons move down.</p>
<p>Widen start bar; more columns hence fewer rows - same letters</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have compared to my other pcs. The pixels in each column is nearly the same on all pcs. The other pcs have about half the resolution so show twice the number of letters....</p>
