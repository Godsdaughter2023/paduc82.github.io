<h2>            All of my files are suddenly read-only</h2>
                    All my files are suddenly read-only, i haven't touched permissions at all. Nothing i try will change read-only related errors, such as not being able to clear browser history, or save files in my own folders from apps. I have exactly the same issue reported
 by other users on here and online for the PAST 3 YEARS.<br />
<br />
First, I ask you not mark this "Answered" like all the other questions that -were not answered-. Mark it answered when my computer is fixed. Thanks.<br />
<br />
Second, support person, i'll save you some time:<br />
<br />
+Read the "Can't change read-only" article you will eventually supply.<br />
+Attrib doesn't work. (when typed correctly, in an administrator prompt)<br />
+I am an administrator.<br />
+I never touched permissions prior to this issue, nor installed untrustworthy software.<br />
+I am running a clean Win7 64x install only 2 weeks old.<br />
+Unchecking 'read-only' and selecting 'apply to all subfolders and their files' chugs along, but errors persist. Upon further inspection, no sub-folder files were ever changed from read-only.<br />
+No sharing was ever setup on this computer, no files or folders shared.<br />
<br />
<br />
The technet answer of "This Behavior is Intended" is unacceptable. To allow an operating system to lock out an Administrator from their files, access and control of their files cannot be 'Intended'.<br />
<br />
Please give us some real tricks to try, and not just "right click, select properties, and then security..." because I assure you, i've already set my user with full control, and ownership of said files, but yet i have no control over them.<br />
<br />
Please tell me there is some other fix than Reinstalling windows again....

<div>Anyway, it sounds like a kernel level hook is blocking writes. &nbsp;Can you install/run software right now? &nbsp;If so, I'd recommend using Process Explorer (run it live from&nbsp;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default</a>)

            I don't mean to yell. I was under the impression the main point of this site was for microsoft to answer. I see now. Just&nbsp;frustrated, and after reading quite a few actual microsoft responses that were quite unhelpful, yet marked as 'answered', and not
 revisited despite 3 years worth users with the same issue, hit a breaking point.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your quick, and calm response. I'll give it a shot, and in the future i'll try to keep my snap-titude undercontrol

<h2>            Surface Pen Working Sporadically</h2>
                    <p>I've had my pen (single button, with a clip, with surface pro 4) for a while now, and recently it has started not working properly. Seemingly at random it will not write. The pen definitely has power as I have checked in the Surface app and it says I have
 79%. I have found that the pen appears to write well enough when upside down, which seems a bit random, but is of course completely impractical. The eraser seems to work fine no matter the orientation of the pen (although it doesn't always register clicks
 1st time, but it has been like this for a while now). Sometimes the pen will just not work at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Ideas as to what is wrong?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this up to Surface Community. If you don’t mind, I would like to ask some few questions just to further isolate the concern on your Surface pen. Because probably, this might be the more on the firmware or due to hardware issue of your
 pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it’s working properly before, when was the issue persist and what was your last activity on it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your Surface pro 4 is updated? I would like to get the OS build and the OS version of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(You can get the OS version and the OS build of your device by directly typing the word “<strong>winver</strong>” on your Cortana Search box)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you encounter this concern, have you tried some troubleshooting steps to fix the issue? If yes, what are those?
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>We would like to check also the driver version of the <strong>
Surface Pen settings</strong> and the <strong>Surface Pen Pairing </strong>which is located under<strong> Device Manager.
</strong>You can get the version of it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Surface Pen Settings:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to Cortana Search box and type there “<strong>Device Manager</strong>”</p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong>Tap/click “<strong>Human Interface devices”</strong> and look for “<strong>Surface Pen Settings”</strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong>Tap and hold<strong> or </strong>Hover the cursor<strong>
</strong>then right click then select “<strong>Properties”</strong></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under properties, look and tap on “<strong>Driver</strong>” then it will show the “<strong>Driver Version</strong>”</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Surface Pen Pairing:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to Cortana Search box and type there “<strong>Device Manager</strong>”</p>
<p><strong><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong>Tap/click “<strong>System Devices”</strong> and look for “<strong>Surface Pen Pairing”</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let us know so that we can provide correct resolution on your Surface pen.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies I had exams and so took so long to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started a week or so before i first messaged and has persisted since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Version 1809 (OS Build 17763.504)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try troubleshooting, but since it was so long ago other than what was in my previous message, I would probably not be able to give more detailed info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface pen settings Driver version: 12.0.303.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface pen pairing Driver version: 3.0.0.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hopefully this can be helpful</p>

<h2>            Automatic installation of Candy Crush, Micky Mouse and other useless garbage&#59; KNOCK IT OFF, MICROSOFT&#33;</h2>
                    <p>On the off chance that anyone from the Windows team is (a) here and (b) listens to user issues (as if), the next time you feel inclined to help yourself to my disk space by installing unmitigated trash like:</p>
<p>Bubble Witch 3 Saga;</p>
<p>Ratsack Rodent Magic Kingdoms;</p>
<p>Candy Crush Soda Saga or similar bloating, disk chewing refuse, could you please consider this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, my computer is not yours to put whatever you want onto. I put Windows on it. Just Windows. I did not and do not agree to any more than that.</p>
<p>Second, it is a business tool. Granted, I have some games on there. Deep games which stimulate the intellect in the way that popping bubble gum does not. I do not need something on Windows PROFESSIONAL which is aimed at the 8 year old market.</p>
<p>Third, My. Computer. Is. Not. Yours. Yes, that repeats point one. Read that last bit very, very slowly and let it sink in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not YOUR call what applications are or are not installed on my computer. It is mine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest what you can do with yourselves but it would be a tad rude and anatomically impossible. Let us just say that I do NOT want to see anything "New!" on my system unless I, me, this person here, has installed it.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your reply, and I realise that you're an MVP not a Microsoft person, but this is not the problem. Users should not NEED to take a tutorial to stop the installation of "suggested apps". They certainly should not need to start doing registry hacks.
 The apps are not "suggested" if Microsoft takes it upon itself to install them without our permission or consent. That makes them
<em><strong>inflicted</strong></em> apps, not <em><strong>suggested</strong></em> ones.&nbsp; All the way back to Windows 95, if you didn't want games, you did not have to install games. You had the features option right there in the install. I had no such options
 with my Windows 10 installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stand by what I said... the key point is that Microsoft needs to KNOCK THIS OFF. The number of threads that you find if you Google anything remotely similar to "Uninstall Candy Crush" is quite mind blowing.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, and I realise that you're an MVP not a Microsoft person, but this is not the problem. Users should not NEED to take a tutorial to stop the installation of "suggested apps". They certainly should not need to start doing registry hacks.
 The apps are not "suggested" if Microsoft takes it upon itself to install them without our permission or consent. That makes them
<em><strong>inflicted</strong></em> apps, not <em><strong>suggested</strong></em> ones.&nbsp; All the way back to Windows 95, if you didn't want games, you did not have to install games. You had the features option right there in the install. I had no such options
 with my Windows 10 installation.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I stand by what I said... the key point is that Microsoft needs to KNOCK THIS OFF. The number of threads that you find if you Google anything remotely similar to "Uninstall Candy Crush" is quite mind blowing.<br />

I agree they should not be automatically installed by default, but what I posted will at least stop it for you.

            Hi <strong>Kvteam,&nbsp;<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
1) Who is the manufacturer of the computer?<br />
2) What is the model number of the computer?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>The hp Laserjet 1010 printer is not supported by windows 7.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check out the link given below for windows 7 compatibility center.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
This is a driver issue.&nbsp; You will need to contact the manufacturre to see if they are going to have Windows 7 compatible drivers available for your device.&nbsp; In the mean time you can try using compatibility settings on the existing drivers however this may not
 get your surround sound working. <br />

Check out the link given below for drivers.<br />

<p>I have recently solved my problem, you can download this memory card reader from its website,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices</a>&nbsp;&lt;-
 this link found out what my problem and eventually took me to the website but if you don't have a&nbsp;Toshiba use that link. &nbsp;I did download the memory card reader but I couldn't find the website because the link was on the problem reports.</p>
<p>Hopefully whoever had my problem can resolve theirs too! :)</p>

            You failed to mention that "<strong>Tablet PC Optional Components</strong> " need to be enabled in the "<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong> " dialog box (left column) of the "<strong>Programs and Features</strong> " control panel. Even if
 you DO NOT have a tablet PC, this option must be checked to enable the Snipping Tool. I lost the Snipping Tool when I turned off these features on my PC.<br />

    <title>Scheduled Tasks Not Waking Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelwgilbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scheduled Tasks Not Waking Computer</h2>
                    <p>I posted this on the Surface 3 forum, but got nowhere. &nbsp;Maybe it isn't a Surface 3 specific problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Surface 3 tablet running Windows 10, tasks scheduled via the Task Scheduler are not waking Windows up. &nbsp;I started with a very simple task to open a command window at a specific time. &nbsp;If I click "Run" from within Task Scheduler, it works. &nbsp;If the tablet
 is awake, it works. &nbsp;However, if I put the tablet to sleep, it does not work. &nbsp;I am not shutting down the system, nor is it hibernating. &nbsp;It is in sleep mode. &nbsp;As soon as I wake the tablet up, the missed task runs. &nbsp;I've tried every combination of settings
 for the task, and it just won't run. &nbsp;This is on a Surface 3 tablet, which has a new sleep state called "InstantGo", and I suspect that this sleep mode just isn't compatible with the Task Scheduler, but I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got decades of experience with computers, but I hope I'm overlooking something simple. &nbsp;Has anyone out there run into this? &nbsp;I've tried all the obvious things.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>To wake up your Windows computer from Sleep mode at a fixed time, type <strong>
Task Scheduler</strong> in Search bar and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>In the right side, select <strong>Create Task</strong>. A new window will open. Here under the
<strong>General</strong> tab, fill in the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong>. Also check,
<strong>Run with highest privileges.</strong></li><li>Under the <strong>Triggers</strong> tab, click <strong>New</strong>. Another window will open. Select
<strong>One time</strong> (or Daily if you want it repeated every day at a particular time). Set the Date and Time when you want your system to wake up from Sleep.</li><li>Next under the <strong>Actions</strong> tab, you have to mention a task. Click
<strong>New</strong>. You can run a simple task, like say, first launching &amp; then closing the command prompt window. This thus will wake your system at the pre-set time to carry out the task.</li><li>Select <strong>Action as : Start a program</strong>. To schedule a task that executes the command
<strong>cmd.exe</strong> with command line arguments, copy-paste under <strong>Program/script</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>/c “exit”</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.&nbsp; Under <strong>Conditions</strong> tab, check on the <strong>Wake the computer to run this task check-box</strong>. Click
<strong>OK</strong> and <strong>Exit</strong> Task Scheduler. Click <strong>OK </strong>
and <strong>Exit </strong>Task Scheduler. Your computer will wake up from Sleep at the particular time.</p>

            Unfortunately, no. &nbsp;Task Scheduler is apparently incompatible with the new Windows 10 sleep modes. &nbsp;So far, Microsoft hasn't acknowledged, much less resolved the problem.

            I use KM Wakeup now. I found it after spending 3-4 hours trying to get task scheduler to wake my computer. It works perfectly and will execute a file upon opening. I did have to do away with the password when waking function though. I also had to disable
 my lock screen.&nbsp;

<h3> xbradyman6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Sign-In Issue &#40;Says to use the password for your Microsoft Account&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased an Xbox One last week and I have loved the experience ever since.</p>
<p><br />
However, I have been receiving a few errors in the past day.</p>

<p>While I was watching a clip that I had made (And also playing Minecraft) I was signed off and I couldn't get back into my account even though I had put the correct credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed my password and it worked immediately after that.</p>

<p>I had then asked my friend for his password which he had given me in order to download a game of his that he purchased (Since I did allow him to do the same thing before) which would be Grand Theft Auto, however, I couldn't log into his account because it
 was giving me the same issue.</p>
<p><br />
Even though I had been entering the credentials right, I still get the message saying, "Use the password for your Microsoft Account".
</p>

<p>All I am doing is going into the sign in section and clicking on "Add New", and then simply adding the information that is required to sign in.</p>
<p><br />
Can anyone help me?</p>
<p><br />
I'm certainly flustered.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear that you were having issues with your gamertag and am glad that you were able to resolve it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>GrowlingYapper is correct though about what you have done. &nbsp;Sharing your gamertag out to other people is against the ToU and CoC of the Live service and could result in the gamertag and/or console(s) involved being banned from the Live service. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Harryscot,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>Microsoft PictureIT 2000 is not Compatible with Windows 7. You may be able to install it but it won't have functionality.<br />
<span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>

<p>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate versions , install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>) and execute your software
 in Windows XP.</p>
<p>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.virtualbox.org</a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.vmware.com</a>) and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional)
 for that purpose. You can do a search on the Internet and find programs that are free of charge and will install on Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>Hope this helps to resolve your issue.</p>

            I, too, have this issue. The file size is 422 GB. It is located in the C: drive as a stand alone file (i.e. not in a folder). I noticed that my new laptop, after re-installing windows 10, was using much more space that I expected. I found this folder to
 be taking up most of it. Advice will be appreciated.

            <p>Having the exact same problem after restoring my Surface Pro 4. It is just in the C: drive and doubled the amount of storage I was using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd been struggling for a week to figure out what was taking up all the storage on my computer since I store everything but my software on OneDrive, and with the new update that came out yesterday my Storage setting finally displayed the C: drive root folder
 as the culprit. Turns out this little file was it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted it and there have been no problems in the past hour or so, so I figure it is fine to delete. Now I'm back to using a reasonable 90 gb instead of over 200!</p>

    <title>We Are The Forerunners Of Halo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            We Are The Forerunners Of Halo</h2>
                    
<p>We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am currently a Field Marshall and I am currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo Reach.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 70 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. Reydaitso and KillJoyseries89 made two websites where you can
 view more of Team Forerunner's information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WEBSITE INFO:<br />
KillJoyseries89 made this website:<br />
<a href="http://team-forerunner.spruz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://team-forerunner.spruz.com/</a> (No registration is required except in posting)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also have the "group" feature on Bungie.net. You can join our group there if you wish. We also have our own Youtube channel. Check that out if possible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim, and Mr Silph (So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at
 my friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because
 it is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings EVERY Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure),
 fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader) and Mr Silph (Team Forerunner Co-Leader) one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ArmorLock4Noobs also writes:<br />
"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner is a VERY fun clan!" -Capt Dewy/ispartan365 <br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a
 Halo Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim and/or Mr Silph. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if necessary.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

            Ok I'm trying to get Outlook. How Many are there ??? All I want to do is have an e-mail with no problems. I own and insurance agency. I go from one Outlook to another and than to another. There's office 365 I'm signed up for than that can putting me into
 a generic free Outlook. If that's not all bad I have lost all my stored Outlook. I have Outlook 2013,2016 live.outlook, Microsoft Outlook. My email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I was forced when I purchased Another outlook just to sign in. mike
 @insureallover.com. I sent a very important e-mail from my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and have no record that it was ever sent from my 5 sent files. Why can't Microsoft just have Microsoft Outlook 1. Outlook 2. Outlook 3 and outlook 4. and one more Outlook
 5. so there is no confusion. This nightmare began when outlook was introduced from a free platform to a paid version. So frustrated,&nbsp;

<h2>            &#126;25&#37; CPU usage while idle&#59; problems arose after coming out of sleep mode.</h2>
                    EDIT// just an update. as i mentioned in my first post i also had error with the Intel RST. i found the answer here: http://communities.intel.com/thread/16881. changing my SATA in BIOS should fix my problem, which is caused by an error between Intel drivers
 and BIOS. just in case anyone else has this problem.<br />
<br />
i'll start with some system specs:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Window 7 Home Premium | 64-bit</li><li>Intel Core i5 CPU | 650 at 3.20 GHz (Quad)</li><li>ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series</li><li>8 GB of DDR3 RAM</li><li>Microsoft Security Essentials <br />
</li></ul>
<br />
basically, my problem is that my CPU usage hovers around 25% while only the task manager is running. it's a concern to me because my processor/fans sound like they are running much harder than normal. to be more specific, when i used to boot my computer it
 would sound like it was working hard then die down once Windows was starting - now it never leaves that "working hard" state as far as the sounds it's making. i can't remember what my PCU usage used to hover around when i would check it from time-to-time,
 but i feel like it was much lower than ~25% and the computer was certainly quieter. also, my system tray says my Intel RST is not running - i only have one hard drive and haven't implemented any sort of raid configuration - and when i right-click it and select
 "open application", i get a prompt that says "IAStorUI has stopped working" before it disappears.<br />
<br />
as far as i know, these problems arose when my computer left sleep mode. i say "as far as i know" because my girlfriend is the one who both put it to sleep and woke it up while i was at work, so i didn't see exactly what error messages happened. i believe it
 was something along the lines of "an error has occurred while trying to leave sleep mode"; she tried booting it into safe mode, and i believe she got messages about the computer having trouble returning to it's normal state - so she then turned my PC off because
 she didn't want to select anything that may damage it. when i got home i finished booting it, and selected the prompts that said they would return my computer to the normal state, despite irregularities that it may cause. sorry if this is all too vague or
 hard to follow.<br />
<br />
i tried following the advice listed <a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f299/solved-high-cpu-usage-after-resuming-from-sleep-461383.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, even though most of the issues in those forums were in regard to laptops. i have tried basically all the varieties of fixing the hiberfil.sys file (i believe that is what it's called) in case it was corrupted - running command prompt as an administrator
 then typing<br />
<br />
powercfg [-h][-hibernate][/h][/hibernate] [off][on]<br />
<br />
- the brackets indicating what i tried at different times, with all sorts of restarts in between and finally one with a disk defragment in the middle. i believe i can safely say it is not because my hiberfil.sys is corrupted. i really don't know what else to
 do, and the sound of my computer working hard when it shouldn't be is just a tad bit stressful.<br />
<br />
any help/advice would be extremely helpful; thanks for your time.<br />

            thank you for the response. i forgot to mention that i had done a full reformat from a back-up image that was pretty recently captured - and it still did not fix the problem. as far as the methods you offered: the first method offered no solutions, i'm
 running a balanced power set-up and my auto-sleep/screen savers were already relatively power friendly; while i understand the second method is really just covering the bases and is more of an auto-response, it was also unhelpful, as i was using the performance
 statistics within the task manager to help determine that i had a problem in the first place; method three also yielded nothing conclusive. i performed a clean boot with all non-essential functions disabled, and my CPU usage/tower noise did not decrease -
 so i omitted the steps where you turn half of the services back on, and alternate, etc.<br />
<br />
i'll be cleaning off/out all of my hardware next time i get the chance to get another air duster (it's pretty clean already, though not immaculate), but i'm fairly certain it's a software issue since a little dust in the fan would not increase CPU usage (to
 my knowledge). then again, i will also be checking physical connections to make sure nothing looks out of place or something.<br />
<br />
again, i appreciate the response and welcome any other input. in the mean time i feel like i'm pretty much out of options as far as things i can find/do on my own. naturally i would love to get it back to running at around ~3% CPU usage idle or whatever it
 was; hopefully it is a bug/anomaly on the OS side of things that can be addressed/resolved.<br />
<br />
EDIT// just an update. as i mentioned in my first post i also had error with the Intel RST. i found the answer here: http://communities.intel.com/thread/16881. changing my SATA in BIOS should fix my problem, which is caused by an error between Intel drivers

            Hi Yute, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

            This is a recovery partition unhidden by Windows update. It was supposed to be hidden. Hiding it doesn't create any problem.

            Hi Cruis, <br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;
<div>
<p>&nbsp;We understand that, People App does not launch on your system and we will assist you to fix this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better: <br />
&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;1. Did you install all the pending updates on your system?&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp; Did you make any changes on the system, prior to this issue?&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;3. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the system to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Let's try to follow these steps below and check, if it works:<br />
<br />
The Modern app troubleshooter can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Try to run the Windows store App troubleshooter steps&nbsp; below:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;1. Type ‘Troubleshooting’ in the search bar and press Enter. <br />
&nbsp;2. Click on ‘View all’ on the left panel of the ‘Troubleshooting’ window.<br />
&nbsp;3. Click on ‘Windows store app’ and follow on the screen instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<div>&nbsp;If you are not able to open the photo app or photos in the app then&nbsp; I suggest you to download and run the app troubleshooter from the following link and check if it helps.</div>

<div>&nbsp;<br />
If you are unable to open the People App , then you can go with the clean boot to check, if that helps.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Let's try to perform a clean boot and check, if it works. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</div>

<p>I have this problem as well. People app will not start. But it's just a problem with my account; seems to start just fine for my kid's accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app troubleshooter said I needed to connect a Microsoft account. Already have that and have double-checked. Even switched to a local account and back to MS account. Still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was going to try your clean boot step, but the instructions are for Windows 8.1 and older. Nothing there for Windows 10. Can you post a link or instructions for Windows 10? I've searched and didn't find anything, just the same page you posted which doesn't
 apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating...</p>

            <p>I imagine the clean boot option for Windows 10 is similar to that for Windows 8.1. That said, it is far too much work to make a small app like this work. When you download the app, it is Mail/Calendar/People. The other two work, but quite frankly, the web
 front end works fine for all of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bigger issue is all of the problems with the Microsoft App Store. I should not have to run a troubleshooter...which never finds the issue anyway. We have multiple computers for the family, and on each one, I have different problems with applications
 from the store. It is beyond frustrating. It is simply bullsh*t.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this happens with the Apple or Google stores, but, somehow, I doubt it.</p>

 require that you use a Microsoft Account, yet in order to reinstall the People app for my local Administrator account, I have to log in with a Microsoft Account! I have several other local accounts on this computer (for my kids) and the People app works just
 fine without a Microsoft Account.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So at this point, I have tried uninstalling and re-installing the People app for both my Administrator account (which is local) and my personal account (which is a Microsoft Account). I've done this while running with a clean boot.

            <p>All of this is simply too much work for the functionality of this application. FWIW, I do not tend to synch my settings, so the Troubleshooter doesn't want to work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in IT so I can at least follow these instructions if I choose to. Are you telling me that if a regular person contacted you, that this would be the instructions they get? Really? Really?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe you would suggest a reset or refresh. Now, how do you explain to them what happens to the Win32 applications that they use? Or do you really think that people are using their computers just to browse the web and run&nbsp;these wonderful windows store
 applications? If so, RT would not have failed. If so, they would be using an iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When thinking about the Windows Store/UWP platform, here is something that perhaps has not been considered. Phones are personal devices. PCs and to some extent, tablets, are not.</p>
<ul>
<li>Very typically, they are shared by multiple users in a family. They also are very different, in screen resolution, memory, storage etc. It does not always make a whole lot of sense to synch settings between them.</li><li>When I buy an application, I expect that it is available for all users of that device, not just myself. It seems odd to me that Office 365 Home, is a multi-person subscription; but that if I download the free, mobile versions of the Office applications,
 then I have to "purchase" and install it for each individual user.</li><li>Why is Mail/People/Calendar checking, for a store account? The application is included in the Windows 10 license, and it gets it's data from web services.</li></ul>
<p>Windows 10 is generally pretty solid, but the store, and the apps are just a disappointment. Hopefully someone is thinking about remedying this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The response below, by TimCashin, is similar to the last time I tried resolving an issue like this (different app). The PC has multiple accounts, both Microsoft Accounts and local accounts (I really do not need the admin account to be an actual user...).&nbsp;Each
 account might be having difficulty with a different app. It is just an awful situation, and typically, the boilerplate suggestions do not help. This stuff simply has to work.</p>

Thanks for the suggestion, but that doesn't seem to be my issue. TimeBroker is running. People App still not...

    <title>Font size in Windows 10 Home Version - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Font size in Windows 10 Home Version</h2>
                    Hello.&nbsp; Can someone please tell me how to enlarge my font for Windows 10 email display?&nbsp; The entire email screen, inbox, etc, has very small font.&nbsp; I can enlarge one email's content by holding down Control X and using the roller in the middle of my mouse,
 but this does not correct the entire problem of the whole email box being small.&nbsp; Thanks so much for any help.
