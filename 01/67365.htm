<h2>            Graphics&#58; Intel&#174; Graphics Media Accelerator Driver for G41 Express Chipset for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated from windows 7 to Windows. Today I tried opening minecraft and it showed me an error-</p>
<div>&nbsp;Bad video card drivers!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----------------------&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>
<p>Minecraft was unable to start because it failed to find an accelerated OpenGL mode.<br />
This can usually be fixed by updating the video card drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating my driver but it isn't working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please provide me with the link for downloading Graphics: Intel® Graphics Media Accelerator Driver for G41 Express Chipset for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or any other way to solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Details- My Processor is Pentium Dual-Core CPU E5800 @3.20GHz 3.20Ghz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks a ton!</p>

 and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.&nbsp;<br />
b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on ‘properties’.&nbsp;<br />
c. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the
 issue persists.</span></p>

            nothing new has been added not sure when this started. Everything else seems fine except I tried to install malwarebytes and it will not let me. I took hard drive out and scanned in another pc with malwarebytes and found nothing.

            I also restored with windows image backup from a week ago and same problem is in backup. I did a new install and all works but I have to many programs to reinstall and data to make sure is all backed up so I restored back with bad backup for now hoping
 I can clean it up and not have to start all over. <br />

<p>Thank you for your response. Some of the common symptoms of (0x800700aa) are unfinished installation of Windows application, virus infections, inaccruate registry entries, corrupt system files, incompatible or outdated software or hardware, unfinished uninstalling
 of some files, clashes between the automatic update error and the computer, installing of some corrupt or infectious apps or files, etc. In this case, we suggest to run a clean boot on your computer. Kindly follow the steps provided by
<strong>Stephanie Sal</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-restore-error-code-0x800700aa/df961792-ad24-4c3c-be21-968c259692bb">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding about the Task Manager concern. Malware may prevent opening of Task Manager. So you may want to clear your computer junk files and then run a full or deep scan with your antivirus or security software or Microsoft Security Essentials. If you're
 done running those tests. We suggest to run DISM and SFC. By doing so, the task will scan for changed or misplaced files. If sfc discovers that a protected file has been overwritten or corrupted, it retrieves the correct version of the file folder, and then
 replaces the incorrect file. Kindly follow the steps below to perform the task:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run DISM and SFC </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open an Administrator CMD window. If you can’t find a way, use these steps:
<ul>
<li>Press CTRL+Shift+ESC to open Task Manager.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><span>File<span>&nbsp;</span></span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Run New Task.</span></li><li>Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges” .</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><span>CMD</span>.</li></ul>

<p>if your on about the original Xbox that came out in 2001 - 2002 then you will not find a new one anywhere, there are plenty of second hand ones available and they were a pretty reliable machine. &nbsp;just get the console out and dust it off and get playing,
 enjoy it while it does last.</p>

<p>I'm just worried about losing game saves since the Xbox has a built in hard drive. I'd rather not invest time and effort into possibly dying Xbox only to replace it and have restart all my games.
</p>
<p>The Xbox did have memory cards but I heard they had very little memory making it a pain to back up a whole library of saves.

<p>How would things be any different if you bought a new one then? It would still be a pain to transfer any current saves. Sounds like your best bet would be to just buy a memory card and start saving things on there.</p>

<p>If you bought one in 2005, you should be just fine because those consoles were much more reliable. The console will probably last you forever. The major problem with the original console had to do with the disc drives. The original thomson drive had a very
 high failure rate. I believe there was problems with the second gen Philips drive as well. Your drive should be a Hitachi which I believe was the most dependable.</p>

<p>My launch Thompson Xbox started to fail on me right around the time Xbox Live released and was then out of warranty. I believe the failure rate was about as high as the RRoD however not enough people had the model for Microsoft to have to do anything about
 it </p>

<p>Thompson drives were dodgy as and mine stopped reading games 6 months after purchase so I did some research and replaced it with a new Phillips Dvd Drive and too this day it still reads disks.</p>
<p>The only thing id be cautioned on is the 8 gig hard drive which is tricky to replace without the know how as it has a special eeprom key also finding an old school PATA drive would be tricky.</p>

<p>We bought an Original Xbox a little after it launched. Never had any problems with it.</p>
<p>Last month, after 11 years (I guess?) it did not turn on. Currently it's being repaired and it cost me about $120 to get it repaired.
</p>
<p>I will be getting it back next week and I hope that all of my downloadable content/saves will still be there. Otherwise, spending all of that money was pointless.
</p>
<p>Needless to say the Original Xbox was built really well. The only reason I believe it died was because of what was inside the Original Xbox -- we used to live in a roach infested apartment and roaches got inside the Xbox. I think the roach infestation attributed
 to the demise of our Xbox. We played the Original Xbox for thousands of hours (and over 12,000 games of Halo 2 played), was much better than the 360 (which we are on our 3rd one).

    <title>Windows 10 fails to locate my graphics card and refuses to install - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 fails to locate my graphics card and refuses to install drivers for the chipset.</h2>
                    I have had a bitter two days after my Win 10 64bit has tried and failed to install several updates. One of the updates is for the chipset including ports and display. The upshot has been that when I attempted to update the graphics card driver (nVidia
 Quadro K620) the OS not only failed to allow the install it deleted the original working driver, now I have a Precision Workstation that had two HD screens now has one 640 x 480 **** screen that will not run my graphics software. NVidia, PNY have not been
 able to help. I do not know what to do. &nbsp;My m/c is a Dell Precision Workstation T5400 with two quad core processors and 16Gb of RAM. It has Intel 5400 chipset. &nbsp;Device Manager shows 'Unknown Device' where once there was a very fast graphics card. &nbsp;Help!!!
 All attempts to install the driver is met with failure and I do mean all!

<h2>            User folder shows and disappears in navigation pane</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month or so ago I noticed an issue on my Windows 10 (1607 AU) PC. In the navigation pane of Windows Explorer (the tree view on the left hand side) the user folder &nbsp;(that is the folder named with my username in the C:\Users\ directory) would appear
 and then disappear again within a few seconds. This occurred on a seemingly random basis, usually around 5 to 6 times a day. Whenever the folder appeared or disappeared the PC made a sound like some kind of notification, one that is unlike any other Windows
 notification I have previously heard (just spent the last 10 mins searching all the Windows 10 sounds on YouTube and didn't find it, though it does sound a
<em>little</em> like the "ir_start" sound).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a week or so this behaviour stopped - I assumed an update had fixed it. However, I just heard the sound again! Unfortunately I didn't have an Explorer window open at the time to see if the directory appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the User directory will show normally if I right click on the navigation pane and tick/check "Show all folders" - this is
<strong>not</strong> what's happening as I only (more) recently discovered this option so it has always been un-ticked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is causing this?</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 screen cracked without a physical drop&#47;hit. Believe it is a glass defect. Any way to repair it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like my surface pro very much. I was happy about it until yesterday I found a crack on the screen. I cannot remember any physical hit or drop on it. And I use a very good protective case for it. But the crack just show up. I checked the crack carefully,
 it turns out that the crack starts from the microphone hole, which I believe causes a glass defect. With this defect, under some perturbation, e.g. heat of the CPU, the glass just cracks. The surface is still full functional.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was frustrating about this. I've been used it for only 3 months and I protected it so much.
</p>
<p>But the screen still cracks. And I asked Microsoft support, they told me that screen crack</p>
<p>of any form is not under warranty protection.</p>

<p>as you described the crack runs from the microphone hole till the other end of the screen and i have a glass protector covering it and the crack still happened&nbsp;</p>
<p>all this happened while it was in a case and it was not dropped</p>
<p>i haven't contacted Microsoft yet but i don't feel i should be paying 350 dollars after i spent $2000 for a item that's a manufacturers fault&nbsp;</p>

            My husband has had the same problem. His has been sent back to Microsoft for assessment under warranty but despite it being in as new condition except for the crack they refuse to fix it under warranty. I am very angry as it was bought for him as a Christmas
 gift&nbsp; and I don't see why I should have to pay to have it fixed when it is not his fault. I believe that there is a fault in the glass. These are supposed to be portable devices. His has never been out of the house and is always used with great care. Deeply
 regret purchasing this and will never buy another piece of Microsoft hardware. Should have stuck to Apple devices which we have always used i the past with no issues. I would be very interested to know just how many people have had the same issue<br />

            <p>here's the update since my last post&nbsp;</p>
<p>i called Microsoft and the support tech told me that Microsoft does not have a record of this defect so its not covered under warranty so i told him to look at this forum (as it seems no one at Microsoft feels its necessary to look at their own website)</p>
<p>His response was that there is not enough complaints to warranty Microsoft a reason to investigate this problem so now i have to pay $450 dollars for a new screen which mind you for such an expensive piece of glass i don't see how it could break!!!!!! (
 unless they're charging you cause they could and it has nothing to do with quality)</p>
<p>As per the tech he suggests going in to a Microsoft store and discussing it with the staff there and they will determine if this is as i said, a damage due to a defect and if they deem it their fault they will cover the repair&nbsp;</p>

 cracked screen...</p>

<p>Take some good advice. &nbsp; Go to a Microsoft retail store and ask to speak with the manager. &nbsp;You have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain. &nbsp;Contrary to the other posters comments I have found the personnel in the retail stores in NJ very helpful
 and very cooperative.</p>

            I actually ended up contacting Microsoft through their Facebook page. They asked for photos of the damage which I sent. They then agreed to replace the machine under warranty. They have also arranged for the damaged one to be picked up by a courier. Finally
 a good outcome<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am not inclined to spend another 450 bucks on another device that is bound to break.&nbsp; If I had a warranty, this would be a different issue.&nbsp;

Here are all the LEGAL options to obtain Vista:<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back to Factory
 Settings</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>There is no legal free Vista download available.</strong><br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Ask them if you can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Print Management snap-in to automatically detect all the printers that are located on the same subnet as the computer on which you are running Print Management, install the appropriate printer drivers, set up the queues, and share the printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add a printer by IP address or hostname, you must be a member of the local <strong>
Administrators</strong> group or be granted the <strong>Manage Server</strong> permission.</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>To automatically add network printers to a print server
</strong>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open <strong>Print Management</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In left pane, click <strong>Print Servers</strong>, click the applicable print server, right-click
<strong>Printers</strong>, and then click <strong>Add Printer.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>On the Printer Installation page of the <strong>Network Printer Installation Wizard</strong>, click
<strong>Search the network for printers</strong>, and then click <strong>Next</strong>. If prompted, specify which driver to install for the printer.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer to the image below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a329811c-600e-4c12-8162-262aaf4faca8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a329811c-600e-4c12-8162-262aaf4faca8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have problems then run the printer troubleshooter: <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Unable to uninstall McAfee</h2>
                    <p>I have used computers since they were born. They have always sucked, but windows 10 really sucks. I wish I was back at windows xp still. It sounds as though others are experiencing the same things. I cannot get rid of Mcafee and other crap. Why in the ****
 do I need administrators permission when I am the only one on here? SUCKS . This is a new computer and I will not buy another. How do I get permission&nbsp; to use my computer the way I want?</p>

<h2>            HP laserjet 3200 will not work after upgrade from Vista</h2>
                    I recently updated from Vista 64 bit to Win 7 Home Premium and an old HP laserjet 3200 will not work when plugged into the USB port.&nbsp; It does not recognize the drivers when plugged in.&nbsp; It says driver not found.&nbsp; I have run Windows Update and that did
 not help either.&nbsp; I also downloaded the universal driver from HP's website and that is not recognized when I plug in the printer.&nbsp; It looks like the scanner drivers installed because the scanner portion is recognized as a device.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?

    <title>Why is it that search in windows 8 explorer doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil-t_002  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is it that search in windows 8 explorer doesn&#39;t work EVERYTIME&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 has a search bar just about everywhere needed. However, frustratingly it doesn't always work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click in the search bar and start typing and windows show things beginning with the first character then as you continue typing it removes the non-matching files. Works great but not every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometime I'll do a search and it will find what I want and the next search right after it nothing happens. It's not that the file I'm looking for isn't there,&nbsp;I may look for the exact same file again,&nbsp;it just stops working and you only see the folder in
 the browse view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To explain further. After I installed windows 8 I moved my music and eBooks. So now the not so smart iTunes can't find 600 items. As you know you double click, it say can't find this do you want to find it I say yes. I browse to my&nbsp;eBook library and type
 the name of the book and presto, search feature kicks in and narrows my search till only the file I want is there. I click on it and done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Next file. This time I browse to the eBook folder start to search and nothing happens. it's like it's stuck. I back
 space retype, nothing back space again retype and this time it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as a techie,&nbsp;I like to figure out when it works and when it doesn't. So I'm trying different things. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I even browse to a folder where a file is I'm looking for. I see it right in front of me but I type search
 and nothing. Just the browse view. Than it works, and than it doesn't again till finally it stopped working altogether.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not just for iTunes but I've been check this out in the explorer window for months. I've searched the internet and can't find the there but this is real.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any body seen this or got a clue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>2) This problem I noticed with Windows 8 from the start so no there haven't been any changes before to problem began.
</p>
<p>3) As I mentioned it is not file specific. I will be&nbsp;in explorers browse view, type 1-5 characters and nothings happens.&nbsp;The browse view does not change, folders do not disappear, files are not eliminated from view. NOTHING HAPPENS!</p>
<p>Honest; absolutely nothing happens on screen and this can happen right after completing a successful search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) The only troubleshooting I've done is listed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, I thought I figured it out. I found&nbsp;that opening a new window a makes a new search work. Or clicking on the top most folder will make a search work. However not every time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what I did...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have over 5000 pictures have the prefix DSC0</p>
<p>So I type DSC02 .&nbsp; Hundreds of files show up. (They range from DSC02001-DSC02999 minus the pictures I deleted as substandard)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I type DSC027.&nbsp; 10 files show up. </p>
<p>Next, I back space and change the 7 to&nbsp;8, the DSC027 files disappear but no DSC028 files appear. The files are there but windows doesn't show them. So I put back DSC027 and now they don't show up. Neither does DSC02, DSC0 nor DSC bring up any results as
 I backspace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OK, so I ask myself Why? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NEW WINDOW TEST</p>
<p>So I close the window and open a fresh Window.</p>
<p>I type the DSC02 again but open a new window after adding each number 7, 8, 9 it works each time with a new window but not if I don't open a new window. However I have found that sometimes it doesn't work in a new window either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SLOW TYPING TEST, THAN A PAUSE TEST</p>
<p>I open a New Window</p>
<p>I type D&nbsp; S &nbsp;C. This works and all 5000 pictures show up.</p>
<p>I pause a little longer than add the 0. All the files disappear even though they all start with DSC0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MY CONCLUSION</p>
<p>It appears that a pause or concluded search causes windows&nbsp;to carry on the search as if the added characters where a new search string and it than searches only the results that where obtained from the initial search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So typing DSC may bring 5000 results but pausing and adding a '0' is asking windows to look among the DSC results for a files beginning with '0'.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may or not be the problem. However, I hope this information helps you think of a solution to this issue.</p>

<p>The symptoms you describe are consistent with a corrupted user profile.&nbsp; Another symptom is that it appears that all your documents, pictures, music etc. is suddenly "missing" from your system and these things are not really missing - they are all under
 the user profile that is corrupted and you can recover them.</p>

</p><p>I don't know all the reasons a profile might get corrupted (easy to do on purpose) and sometimes logging out and logging in again (or restarting) will get things working again.&nbsp; Some folks think a System Restore to a date/time prior to the incident will
 work so you can consider that option. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't "fix" a corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure looking at the user accounts screen in Control Panel will not help you but you can sure try it and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens often enough that Microsoft has an article that tells you how to copy most of the things from the corrupted profile to a new user profile that you will have to create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some ways to be sure that the problem is a corrupted user profile and a link to the article from Microsoft that you can consider:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
Another option is to perform a System Restore to a date/time prior to this incident.
</p><p>
</p><p>If you see the taskbar and desktop with just a few icons and it appear that all or most of your installed programs and personal files are "missing" it could be that you have a corrupted user profile...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is extremely unlikely that all your documents (or anything else) has vanished or been deleted...&nbsp; they are just in a place where you can't see or find them</p>
<p>
</p><p>This condition sounds like a corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes (for some reason) Windows has a problem reading your profile information when you login and that condition could just be temporary and simply restarting your system will get things going again and if that works you should keep an eye on things
 because it could be a sign of a bigger problem.</p>
<p><br />
When your user profile is corrupted Windows will log you in to a temporary profile and that temporary profile is not going to have any of the things that you are used to seeing - but you can fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every user on your system has a user profile and under each user profile are all the things what belong to that user - the Windows desktop, the taskbar, the All Programs menus, Documents, Music, Images, etc.&nbsp; Each user has their own set of these and if Windows
 has logged you in to a temporary profile you are not going to see any of these things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Explorer to navigate to the c:\Users folder and look for a folder that has the same name as the user profile you are used to using - that is where all your "missing" items are.&nbsp; You might see something like this in the Users folder:</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When your user profile is corrupted Windows will log you in to a temporary profile and that temporary profile is not going to have any of the things that you are used to seeing - but you can usually recover everything missing from a corrupted user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you login you might briefly see a message "Preparing your desktop" followed by a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=937f7707-d975-45ce-836d-00248b0a20f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d2bf04c-26a9-447f-9b0d-01dea2dbb8d4" /></a></p>
<p><br />
That message will fade away leaving you with a desktop with just a few icons - maybe all you see are a few basic things like a Recycle Bin.</p>
<p><br />
A temporary profile does not last...&nbsp; as soon as you shutdown or logoff the temporary profile is deleted and when you restart your system or login again you will see the same thing again (a good thing to test).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the problem is temporary and if you restart your system a few times things might start working again (lucky you) but if that does not work you are going to have to create a new Windows user and copy parts of the afflicted user profile to the new
 user profile.</p>
<p><br />
Another quick test to verify the problem of a corrupted user profile is to open a Command Prompt window and see what the prompt says:</p>
<p><br />
Open a Command Prompt window and tell us what the prompt says:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=20382857-f809-49f2-8783-1488b77717f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37dc963f-f5f0-4f98-b17a-70277fd02e90" /></a></p>
<p><br />
Normally the Command Prompt window will open in the Users folder that belongs to that user like this for user Jose:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=67489ccb-14d4-48e8-a8cb-db4d928cbe58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92dbce27-ca97-4626-ae2c-063a8acac03a" /></a></p>
<p><br />
If the prompt looks like this, it means your login profile is corrupted and you have been logged in to a temporary profile (it says TEMP):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=09b91157-1859-4d53-8093-bea5f1abd845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47c01e3d-c3cf-4963-ad98-f6284e4d963f" /></a></p>
<p><br />
When you open a Command Prompt window what does your prompt say?</p>
<p><br />
Enter 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your user profile is corrupted and fails repeatedly to login, you cannot fix or salvage it - you must create a new Windows user account and copy most (not all) of the files from your corrupted profile to the new user account and then use that new account
 from now on. </p>
<p><br />
Microsoft has an article that tells you how to do that:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14039/windows-7-fix-corrupted-user-profile</a></p>
<p><br />
The problem is that one of these files in the afflicted user profile is corrupted so don't copy these to the new user account:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Ntuser.dat</li><li>Ntuser.dat.log</li><li>Ntuser.ini</li></ul>
<p>One of those files has the corruption in it so you don't want to bring those corrupted files (or any that look like it) into the new user account you have created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example you would NOT want to copy files that looks like these from the corrupted profile into the new profile:</p>
