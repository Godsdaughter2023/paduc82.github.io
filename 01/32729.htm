    <title>Can&#39;t sign in to windows with the same password by which I am able - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anuragbharadwaj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sign in to windows with the same password by which I am able to sign in to my Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>My windows account is synced with my microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can log in to that microsoft account but cant log in to windows using the same password. I even tried resetting the password. I am not able to login with the new as well as the old password. I also restored my windows to a previous version but it also
 is not working. The keyboard is in English (US) mode only and hence what I am typing is correct. Also, I have typed using On-Screen keyboard also which is also not working.</p>
<p>The only change I made to my system is installed a software from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlT0N2CX50g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/vlT0N2CX50g?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/vlT0N2CX50g?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;(I mean the link given in the description). After its installation, when I rebooted my system, I am facing this problem. It may be a coincidence but I am just sharing it so that you are aware of the complete situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am feeling really helpless.. What should I do?</p>

    <title>cdfs.sys is present but disabled in Windows 7 -- how can I change it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mleprof  say:</h3>
<h2>            cdfs.sys is present but disabled in Windows 7 -- how can I change it to manual&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to use CDFS CDs under Windows 7, apparently because cdfs.sys has been disabled.<br />
<br />
cdfs.sys is where it should be, in c:\Windows\System32\drivers\<br />
<br />
It's also in the Registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\services\cdfs and the same except ControlSet002 and CurrentControlSet<br />
<br />
However, according to System Information &gt; Software Environment &gt; System Drivers:</p>
<p>-- Started reports "No" </p>
<p>-- Start Mode reports "Disabled" and </p>
<p>-- State reports "Stopped"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>cdfs.sys is not listed at all in Services, so I can't change the settings there.&nbsp; Also, it is not listed at all in msconfig &gt; services, so I can't change the settings there either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change these settings, or at least change "Disabled" to "Manual"?<br />
<br />
</p>

            <p>Thank you, but I had already tried that before posting this question.&nbsp; If you look at the replies to the answer you cite, you will see that I replied to it, stating "This answer is not helpful for me."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people have posted similar questions, all along the lines of "cdfs.sys is disabled."&nbsp; I have already tried many of the proposed solutions, with no luck so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, I don't see the people who asked saying their problem was solved.&nbsp; One who did say that said cdfs.sys was missing from his drivers directory and the CDs worked when he found a copy somewhere else and copied it to his drivers directory.&nbsp; That
 is why I pointed out that it is in my drivers directory already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Perhaps I did not make clear that the CD/DVD drive works fine for other CDs and DVDs.&nbsp; The problem is only with CDs that use CDFS.)</p>

            <p>Yes I have checked that, My desktop can support 64 bit version. Second thing, My computer came with windows 7 32 bit version (pre-installed). Later on, I installed windows 8.1 32 bit on it and recently I have a RAM upgrade (only RAM), therefore, I was thinking
 to shift my system to a 64 bit.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer supports 64 bit architecture, then you can install Windows 8.1 64 bit. Unfortunately, you cannot use the same product key which you used for Windows 8.1 32 bit to upgrade to Windows 8.1 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have upgraded the RAM, it is recommended to upgrade the system to 64 bit. You can buy Windows 8.1 Po from the link provided below.</p>
<p>

            I purchased Windows 8 Pro with two disks -- 32 bit and 64 bit. I upgraded my old 32 bit XP to 32 bit Windows 8. Then upgraded from 32 bit Windows 8 to 32 bit Windows 8.1. I now want to install the 64 bit version from the other disk. Can I use the original
 key for Window 8 Pro to do a clean&nbsp;install of the 64 bit version? ...and then upgrade that to 8.1?

            It would be password protected, I just wouldn't lock it when I'm not using it or have it lock itself when it logs off?&nbsp; Isn't that the way it works?&nbsp; If your scenario were the case, it's not locked now because I'm using it and they could hack it now?&nbsp;
 I'll probably leave it the way it is and paint the password across the bottom of my computer desk.&nbsp;

<p>I am trying to change when I get the lock screen.&nbsp; I'm fine with getting it when I turn on my laptop when it's totally turned off.&nbsp; I do NOT want it to ask me for my password every time I hibernate it or especially when it goes to sleep!&nbsp; I walk away to
 do something else for 10 minutes and I come back only to get the lock screen asking for my password.&nbsp; It happens around 10 times a day and it's really a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed both examples above, but did not get what both answers said I'd get.&nbsp; I got no choice under Power Options for the lock screen.&nbsp; All I have is stuff like when pc goes to sleep.&nbsp; I also tried the following suggestion:</p>
<p>
"Press <strong>Windows Key</strong>, type <strong>settings
</strong>and select <strong>Setting </strong>from the list
</p><p>* Navigate to <strong>Account /&gt;Sign-In options/&gt;Lock Screen /&gt;Screen time out</strong></p>
<p>* Change the value as required under <strong>Screen</strong> as per requirement."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any Sign-in options after clicking Account.&nbsp; All the Account page has is ways to change my password, purchases, stuff about Rewards, apps I might like, etc.&nbsp; There's nothing about WHEN the lock screen shows or password is required, only editing
 the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked and looked, and I can't find anything about the lock screen except how to change the background picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!&nbsp; All ideas and suggestions are appreciated!!</p>

<h2>            rdyboost.sys error after restoring</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've created a backup of my whole hard disk and restored it to a new one. I've got now both hard drives plugged in, and when I try to boot my computer using my new secondary hard drive I get this error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Boot critical file e:\windows\system32\drivers\rdyboost.sys is corrupt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Windows 8. Neither automatic repair or safe mode allows me to boot it. And I'm sure the backup / restore were successful. I can, however, still boot my computer using my old primary hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm sure I'm missing something pretty obvious here but I don't know what it is yet. Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Thanks Basith M,
<div><br />
<div>I managed to resolve the problem. What happened was that I did the backup of my old whole hard drive while Win8 was running on it, so some Windows files were being used during the process, and obviously they didn't get backed up right. One of those files
 was rdyboost.sys, together with the whole containing folder. I knew I was missing something obvious!</div>
<div><br />
<div>In order to fix it, I just made again another backup by running the software I used for it from a bootable flash drive, so Windows was not running at the same time. Then I restored the backup to my new hard drive using again the bootable usb.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I now have, however, another related question. As I only have 1 Win8 licence (more specifically, I have a Win7 + Win8 upgrade licence), would I have any problems of running Win8 through my new hard drive as it obviously has a different signature? If so,
 is there any way to associate each other?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro and Office 2016 Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kykaren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro and Office 2016 Updates</h2>
                    <p>I need a better understanding of how Windows 10 Pro and Office 2016 updates interact. I have a new Windows 10 Pro machine (version 1703, O/S Build 15063.413).<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has Office 2016 on it.<span>&nbsp; </span>I also have a Window 7 machine, with Office 2007 on it.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I am familiar with how Windows Update automatically updates the Windows 7 O/S in addition to updating Office 2007 at the same time. However, I am not completely familiar with how Windows Update updates Office 2016 on a Windows 10 Pro machine.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have a few questions in conjunction with some of the settings that are in effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; At Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security (aka Windows Update) &gt; Advanced Options (under Update settings), I have the box checked for “Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows”.
<span>&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Is a check in this box supposed to give me the security updates to Office 2016??
<span>&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Is a check in this box supposed to give me the security updates to Office 2016??
</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span>I ask because:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">a.&nbsp; When I check the installed updates at Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Installed Updates, I do not see any Office 2016 updates listed there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I only see the current updates for Windows 10, Version 1703 O/S (all with the date of June 13, 2017).</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">b.&nbsp; At Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Installed Updates, I do not see any of the Office 2016 updates that are listed at
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023935/june-13-2017-update-for-microsoft-office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023935/june-13-2017-update-for-microsoft-office</a> , where 18 updates are displayed, 8 of them with a June 13, 2017 date and 10 of them listed with a June 6, 2017 date.<span>&nbsp;
</span><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Should I be seeing most of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
these</span> Office 2106 updates listed in my Installed Updates, since I have the box in 1) above checked?
</span></em><span>&nbsp;</span>[I use Outlook, Powerpoint, Word, &amp; Excel; I do not use Skype or Visio].</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I can open Word 2016 or Excel 2016, create a file, click on the File tab, click on Account on the left, click on About Word, and see the current version.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Before step 3 below, I saw that I had 16.0.8067.2115 (*released May 18, 2017).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I can also click on Update Options &gt; Update Now. After I clicked on Update Now, I checked About Word again, and saw that the version changed to 16.0.8201.2102 (*released June 13, 2017).<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp; Does this June 13 version incorporate the most recent Office 2016 security updates (i.e., the ones listed at the link in 1b)?</span></em>
<span>&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Or is it just a new build that has added features but not any security updates?</span></em>
<span>&nbsp;</span><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Or is it just a new build that has added features but not any security updates?</span></em>
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp; If it does not include the most recent Office 2016 security updates (or as a matter of fact, any security updates dating back to when I first installed Office 2016), how do I manage to get the Office
 2016 on my machine updated with all of the necessary Office 2016 security updates (since I do not see any Office 2016 security updates at Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Installed Updates)?</span></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I am fairly certain that I am a non-subscriber of Office 365<em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">.<span>&nbsp;
</span>How can I tell for sure?</span></em></p>

<p>...I can conclude that security updates...will not be listed in the Windows 10
<strong>Update History</strong> or <strong>Installed Updates.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not quite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story, short version: Both Win10 and Office 2016 Click-to-Run update automatically, silently, and in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Longer version: In Win10, there are only cumulative updates, most of which include "rollups" of security updates. See

<p>
</p><p>If all were well with the computer, KB4022725 should be listed in <strong>Installed Updates</strong> (with an
<strong>Installed On</strong> date of 09 June 2017) <em>as well as your&nbsp;<strong>Update History</strong></em> - and KB4022730 should be listed
<em>only in <strong>Update History</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're running Office (i.e., Word; Excel; etc.]&nbsp;2016 Click-to-Run Version 1705, Build 8201.2102, all is well.</p>

 When I attempt to do so through the control panel, I get the error message: Error loading xwizards&nbsp;&nbsp; xwizards is not a valid win32 application.&nbsp; I have downloaded two different registry cleaners which advertise that they will fix .dll problems and neither

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased a laptop with Win10 Japanese OS. Is there any way of changing interface language in to English? and If it is possible, would it be effective to other software as well?</p>

<p><span>Hi kcassell,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any other third-party backup utility installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message/code, by chance?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure that “Windows Backup” service is started and the “startup” type is set to “Manual”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Start”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 “services.msc” in the Start search box and hit “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 “Windows Backup” service.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 the “Windows Backup” service and click “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the “Startup type” list, select “Manual”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Start” to start the service.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Apply” and click “OK”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try backing up in a clean boot state.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Before proceeding,&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>uninstall</span></a>
 any third-party backup software from your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Start your computer in a clean boot state and check if any of the existing third-party software is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>How
 to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></a><span> for instructions on clean boot.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure
 to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in <strong>Step 7</strong> in the above KB article.</span></p>

<h3> justitia_paxub  say:</h3>
<h2>            Having problems with IP address afte May 2017 Win 10 update...</h2>
                    <p>Even before Win 10 May 2017 update, I abruptly had IP address problems (though it took a while to diagnose that.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 devices: a Lenovo X1, a Lenovo Yoga Tablet 2 10 and a Yoga Tablet 2 8. &nbsp;I have a Verizon&nbsp;modem with wifi&nbsp;disabled and use ASUS AC1750 Wireless Dual Band (5GHz + 2.4GHz) Gigabit Wi-Fi Router [RT-AC66U] 802.11ac</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)">
</p>
<p>I have Verizon DSL (no Fios and Comcast&nbsp;has lots of problems) which I have used for over a dozen years, either directly from Verizon, or earlier from a 3rd party service provider who rented Verizon DSL and sold to customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is a (very long) history that I believe is relevant but you can skip to below it for the current problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let me say in advance to anyone who does read through all of this, THANK YOU! so much for doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*******************************************************************************************</p>
<p><strong>History (</strong><em>This is&nbsp;</em><em><span>very long and detailed</span></em><em>&nbsp;because the experience was rather unusual - and too concerned I might leave out some important detail</em><strong>)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Various problems with DSL service over the last dozen years or so, Verizon techs not always able to solve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most recently, a totally new problem emerged. About 6 weeks ago, my internet service abruptly went out completely for the first time. Tech people couldn't resolve it. Went on for days. Used cell phone data which cost tons of $</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperate for internet&nbsp;as I work at home a lot, I went down with my Lenovo laptop to the lobby of the building I live in (I am 30 + stories&nbsp;up) where WiFi hotspots are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My building offers free WiFi with a passcode. Could not get on its internet even though the 5 others around me, each with their own code were getting on fine. Adjacent to my building was a public environment which provided its own free WiFi hotspot. I knew
 the username and password, and was able to log onto that and get connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The following is a bit unbelievable&nbsp;but independently&nbsp;verified - which no tech - even some great ones -- could explain:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what I needed (nothing confidential) and, without turning off my laptop, went the 30 + stories back to my apartment. &nbsp;When I opened my laptop, I discovered -surprisingly, that I was connected to my own internet wifi, without doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presumed Verizon fixed my DSL and went to turn on my two tablets to see if they could connect too -- but they couldn't. So I took them down to the lobby of my building and did *exactly* the same with them, one at a time. Got code from my building to get
 on its WiFI, neither one could connect to building's WiFi....And then I connected each of them to the public place WiFI and they&nbsp;got on without any problems. Took them both back up th&nbsp;30 floors to my apartment and - lo and behold -- both were now connected
 to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it stayed that way for a few days -- and then the internet suddenly went out again. So I took my laptop back down to the lobby - and just tried to connect directly to Public place internet, skipping the step of failing to connect to my building's internet
 first, and I was able to connect to the Public place wifi internet. &nbsp;Took my laptop back up to my place and -bam - I was now connected to my own internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I took my two tablets down to do the same - and when I was explaining the mystery of what was happening to the concierge - a delivery person who also was a techy said that what was happening was when I was connecting to the public place WiFi, it was straightening
 out my IP addresses. And he went on my tablet and checked something through the command prompt (I didn't see what it was) and he said that now, after looking, that didn't seem to be the issue. So he had no explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at least I was on my internet. And every time it went out -- which was every couple of days or so, I followed the same procedure with all 3 devices of going down to the lobby, connecting to public place WiFi and coming back up to my place, now connected
 to my own internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I needed to send something to my (Canon) printer (in another room) wirelessly - my laptop said it wasn't able to connect to the printer. I kept trying to reset the wireless connection and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Canon has excellent tech support -- so I called and I must have gotten to one of their best tech people.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I explained to the Canon tech person the above story (with the caveat that it will seem unbelievable.) First he had me reconnect to my wireless internet again -- and, of course, it still didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he then did was check the IPv4 address on the wireless connection on my printer, which was XXX.XXX.2.XX. It was the one I always had up until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He then had me check the current IP address on my laptop and it was: XXX.XXX.1.X. &nbsp;This I knew was new. &nbsp;He pointed out that the problem was that the printer was trying to connect to the old IP address (the ".2") and not the new one (the "1"). &nbsp;Thinking
 about how to resolve this -- he instructed me to do the following, hoping it would work: he had my printer "forget" the network it knew and then had me connect again to my WiFi - and it worked. Now both the printer and the WiFI had the same IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing how this worked, I decided the next time my internet connection went out - I would try the "forget the Network" approach instead of rushing down to the Lobby again. It worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>End of History</strong></p>
<p><strong>************************************************************************</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the latest (May 2017) Windows 10 update occurred on my laptop. And as soon as my laptop turned on, it no longer connected. I went to do the "forget Network" and that didn't work now. I checked the IP address on my laptop - it had been returned to the&nbsp;&nbsp;XXX.XXX.2.XX
 but "forgetting the network" didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now understanding a bit more about IP addresses and remembering what the delivery/tech person down in the lobby said 10 days earlier, I decided to google what info I could about my problem and found the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in the search bar "cmd", right click it, select run as administrator and enter each of the following after the cmd prompt and hit enter after each one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>netsh winsock reset catalog &nbsp;</span><em>(Reset WINSOCK entries to installation defaults)</em><br />
<span>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log&nbsp;</span><em>(Reset IPv4 TCP/IP stack to installation defaults)</em></p>
<span>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log&nbsp;</span><em>(Reset IPv4 TCP/IP stack to installation defaults)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And that worked! &nbsp; Except that my internet connection still goes out after a while. I do the same cmd prompt instructions and that fixes it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the connection still keeps going out every few days. Now, whenever I check, my laptop wifi connection has been reverted to the XXX.XXX.2.XX. &nbsp;I do the same command prompt instructions above and that fixes it -- but I still have to do this every few days.
 I did not have to do this before the Win 10 May 2017 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the above technique at my workplace as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my workplace for the first time since all of this started (including after the Win 10 update) and I was no longer able to connect to my workplace internet with my laptop. &nbsp;"Forget the network" didn't work either. So I used the above cmd prompt
 instructions and that fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know -- no one else at work has had this problem and there is a mix of Apple and Win 10 laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an explanation? Why does my home wifi keep reverting back to the old &nbsp;XXX.XXX.2.XX since Win10 May 2017 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 theories of possible causes with no explanation for any of them --- </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;My DSL service now keeps messing up my IP addresses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My ASUS router keeps messing up my IP addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Win 10 May 2017 keeps messing up my IP addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a 4th possible explanation: I lost my android smart Phone (Samsung Note 4) a few days before this. Though it is possible it was found and stolen - but for various reasons, it is suspected it's lost and just unfound. &nbsp;But if stolen -- since my
 cell phone connected to my home internet all the time -- is it possible thieves have found it and hacked it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And why none of Verizon, Samsung and Google would not ping and locate it when they could have &amp; it was still possible --is a nightmare story unto its own).</p>

<p>Hi I'm a sucker and I read the whole post. The thing that comes to my mind is your router is dropping you. They do wear out just like any electrical devise. My PC was dropping me from the internet and a new NETGEAR WiFi Cable Modem Router fixed my problem.
 You could also be getting some kind of electrical interference that causes your problem. Your provider is the one that assigns your IP Address.

<p>Thank you, Gary!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I would like a little more diagnosis before I rush out to buy another $200 router, (which is what the ASUS cost - considered the very best router available at that time. July 2013.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed in again here because my not being able to get on the internet just happened again. I obviously was on the internet all morning for the hour + it took for me to write that post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got on whatever time this is when this posts from the time of the&nbsp;last post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had just turned on my laptop, got the usual error of not being able to connect to the internet. I did the "forget the network" first and tried&nbsp;to reconnect. It still wouldn't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I checked the properties of my wireless connection as listed on my laptop and the same name (say "Ann") now had reverted back to the old IP&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">XXX.XXX.<strong>2.</strong>X</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did the cmd prompt entries as described above:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in the search bar "cmd", right click it, select run as administrator and enter each of the following after the cmd prompt and hit enter after each one:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>netsh winsock reset catalog &nbsp;</span><em>(Reset WINSOCK entries to installation defaults)</em><br />
<span>netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log&nbsp;</span><em>(Reset IPv4 TCP/IP stack to installation defaults)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>and restarted my laptop as per instructions I found on internet, and as soon as it started, it automatically connected to my WiFI "Ann" - without my doing anything. ("Ann" is set to connect automatically.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I checked "Ann"'s IP address now, it had changed as a result of this process to</p>
<p>
</p><p>XXX.XXX.<strong>1</strong>.X</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I know when I check my two tablets now and turn them on -- the IP address for "Ann" will have reverted to XXX.XXX.<strong>2.</strong>X And they will also not be able to connect to the internet until I do the above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am still looking for more explanation. If it is the router -- how is it doing this so intermittently but consistently so?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time I get an error message from my router -- it opens a web&nbsp;page and says -- "not able to connect to the internet" with either no explanation in the&nbsp;explanation box -- or a statement that there is no Ethernet connected, which is not
 true. It is connected to the modem via ethernet cord all the time, never disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something is happening to cause my WiFi IP address to revert to the old one, just out of the blue. No cause or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this problem that's this bad started with the Win 10 update May 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said this happens once every 2-3 days and I&nbsp;am on the internet typically 10 hours a day, on and off, on one or another of my devices. So it seems purely random.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it were my router, it wouldn't explain why I had this same problem at work after the Win 10 May 2017 update with my work's WiFi connection. No one else did as far as I know. And my router wasn't involved. And before I left my house, I was connected to
 my home WiFi.</p>

<p>Hi! IDK. If you have 3 devises that all act the same way, there seems to be a big problem. If just one devise had these problems, then we might be able to find the problem. My IP on my router does not change.</p>

<p>Yes, it happens on all 3 devices - but all 3 Win 10 were updated at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the wireless connection on my laptop,&nbsp;I can click on properties for&nbsp;"Ann_5ghz" :</p>

the IPv4 address has changed where the last 1 is changed to a 2</span>. (I have never looked at the IPv6 address but I presume the same has happened there but don't know.)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I think I understand what you are saying. What do you think there is in the W10 update that chances the 1 to a 2 ?. I believe you; and I think you have found the answer, but what do you think is changing IPv4 address?? Can you change
 it without going through this? I don't know of any way! </p>

<p>The reason I am fairly certain that&nbsp;it was the Windows10 May 2017 update that triggered the problem is that prior to the update, though my internet would still go out, all I had to&nbsp;do was have my laptop "forget" the "Ann" wireless network. Then my internet
 service would&nbsp;come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only after the update and immediately so, as soon as the restart had concluded,&nbsp;did I have to do the procedure in your previous text to get my internet back. And now every time my internet goes out I have to do that procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there is another contributing cause -- I don't think that the Win&nbsp;10 May 2017 update caused it alone - but I do not understand yet enough about IP addresses and assignments, etc. to figure it out. &nbsp;All I know is that before Win 10 May 2017 update,
 my internet would go out just as frequently but could be resolved by "forgetting" my "Ann" wifi connection, which allowed the now available&nbsp;"Ann" WiFi connection to have the correct IP address and let my laptop connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something was already causing the problem, converting the "recognized" IP addresses into ".2" from ".1" but all I had to do was "forget" them. Now I have to do much more troublesome work. And 2-3 times a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the real question is -- what is (was) causing the IP address to change from a ".1" to ".2" to begin with? Then Win 10 May 2017 update aggravated it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least that's what I think at this point.</p>

<p>I've been extremely busy which is why I haven't been back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is embarrassing to say what the problem was with the connection on the final round.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech person who came to visit to check things out unplugged and then re-plugged in the Ethernet cord between the modem and the router into the wrong slot of the router. He plugged it into one of the slot for a computer to have wired DSL connection instead
 of the slot intended for the Ethernet cord that was connected to the modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all the other problems were real and solved and it was after that , the tech person came to see why my internet service would sporadically go out for a few minutes and then return. No solution for that found. But plugging the Ethernet cord into the wrong
 slot explains why everything as working fine for a while and then suddenly it seemed the same problem emerged again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I plugged it back into the correct slot -- there have been no problems since -- except, of course, the internet service itself conking&nbsp; out randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try to go with Comcast cable when I have the time.&nbsp; But the tech people wrt Comcast here are notoriously incompetent.</p>

</p><p>I know my receiver is working as all my brothers (three of us) have&nbsp;our own&nbsp;receivers and all of us are having the same issue with our respective xbox360 dongles even on my brother's Win10 OS. It is as if it has suddenly become unsupported at the software

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Loose connection of the USB dongle to your computer is one of the possible reasons why this is happening. Usually, using other USB ports may help resolve your concern. We also recommend unplugging the USB then re-plug it securely on your computer and avoid
 using USB extender cables.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists after following our recommendation, we suggest using the USB troubleshooter and see if it helps. Click on this
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/EasyFix_WinUSB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>to run the troubleshooter. Follow the prompts to complete the process.
<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.

<p>Thank you for responding. Changing to a different USB port did not solve the issue. I know that the dongle is not broken as each of us has our own usb&nbsp;wireless receiver and our computers are misidentifying all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the trouble shooter from your link, it did not help fix the issue.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Micro SD Card Reader Speed and BUS Class</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>just wanted to know if the slot supports the UHS-II cards ? couldn't find an official answer on this one .</p>
<p>if not , could I still use a UHS-I type which is a U3 speed class ? I mean can I get the benefit of a higher read/write speed on this type compared to a U1 class ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Surface Pro 4 can handle the largest SD card in terms of memory size. The MicroSD card should be freshly formatted. You can use 128GB (UHS-1), or MicroSD card 64GB (UHS-3). To know more about this, we suggest that you check our support article that can be
 found on this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>Something tells me you don't understand the question. The difference between UHS-1 and UHS-2 or -3 is not the same thing at all as the difference between U1 &amp; U3. A UHS-1 card reader only has one row of 8 connector pins and has a maximum transfer rate of
 104 mb/s. A UHS-2 or -3 card reader has 2 rows of 8 pins per row and has a maximum transfer rate of 312 mb/s and 624 mb/s respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know this for sure but I believe the Surface Pro 4 Micro SD card reader only has one row of pins which would imply that it is only capable of 104 mb/s maximum transfer speed. It will use the UHS-2 or -3 cards but you will not gain anything by spending
 the extra money for these cards because the bus for the card reader will be the limiting factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say I don't know this for sure because I have asked Microsoft support team directly on the phone and I also corresponded with the support team directly online. On both occasions I actually got one tech. that said it did have a bus that utilized the UHS-3
 interface and in the same conversation another tech. said that it did not have this capability. I also ask the same question at the local Microsoft store where I bought my Surface Pro 4 and no one there even knew the difference between the two interfaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is no question that the Surface Pro 4 will use the UHS-2 and -3 card but rather is the card reader designed to take advantage of these cards? Or to cut to the chase does the card reader have 1 row of pins or 2? If you actually know the answer to
 this question please share that information, but please be sure you are correct because the difference in price for these cards is substantial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>yes , the whole point of my question , as you said , is to know if spending so much more money on a UHS-II card will do me any good in terms of read/write speed or not .</p>
<p>as I mentioned before , if the slot is UHS-I , I also want to know if getting a UHS-I U3 card will let me enjoy a better speed compared to a UHS-I U1 card or not ?</p>

            I am not sure about this either but I believe so long as it has a UHS-1 compliant card reader it will take advantage of whatever speed the card is capable of, up to 104 mb/s. In other words whatever speed the card is rated at will be the determining or
 limiting factor.&nbsp;

<h2>            Does the drive letter affect what you can do with it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant changed my drive letter to (H:). I've posted a question stating what I can do to change it back to normal. However, nobody answered my last question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you still store stuff on an (H:) drive? </p>
<p>Does what letter the drive is assigned affect what you can do with it? Like not being able to store stuff. Or deleting items.</p>
<p>Will Windows 10 Installation files still work on a different drive letter, like (D:)?</p>

<p>As I am changing the drive, it gives me a message saying that some programs might not work if I change the drive letter. Is it okay to change?</p>

            It is, but if you installed a program to a different drive and that program is badly built, it may need reinstalled again after you change the letter.&nbsp; That's probably rare though.
