            Hi Kay,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the system settings is one of the possible reasons why the keyboard is not working on your device. We recommend that you contact the manufacturer of your device for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Should you have further queries, feel free to post it.

 all in the same Workgroup. No Homegroup. I want to be able to share individual folders on the network, by setting them to&nbsp;</span><em>shared&nbsp;</em><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">through
 File Explorer. In Windows 7 and Vista, I just go to Network and Sharing Center, enable file and printer sharing, disable password protected sharing, and it all works.&nbsp;</span><strong>In
 Windows 10 and Windows 8, the same still works, but only if both machines use local accounts</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">.
 As soon as one of the machines - either the one accessing the files or the one sharing them - uses a Microsoft account, it is no longer possible to access any files or folders on the other machines. Specifically, if the machine with the Microsoft account tries
 to access the machine with the local account, it will prompt for a username and password, and access will fail unless username and password of an actual user on the target machine are provided.&nbsp;</span><strong>Changing
 the Microsoft account to a local account immediately fixes the problem</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">,
 with no other configuration changes.</span></p>

 the problem seems to be same in windows 8 and 10.</span></p>

<h3> dolias14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen while Formatting WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>So there is a problem with my computer and I wanted to format/clean up windows 10. I followed the instructions on doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after clicking to delete everything and restore windows 10 again it says "rebooting your computer, it will take a while". After that the computer reboots and when its supposed to be deleting the files and stuff its just stuck on a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't find any solutions on the internet so I thought you guys might help thanks!<br />
</p>
<p>( If you're confused by formatting I mean this option but instead of keeping files I chose to remove all files )</p>

            Hi  Dolias14, if that Windows Reset does not complete, your Recovery Image is corrupt, your best option is to clean install Windows, since you were not keeping files anyway . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Hi Dolias.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd create the bootable Windows 10 installation media to do the vastly superior Clean Install which  compiles the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given in this tutorial, and has zero reported problems from those who do so:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><blockquote>Hi Dolias14, if that Windows Reset does not complete, your Recovery Image is corrupt, your best option is to clean install Windows, since you were not keeping files anyway . . .
<br />
<br />
You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! <br />
<br />
Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will
 have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers <br />
<br />
Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br />
to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />
Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10
<br />
<br />
If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: <br />
Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes:
<br />
1. Disable Secure Boot <br />
2. Enable Legacy Boot <br />
3. If Available enable CSM <br />
4. If Required enable USB Boot <br />
5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order <br />
6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Sorry for being a newbie but how can I clean install windows 10? Never done it before since I bought my windows 10 and got them installed by a technician. ( i still have the installation CD though )</p>

            Dolias, Reset will often fail if the install is corrupted or a Factory or repeatedly upgraded install that chokes the reset.  The solution at that point is to do the Clean Install which is a much better install that will last much longer and avoid almost all problems anyway.  
<br />
<br />So read over the steps in my tutorial here which has been used by hundreds of thousands without any problems who have never come back to report any further problems IF they stick with the steps I give and tools and methods I suggest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any questions and I'll be here to help as needed.
<br />
<br />Once you have the media created you can also try first doing the Reset from it which may work better.  
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.

<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose   Repair Your Computer, then from Troubleshoot options choose Reset.  
<br />
<br />If it fails again then proceed with the Clean Install by choosing Install now, Custom install, at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.

            You can also take it to a shop and pay at least $150 and not get an install one half as good as the Clean Install I gave you which is priceless and more valuable than any amount of money.

            It is a very common problem that the computer screen gets blue or sometimes black and it is quite easy to get rid of this problem. First Restart your Computer, and delete the temporary files of your system and then reset your&nbsp;system.&nbsp; If you can't still&nbsp;get
 out from this problem, consult with <a href="https://mailhelp.net/hotmail-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi Samuel
<br />
<br />It depends on the method you used . . .
<br />
<br />Did you just upgrade to the Pro version or did your perform a full clean install of Windows 10 Pro?
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />
<br />On the left, click 'This PC'
<br />
<br />On the right, double click your hard drive
<br />
<br />Do you see a Windows.Old folder, if so open that and navigate down into the users folder
<br />
<br />Do you see your files there?
<br />
<br />If so, immediately copy those files out into your user account folders (Documents, Pictures . . etc) because Windows will automatically delete that WIndows.Old folder in a few days, and all your data will be lost . .
        </p>

            Hi Samuel
<br />
<br />Don't copy and paste, that will require a lot space, just move the files . . .
<br />
<br />Just click and drag all your documents and folders from inside the folders in the Windows.Old folder into their equivalent folder in the left hand pane in File Explorer
<br />
<br />(For Example click and drag all your files form the contained Documents folder, into the actual Documents folder in the left pane)
<br />
<br />This will just move that data, and not require any extra space . . .

    <title>Windows 10 Installation causes Windows 7 Authentication error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjcoulson_1951  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Installation causes Windows 7 Authentication error</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Windows 7 since purchasing this computer and receiving regular updates. Now Window 10 starts installing itself on my computer and I panic (not wanting the problems I hear other people are having) and "decline" the installation at the
 end. Windows 10 then uninstalls itself and reinstalls Windows 7. I am now getting constant messages saying my version of Windows 7 is not authentic and I will no longer receive updates.</p>
<p>How can my original version not be authentic if I've received regular updates for years and if Windows 10 was installing itself on my computer?</p>
<p>So, I figured I better install Windows 10, or I'll have no updates to protect my computer, only now it will not install because it says I do not have an authentic version of Windows 7 and I must purchase an authentication code.</p>
<p>What Gives? How do I solve this problem? I shouldn't have to purchase an authentification code!</p>
<p>Thanks for any help anyone can provide.</p>

<h2>            My files have disappeared&#33;</h2>
                    Yesterday, I was at my job and turned on my W7 notebook to start work. I opened the company file in which I store all the projects and opened the one I was going to work on in Photoshop. I noticed the system wans't working properly (I coulnd't get to use
 the tools), so I decided to RESTART my computer. After I had done that, I opened the company file once again, but there was only ONE project file!! All the others were simply GONE!! I have tried everything to get the &nbsp;files back. A friend of mine who is a
 computer geek even ran a program to recuparate all deleted files from my computer, but they weren't there. Does anyone know what is going on and what I can do to get my files back?? Thanks!!

<p><span>In my personal experiences, as to the lost computer drive files, there are often two solutions to go on:
</span></p>
<p><span>1). Perform data recovery </span></p>
<p><span>Before all lost data is utterly overwritten or corrupted, performing a perfect data recovery on this drive can be a good chance to rescue files. There are many related data recovery programs that can help you, like Recuva,
</span><em>&lt;advertisement removed&gt;</em><span> etc. </span></p>
<p><span>2). Professional services</span></p>
<p><span>If this problem cannot be fixed by yourself, some professional persons could be your next way to go on.</span></p>
<p><span>Never save needed data on only one drive again. </span></p>

            <p>In Windows 7, it shows up as WFS.exe and it is the Microsoft Windows Fax and Scan Service.
<br />
<br />
In Windows XP, Fax console is an optional installable component. It should also be the wfs.exe.

<h2>            No wireless networks are available after upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 on Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Performed the upgrade from 8.1 to 10. Wireless worked initially. Then after a shutdown and restart the wireless quit working. Tried the different suggestions found in the community for removing the VPN software including reverting back to 8.1, deleting
 the files and reloading Windows 10. Same result each time. Wireless works until a shutdown/power up cycle has been completed. Once during my searches for a solution thru the forums and community came across a link to a driver update for the network adapter
 but haven't been able to locate again. No VPN programs loaded at this time. Tried the troubleshooter from here as well:&nbsp; https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3084164 and the manual method. No joy.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It's possible that the issue was caused by a corrupted program file in Windows Live Mail client installed in your desktop. Kindly repair Windows Live Mail by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to Control Panel.<br />
2. Under Programs, click <b>Uninstall a Program.<br />
</b>3. Locate Windows Live Essential 2011 then click <b>Uninstall/Change.<br />
</b>4. When a window appears, select <b>Repair all Windows Live programs.<br />
</b>5. Restart your computer after the repair.<br />
<br />
In addition, I suggest that you configure your&nbsp;account&nbsp;in Windows Live Mail for us to isolate the issue.<br />

            I just posted a similar question to this one (see my post from a few minutes ago!)&nbsp;-- I am having the same "Not Responding" issue. I don't mind trying what you suggest, but will this hurt all of my emails and folders already installed? I am currently using
 WLM 2012. This has been happening for a month or two now. But I absolutely cannot lose all my emails and work through a reinstallation.

</p><p>I installed the windows live essentials 2 days ago and then set up my emails, which were working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 day later I get the message "Windows live mail has stopped working" with no error code and no help from windows with any solution!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have repaired several times to no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted and re-installed WLM and still the same message.so now I am unable to send or receive any emails..........&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in the action center where no error message or code is shown.</p>
<p>

            <p>I get the "Not Responding" thing but no error code. It just hangs there for minutes on end, with a faded screen and the spinning wheel icon. Eventually it resolves itself, but this happens about every other time I click on ANYTHING to do anything -- from
 just seeing an email in the preview pane to trying to delete an email. It's like the program can't work properly for more than two or three minutes without stalling and pausing for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know if repairing WLM means I will lose my emails and folders, etc. Frankly, I hesitate to try to "fix" this if the solution could end up worse than the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi, you can save all emails to your hard drive or an external drive if available. &nbsp;There is a facility with in WLM to export all contacts and all messages, provided you can get into WLM in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to open live mail and export all contacts and emails, then you can safely delete/remove and then re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not work at all then you have a big problem the same as me ..............</p>

<p>Hi glogirl99,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to contact Toshiba to check if there are any shortcut keys to unlock the keys.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.toshiba.com/tai/support/support_cons.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.toshiba.com/tai/support/support_cons.jsp</a></p>
<p>You may try booting the computer to safe mode and check if it is working.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions to boot the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Turn the computer on or Restart the computer <br />
2.&nbsp;Start tapping the F8 key. The Windows Advanced Boot Options Menu appears.<br />
If you begin tapping the F8 key too soon, some computers display a "keyboard error" message. To resolve this, restart the computer and try again.
<br />
3.&nbsp;Ensure that the Safe mode option is selected.<br />
4.&nbsp;Press Enter. The computer then begins to start in Safe mode.</p>
<p>Restart the computer in Normal mode after checking the issue.<br />
Let us know if you are able to use Keyboard in Safe mode without any issues.</p>

</p><blockquote>after the windows 10 update my surface pro 3 keyboard isnt working anymore ive tried everything front resetting it , to cleaning it, and doing that diagnostic thing. Still doesnt work! fix this!
</blockquote>
<p>I have exactly the same problem. So far I have tried all recommended solutions by Microsoft, but my keyboard is still dead and nonresponsive. I downloaded the surface diagnostic toolkit and ran it without results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried to reinstall the keyboard driver from Microsoft Surface 3 pro drivers download page and the problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter into Device Manager and expand the keyboards category, I found that the driver is named "HID keyboard device" and is duplicated. I do not understand why. One of the recommended procedures that I found at MS community, is that once you expanded
 the keyboard category in the Device Manager, you should right-click "surface type cover filter device" and then select "uninstall" &gt; "OK". After restart the surface, it will automatically download and install the surface cover driver, the next time you connect
 the Internet. However, this option <span>"surface type cover filter device"</span> is not available in my Device Manager window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking that the only solution is to replace the keyboard for a new one, but also I believe that a keyboard with only a year of moderate use, can not fail suddenly and get dead. There is a method to test the keyboard in order to know if it is broken
 or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If somebody have a solution to this problem, please help me. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I think you need to drill down deeper on that tack. &nbsp; E.g. getting into Driver File Details I find for Surface Touch Cover Filter Device 3 drivers</p>
<p>kbdclass.sys&nbsp; kbdhid.sys&nbsp; and&nbsp; SurfaceTouchCover.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first two are referenced for&nbsp; HID Keyboard Device&nbsp; (which is as far as you got).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do you have SurfaceTouchCover.sys&nbsp; anywhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A way to answer that question would be to use this PowerShell script</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">PS&gt;cd \<br />
PS&gt;LS -Re -Fi SurfaceTouchCover* -Fo -EA:SilentlyContinue | sort LastWriteTime | ft LastWriteTime, Length, FullName -AutoSize -Wrap</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually started that first at cd \Windows but then after backing up to the root discovered that I had apparently downloaded something that contained the driver. &nbsp; So, to have a look at that I would filter by directory only from that list and by the actual
 driver filename. &nbsp; Although it is possible to do that with another execution of the above pipeline with an appropriate extra stage each time.&nbsp; I would redo it either with a pipe to clip or just capture the output of the above and filter it manually. &nbsp; I did
 the latter and then did</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">PS&gt;$FL = Get-Clipboard<br />
PS&gt;$FL | sls "\.sys"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that a . is a pattern character and needs to be escaped if you want to match only that character.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turns out I had either downloaded or reinstalled something earlier this year that looks identical to something created in 2013.&nbsp; If instead a reinstall was being done it would have been originally done in 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2013-08-08 16:23:43&nbsp; 37992 C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\surfacetouchcover.inf_amd64_876425d265d2887b\SurfaceTouchCover.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what all that implies.&nbsp; E.g. I don't know if I actually installed what I had downloaded or where I got it.&nbsp; Here's what it got called when unzipped:&nbsp; SurfacePro2_Win10_160501_2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope these hints and tips help.</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I discovered, via an internet search, that I could do the following:</p>
<p>Hold the <strong>V</strong><strong>olume Up button and the Power Button at the same time</strong> for about 30 seconds and until you see the Surface logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This fix described here:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Also change a setting:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Settings --&gt; System --&gt; Power &amp; Sleep&nbsp; --&gt; Additional Power Settings --&gt; Choose What the Power Button Does&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then remove the check (uncheck) the checkbox for the Turn On Fast Start-up option</p>
<p>This will cause the Bios to be reloaded each time the laptop is turned-on.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I turn off or edit the Keyboard General Shortcut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thalwil tiger  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off or edit the Keyboard General Shortcut &#34;CRTL&#43;Shift&#34; which switches between multiple keyboard inputs&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using the Swiss version of Windows 7 in English on a German (QWERTZ) keyboard. &nbsp;The General Shortcut to toggle between QWERTY and QWERTZ is CTRL+Shift. When using Excel, I use this combination all the time with arrows in order to navigate large spreadsheets.
 &nbsp;If I start a movement, only pressing CTRL+Shift but then don't press the arrow, I wind up switching keyboard layouts. &nbsp;Is there a way to change the General Shortcut or to otherwise delete or disable this feature?

<h2>            Error code 800FOA13 when Installing Windows 7 SPI Service Pack</h2>
                    I recently had a computer crash and had to do a full Advance System Restore. &nbsp;My browser is outdated and I haven't been able to update it to Explorer 11. &nbsp;It was indicated that I needed the Windows 7 SPI Service Pack to update my browser. &nbsp;All my other
 important windows updates went through but I keep getting the error message 800FOA13 when trying to install the Service Pack. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 64-bits. &nbsp;I have disabled all anti virus programs and run sfc /scannow and chkdsk. &nbsp;I think my drivers are updated
 and my registry is clean. &nbsp;Nothing seems to be working. &nbsp;Any suggestions as I am having to use Google Chrome as my browser but prefer Internet Explorer 11 if I can get it?

            No, this did not help as I do not have the original Windows 7 disc. &nbsp;I only have a Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Product Key and I tried using this but it did not work. &nbsp;I have tried doing everything else but without the disc this info is not helping
 me.
