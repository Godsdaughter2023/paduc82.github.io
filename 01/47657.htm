<h2>            Microsoft wireless mobile mouse 4000 battery life when left on all the time</h2>
                    Box it came in says battery life is 10 months.&nbsp; Lots of internet complaints that actual battery life less than one month.&nbsp; Should one get 10 months of battery life if mouse is left on all the time.

<h2>            How do i reinstall my sound drivers &#63;</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original Title: my sound&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello</p>
<p>I just uninstalled both my speaker and microphone. My speakers were working fine but when I spoke to my friends in skype or team speak in games my sound was very low. I went in to settings and maxed the volume on my microphone but it was still very low.
 So what I decided to do was to uninstall both. Now I dont know how to reinstall them or if that is even possible. The program I am using with my sound is realtek hd audio manager and maybe the problem is there? I would really appreciate answers. Is there any
 was to reinstall my speaker and microphone?</p>

    <title>Update Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yukisakurashu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Um... Okay, so this isn't too much of a "help, help" - desperate- kind of question; I guess. But mostly I'm just in need of assistance. So the past weekend was spent at Best Buy, about my new laptop(Microsoft surface book) and all. I so I don't want
 to have to make an appointment to go back for assistance, so I'm asking, and/or requesting, for assistance here instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay so, I use Cortana and all, yea? And this is something that appeared before, but I didn't do anything about it yet, because I just picked this up yesterday night. And I'm not in a rush, or a panic or anything. I asked (spoke): "Please pull up notes."
 "It looks like your account needs an update. I can take you there to get that settled," is how she responded, with choices, below, "Other Account," "Manage Account." Then I clicked "manage account," which brought me here. I saw I wasn't signed in and so I
 signed myself in. And then it brings me to my profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so technically my issue(s) and question(s) are "Which/What account am I in need of updating? What is it, that needs to be updated? How do I update it?" And "What does the update contain, do, and cause/create?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'd be very grateful if you could answer my questions and help me with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Separate Subject: <em>YouTubing</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also wondering if you know/recommend any apps and/or programs often(and that work well with) used for screen recording, video recording, video making, animating,
<em>speedpaint(ing) recording</em>, etc..., and work well for being used for YouTube, too. Sorry that this isn't very well grammar-ed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'd also be grateful and happy if you had knowledge of any. </p>
<p>Please reply when you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Yuki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Updating accounts is very essential to your computer. To answer your question on which/what account you should update, it is the account that you used to sign in to your Windows 10 device. It is called Microsoft account. It is the key to your computer and
 its security. Basically, updated account will help your email account, personal data and important computer files more secured.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help protect your email account and your personal data, everyone who has a Microsoft account should make sure that the security information associated with their account are correct and up to date. When your security information (like an alternate email
 address or phone number) are updated, we can use it to verify your identity. For example, if you forget your password or if someone else tries to take over your account, Microsoft uses your security details to help you get back into your account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To learn more about Microsoft Account, we suggest that you check the link below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account help</a></strong></p>
<p>For another reference that might be helpful to you about making your account more secured, you may check this article:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security info &amp; security codes</a></strong></p>
<p>Regarding your concern about an app that works well with video screen recording, video recording, video making, animating,
etc., we can simply recommend the free <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ph/store/p/movie-maker-free-video-editor/9nblggh4wwjr?SilentAuth=1&amp;wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Movie Maker</a></strong> , or you can search other
 apps that are more applicable in your end from the <strong>Store </strong>app. However, if you still find other third party software/apps that are more applicable, you're still free to choose those.
</p>
<p>We hope the above information are helpful to you. Let us know how else we may help you. </p>

    <title>RemoteApps window focus error with the latest April 10th update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albertomc  say:</h3>
<h2>            RemoteApps window focus error with the latest April 10th update &#40;1803&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since the last update (April 10th, 2018. Number 1803) we have an error with our RemoteApps, all of them suffer from this issue.
</p>
<p>When the RemoteApp needs to open a new window or show the contextual menu it usually draws it behind the main window, you need to click the icon in the taskbar in order to bring it to front. This is a very frustrating issue.
</p>
<p>Is there any solution?</p>
<p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>We finally got a workaround by replacing the mstsc.exe and mstscax.dll files from the ones in the 1703 Windows version following the thread linked by Mainmind. Waiting for an update.

            If you're on the same Gamertag as before and you don't have the old achievements it was because you were offline and didn't connect to Xbox Live. If you're using a new Gamertag then it is not possible to move the achievements over.

            Yup, sounds like your friend modded your gamerscore. Which is part of the reason why it's a violation of the code of conduct to allow anyone else access to your account. You would have had to contact the enforcement team after the gamerscore reset initially
 happened to see if they removed it. Since it happened years ago that would no longer be possible and gamerscore resets are permanent. In order to re-earn those achievements, you would have to start a new account.

<h2>            Minecraft Xbox One - Lost Data</h2>
                    
<p>For the last 6 or 7 months, I've been using a minecraft creative world. The save file appeared to be a fairly large one, compared to the others on my console. Today, when I tried to play it with a friend, after selecting a guest profile we were not able
 to play the game. &nbsp;When it was restarted and the same world was selected to open, it was unresponsive to the A button, and the little icon that was the last saves location turned into the minecraft dirt block icon. the only thing that I could do to the file
 was rename it; it could not be moved or copied. After a number of attempts signing in and out, and restarting the console both properly and through power interruptions, the file is still unable to be accessed.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate that with this console I can't go into the storage and look at each file individually, similar to the 360, so I'm really at a loss for what to do.</p>
<p>And it may or may not be important to note, but the time prior to this (about 14 hours ago) when I accessed the world it sync'd and worked fine.</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Something you can try, which has worked for me with previous save issues is the following:</p>
<p>Firstly, go into your settings and then into network settings.</p>
<p>Go offline</p>
<p>Then, give the console a hard boot by holding down the power button for 10seconds until the console fully switches off.</p>
<p>Wait a minute or two</p>
<p>Then fire it back up, go back online and try it again.</p>
<p>That has worked for me previously, so hopefully it'll work for you too :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>"1) It wants me to do something with an open network."</p>
<p>This might mean you need to have your NAT status to be "OPENED". - This is also known as "port forwarding".</p>
<p>After you have port forwarded /opened your network, try and re-download these bits, and see if it'll work.

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;xyoungnetsrikx! I think we should be able to help you out with this one. ^_^<br /><br />First off, I'd take a look at your NAT settings and make sure your NAT is set to Open and your ports are forwarded. For how to do that, check out this handy guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/nat-type-strict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/nat-type-strict</a>!<br /><br />Also, I would try these steps:<br />-Delete the game from your hard drive (go to the system hub on your dashboard, settings, storage). Do NOT delete your game saves (if you have any).<br />-Clear your chache (check out this handy guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache</a>).<br />-Restart your console.<br />-Install the game on your hard drive (if you have room).<br />-Boo

<h2>            OneDrive files won&#39;t sync</h2>
                    <p>NOTE: I was not able to post this question in the "OneDrive" category because it said that the forum was "locked."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I write music with Sibelius Ultimate and the files are all .sib files. I had an old HP Envy laptop in which I had all the original files, but I have gotten a newer HP Envy 17 laptop. Before I migrated my data/cleaned the other device, I put all my .sib files
 into a OneDrive folder which I would open in the new laptop, however, many of those files still have the little cloud icon, indicating that they need to be synced/downloaded, and that it won't happen until my device/OneDrive is "online." What can I do? Other
 files show a "sync" icon or a green checked mark, and I can open those, just not the ones that stil need to be fully synced. I've had this new laptop for about a month now.&nbsp;</p>

            Lets try to reset Onedrive 
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows key + R. 
<br />In the Run window, enter: %localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />After 2 or 3 minutes OneDrive should start by itself, sometimes does not open.

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an OneDrive Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below:
<br /> 
<br />Log into OneDrive on your computer and run the following commands to update OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R 
<br />
<br />In the Run window, enter: 
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />Wait 2 minutes and then execute the following command: 
<br />
<br />% localappdata% \ Microsoft \ OneDrive \ update 
<br />
<br />Click OK. 
<br />
<br />Make sure the OneDrive icon in the notification area of the taskbar disappears and then re-appears after a minute or two. 
<br />
<br />If the OneDrive icon doesn’t re-appear after a few minutes, open the Run window again and enter: 
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe 
<br />

<p>This happen all the time where it simply wont upload and sync files I think are being processed. Then&nbsp; I only get to know this when a client who I shared the files with tells me the folders are empty!&nbsp; So normally I just reboot my PC which fixes it, but
 this is all wasting so much of people time. </p>
<p>So nice to see some fixed here, but really why is this so buggy and doing it to begin with? I have to say the whole MS Office 365 experience is really poor and it hangs sheet and docs constantly.&nbsp; Its really terrible.

<h2>            Will Sims 2 be compatible with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have 'The Sims 2' and all the expansion packs currently installed on my Windows 7 computer and they seem to work fine without me downloading any patches or hacks. If I upgrade to Windows 10 will I still be able to play them? This is a really
 important question for me because if I cant play I might not upgrade. I really need some assistance with my problem and hope I can download Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Don't bother upgrading. I managed to get The Sims 2 and the expansions and stuff packs to work with Windows 8 but they no longer work on Windows 10, even with the compatibility set on Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Stick with Windows 7 if you aren't having
 any problems. It's honestly not worth the hassle.

<p>
</p><p>If you intend to play the&nbsp;Sims 2.</p>
<p>I agree with RebeccaKemp: it is not compatible with Windows 10 For those of use whom spent an incredible about of time and money on the Sims 2 and all of the expansion packs, building families and communities, Windows 10 unfortunately will not allow game
 play. I have been playing the Sims since 2007 and this is a humongous disappointment.&nbsp; I have researched quite a few forums and no one has been able to present a viable compatibility solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the Microsoft reps: I have ALL of the expansion packs. Tried the Sims 3 and 4, but am perfectly happy with 2.
</p>
<p>Is there anyway of fixing the compatibility issue with this?&nbsp; Fair warning- I have recommended my family/peers not to install Windows 10 due to software issues and the inability to add extensions (adblock).

            <p>I MIGHT have a solution to our Sims 2 problem.&nbsp; For starts, how big is your hard drive? Do you still have your Windows 7 install disk? &nbsp; I just partitioned my hard drive so I can install Windows 7 on it for a dual boot system!!&nbsp; I haven't installed Windows
 7 on it yet.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Oh, very important, you have to go into&nbsp;DISK&nbsp;management and SHRINK the volume on your C: drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is because when you installed Windows it allocated the entire C: drive to Windows 10.&nbsp; When you do that let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I don't know what virus scan you use.&nbsp; I just talked to Norton.com.&nbsp; &nbsp;According to them, &nbsp;you'll need&nbsp;to install your V scan on both operating systems.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something to consider.

            <p>Regarding anti-malware, remember that Windows 8 and 10 have built-in anti-malware, and it's a free download for 7 from Microsoft.com, so you don't need third party anti-malware. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third party anti-malware can actually CAUSE security issues in various ways since it's running low level with the kernal, may install fake certificates, etc. &nbsp;(Not that it's necessarily bad either.)</p>

            <p>I already had Norton for 5 devices, so I installed it on my partition for Windows 7. &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm not sure what that have to do with running Sims 2 anyway. &nbsp;I already have a installation disk and drivers for Windows 7 I got from Dell when I bought the computer.

<p><b><u>These are the various ways to reinstall Vista</u></b></p>
<p><span>contact the computer/laptop manufacturer and ask them to send you vista recovery disks to reinstall the operating system back the way it was when
 you bought it</span></p>
<p><span>they do that for a nominal $ cost</span></p>
<p><span>____________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>also ask them if you have a recovery partition on your hard drive to put it back to how you bought it</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>you would normally press F8, F9, F10 or F11 or Alt + F10 or 0 at boot to start the recovery process depending on the manufacturer</span></p>
<p><span>ask them for the exact key sequence</span></p>
<p><span>__________________________________________________________</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>or borrow a microsoft vista dvd;
<u>not an HP, Acer etc recovery disk</u></span></p>
<p><span>make sure you borrow the correct 32bit or 64bit&nbsp;microsoft dvd&nbsp;for your computer</span></p>

            Most computers made around late 2007 and newer have factory restore partitions. the most common way to access these are to tape f8 after the bios screen to bring up the boot menu. From there select Repair my computer. One of the options at the bottom of
 the menu is restore. From there you should be able to select factory settings :)

<h2>            Windows 10 freezing after update</h2>
                    A few days ago I decided to upgrade from Windows 7 -&gt; Windows 10. After I upgraded I tried to log on for the first time and if I type in the right password and press "Next" my computer freezes. If I hit the "I'm not (user)" button then my computer freezes
 again. This happens every time I log on no matter what. I would try to revert back to win 7 however I can't even get passed the login screen.

            <p>Oh that's not the login screen, that's still part of the setup program.&nbsp; If it can't continue with Setup at all then I'm not sure what good options are available, other than booting from an install disc/USB stick and trying again (either attempt plain install
 again, or copy files and do a clean install... which would be reliable and fast but comes with the hassle of installing things like your favorite browser or productivity software again after a fresh install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the computer have any indication at all that it is working when you proceed from that screen?&nbsp; Hard drive activity indicator for example?</p>

            <p>Hey there Koto2006.<br /><br />Does the region of your account match your physical locale? Cross-region accounts aren't supported and will often cause purchasing troubles such as the one you're experiencing. If you're using a cross-region account, try switching over to your current location and try making the purchase again. Let us know :)</p>

    <title>3rd party Antivirus and firewall programs on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjl1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            3rd party Antivirus and firewall  programs on  Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The latest testing of protection software was done using Windows 10, do not recall who ran the test right now, but most major contenders were at the top of the list.</p>
<p>One that was better than the default was bullguard, having more than a year left on my subscription I installed it.</p>
<p>The issue I have is that some microsoft apps like the store and xbox for win 10 are being blocked by bullguard</p>
<p>by the firewall.</p>
<p>Confirmed this but shutting it off and launching the apps with no issue and was fine re enabling the firewall after the connection was made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if&nbsp;bullguard is active on the launching the app they would again be blocked.</p>
<p>Both windows defender and firewall are off or are still using some settings that are not fully off using the programs&nbsp;</p>
<p>interface.</p>
<p>I use the same&nbsp;&nbsp;bullguard program on vista and win7.</p>
<p>Note; movies and tv have no issue, have not tried groove music.</p>
<p>I know how to set firewall ports and programs to be allowed by the firewall and antivirus but due to the way win10 is configured it is not as easy to find connected apps that run in the cloud and local pc as easily as previous versions
</p>
<p>of windows.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After restarting the pc and the same issue reappeared again.</p>
<p>So went looking for any changed settings with network and connections.</p>
<p>Even though I had turned off windows firewall, somehow &nbsp;it reset to use public</p>
<p>networks and had to disable it again.</p>
<p>Also in settings, network and internet, advanced network and sharing settings, removed all
</p>
<p>options for public networks ( this was re enabled &nbsp;after a reboot without my intervention ).</p>
<p>Changed windows home group to use user accounts and passwords.</p>
<p>Manage WIFI settings, set to metered connection and paid WIFI turned off</p>
<p>These settings had previously been made prior to recent windows updates,&nbsp;</p>
<p>that seem to be overriding set options.</p>
<p>These steps have corrected the issue with the previous post.</p>
<p>Hope it can help others having this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>this occured when i re-installed the system after a liltle hardware upgrade.(cpu &amp; mobo). i installed the windows 7 same way (not changing any settings) . so what do i do now?</p>

    <title>A Beginner&#39;s Guide To Battlefield 1 Multiplayer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Beginner&#39;s Guide To Battlefield 1 Multiplayer</h2>
                    <p><i>Battlefield 1</i>'s multiplayer is very intense. While the game teaches you some basics during the campaign, it doesn’t do much to explain what’s going on in the multiplayer. Don’t worry, doughboys and gals: I’m here to help!

  </p>

<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Know Your Game Modes</b>

  </p>

<p><i>Battlefield 1</i>&nbsp;has six multiplayer modes at the moment:

  </p>

<p><b>Conquest</b>&nbsp;is the bread and butter mode of any&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i>&nbsp;game. In it, two teams face off to a capture flags around the map. Holding these positions gives you points. The goal is to reach 1,000 points. The more flags you hold, the faster you get points. Additionally, killing members of the enemy team also adds to your point total.

  </p>

<p><b>Rush</b><i>&nbsp;</i>involves a team of attackers and defenders. The defending team needs to protect telegraph posts from the attackers. The biggest change in this mode is that attackers have a limited amount of lives, called “tickets.” Each death costs one ticket—run out and you lose. You have to capture multiple posts in a sequence to win a match.&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p><b>War Pigeons</b>&nbsp;functions like a capture the flag mode. Small teams compete to capture a pigeon somewhere on the map. After capturing the pigeon, they must hold onto it for a short time before it will be released. Releasing a pigeon summons a massive artillery barrage on the map and spawns a new pigeon to capture. You must capture and release three pigeons to win.

  </p>

<p><b>Team Deathmatch&nbsp;</b>is exactly what you would expect: Two teams compete to reach a certain number of kills. This number varies depending on what server you’re playing on. The team to get the required number of kills first wins.

  </p>

<p><b>Domination</b>&nbsp;takes the core concept of Conquest but shrinks the size. Teams are smaller and maps are more condensed. The goal score is only 100 points. Otherwise, it functions exactly like the traditional Conquest mode.

  </p>

<p><b>Operations&nbsp;</b>is&nbsp;<i>Battlefield 1</i>'s most prominent multiplayer mode. Operations are pretty cool but can be very confusing for new players. Operations function as something of a combination of Conquest and Rush. Two teams face off. The attacking team has three battalions, which are basically just ticket-based attack waves. Defenders do not have tickets. With these limited battalions, the attackers must sequentially conquer sectors on multiple maps. The number varies depending on which Operation you are playing.

  </p>



<p>To capture a sector, the attackers need to capture two control points. Once they have control over both points, they drive the defenders back to the next sector. This process continues until they either control all sectors or use up three battalions’ worth of tickets. </p>

<p>Operations are my preferred way to experience&nbsp;<i>Battlefield 1&nbsp;</i>because they are constantly changing<i>.&nbsp;</i>If a team is struggling, they might be given special advantages between rounds. Armored tanks, blimps, or battleships will be given to a team lagging behind. There’s also a narrative through-line that plays between the matches depending on who is winning.

  </p>

<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>THE BASICS</b>

  </p>

<p><b>Don’t worry about your kill/death ratio.</b>

  </p>

<p><i>Battlefield</i>&nbsp;is about points. It’s about capturing positions and ordering squads. It’s about objectives. Play the objective, follow squad orders, and don’t worry too much about dying. Everyone dies. But if you play hard and do your job, you can contribute more going 7-13 than 18-2.

  </p>

<p><b>Mark all enemies.</b>

  </p>

<p>If you see an enemy, you should mark them immediately. RB on Xbox One will place a red marker on the enemy. This makes it easy for you and your team to spot them. Mash that button even when you don’t necessarily see baddies. Sometimes you’ll ferret someone out of hiding.

  </p>

<p><b>Lead your squad, sergeant!</b>

  </p>

<p>I made&nbsp;an entire post about this, but if you are the leader of a squad, you need to issue orders. It’s just like marking: Point to an objective and hit the spot button. You will be able to designate a point for attack or defense.

  </p>

<p><b>Switch kits on the fly.</b>

  </p>

<p>When folks die on the battlefield, you can take their weapons and kits. Did a Medic just die near you? Take their kit and revive them with their supplies.

  </p>

<p><b>Aim where enemies are going, not where they are.</b>

  </p>

<p>Bullet physics matter in&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i>. Don’t fire at where someone&nbsp;<i>is</i>, fire at where they&nbsp;<i>will be</i>. If firing over a longer distance, be prepared to account for bullet drop.

  </p>

<p><b>Horses are magic!</b>

  </p>

<p>This is a fun one: If you’re ever in desperate need of ammo and no one is around to give it to you, just climb on a horse and get off. Full ammo!

  </p>

<p><b>Good job, you’ve been promoted.</b>

  </p>

<p>Earning points increases your level and ups your rank. You receive “war bonds” each time you level up. These are the currency you use to buy new weapons. To buy them, go to “customize your loadout” when you spawn. You’ll be able to buy out new guns and equip them.

  </p>

<p><b>Classes have their own leveling system.</b>

  </p>

<p>You level up your rank in different classes by playing as them. You unlock new weapons for purchase at certain class levels. You’ll still have to buy them with war bonds, so plan accordingly!

  </p>

<p><b>Battlepacks are ****.</b>

  </p>

<p>Occasionally after a match, you will randomly receive a battlepack. These RNG-based crates unlock different skins for your weapons. Keep in mind that getting a skin does not unlock that weapon. You can turn skins into scrap to buy higher quality packs if you want, but otherwise they don’t really change the game much.

  </p>

<p><b>Use your sidearm.</b>

  </p>

<p>Pistols are surprisingly effective in&nbsp;<i>Battlefield 1</i>. You have an M1911 by default across all kits. It’s great. Pistols are phenomenal in tighter spaces and are perfect to switch to if you have a weak enemy but no ammo in your primary. Don’t hesitate to use them!

  </p>

<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>THE CLASSES</b>

  </p>

<p>You have four classes to choose from in&nbsp;<i>Battlefield 1</i>: ****, Medic, Support, and Scout. All have strengths and weaknesses, specific weapon focuses, and additional utilities.

  </p>



<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>****</b>

  </p>

<p><b>Play **** if you want to kill dudes.</b>

  </p>

<p>**** gets in close and **** **** up. You’re not going to be the most refined soldier on the battlefield, but if you want to keep things simple, **** is the class for you.

  </p>

<p><b>Get in the enemy’s stupid face.</b>

  </p>

<p>In terms of weapons, you have a choice between sub machineguns and shotguns. Neither are great at range, so get in close and let the other team have it!

  </p>

<p><b>Blow **** up.</b>

  </p>

<p>In&nbsp;<i>Battlefield 1</i>, **** soldiers are the folks to call if some enemy armor has you pinned down. From TNT and mines to the most esoteric anti-tank rifle, you will have plenty of tools to deal with landships or tanks. All of these hard hitting weapons and tools mean the **** class can quickly turn the tide of a fight.

  </p>

<p><b>Move!</b>

  </p>

<p>The **** class is a furious role that rewards risk. If a tank is in the open, book it, drop some TNT, and detonate. Even if you get caught in the explosion, you’ve made a huge difference.

  </p>

<p><b>Find a buddy.</b>

  </p>

<p>**** soldiers should buddy up with Medics. The classes mesh well, with the **** able to handle immediate threats while the Medic heals them up and offers mid range assistance.

  </p>

<p><b>AT Grenades are heavy.</b>

  </p>

<p>Anti tank grenades have a lot of heft and a longer travel time than you think! Aim your throw arc a bit higher and lead a little bit more when using them.

  </p>

<p><b>Shoot from the hip.</b>

  </p>

<p>Don’t look down your iron sights too much. The **** class is about output, not precision. Fire away!

  </p>

<p><b>Use the right **** weapons.</b>

  </p>

<p>Grab a variation of the&nbsp;<b>Automatico m1918</b>&nbsp;as soon as you can and then focus on&nbsp;<b>Model 10&nbsp;</b>variants for your shotguns. If you&nbsp;<i>really</i>&nbsp;want to go mid range, the&nbsp;<b>MP18's Optical version</b>&nbsp;will do in a pinch.&nbsp;<b>TNT</b>&nbsp;is a bit more technical to use than other tools but highly recommended if you want to take out armor quickly.

  </p>

<p>As a side note, the **** class actually has one of the few good level ten class weapons: the&nbsp;<b>Hellrigel 1915</b>. Level up and grab this for the best **** weapon in the game.

  </p>



<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>MEDIC</b>

  </p>

<p><b>Keep people alive.</b>

  </p>

<p>Medics have access to medical syringes that revive downed teammates as well as a bandage pouch that can be dropped for healing over time. A larger medical crate later becomes available with a little more kick.

  </p>

<p>Follow the skull icons to recently killed buddies and stab them with a syringe to bring them back to life. Make a habit of dropping heal near clustered allies or those hiding in corners. They’re the ones who probably need it the most.

  </p>

<p><b>Medics can fight too.</b>

  </p>

<p>Medics primarily uses self loading rifles. They don’t hit as hard as what the Scout uses, but they do fire faster. If you deck one of these out with a scope, the Medic can become a formidable fighter who can even do some counter sniping. Hell, if you’re desperate, you can&nbsp;stab someone with your syringe.

  </p>

<p><b>Save yourself.</b>

  </p>

<p>It’s easy to forget that you can heal yourself as well. When you’re on the brink of dying, toss a med pouch at your feet.

  </p>

<p><b>Open fire!</b>

  </p>

<p>Certain Medic weapons can be toggled to an automatic fire mode. Switch to full auto and pin the enemy down with heavy suppression if you don’t feel confident setting up for more precise shooting.

  </p>

<p><b>But also take your time.</b>

  </p>

<p>If you are using an optical or marksman version of one of the Medic rifles, don’t be afraid to take a moment to line up your shots. With precise aim, you’ll down enemies in 2-3 rounds.

  </p>

<p><b>Most non-healing tools are useless.</b>

  </p>

<p>Avoid the rifle grenades. They take up a slot in your kit that could be used for healing items, and the HE grenades aren’t damaging enough to make for good anti-vehicle use either.

  </p>

<p><b>Use the right Medic weapons.</b>

  </p>

<p>Scopes are crucial for this class. Aim for a&nbsp;<b>Selbstlader</b>&nbsp;<b>M1916 Optical&nbsp;</b>or<b>Marksman</b>. It’s a flat upgrade from your default Cei-Rigotti that should become your go-to rifle. For close encounters, grab the&nbsp;<b>M1907 Trench or Sweeper</b>.

  </p>



<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>SUPPORT</b>

  </p>

<p><b>Play Support if you want a lot of options.</b>

  </p>

<p>This is the class with all the cool stuff. Limpet charges, mortars, light machine guns—with a little ingenuity, you can kit out your Support soldier to fill a variety of needs. Go wild and experiment!

  </p>

<p><b>Stock up and repair everything.</b>

  </p>

<p>Support soldiers have access to ammo drops and boxes that work much like the Medic’s health packs. They also have access to a wrench that can be used to repair vehicles. Whenever you’re not killing, you should toss out ammo like candy and repair whatever you can.

  </p>

<p><b>You’re the wheelman.</b>

  </p>

<p>This is the class to be if you want to drive vehicles. Do your damage and then find a safe place to conduct repairs with your wrench before heading back into the fray.

  </p>

<p><b>Take the high ground.</b>

  </p>

<p>All classes benefit from elevated positions, but the Support class really uses it well. Think spatially and look for buildings that will provide you a solid place to fire on enemies.

  </p>

<p><b>Keep firing.</b>

  </p>

<p>Your machine gun gets more accurate the longer you hold the trigger. Don’t fire in tiny bursts. Unload your clip and transfer the spray to your next target when the first one falls.

  </p>

<p><b>Fix up your kits.</b>

  </p>

<p>Tools are limited. Consider making a few different pre-made loadouts to swap in and out situationally: Alimpet mine build for anti-tank action, air mortar for anti-infantry.

  </p>

<p><b>Use the right Support weapons.</b>

  </p>

<p>The default&nbsp;<b>Lewis Gun</b>&nbsp;is astounding and can serve you well throughout your career, but the real prize is the&nbsp;<b>BAR M1918</b>. Power through to class level 2 and grab it. If you want something that will work best over long distance, take the&nbsp;<b>M1909 Benét–Mercié.</b>

  </p>



<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>SCOUT</b>

  </p>

<p><b>Scouts are sneaky, sniping bastards!</b>

  </p>

<p>Scouts are your snipers. In the right hands, this is a powerhouse class that can significantly confuse enemies and cut through their ranks. It’s also a very demanding class in terms of twitch skill and situational awareness but if you are patient and take the time to really learn this class, it will pay high dividends for your team.

  </p>

<p><b>Be proactive.</b>

  </p>

<p>Shifting positions, adjusting angles, and avoiding complacency are essential as a Scout. You need to have sights on where the enemy will soon be. Where are they pushing next, and where can you be to best cover that position? Scouts need to think just a few steps ahead.

  </p>

<p><b>Communicate.</b>

  </p>

<p>All classes can mark, but Scouts can survey areas in a way no other class can. Calling out the enemy position and keeping your team well informed of their moment will help them organize strong counter offensives. The flare gun is a great tool, marking a wide area of the map when used. If you’re not killing the enemy, at least make sure that your teammates will be able to react in time.

  </p>

<p><b>Don’t panic.</b>

  </p>

<p>If you’re being fired upon, keep calm. You usually have time to pivot and fire your own reply. Shift, scope, aim for the head, and fire. As long as it is just one enemy, you’re in the clear.

  </p>

<p><b>Stand up tall when you have to.</b>

  </p>

<p>Going prone will deploy a bipod on most rifles. The added stability is nice but can come at the cost of a limited angle. If you have to stand up to line up a shot, go for it.

  </p>

<p><b>Set your traps.</b>

  </p>

<p>Tripwire bombs will help you secure strong camping positions if you want to lay down, but they can also be used more actively to wire pathways you know enemies will follow. Think about where the enemy will need to go and lay your bombs there.

  </p>

<p><b>Find the sweet spot.</b>

  </p>

<p>Sniper rifles have a mechanic where their damage starts high and then gets&nbsp;<i>even</i>&nbsp;<i>higher</i>&nbsp;at a certain range before falling off. As an example, my preferred rifle (the<b>&nbsp;</b><span>Russian 1895 Sniper</span>) hits its max damage potential once the bullet has traveled 60 meters and only falls off once it has traveled around 100 meters.

  </p>

<p>This means if I land a body shot in between those distance values, it will kill the enemy&nbsp;<i>in one bullet</i>. If you know the engagement range you tend to fight from, you can use the&nbsp;<span>stats at Symthic</span>&nbsp;to find the perfect rifle for your sniping preferences.

  </p>

<p><b>Don’t get cocky, kid!</b>

  </p>

<p>Be realistic about your shots. Long distance Hail Mary head shots are tricky. Sometimes it is enough to hit the body and force the enemy to fall back.

  </p>

<p><b>Use the right Scout weapons.</b>

  </p>

<p>Grab the<b>&nbsp;Russian</b>&nbsp;<b>1895 Sniper</b>&nbsp;and don’t look back. If the higher magnification proves difficult or you prefer shorter engagement distances, take the&nbsp;<b>SMLE MKIII Marksman&nbsp;</b>instead.

  </p>



<p><b><br /></b></p><p><b>Oh, yeah. Have fun!</b>

  </p>

<p>Video games are pretty exciting. It can get easy to give into your competitive side, but&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i>&nbsp;is so chaotic that you just need to embrace it. Take breaks, play with friends. Do whatever you have to do to keep a cool head. After all, it’s just a game.

<p>My daughter got a new Windows 10 laptop. &nbsp;She forgot the login password. &nbsp;When the computer starts, she comes to the login page. &nbsp;It has her name along with an e-mail address. &nbsp;There is the box for her to enter the password. &nbsp;She can't remember it. &nbsp;Therefore,
 she can't get onto her computer at all. &nbsp;Essentially, this has turned her computer into a $500 paper weight. &nbsp;How can we reset the password? &nbsp;Very frustrating!</p>

<h2>            Apps now in Spanish&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I did a clean install of English windows 8 and everything ok.&nbsp; Now updated the basic included apps and now the interface language is Spanish.&nbsp; Since I am in Australia and English is the language here, how strange.&nbsp; I can speak Spanish but I definitely prefer
 to work in English.&nbsp; What happened and how to I get back to English.&nbsp; I've checked out the language options and all seem to be ok.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you, for posting in the Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p><span>From the description you have provided I understand that after a reinstall of Windows 8 you have downloaded and installed
 the Apps you needed. However, the Apps are displayed in Spanish. To understand the issues even better it would help if you could let us know a couple of things.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are all Apps in Spanish including the default Windows 8 apps?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the display language in Windows?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which language options did you check?</span></p>
<p><span>Try these methods.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you first check the Region and Language setting if it is set to the country you reside. Follow
 the steps.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Windows +X.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Arrange the options by choosing the “Category” option from the dropdown.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Region and language option.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Region option.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Location tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose the country of residence.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you have already not tried changing the Language setting from the Control panel then try these steps.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press Windows +X.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Arrange the options by choosing the “Category” option from the dropdown.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Region and language option.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Language option.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Add language.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose English from the list.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists then refer this link and try the methods from the article.</span></p>

            <p>I solved the problem.&nbsp; I had installed the Spanish keyboard as I sometimes need to work in Spanish, but I kept it as the second keyboard, i.e. below the US English keyboard.&nbsp; I removed this keyboard (the Spanish one) and then changed the store language to
 English (via a setting for this app), did a reboot and then removed each Spanish app and reinstalled.&nbsp; Lo and behold, English as the app language.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Later on, I saw a problem on the noticeboard by someone who installed the Spanish keyboard while in Spain and had the same problem of Spanish language apps appearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to be some problem in this keyboard setting, don't know if it's only for Spanish that the problem occurs or for other lanaguages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to those that tried to help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Everything went fine with the reset, however, in the process I lost the free Windows DVD player.&nbsp; The laptop was updated from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 and had the free Windows DVD player prior to the reset.</p>

            <p>She had windows 7 home premium and updated to Windows 10 - which gave her the free DVD player.&nbsp; If windows 10 didn't have so many bugs, and need to be reset, the DVD player would still be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So I guess the only way to get it back is to pay for it.&nbsp; Not happening.</p>
