 "the export could not be performed. An error occurred while initializing MAPI". I've tried shutting down Outlook Express as well as rebooting machine. Have tried this on several occasions over several days to no avail. Any ideas?</p>

    <title>Why are active and inactive title bars and borders the same color&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j town  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are active and inactive title bars and borders the same color&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So my main laptop was ready to update this morning. &nbsp;I made a system image then let the update chug away. &nbsp;First thing I noticed is that active and inactive windows look identical. &nbsp;And I can't find a way to change it. &nbsp;This doesn't make a bit of sense to
 me. &nbsp;I've got two external monitors on this laptop so I can have several non-overlapping windows open simultaneously but now I can't tell, visually, which window is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought maybe I was crazy but I looked over at a Windows 8.1 laptop that I got yesterday and the windows are easy to differentiate. &nbsp;I've made no changes to its appearance (as noted by the huge borders which is usually the first thing I change). &nbsp;The active
 window's title bar and borders are blue-grey. &nbsp;The "X" has a red background. &nbsp;It clearly stands out as the active window. &nbsp;The inactive window's title bar and borders are light grey and the "X" has a dark grey background. &nbsp;It's clearly an inactive window.
 &nbsp;I don't have to click on the active window to confirm it's activeness. &nbsp;I can tell it's active because it's the only one with a colored border and red "X".</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking very (very, very) closely, I can see that there is a slight bluish tint around the active window and the title bar items are ever so slightly (slightly, slightly) darker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, Microsoft, this is basic UI functionality. &nbsp;The difference between active and inactive windows shouldn't be a subtle suggestion. &nbsp;It should be a clear statement. &nbsp;I shouldn't have to lean in and squint to see which window is a bit bluish around
 the edges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a way to fix this within Windows or am I going to have to wait for a 3rd party application to fix a change that should never have been made? &nbsp;Again.</p>

            I totally agree. &nbsp;I couldn't wait to get rid of the ridiculous stupid mistake known as Windows 8 and move on to the one where they came to their senses and made everything work again. &nbsp;Right out of the gate I find this. &nbsp;PLEASE, Microsoft, stop trying
 to be more like Apple and just make things work the way they should. &nbsp;I need my computers to be useful tools, not pieces of artwork!

            <p>I suggest everybody to open their Feedback app, go to the "Personalisation; Designs and windows" section, find that entry and
<strong>vote for it</strong>. (If there's none yet in your language, feel free to write a concise and objective entry.) This is a major usability failure that needs to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is kicking all keyboard users into their face with this. If it's not obvious what state the system is in, it can't be used reliably. "Mobile first" means "touch first" and that's exactly how Windows 8 failed. Windows 10 can't afford to go down
 the same way. The keyboard will stay on people's desks for a long time, so make it work again. Keyboards need focus cues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad that windows aren't transparent anymore because that was an issue in Windows 7 as well where the desktop background image (or other overlapped windows) affected how active and inactive window title bars were displayed. Take the default Aero blue
 together with an image of a blue sky, and you won't see the difference in Windows 7 as well. (However, at least there's the red Close button.) Windows 8 was really great in this regard. Windows 8 was great in a number of ways regarding the theme. Windows 10
 is not necessarily an improvement. (For instance, it's too dark for my liking. I like the window drop shadows though.)</p>

            I didn't want to use the feedback app on my main computers because it requires authorizing the computer to send a bunch of diagnostic and usage data. &nbsp;Then I remembered I've got an old machine with nothing personal installed so I used that. &nbsp;There are
 at least half a dozen entries for this in the feedback system. &nbsp;I upvoted all of the entries that had passable grammar.

            I'm only running Windows 10 in a virtual testing environment for now. But when logging in to Feedback from my local Windows account, I also had the option to only log into the app, without making my Windows account a cloud account, i. e. keeping my local
 user name and password. It's just a small link in the login dialog. Maybe that helps. I'm not sure though what data is collected by the Feedback app. If you're worried about what Microsoft does with any of your local data, then Windows 10 is probably not a
 recommended option anyway...

            I cannot believe that a company the size of Microsoft, with its leadership in operating systems and office applications does not have a human factors team that conducts usability studies on its products. I am an educational psychologist and I have done
 such studies. But there are engineering psychologists, humans factors engineers, and others who do this on a regular basis.

<h2>            windows 10 TH2 10240</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community, this is my first post so forgive me if I get anything wrong. I am having trouble updating windows. when I go to the update tab in the Action Centre there is no info in the update tab only dots going across the box. I have tried stopping and
 starting bits, crypto etc and deleting/renaming softwaredistribution and catroot2 and have run sfc /scannow and dism but nothing seems to work, I am unable to update and not getting any security updates, in addition and not sure if it's linked but file explorer
 crashes every time I try and openit up. I am sure I am not alone with this problem so any assistance our thoughts welcome. I don't want to have to rebuild from scratch as it will be a real pai in the butt.

    <title>Windows 10 Newest Update, or Phishing Scam &#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tftkia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Newest Update, or Phishing Scam &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 10 for several months now, with no problems. Recently, I received a message that said the "first new Windows 10 Update" was needed, so I let the computer update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day, I went to use my (desktop) computer, and none of the usual icons were at the bottom of the screen, &amp; there was no photo or box to click on, to go into the internet browser. I shut the computer down, then tried again. This time, there was a
 black screen with 2 white-lettered sentences in very tiny print that read:</p>
<p>
</p><p>User profile service failed the sign-in.</p>
<p>User profile cannot be loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not able to use the computer at all that day, because I couldn't get on the browser, or do anything on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried again. My screen is not the same, and there is no photo on the screen like there usually is, just prior to me going on the net. Also, the icons ARE at the bottom of the screen, but now there is an additional icon that I did not put there,
 &amp; it is a white envelope that is open on top.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are: &nbsp; What happened when Windows updated -&nbsp; or was that not a legitimate Windows update ?</p>
<p>Also -&nbsp; IF I click on the white envelope icon, is that going to open Malware, or is it really a message from the Windows people ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>DJ</p>

<p>Hi DJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue is conflict with some updates or programs installed on your PC. We would like to ask some questions to know the best possible resolution to offer:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried restarting your PC in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</li><li>Have you tried running the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I am sorry, but I am not sure how to do the things you have suggested. &nbsp;????? &nbsp;I am not a computer expert, and someone else originally set the computer up for me. &nbsp;I just don't understand why the computer has updated prior to this with no problem. But this
 time, the whole "look" of my screen has all changed. It no longer looks like Windows 10...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not added or taken away any programs since I got this computer; the only changes that have been made were made when Windows did the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you for your response to my question. I wish I had someone here to explain what all of those terms mean, and how to do them.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the build and version of your Windows PC? For us to check if it is updated to Creators Update.<br />
</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of your desktop for us to determine the white envelope that you are referring to.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><em>Note: Kindly remove some personal information on the screenshot that you'll be sending.</em></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't work for Microsoft or have anything to do with their Tech Support.</p>
<p>We are mainly volunteers here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you would be very lucky to be able to contact the same person again.</p>

                    Hi:<br />
<br />
I just bought a new computer today ( Lenovo)&nbsp; and it came installed with windows 7 home premium 64 bit. I know that oblivion is not compatible with this OS. Although I noticed that Oblivion GOTY is compatible. So I really don't know what to do. is there any
 way i can make the regular version of Oblivion compatible with the 64 bit or no?<br />

            Hi aromancer, what type of file are you compressing to a zip?
<br />
<br />Some file formats are already compressed and zipping them up will have no effect on size . . .

            1. Try running SFC / DISM and check after this
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">https://answers.microsoft.com/thread/bc609315-d...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As an alternative, you can try to use 7z also which is the leading freeware zip utility
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.7-zip.org/download.html</a>
<br />
<br />(Note - MS Store offers few zip utilities. If you type zip, you will get many options. Hence, if you are wary of any third party utility, you can download form MS Store offered zip utilities)
<br />
<br />3. As a last resort, I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi Matt.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you describe the exact behavior you're seeing?   Is it consistent?  Will Windows 10 start at all?
<br />
<br />Have you tried Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a> ?
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>.  Try Last Known Good Configuration and then Safe Mode with Networking.
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Device and drivers for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nokialoyal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device and drivers for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Long story short. Win 10 free upgrade was available on pendo pad. After upgrade touch screen was messed up, touch left and it would show right and scroll up would show down. This tablet has just one micro USB port and to revert back I had to have the power
 connected but couldn't select the rollback option. A reset made it worse as it removed windows.old and the recovery partition could not give me much as the reset replaced it with win 10 files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A few weeks, calls to MS tech support and manufacturer gave little or no result.
</p>
<p>Manufacturer says return the device if&nbsp; under warranty which it isn't.</p>
<p>device manufacturers website is hopeless (sileadinc) is in some Asian language cant really get anything out of it.
</p>
<p>MS tech support told me there is no way of installing win 8.1 as the ISO from media creation tool is not with "bing" and it refused the OEM key which I had.
</p>
<p>I managed to find the OEM ISO and installed it and activated without MS help but the touch screen refuses to work.</p>
<p>The device driver doesn't show the device either. my audio device also having the same problem.</p>
<p>There are 5&nbsp;Intel I2C and 2 UART in the device manager list with yellow triangle and a "!" update driver option says up to date but properties show error code 37. I don't&nbsp;want to use the USB hub al the time, it defeats the purpose of having a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried driver identifier and that didn't work with the 7 instances mentioned above and it didn't detect the audio or touch device either and&nbsp;windows update shows squat. Somewhere in this forums there is a thread about devices
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/nvidia-graphic-card-does-not-show-up-in-device/d773c616-7767-47c0-94be-b35d77727941?auth=1">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/nvidia-graphic-card-does-not-show-up-in-device/d773c616-7767-47c0-94be-b35d77727941?auth=1</a> In the solution by Mann Manohar method 1 and 2 didn't fix the problem and I am not sure with the
 3rd option as the manufacturer is asking for the device to be sent back "if" within warranty. I don't think it will be worth sending it back (cost wise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <a href="http://drivers.for.insyde.pndppw81qi7blk.driveragent.com/12521442986601/Microsoft-Windows-10?PHPSESSID=10or6a8cjuqtgdrnj743u7rf90&amp;PHPSESSID=o80qig2q6rh12veenta7djaii3&amp;PHPSESSID=5qu9ie2bfmvmarbeagnuor9ag4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a> shows the drivers list. In it the "<span>KMDF HID Minidriver for Touch I2C Device", sound device and possible others that I dont really miss are missing from the List. These 2 devices are not in the device manager list.</span></p>
<p><span>How do I fix this</span></p>

    <title>What is better&#63; System Image vs System Repair - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What is better&#63; System Image vs System Repair</h2>
                    <p>Looking for an opinion on System Image vs System Repair. &nbsp;I have never had to recover from a system crash.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Assuming that&nbsp;I don't&nbsp;do a System Image capture on a regular basis but&nbsp;I do&nbsp;data backup "fairly regularly" -&nbsp;is&nbsp;a System Image really better than System Repair + original discs + OS Updates +&nbsp;Data Back Up discs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) Also&nbsp;with the System Image route I would have to buy Imaging software for both my PC's ($60) + an external HD.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So is the System Image process really that much better?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Whether you get a NAS or a USB connected disk is irrelevant. The difference is purely in the connection method.
<div><br />
<div>You can store several images on one disk. However, with the lower flavours of Windows 7 you can store the image on a local disk only. Networked media are out. This restriction does not apply to third-party imaging products.</div>

            <p><i>Also&nbsp;with the System Image route I would have to buy Imaging software for both my PC's ($60) + an external HD.</i></p>
<p>-&gt; Imaging software is included in Windows 7. It's basic but it works (well, most of the time). An external HD is almost compulsory for backup purposes. It is ridiculously cheap.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i>So is the System Image process really that much better?</i></p>
<p>-&gt; It depends. Experience says that it takes around one day to rebuild a machine from scratch and about one week to get everything back the way it was. If you have oodles of time and do not mind starting afresh (complete with downloading
 200-odd automatic upgrades) then you can skip the image creation bit. I wouldn't - in fact I'm happy to pay for a more powerful and more dependable image management tool instead of using the basic native tool.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Surface-book freezing during streaming - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neos_nightwing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface-book freezing during streaming</h2>
                    <p>I will be watching a video and my screen will just freeze as if I am pausing the video. I try Ctrl+Alt+Del but it does not work, I try touch actions and manage to bring up the control center with a swipe to the left but I can only do it once. I click on
 settings to try and wake it from the freeze and maybe delete the desktop and open a new one, but by that point, I now have no control whatsoever. Even detaching has no effect. It is really quite annoying because I feel it happens every time I watch an hours
 worth of video playback. My mousepad will stop working as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently lost my Logitech mouse and abruptly just deleted the device and took the USB out. I do not think this was the right way to eject and am worried this may be part of the issue for the mousepad? I have no idea and anyone with a similar problem with
 their surface freezing, I would appreciate the advice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll need a bit more information to help you better:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the freezing behavior only happens when you're streaming a video or is it happening randomly?</li><li>What software or application do you use to play the video?</li><li>What are the other services and apps running when the freezing happens?</li><li>What are the solution steps you've tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that the freezing issue of your Surface Book is caused by its connectors. If the Surface Book connectors become dirty, this can result in poor performance. Thus, it's recommended to make sure the connectors are clean to prevent such
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find helpful solution steps to help care for your Surface Book and other troubleshooting suggestions from this support article:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023472/surface-troubleshoot-your-surface-book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot

<p>Hello Edjay,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. I will try to answer all the bullets in order so that you can help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The freezing started very suddenly just a couple days ago and I believe that it only happens during streaming. There has not been another freeze where it wasn't&nbsp; a video stream so I can not guarantee. I have had it freeze in the past where I was not watching
 a video I believe but was able to either</li><li>
<ul>
<li>A. Fix it without a hard restart by touching the screen or</li><li>B. Wait for it to respond to my actions or use task manager</li></ul>
</li><li>This new freezing is very hard to manage and lets me do only certain actions for a while until it is completely frozen. Actions like briefly open the Action Center with swiping to the left, go to settings, and by that point, I can not do anything. The screen
 recognizes&nbsp;my touch, but it does not respond. Keyboard and trackpad as well.</li><li>It usually happens when I am streaming anime on Crunchyroll, never YouTube&nbsp;</li><li>I believe the only things running in the background was my Spotify, Canon Printer Service, AVG Antivirus, other regular background processors, etc. I wasn't actually using anything besides the one browser window I had opened and maybe Spotify had a song
 paused from earlier.</li><li>I haven't really tried anything major, I thought it may be because I leave my Surface plugged into my surface dock for an extended time and I have a bad habit&nbsp;of not manually shutting down. It will either be on for a while or it will turn off itself. I
 took the charger out of the port and cleaned it a bit, but I will make sure to take your advice on cleaning the connectors as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>So far been using it the majority of the day with shutting down and turning on with no real problem, any precautions or advice&nbsp;would be greatly appreciated!!&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Thank you for your time and help!! </p>

<p>Thank you for proving more details. To clarify, the freezing only happens when you stream videos from one particular website and using a browser? Have you tried to optimize and reset your browser? Have you tried to use a different browser to test and replicate
 the issue? Is your flash player up-to-date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to check it this issue is software-related, we suggest that you run the

            Hi Jeannette
<br />
<br />Right click your clock on the Taskbar, choose Adjust Date/Time
<br />
<br />On that page, you can turn on/off 'Set Time Automatically'
<br />
<br />That will unlink your PC form the Internet Time Server . . 
<br />
<br />Alternatively on that same settings page, click 'Additional Date Time and Regional Settings'
<br />
<br />Then click Set Date Time
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, choose the 'Internet Time' tab and click 'Change Settings'

            <blockquote>Be glad it failed (installed and reversed.) I have a dell studio 15 running vista x64, and that update (kb968389) crashed my computer. I ended up on a blue screen after about 45 to 90 sec.&nbsp;I couldn't get anything to work b/c the computer would automatically
 shut down and restart. Finally got it on in safe mode and uninstalled the updates, have all but that one reinstalled today - kb968389 was definitely the culprit!</blockquote>
<br />
You're the second poster with a Dell system that&nbsp; has reported that KB968389 crashed their systems. His system was a Dell Dimension 8400 with XP SP3 installed. If you want to pursue this issue, here's the advice I gave the OP:<br />
