<h2>            windows update errors 800F026 and 80070057</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I cannot install updates - when I restart Windows to complete updating, it installs a little bit, just like 7%, then says reverting changes and that's it, nothing gets installed.</p>
<p>All except for one update report error 800F026, and the remaining one update reports error 80070057. I run Windows 7, 64 bit.</p>
<p>- I tried Windows Troubleshooter, that did not help</p>
<p>- I tried the "fix it" program available to download from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us. That helped to some extent - after running the basic version of the fix, windows managed to install 6 out of the 16 updates pending. But 10 are still
 reporting the errors 80070057 and 800F0826. The advanced version of the fix didn't seem to help any further</p>
<p>- I tried also renaming the software distribution folder as suggested in the first answer here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_update/error-80070057-when-installing-windows-updates/3646cb74-3cfc-4bea-b5a0-ba78ff4864d0</p>
<p>I would be grateful for any advice how to proceed</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p><span>Windows</span> Update error 800f0826 is displayed when an update for

Microsoft</span> Office System.</p>
<p>To prevent error 800f0826, you need to identify the update that's causing the problem (it will display a different error message), fix the problem, and then try installing updates again. etc etc etc</p>

    <title>Advanced sizing of text and other items in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> al52818  say:</h3>
<h2>            Advanced sizing of text and other items in Windows 10</h2>
                    <strong>I am able to change the size of Text and other items by right clicking "Display Settings" on my desktop, dragging the slide bar to show 125 %, Click on "Advanced Display Settings", then on "Advanced Sizing of Text and Other Items". I then go to
 "Title Bars", "Menus", Message Boxes", "Pallette Titles", "Icons", and 'Tooltips", set the font size for each to 12, then click "Apply". Everything works perfectly from that point on.......................until someone else logs onto their profile. When I
 go to sign in afterward, all of my display settings have reverted back to the default of 100 % on the slider and fount size of 9 for everything. How can I keep this from happening in the future ?</strong>

    <title>BOOTMGR image is corrupt. System cannot boot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sajibacharya  say:</h3>
<h2>            BOOTMGR image is corrupt. System cannot boot.</h2>
                    I have recently downloaded the Win7BootUpdater, that promises to change the Boot-up screen for my Windows 7 system. I have downloaded a different animation for the boot up screen from a trusted source, and I have used the Win7BootUpdater to&nbsp;customize&nbsp;the
 Boot screen. I had applied the settings and it said that the settings have been successfully saved. When I restarted my machine it is giving me the error message "BOOTMGR image is corrupt. system cannot boot."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>now one good thing &nbsp;I had done is that before I had applied the customized settings, I saved the default start up animation. But since the system cannot boot to the OS, I cannot apply the default settings. Now I have the Windows 7 Installation Disk, which
 takes me to the System Repair Tools, but its no good, because it cannot solve this problem. Please Help. I cannot format the System since I have very important documents in my system, including important documents in the C: Drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the "repair your computer" from the installation disk. This scans my machine and gives me to choose my OS in a tab. It shows only one option to choose i.e. "Windows 7"</div>
<div>when I am selecting this, it is giving the error message that this is not the correct OS and that this OS cannot be repaired from this Disk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I have Installed my Os from this disk. I do not know what to do.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>

 &gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>, do you see an option labeled <strong>Mobile hotspot</strong></span>?</li><li>If you do see the option for <span><strong>Mobile hotspot</strong></span> in the<span>
<strong>Settings </strong>app</span>, have you attempted to use the built in application to turn your laptop into a hotspot?</li><li>Were there any error messages when you attempted to connect other devices to your laptop's hotspot?</li><li>Which build and version of Windows 10 do you have installed on your computer?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>We would like to confirm what was the type of authentication settings that you choose when you set up the mobile hotspot on your laptop? We suggest also that you temporarily make the mobile hotspot an open connection. Doing this will allow us to check if
 the reason that devices are not able to connect is due to incompatible authentication settings being used.</p>

<p>I have even ran the cmd bootrec /rebuildbcd and I receive that the total amount of Windows installations is 0.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Fell,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We will help you in resolving the issue you are facing with.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Before assisting you further, I would like to ask a question related to the query.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Does it responds when you press BIOS setup keys like F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key to begin the BIOS Setup?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then to repair your computer, create a Windows 10 Bootable media (i.e. USB or DVD) using
</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Media Creation Tool</span></span></a><span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.
 &nbsp;</span>Once you're ready with Bootable Media, follow the below mentioned steps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Insert&nbsp;the Windows installation disc in the disc drive or connect USB media and then start the computer.</span></li><li>
<span>Press a key when the message <strong>Press any key</strong> is displayed to boot from CD or DVD appears.<br />
If your PC does not detect the media automatically </span>
<ol>
<li>
<span>During the restart process, read the screen for any instructions that explain how to interrupt normal startup and enter the basic input/output system (BIOS) setup utility. Most PCs use the F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key to begin the BIOS Setup.</span></li><li>
<span>Look for a tab in the <strong>BIOS Setup Utility</strong> that is labeled <strong>
<span>Boot Order</span></strong>, <strong>
<span>Boot Options</span></strong>, or <strong>
<span>Boot</span></strong>. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to go to the
<strong><span>Boot Order </span></strong><strong><span>and</span></strong> then press
<strong>Enter.</strong> </span></li><li>
<span>Locate the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive (this might be called <strong>Removable Device</strong>) in the Boot list. Following the directions on the screen, use the arrow keys to move the drive up so that it appears first in the Boot list. Press
<strong>Enter</strong>. The boot order sequence is now changed to boot from the CD, DVD, or USB flash drive.</span></li><li>
<span>Press F10 to save your changes and to exit the BIOS Setup Utility. Select <strong>
Yes</strong> in the confirmation window. The PC will <strong>restart</strong>. Allow the PC to restart normally. The scan will take a few minutes and remove any malware that may be infecting your computer.</span></li></ol>
</li><li>
<span>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or another input method, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Click <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Click the operating system that you want to repair and then click <strong><span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>On the Choose an option screen, select <strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong>.&nbsp;Select
<strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong> &gt;<strong><span>Command Prompt</span></strong></span></li><li>
<span>Type <strong><span>Bootrec /RebuildBcd</span></strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>You can also go with
</span><strong><span>System Restore </span>
</strong><span>or </span><strong><span>Startup Repair
</span></strong><span>option under </span><strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong><span>&nbsp;and follow with onscreen instruction to repair your computer.
</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. I am able to enter BIOS setup. &nbsp;Unfortunately I tried this and when I did Bootrec /RebuildBcd I still received an error. I spoke to a tech support at Microsoft who recommended that I transfer my files to a different drive and
 clean install Windows. All this headache and loss of productivity due to a forced automatic update on Microsoft's behalf. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry that you have been having these issues while setting up our product.&nbsp; We did identify an issue with our service that was preventing some users from signing up&nbsp;earlier this summer.&nbsp; As Reed indicated, that issue has since been resolved.&nbsp; I would
 like you to confirm these last few things, and if you are still having the issue, I will have someone from our team reach out to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Restart your machine (yes, this does actually make a difference)</p>
<p>* Make sure that you are logging in using your Microsoft account, and as an Administrator account</p>
<p>* Go to the Family Safety desktop control panel and click "Manage settings on the Family Safety website".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you were able to get a network trace from settings.familysafety.microsoft.com.&nbsp; If you are still having the issue, that trace will help us resolve the issue, so please hold onto that or gather it again if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you are still having issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 takes forever to bring up sign-in screen</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10 on its launch date. Had a few issues with OneDrive syncing properly between two separate laptops and the cloud. Got that resolved, but after the last update I've had a new issue. Originally I thought it was just with restarting,
 powering on from completely shut down or waking from sleep. However now I realized when signing out to take me back to the sign-in screen it also has the issue. My issue is this, upon all those situations both laptops take an extremely long time to load the
 sign-in screen. I get the page where the dots keep circling in the center. I can see my mouse pointer. I can press Ctrl, Alt, Delete and get the screen with the window, wifi, ease of access and power. The first time it happened I left them in overnight and
 in the morning they were both at the sign-in screen. Another time I sat and waited over a half hour. Like I said it was after the last big update, that was meant to fix other issues, when this started. I've checked and there are no ne

I'm having the same problem. I have avast installed on my unit and it updated itself. I got the usual message that in order for the update to be fully installed the lapper had to be restarted and after an&nbsp; hour, I have yet to see the sign in screen. What's

            <p>Please forgive me if I seem to have a bad attitude; I've had this same problem on two different hard drives. You mentioned "hours" --- how about days?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody on any forum Google has sent me to seems to have been successfully helped with this boot time issue.</p>
<p>Please, I've tried all kinds of tools and "tricks" to fix this issue. I replaced one hard drive, two power supplies and a more efficient case. &nbsp;I have tried the procedure that you MS reps have suggested. I am frustrated almost to the point of wanting to
 go back to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got any more suggestions?</p>

            <p>I am having the exact same problem. For me it takes about 2-3 hours before I get the login screen. Once I login all looks okay, its just the amount of time it takes to get me the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that I am seeing this after I changed ownership of my C: drive to myself as compared to the default "TrustedInstaller" account. Although I have changed it back to "TrustedInstaller" but the damage is done. Windows 10 just takes for ever now to get
 me that login screen.<br />

            <p>I also have the exact same issue, here in March 2016.&nbsp; It started after an automatic windows update.&nbsp; Microsoft answer desk tried but couldn't figure it out and sent me to the motherboard manufacturer AS Rock to check the boot sequence.&nbsp; Well that was nothing
 as the machine is set to boot from the drive with Microsoft installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next try with the answer desk and nothing resolved again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I noticed with further web research&nbsp;there may be an issue with the video drivers not up to date from NVidia.&nbsp; I updated and am still struggling with this issue and the 3 hour spinner until
 the log in screen comes on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is horribly frustrating.&nbsp; The auto update feature now makes me want to go back to windows 8.1, where I was a good steward in managing my updates weekly.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the not a good&nbsp;user experience when updates can put you into such a quagmire.</p>

<h3> mr_boyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Login with cloud accounts</h2>
                    <p>I rebuilt one of my Windows 10 computers.</p>
<p>The computer has full network and internet access through accounts added a couple days ago.</p>
<p>I added a new users by email address (both a gmail address and live.com address).</p>
<p>The new&nbsp;users cannot login. The error says that the computer has to be on the internet the first time.</p>
<p>As stated, the computer is online. </p>
<p>To eliminate issue with the single device&nbsp;, I added the users to a second&nbsp;Windows 10 device, also online.</p>
<p>The new users cannot login. The error says that the computer has to be on the internet the first time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have 2 conclusions. </p>
<p>A: The authentication service in the cloud is down and MS isn't reporting it anywhere (no way to validate)</p>
<p>B: My local network is configured in such a way that everything is working except getting to the authentication service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone see this before or have any ideas on how to isolate or solve the issue? It's really annoying for a computer to tell you it needs to be online when it already is.</p>

            If you have no bootable media to use in the event of a problem no boot scenario with you system, in addition to the Acronis backup suggested by contributor Elizabeth23, I would make yourself a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP Media required) and
 a Hiren's Boot CD for use in an emergency.<br />
<br />
After creates same, it would not hurt to test each to be sure you can boot on them.&nbsp; You don't have to "do" anything - just be sure they work.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hiren's Boot CD</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (a sizable download, but worth it)<br />
<br />
To make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD, do this:<br />
<br />
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>

<h2>            How do I launch Windows Movie Maker in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Dell XPS desktop that came with Windows 8 preinstalled.&nbsp; I downloaded Windows Movie Maker from Microsoft.com and after installation, I received the message 'Windows Essentials 2012 has successfully installed.'&nbsp; My question now, is how do I launch

    <title>Xbox&#39;s Com Bans Feels More Like Anti-Free Speech Than Safety - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox&#39;s Com Bans Feels More Like Anti-Free Speech Than Safety</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello fellow Xbox gamers, I am a former Ambassador, an alpha build tester, a 15 year Xbox Live user, I always leave feedback for updates, I always report bugs, I have an unhealthy habit of me wanting to play competitively but dropping it to help new players
 out, and I feel as though I've been treated unjustly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is a reason why in laws (in this case rules, code of conduct) there's no zero tolerance policies where "if you do it, your done" because that's not justice. If you hit someone it's not instantly assault, if it was it would be unjust, because things
 are situational. It could have been self-defense, but in this system no reasons good enough and it doesn't matter because the innocent are punished as well, and although this system delivers safety it does unjust things like suspending both parties.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now that I showed the flaws of this system, its self-explanatory why myself and most people feel like it limits my freedom on Xbox and is a hindrance, so let me explain my exact situation (there's more than one but I will only use one for this point) that
 has made me feel this way.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A while ago, I was playing a game with my fiancee who was upset about our recent miscarriage. She got spammed by two people for not doing well, she was being harassed and called horrible things for no reason and her being in an already really upset state
 she cried, so I defended her.&nbsp; While doing so I did not use anything personal against them, nor did I curse either, and I got banned for defending her (enforcement admitted it, I submitted a case review) no matter how minor/childish the insult, or what the
 circumstances are it is bannable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There's no way you can disagree with me that I am in the wrong in any way especially morally but yet there are still people who will try to justify it. I was screwed over by the enforcement team and so were others due to there strict rules on speech and
 zero tolerance policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Which is another thing, besides how they handle enforcement action maybe those reasons shouldn't exist at all because I hate how limited my words are on Xbox Live because of the many other options where my words are not such as; PSN and Steam. They don't
 have nearly as much of strict policy, you'd have to be hateful to get com banned on their platform opposed to here where petty insults or phrases would.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Look at what other manufacturers that are ahead of you are doing and take note enforcement team and Xbox. I am fed up with how unjustly I have been treated and how limited my freedom has become (Com bans were extremely infrequent and hard to get on 360)
 so goodbye fellow Xbox gamers hopefully I have your support! ~ Datan</p>

<p>Hi there King Ownage XV&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK I understand you have some annoyance with being some sort of comms ban over certain subjects, The enforcement team actually says the code of conduct evolves over time, so it down to the community ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in your example about someone being assaulted and a zero tolerance policy is not really that clear, Normally the give a small one depending on what was said or action that was taken by the person who might have broken CoC (Not my place to say if they
 did or not ect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear about you and your fiancée&nbsp;miscarriage and hope you are both in good health and are recovering both physically and mentally from a really tragic event. I can see why you would defend your fiancée honor, but cases like that are not worth
 lowering yourself to to these people behavior and manners, specially due to a rather tragic and upsetting time for yourself and your partner. Even Insults are against code of conduct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each case is different and each case is handled like that from I have seen, From a 3 then a week, then 2 weeks then a month ect. Seems they do try to say in a polite way "please don't do it again". But there is a few things that context does matter and even
 enforcement team do ask for more context sometimes. They even allow players to appeal and give more context to what happened and to apologize if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can only wish you and your fiancée a more enjoying time in the near future no matter what system you play on. Please take care and happy gaming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are aware that you sound like a robot repeating stuff a 14 year Xbox live player already knows some of which isn't even relevant. I read the code of conduct start to finish and I know nothing can be changed about a verdict once its made, I never even
 said I was here to get it appealed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm here for a change, rules are rules but if those rules are unjust they should be changed and I have a right to voice my opinion and that's what I'm here doing. Your counter argument cannot be "rules are rules" to how unjustly I was treated or to why things
 should stay the way they are. To disagree with me is to say I was wrong for defending my fiancee and I deserved to get banned which is immorally wrong and I'm not even willing to consider that an opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many fellow ambassadors of mine are giving helpful replies but this one looks like a way to get your score up rather than to actually help. But thank you for replying anyways, hope you had a good day.</p>

<p>Thank you, this reply felt more helpful. I will definitely do something on Xbox Ideas. However I do not need to be an expert to tell when something is wrong or a judge to know if a regulation or rule isn't just. No one does, sorry if that was the impression
 you got, I just know I was wronged in my situation and it shouldn't happen again or with anyone else. Thank you for the link, have a good day.</p>

    <title>1.5 TB hdd that is showing up as a 500 gb drive after running windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samuel_dean  say:</h3>
<h2>            1.5 TB hdd that is showing up as a 500 gb drive after running windows check disk on it</h2>
                    As stated in the title I have a 1.5 TB western digital drive, ntfs&nbsp;formatting, now showing up as a 500 GB drive after running windows 7, 64-bit, check disk on it, which showed no errors or bad sectors on the drive. It is even showing up in the my bios(using
 an elitegroup mother board) as a 500 gb drive now. I have already tried running check disk again,&nbsp;formatting, rebuilding/writing the partition table, and deleting and rewriting the Master table file, but it is still showing up as a 500 GB drive. Tried using
 a few&nbsp;different&nbsp;diagnostic tools, one showed that the missing 1 TB turned into a FAT12 format, but it was unable to recover, delete or re-format that sector. Programs/tools that I have tried thus far; windows cmd commands, testdisk 6.14, WinDig(from western
 digital) , hdat2, and hdd capacity restoring tool.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A few other side notes, &nbsp;It is a sata 2 drive hooked up to a sata 2 port tried 2&nbsp;different&nbsp;cables for both that and power, disabled and re-enabled SMART on it. The drive is about a year and a half old and had been showing up and working as a 1.5 TB drive
 for all of that time, up till now. Also the hdd is not making any strange sounds and the 500 GB that are there seem to work perfectly fine. Plus there were no errors in eventviewer&nbsp;from before or after the check disk ran. The important data on it was backed
 up so not worried about&nbsp;recovering&nbsp;the&nbsp;information&nbsp;too much. This drive was used for storage used fairly&nbsp;often and no operating systems have been on this drive. Also I&nbsp;initially&nbsp;ran check disk on it because I was about to defrag it and wanted to make sure
 everything was working ok before I did it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly&nbsp;appreciated&nbsp;because I am stumped and don't want to have to buy a new drive.</div>

It sounds like an odd hardware failure, but I would look at the detailed SMART data first and see what it shows using a program like the one below.<br />

            <p>Hello Samuel,</p>
<p>My first question - what type file system is the drive formatted for? It has to be formatted as an NTFS file system to take advantage of size limitation restrictions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Windows Explorer, right-click on the drive in question, select "Properties", and on the first page (the General tab), a few rows down it says "File System". What file system is listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If its not NTFS you need to reformat the drive as an NTFS drive (you'll lose all data when you do).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

Sorry you are correct there are no jumpers, had a long night. Disk&nbsp;management&nbsp;sees it as a 465.77 GB capacity "healthy" ntfs drive. &nbsp;And yes I also deleted the partition and remaking once with disk management and once with miniTool partition wizard. And testdisk
 6.14-WIP was what I used to rebuild the partition table&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk</a>&nbsp;, also was the only one that can see the rest of the drive (the 1 TB of FAT12) that is invisible
 to every thing else including my mother board&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Still looking over smart data, but the Smart extended Self-test log version: 1 showed &nbsp;no errors logged.</div>

<div>And yes the drive was NTFS before 1TB went missing and it is NTFS again now after reformation a few times. But it is still only showing 500GB capacity where as before I ran checkdisk it was 1.5 TB.</div>

            <p>Hello Samuel,</p>
<p>OK. My next thought, based on my own direct experiences with Windows Disk Management, is to not trust that its gotten it right. I'd suggest another, 3rd party application, the freeware program EaseUS Partition Master Home Edition (here:
<a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partition-tool.com/personal.htm</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As just one example, my external data drive was formatted by Windows, but subsequently Windows couldn't "find" the drive (it cease to be listed). Easeus&nbsp;found the drive as "unallocated space" and by reformatting the drive,&nbsp;corrected the problem. I'd suggest
 you try that application and see what it tells you the drive is formatted as, what size, etc. I'd also suggest reformatting it using the Easeus program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<div>Yes I have tried third party programs to re-partition the drive, and just now tried easeUS and it was also unable to see or interact with the missing storage space on the drive. I am assuming GTS-NJ is correct in that it is just some weird hardware failure.</div>

The 1 TB drive showed as a 39&nbsp;GBs drive with the rest of the space showing as unallocated space in windows disk management. Merely deleting the partition and re-partitioning fixed the problem.. Thanks for your help...

None of these options (except sending in for repair) has worked for me. Please repair this asap, otherwise the surface is rather useless

With all respect, but I believe you misunderstood my statement. The problem is not resolved at all, since the touch screen still does not work with the latest update, and reappears if I update again. Sticking to &nbsp;an outdated software version and stopping all
 further updates for a rather new device can't be a serous solution offered by Microsoft.

<h3> nikix55  say:</h3>
<h2>            My computer can&#39;t run movies</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I need help. Yesterday I downloaded a movie from zamunda. I very rarely watch films on my laptop. I use windows 10. As I said yesterday I downloaded a movie and when I opened nothing happened. Well, I opened&nbsp;it with BS player and yes, it does open
 but there is no sound or picture. I restarted my computer and downloaded the newest BS player version and I downloaded&nbsp;another move and nothing changed. My laptop can run a lot of games so I did not think that one film will be a problem for it. Can you help
 me, please? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Roberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying me.</p>
<p>I just checked the file.I am trying to play&nbsp;AVI file(.avi).</p>
<p>Yes, I downloaded different film form a different source and again there was no sound and no picture. But on my second&nbsp;laptop, I downloaded the same file and it could run it so I think that the problem is not from the file, it forms the laptop.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I tried to restart my computer, downloaded the newest version of BS player, checked my laptop with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware and with Windows defender but after all these steps&nbsp;nothing seems to help. My laptop still cannot run movies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">There is no error message.&nbsp;</p>

            Download VLC player and see if that will play it for you. VLC plays mostly all of the available file types.

<p style="text-align: justify">Thank you for the quick response. There might be a software conflict, a corruption in system files or the codec is missing that prevents the film from playing. Before we go to a more in-depth troubleshooting, we suggest stopping<br />
non Microsoft services from running by doing a <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot.</a></strong></em> Try to play the film on the built-in<strong>
 Movies &amp; TV app for Windows 10.</strong> If it does play, the codec on the BT player that recognizes the file might be corrupted. If it doesn't play, we'll do something else.</p>

<p>Hello Niki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’d like to confirm if the issue that you’ve encountered when playing movies on your Windows 10 computer is already resolved. If yes, we encourage that you share the information that fixed it. This would be a great help for other
 Community members if they encounter the same concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, we suggest that you <strong>update the drivers</strong> on your computer from the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. This is to determine if the issue is not related to it. To do this, you may follow the steps provided in this article on how to
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Update drivers in Windows 10">update drivers in Windows 10</a></strong></span></em>.
 Once you’re on the page, you may proceed with the steps, and then complete the process. After updating all the drivers on your computer, you may check if you’re able to use your computer properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’ll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>Hi Joseph Ban,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick reply! I updated all the drivers form the Device Manager but nothing changed. I don't know what the issue can be but I think for reinstalling my computer. The last time my computer was reinstalled was a few years ago, maybe four or even
 more. Before that, my i5 was replaced with new because it was damaged and from then my computer was a bit slower than before. And from then it was never reinstalled again. It was cleaned up a year ago and for a long period, it was with better performance than
 before the cleanup. And by clean up I mean it was opened and it was cleaned from the dust. Should I reinstall it? If I should, can you please tell me how t reinstall it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Niki</p>

<p>Hi Niki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to reinstall your Windows 10, we suggest that you check and follow the steps provided by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> on his <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">article</a></strong>.
 It is important to back up your personal data and files to an external hard drive, USB thumb drive, or cloud location (such as OneDrive) before you begin any reinstall of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>
