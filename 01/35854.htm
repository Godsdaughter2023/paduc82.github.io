<p>
</p><p>I would like you to know that this option is not available in Windows 10, you can only pin the websites to start menu. To do this, go the settings menu and click on 'Pin to start'. If you want to create a desktop shortcut, you can try the work around of
 opening the same webpage through Internet Explorer and then creating a desktop shortcut. Go to settings menu in Edge browser and then click on 'Open in Internet Explorer' to open any website you are currently viewing in Internet Explorer.</p>

            <p>Actually, I have the same question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added a Toolbar that contains all my favorite programs so they always appear in the same place. If you pin a program to the toolbar, the icon goes away or moves around when you run that program. If I want to open a second instance of a browser or excel
 for example, I want that button to be in the same place every time and have 1 click access.</p>
<p>I'd like to add Microsoft Edge to that group. (I always kept Chrome and IE in that toolbar before.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can't be done, then I probably won't be using Edge since as I said above, I like to start my favorite programs with just one click. The way it is now I'd have to click on the start, find it there visually, move my cursor there and click on it. 4 steps
 vs 1.</p>

            Another way around it is to minimize your browser, right click on your desktop screen and hit create new shortcut, copy and paste the site address.&nbsp; Not saving a lot of steps but if you don't want to work in IE.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            Yes! Right click on a blank area of desktop and select 'New' then 'Shortcut' and paste the URL copied from the EDGE address bar in edge.&nbsp; Don't forget to give the shortcut a easy name to remember why you did this! Yeah it's a drag... and that's why I'm
 using Chrome more than ever until MS gets EDGE more realistic and functional.

<h2>            How can I get the PlayReady update to complete on Windows 8 Pro with Media Center&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using my Windows 8 PC to watch TV everyday since Windows 8 was released. I have had no problems up until yesterday when trying to watch live tv media center states and update to PlayReady was incomplete and I will not be able to watch TV until
 the update is complete. Upon trying to update it will fail and ask if I want to try again. I am using an ATI CableCARD tuner to watch TV. I have tryed uninstalling playready and media center and reinstalling and have had no luck. This is very frustrating as
 I use media center almost every day to watch TV.

            Hello,
<div>Thanks for the reply, I had tried all the solutions in that thread and none of them worked for me. Actually, disabling the Windows Media Center Receiver Service allowed PlayReady to update, but after restarting media center the same error popped up again.
 I did get it working again though, I did a system refresh (In Change PC Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Advanced Startup) and everything started working again. Thanks again for posting this suggestion, I hope that between your reply and what worked for me other people
 can solve this issue on there own computers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edit: To further clarify the steps I took to fix this</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Go to the charms bar and click settings</div>
<div>2. Click on Change PC Settings near the bottom</div>
<div>3. Click General</div>
<div>4. Click Restart Now under Advanced Startup</div>
<div>5. Click Troubleshoot</div>
<div>6. Click Refresh you PC</div>
<div><br />
<div>After this completed Media Center would play live TV with no problems.</div>

<h2>            Safe Exam Browser Stress Testing&#47;Changes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working for a company who is stress testing a safe exam browser. The idea of this browser is that it locks down the device at hand. We found a way to make it so students could press the Ease of Access button to launch google chrome.&nbsp; Simply changing
 the name of google chrome to the ease of access file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need to do the same for the wifi pane. We are running Windows 10. I need to be able to change the name of google chrome to the wifi pane name so it launches chrome when I press the network/wifi button when I press CTRL+ALT+DEL and get to the options screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            Hello ChrisWall13 - 
<br />
<br />I'm not sure that it's possible to do that. It sounds like an attempt to bypass security settings in Safe Exam Browser. The whole purpose of Safe Exam Browser is to prevent access to any other programs while someone is logged into the browser.
<br />
<br />What is the reason for needing to make such changes?

<p>The interesting thing is I dragged the Blank Tile from start Menu to Desktop and the tile changed to showing all logo's and info , so the Bug must be in the Start UI ?</p>

<h2>            Games re-start in the middle of a game</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been playing Solitaire daily challenge for some time now and recently I have been having a problem.</p>
<p>If I start either Tripeaks or Pyramid, soemetimes I am half way through the game and the screen goes black and the game re-sets itself to start again.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's OK and I can finish a game, but other times it does it quite a few times.</p>
<p>I have closed the app and restarted it and sometimes it's OK and sometimes it does the same thing.</p>
<p>Would this be a problem with my video card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 pro 64 bit, with 5Gb ram</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Nvidia GeForce 315 graphics card and a while ago I updated with the latest driver and had this report:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver Management has concluded the process to add Service nvlddmkm for Device Instance ID PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_0A22&amp;SUBSYS_1141174B&amp;REV_A2\4&amp;15EA036&amp;0&amp;0008 with the following status: 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a stop code in the past, but this was before I updated the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop Code: Video TDR Failure and what failed was the nvlddmkm.sys file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is a problem with my graphics card, but as nothing else on the computer gives a problem I was hoping it may be something to do with Solitaire?</p>

            I have had the same problem, starting recently with the Win 10 update. I've tried running the troubleshooter, uninstalling and re-installing Solitaire, and resetting the app from Settings.

</p><p>After running the troubleshooter I still had problems today, so I uninstalled the app, and restarted the computer to be sure there was a clean re-boot.</p>
<p>I downloaded the app and was informed I owned the app and then I installed it.</p>
<p>It then restored the used data.</p>
<p>I have used Solitaire and had no problems, but I will be monitoring it over the next few days and will post either with good news or not good news.</p>

<p>Have just played tripeaks and the situation is the same, I get part way through the game and the screen goes black with some writing for the game still showing and I had to close the app.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you uninstall your graphics driver completely and reinstall it. Based on the thread, you already uninstalled the app so it rules out the possibility that the game files are corrupted. I would suggest you contact your OEM or Nvidia so
 that they can also check it on their end and maybe get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If they can resolve the issue, please do post it here so that others will have an idea as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and more power!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been trying several things:</p>
<p>I contacted Nvidia who gave me instructions to do a complete uninstall of their drivers, in safe mode, which I did.</p>
<p>I re-installed the drivers with a clean install.</p>
<p>The fault was still the same.</p>
<p>I decided to uninstall the Nvidia drivers completely again in safe mode.</p>
<p>I restarted the computer in normal mode without the Nvidia drivers being installed and played Pyramid and the fault is still the same. It resets the game to the start point, if I continue to play, the next time it goes to a black screen with white words
 which are part of the game screen but I cannot do anything, so have to exit the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to check, I looked at the drivers assigned to the graphics card in device manager and they are all Windows drivers, so the fault can't be Nvidia drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have had a BSOD with the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">nvlddmkm.sys file being the problem is there something I can do about that?</span></p>
<p><br />
In the properties of the Driver details for the Graphics card this is the info provided</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Provider: &nbsp;NVIDIA</p>
<p>Driver Date: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;30/05/2016</p>
<p>Driver Version: &nbsp; &nbsp;9.18.13.4196</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, I have only recently had this problem, about 2 weeks, and before I could play without anything going wrong. I know Windows did an update that changed the appearance of the start button screen popup, but can't be sure this update was the
 start of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems that the culprit is the Anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you the steps provided there to remove the update. Or maybe you can also posts there and maybe get some other inputs regarding the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, the drivers are not the issue here and we may need to check for other options.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a NVIDia GeForce GTS 250, currently running driver version 341.95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait to see if there is a fix either through another Win 10 update or a new graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This hasn't been a big problem for me. In the past week, only one of the daily challenges reset (TriPeaks, October 15th). I haven't noticed any problems with other programs.</p>

<h2>            Account login problems on Xbox</h2>
                    <p>As of recently I tried logging into my account and it prompted I get a parent/guardian to sign despite me being in no families/account under 18. The only account available to sign in for me was my own account, and upon putting in my password it sends me
 back into the parent/guardian sign in screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR: Endless parent/guardian logins on own account won’t let me login</p>

<p>Well my problem is I’ve never needed a parent/guardian sign in (until recently for some reason), and if the DOB on the account can’t be changed, the Xbox considered my account a parent account when trying to get a parent/guardian sign in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do sign in using the same account on the parent/guardian screen it just puts me back to the password screen.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 notifications and alarm horribly broken - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 notifications and alarm horribly broken</h2>
                    <p>Ever since one of the recent updates, the notification system on my computer is completely broken. Notifications don't show up until hours after they've been triggered and sometimes even days.&nbsp; This wouldn't bother me much if the same update hadn't also
 broken the alarm feature. Since the sounding of the alarm is actually tied to a notification that pops up, from one day to the next, my alarm stopped going off in the morning because the notification just doesn't show up.</p>
<p>One thing I've noticed is that restarting the Windows Explorer task will immediately show all notifications and sound all alarms that have been triggered earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can imagine, this is extremely annoying since it's now a 50/50 chance whether or not I'll wake up in the morning to go to work. It worked perfectly fine before. Why try to fix something that wasn't broken?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution to this?</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Audio Device &#124; &#34;Listen to Music&#34; link not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently purchased a new set of Bluetooth headphones I'd like to use with my laptop. They seem to pair just fine in my devices, but when I click into "Services" and click on the "Listen To Music", nothing happens. I've also attempted to connect to the
 headphones via the "Playback Devices" where I see them listed as both a "Headset" and "Headphones" as well. One thing I have noticed is that every time I install or reinstall the devices, or restart my computer, there's is an issue with "Bluetooth Peripheral
 Device" that the driver won't update correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've played with multiple settings, reset to default, restarted the computer as well as reconnect the device to no avail. Any ideas what I can do to get things working?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

            Hello Bradley,<br />
<br />
We hope that the Community can provide ideas that can help you meet the concern.<br />
<br />
Noting the troubleshooting you've completed on your end, run the Hardware and Devices built-in troubleshooter to sort the issue with your Bluetooth audio device. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter:
<br />
<br />
1. Go to the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Located at the upper-right side of the window is the search box, type <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>, then click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>. <br />
4. Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> to start the scan. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.<br />
<br />
Check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Moreover, make sure all drivers are all up to date. We recommend manually downloading the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website to make sure the one installed on your PC is updated. Outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issues such as this
 one. <br />
<br />
It is best to seek further assistance with the device manufacturer's support site for a more established workaround.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you require any further assistance.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

    <title>fail user login after windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fief61  say:</h3>
<h2>            fail user login after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Today I upgraded my sony vaio from w7 to w10. Upgrade went well and fairly speedy (took about an hour). Got the user login screen with login name, entered the password and then we had wait for further installation. Was told by the computer that installation
 took a little longer than usual but still ok. Then the screen started to flicker with approx 1 second intervals. It showed the new windows start button in the left&nbsp; corner but still the old VAIO desktop screen. The desktop shows different contents with each
 interval: sometimes with and sometimes without icons. When the cursor is on the (empty) task bar it's the round 'in progress' circle but it's an arrow on the desktop.</p>
<p>Startbutton does not respond when clicking on it. I did manage to get the task manager but it did not show any active software, other than the processor going waves: up and down.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have browsed but can't find anything remotely similar on the net. Get the impression that upgrade was fine but that problem is with user logon, it somehow gets stuck in personal logon mode. How can I sort this out? Could make a movie and post it to show
 exactly what occurs as screenshots are not possible to make. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;I request you to follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If we see the screen flickering after sign-in there are two possible causes – apps causing Explorer to crash, or display driver
 issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To start, press this key combination:&nbsp; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If this opens Task Manager and that window is NOT flickering:<br />
The likely cause is Software Compatibility issue causing Explorer.exe to crash repeatedly.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Use the File, Run option in Task Manager to open additional tools as-needed. Be sure to check the box to run tools as Administrator.
 These could include:<br />
appwiz.cpl:&nbsp; Opens Programs and Features<br />
compmgmt.msc: Opens <br />
Computer Management<br />
cmd.exe </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. You can search for crash events in the Event Logs(Type "eventvwr" in Run command) and find if any third party DLLs are the
 faulting module in the Explorer,.exe crashes Or uninstall software that is likely to include shell
<br />
extensions. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. If removing software does not resolve the issue, use these commands to repair Windows:
<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image <br />
/restorehealth<br />
sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We have reports that removing these apps help resolve the issue:

Other AV solutions <br />
iCloud</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If Task Manager is flickering, or it didn’t open, proceed with display driver troubleshooting:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The likely cause is a display driver or display hardware issue.
</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Use the same steps here as for Black Screen issues – if dual chipset, disable built-in graphics, if still flickers, try with
 only the other chipset enabled. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. If this does not work, or there is only a single chipset, uninstall the device and remove the driver software.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Uninstall and Drivers:</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Search device, right click on it and then select “Uninstall”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “Delete
 the driver software for this device” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and then restart the computer if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the restart, please go ahead with the next steps to install the latest drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</span></p>

                    How do you apply and activate a new XP Pro License Key to a new hard drive cloned from an older drive that had a different previous XP Pro license key?&nbsp; I tried using the repair installation feature.&nbsp; Everything seemed to install okay, the request for
 Activation box appears, but&nbsp;the system boots to a blank blue&nbsp;screen&nbsp;and&nbsp;Windows Activation is not accessible.&nbsp; The system boots to safe mode and most programs are accessible.&nbsp; The system will not boot to safe mode with network connection and activation is
 blocked.&nbsp; I can't do phone activation because the numbers are not visible on the blank blue screen.&nbsp; At the end of&nbsp;the attempted activation sequence, the system hangs on a Windows XP logo with a black screen and "please wait".

            Thank you for the quick reply.&nbsp; I should have tried this method rather than the repair installation, which went sour.&nbsp; I tried your suggestion, running the tool&nbsp;in safe mode, which is the only way I can get a visible desktop, but the tool will not work
 in safe mode.&nbsp; Which leads me back to my problem that the system will boot in nomal mode (I can hear the Windows boot up chime), the popup box appears&nbsp;asking if I want to&nbsp;activate Windows and when I click on yes, my system goes to a blank blue screen except
 for the mouse pointer.&nbsp; I was trying to avoid a complete reinstall, but it is now looking like that may be my only option.

<h2>            Windows 10 print spooler delay - a real fix needed</h2>
                    <p>I hope that someone can help me. &nbsp;I am really frustrated with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an HP officejet 8600. &nbsp;We print to it from windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the system, windows 10 is "up to date". &nbsp;That's all the info I can find on the system because it is very difficult to find information in windows 10 compared to windows 7. &nbsp;I used to be able to figure everything out in windows 7, now I am just
 blind in windows 10. &nbsp;Can someone tell me what path to use to find the system information?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Anyway, every time I print a document, I have to wait 15 minutes before I can print another document. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>1) I print a document (and actually get the printed copy from the printer)</p>
<p>2) I try to print another document, but queue shows that the first document is still printing.</p>
<p>3) After 15 minutes, I get an error message that the first document can't be printed.</p>
<p>4) At that point, the second document prints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>-Cancelling the first print job does not work - it just delays the ability to print a second job even more.</p>
<p>-Stopping and re-starting the spooler, but I can't do this every time I want to print a stupid document.</p>
<p>-Downloading a document and opening/printing it with Edge.</p>
<p>-I have downloaded the most recent driver for the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not an issue when I had a laptop that used windows 7 - I was able to print to this printer with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating that I wish I could go back to windows 7.</p>

<p>Here are my responses:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes on your PC prior to this issue?</span>
<ul>
<li>No</li></ul>
</li><li><span>Since when have you been experiencing the issue?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>Since the May, 2017 timeframe</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span>Are you getting any error messages when trying to perform certain actions? If so, what are these actions and what is the particular error message?</span>
<ul>
<li>As noted in the original post, this is what happens when I try to print documents.
<ul>
<li>I print a document (and actually get the printed document off the printer)</li><li>I try to print another document, but <strong>queue shows that the first document is still printing&nbsp;</strong>even though the document has completely printed out.</li><li>After 15 minutes, I get an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">error message</span> that the first document can't be printed.</li><li>At that point, the second document prints.</li><li>If I try to print a 3rd document, I have to wait 15 to 20 minutes before I get the error message again and then the 3rd document will print.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li><span>Have you recently installed any software?</span>
<ul>
<li><span>No</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am going to copy/paste the "things I have tried" so that you don't ask it again:</strong></p>
<p>-Cancelling the first print job does not work - it just delays the ability to print a second job even more.<br />
-Stopping and re-starting the spooler, but I can't do this every time I want to print a stupid document.<br />
-Downloading a document and opening/printing it with Edge.<br />
-I have downloaded the most recent driver for the printer.<br />
</p>
<p>I haven't had to print a lot of documents until this summer, therefore, it hasn't been an issue until now. &nbsp;Currently, I am able to avoid the issue by printing from my iPad. &nbsp;But that is not a long term solution.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Leslie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue has something to do with the printer's configuration. As you have already uninstalled and reinstalled the driver, we recommend that you contact the printer manufacturer for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to contact us if you need assistance with Windows.</p>

<p>I do not understand how the issue could be related to the printer configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) this issue does not occur when i print from my ipad</p>
<p>2) we did not make any changes to the printer that caused this to happen. &nbsp;I installed the latest driver
<strong><em>after</em></strong> the issue started to occur.</p>
<p>3) i have been instructed to stop and re-start the print spool when this happens. &nbsp;That is a fix that works (but is not something that i can do 10 times per day). &nbsp;That would indicate to me that the problem is the windows 10 print spool.</p>
<p>4) when i queried on open issueswith the print spool, i found pages and pages of issues (so it seems to be an ongoing problem for microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>we are looking into purchasing new pc's for our business, but i am really reluctant to purchase a pc with windows 10 on it.</p>

<h2>            dism fails to fix corruption with 0x800f081f error</h2>
                    <p>Background: HP ENVY Desktop 750-514 running Windows 10 build 17134.112<br />
System has experienced some problems in the past but I was able to fix them with DISM.<br />
<br />
Current Problem: Windows update KB4338819 runs and results in a stopcode of 0xc000021a. Automatic Repair does not help. I am able to use DISM with the /revertpendingactions option to undo the changes and boot the system. However, I cannot repair apparent corruption
 with DISM.<br />
<br />
Most DISM commands complete successfully, but restorehealth results in errors (see below). The problem seems to be the inability to read the install.wim file. Most help sites recommended using the install.wim file but my DVD only had an install.esd file. Per
 the recommendation at https://www.wintips.org/how-to-extract-install-esd-to-install-wim-windows-10-8/ I extracted the correct install.wim for my Windows 10 Home edition and have been using that.<br />
<br />
More details are below. Any help would be appreciated.<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But since you've had chronic corruption, remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Greg, <br /><br /> as long as it's the latest version of Windows from media creation tool, then there's no reason you can't clip to mount the ISO file right click setup to run as administrator.<br /><br /> Should be fixed in about an hour or less. Any longer means it's choking on More serious corruption.

<h2>            Crackling, Stuttering, Freezing, Blue Screen and Automatic Shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Dell Precision M6500 laptop. I've been experiencing several issues with my laptop. I'm streaming videos, movies etc., everything will be working fine. Then a crackling sound starts (however, the actual audio "voices, sounds" are fine) and then the
 video starts "stuttering". I've also been getting the "blue screen of death"--An Error Ocurred, we are collecting some info. and we will restart it for you message. The screen has started flickering in and out. Sometimes the video will just freeze. And finally,
 out of nowhere the computer will just shut itself down--no error messages or warnings; just screen goes black and computer shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a diagnostics and got two error codes. First one is: Error Code 0147; Msg. Error Code 20000-0147; Msg. Optical Drive 0-self test-OPU test failed. The second is: Error Code 0147; Msg. Error Code 20000-0147; Msg. Hard Drive 0-self test log contains previous
 errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have BIOS Version: A07 (specifically, Phoenix ROM BIOS PLUS Version 1.10 A07). There is an A10 Version available but I don't know if I should try to update it or not? Would this even be what is causing my issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            Hi Melvin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would always have the latest BIOS version.  Just be sure to follow the instructions and prompts closely and assure it cannot lose power which can be fatal.
<br />
<br />But some other things to try:
<br />
<br />1) Did you do the long test on hard drive once it prompted errors?  Do a more definitive Test on the hard drive with bootable diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />If the hard drive is failing I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best upgrade you can give your PC - lightning fast, better than a new higher end PC without one.
<br />
<br />Follow the included instructions or a video you find for your model via Google to swap it in and do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />2) If not Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Next Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />

            Hi Melvin,  to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>Hello Dave and Greg, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you both for taking the time to help me. I actually resolved my issues by contacting NVIDIA about my graphics driver. I install an updated version of my "display adapter" and everything is fine now. Also, I installed "CCleaner" and that seemed to fix
 some issues as well. I hope this information will help someone else out in the future.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you mentioned that you have recently changed your password from the other email provider, it caused to break the authorization
 of your Microsoft account to retrieve the emails from your other account. Therefore, you need to
<b>remove</b> and re-add the&nbsp;email address to your&nbsp;Microsoft account to receive those&nbsp;messages again.&nbsp;Please&nbsp;set up your Microsoft account to receive email messages&nbsp;from your other accounts by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to your
<b>Hotmail</b> <b>Inbox</b> page.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on
<b>Options</b> (located on the upper right corner of your screen, next to a question mark icon) then
<b>More Options</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. From the Hotmail Options screen under the category “<b>Managing your account”</b>, click
<b>Sending/ receiving email from other accounts</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Remove the email account that contains your old password by clicking on the
<b>Remove</b> link.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on “<b>Add an email account”
</b>to receive messages from other accounts. If you wish to send messages from other accounts click on “<b>Add another account to send mail from”</b>. Fill out the necessary information then click “<b>Next”</b>. Wait for the
<b>verification message</b> that the transaction has been successful.&nbsp;To complete this process, please check and confirm by clicking on the
<b>email confirmation link</b> that will be sent to the other account that you connected to your Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the delayed response. Are you referring to the Arc touch mouse that has a reference in
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/touch-mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, I would request you to have a look at the "<strong>Note</strong>" mentioned at the very end of the article that states that you would require a Windows 8 or 8.1 PC for you to be able to use the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the model that you currently own, then it may not work with the Windows 7 laptop. In this case, please get in touch with the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hardware support</a> for more help on the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

</p>
<p>A $70 mouse and it won't work with my Windows 7 work laptop???</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here I am with my Surface Pro, using it more and more for work, but with some things that I HAVE to do on my company-supplied work&nbsp;laptop, so unfortunately I still use both.&nbsp; I'm thinking, 'Would be nice to have a mouse to use with my Surface and of course
 I could use it with my laptop too' and see this nice-looking Arc mouse that folds flat.&nbsp; It's $70 for a mouse, but oh well, Microsoft is making some innovative and high-quality accessories now with their Surface line, so I'll mention it to my wife for Christmas.&nbsp;
 Use it all weekend with my Surface and loving it.&nbsp; Get to work this morning and think 'okay, it's a Bluetooth mouse.&nbsp; I'll just pair it up... let's see now.&nbsp; Hmm, what seems to be the problem.&nbsp; Okay, no driver on the laptop.&nbsp; No problem, search online.&nbsp; See
 this post.&nbsp; WTF!?!&nbsp; Please tell me there is or will be driver or fix for this.&nbsp; This is inexcusable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I really want to see Microsoft succeed and have been a loyal supporter.&nbsp; But bullsh*t like this is why I am beginning to think Microsoft can try all they want to be like Apple, but sadly, it just isn't in the cards.</p>

            <p>It is a <strong>Surface</strong> Arc Mouse, not a PC Arc mouse, specially made to complement the Surface machines. There is no provision for it to be used with anything but a Surface.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are similar mice for PC's in general within the Microsoft range. Perhaps you could return the mouse, explaining the predicament and exchange it for a similar mouse which would work on either system type..

            <p>Mike, the only thing that makes it a <strong>Surface</strong> mouse is that it says Surface on it and is the same color.&nbsp; Other than that, it really is just a Bluetooth mouse.&nbsp; It works with any Bluetooth-enabled Windows 8 PC or laptop, so I don't think
 it's too much to ask for it to work with Windows 7, an operating system still sold and supported today.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not being backward-compatible with a standard technology like Bluetooth, for a high-end product like this&nbsp;is inexcusable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Arc touch mouse uses 2.4 GHz wireless via a USB dongle, and I really don't want to use up the one USB port on my Surface Pro for this. My only hope is that a driver for Windows 7 is released sometime soon.</p>

            <p>You seem to be defending the product and its specs, so I'll continue with this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, please explain what "special edition" means and how this would function differently with a Surface than it would any other Windows 8 laptop or tablet.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next,&nbsp;you are re-posting what was mentioned into the second post of this thread.&nbsp; I quickly learned yesterday morning that it is not compatible with Windows 7, which is what led to my shock and anger.&nbsp;
 I clearly did not read this information at the bottom of the web page before deciding this would be a great mouse for me.&nbsp; Granted, I am not completely familiar with "Bluetooth Smart Ready" but I assume it is a new BT technology.&nbsp; EVERY&nbsp;Bluetooth device I
 have ever seen or used will work with ANY Bluetooth device designed to pair with it.&nbsp; Maybe I am wrong on this, but please show me another Bluetooth mouse that will only work with certain Bluetooth laptops.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Third, follow your link to the compatibility list, click on the product (as instructed by clicking on the three dots), and select Windows 7 from the dropdown menu.&nbsp; It actually says it is compatible
 with Windows 7!!!&nbsp; So it looks like it is not even obvious to someone at Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Last, if what you say is true that there will never be a W7 driver, then I am returning it.&nbsp; Sadly, Microsoft designed a great product, but failed to make it complete and as usable as one would expect.&nbsp;
 Kind of sums up everything Microsoft does.&nbsp; Really great ideas and innovative products, but just can't quite put it all together.&nbsp; Hopefully the new CEO realizes and can make the colossal change to being a more customer-focused organization.</p>

            I got this mouse to function on my new W7 work laptop. &nbsp;I recently got a Lenovo T440s at work and wanted a nice mouse to go along with this considerably more compact laptop.
<div><br />
<div>Having done some research, I found that this device is a Bluetooth SMART or LE (Low Energy) device. &nbsp;This is what makes it slightly different than your standard mouse I believe. &nbsp;SMART or LE Bluetooth seems to be a fairly recent innovation. &nbsp;My laptop
 discovered and paired with the mouse without any issues, however the mouse still did not function.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center, hoping that it could possibly install some sort of file or driver that might wake it up to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also played around in the "Devices and Printers" panel attempting to remove and re-add the device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I finally noticed something in Devices and Printers. &nbsp;When you click on the paired, yet not working, mouse (comes up as "Arc Touch Mouse SE") an extra menu up top labelled "Bluetooth LE Services" clicking on it brings up the dialogue attached. &nbsp;Clicking
 "Try Again" brings it to life.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d229f25-d024-4715-90f8-f574920ab012" /></div>
<div><br />
<div>It works as expected, scrolling with haptic feedback works etc. &nbsp;The only issue is that when I scroll it makes this old school audible scrolling sound along with the feedback which is kind of annoying. &nbsp;It's not something you can turn off without software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other issue I have found is that if you turn the mouse off and back on again, or if it goes to sleep on its own, it won't reconnect with the computer properly on it's own. &nbsp;You have to go back to devices and open up the "Bluetooth LE services" dialogue
 again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Considering this is a travel mouse, I think I will keep it for now in the capacity it does function. &nbsp;It's not ideal, but it's good enough.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That being said, this is proof positive that this device should have no issues working with any OS as long as the computer is capable of this new Bluetooth SMART/LE standard.</div>
<div><br />

            Actually, just double clicking on the mouse in "Devices and Printers" automatically brings up this Bluetooth LE Services screen and connects to the mouse. &nbsp;I created a shortcut to this in my start menu so I can quickly reconnect the mouse when I need to.

            Anymore insight on how you accomplished this? I can't even get my surface to show up to pair. I am using an Intel 6235 N Centrino Bluetooth 4.0 which specifically is Bluetooth LE capable. I can't even get paired to make it as far as you did.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that compatibility is not directly related to the OS but to the ability of the system to connect to LE (Low Energy) bluetooth devices.</p>
<p>This may be related to your laptop's hardware (i.e. the bluetooth chipset does not support the functionality) or your drivers (the chipset might not have the latest drivers enabling LE connections loaded). From what I understand, in Windows 7, the functionality
 is not natively supported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could buy a Bluetooth dongle that supports the functionality, but you need to make sure that they provide you with the correct drivers for Windows 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the above helps.</p>

            Hi, OBXBeehive
<br />
<br />Follow these steps, I hope you can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings&gt; Applications&gt; Applications and features. From here you should look for the application in question. You will not be able to do anything unless you enter the advanced options. Here you will see an option called Reset and that, pressing it will solve the problem. Just sit down and wait for the system to do its job, then do the test to see if you have found the right solution.
<br />Another option is to reinstall the app. Yes, this can be done if you use the PowerShell (press the Windows key + S) and type the following command: get-appxpackage * Microsoft.Windows.Photos * | remove-appxpackage. Then you just have to find the app in the Store and install it again. Now that the Store is out, you can choose another of the free apps that are available to you and then use them as default apps if you do not like Photos as such.       
        </p>

            Hi OBX.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can Reset Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try reinstalling the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Some are temporarily installing the popular IrfanView photo app until MSFT gets this fixed:  <a href="https://www.irfanview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.irfanview.com/</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Is there a way of disabling the on off button on the front of the Xbox and only turn it on by the controller. I know this will cause problems later but he's already causing problems on my Xbox by turning on and off and not allowing it to turn on properly if there is a way of doing this I really would appreciate the help with it.</p><p><br /></p><p>TIA&nbsp;</p>
