<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you tried to play movies from a different website which requires Silverlight?</p>

    <title>Factory reset my pc for windows 10 not running properly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Factory reset my pc for windows 10 not running properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I want to do a factory reset for my laptop (Pluto) with upgraded windows 10 from windows 8.1 x64. However when I went to recovery to reset this PC, with option to wipe out all my files, it cannot be done. Keeps telling me windows have problem trying
 to reset your PC but never mention anything more about the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep encountering Windows update stuck at 0% with S6000rmv.dll error popping up right after I start my laptop. Does this error has anything to do with unable to get windows update? I have let it run windows update for 3 hours on my laptop, still 0%. No
 matter how many times I have tried using the net stop wuauserv method, I am still getting Windows update at 0%. Has Microsoft solved all windows update stuck issue, as I think there is a very common problem for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DLL error is also very common in windows 10 however the solution provided online does not seem to get it working anywhere. I have scan SFC, nothing found. I have run into safemode and this DLL error did not pop up in safe mode too. However, there is another
 error that pops up when in safe mode which mention about windows security, I did not know what to do next and just restart my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run AUTORUNS and there are a few boxes that are highlighted in yellow and pink. What does the color represent and thereafter what should I do next? Below is one remark when I scroll to the highlighted portion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) File not found: S6000Rmv.dll - C:\Windows\SysWOW64\Rundll32.exe S6000RMV.dll, WinMainRmv /StartStillMnt</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is SysWOW64? I did not seem to download anything or is this from Windows update? Previously I am using AV 360 Total Security and it would prompt block such rundll32.exe as it mentioned that it is malicious. If this is from Windows update, I wonder why
 is it that it is malicious? I will normally block it or upon full scan, remove with my AV 360 Total Security. Is this the reason why the file is not found? And what can I do further from here then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Malware, normally after scanning, virus files will be quarantined right? Do I have to remove those files actually? Or once quarantined my laptop is safe? I saw from another website that asks to download AVIRA/ AVG and a few other AV. I just downloaded
 AVIRA and it seems to be detecting a few more viruses that 360 Total security did not detect and I saw several are .DLL file. What are all these files and where it comes from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly I am trying to attempt to do scan and recovery with AV Avira. In the event that I am still encountering S6000Rmv.dll error, what else can I do? If I want to reset my laptop with fresh windows 10 again, how to go about it? Can I get a step by step
 instruction on how to factory reset pls... I got my windows 10 from windows 10 icon update, not from media creation tool which previously have given errors like x800...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my laptop, I have bought from my son's school at subsidized rate. No disc was given to me but there is a product key behind. So if I want to reset it back to windows 8 again, how to go about it without disc? Sorry for my lengthy email, I am not pro in
 computer so really need a proper and detailed instruction. Please help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds,</p>
<p>Wendy</p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue, but my advanced startup won't even start up at all when I select it, it acts funky like it's going to start the advanced restart, but then it just restarts normally.&nbsp;&nbsp; My reset doesn't start up at all when I select it.&nbsp; I even
 tried the fresh start and it didn't even work.&nbsp; I even got some kind of error saying something about systemio or something to that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use this computer for my work, please help ASAP.&nbsp; I'm using a Dell, and I'm running Windows 10 Creative eupdate.&nbsp;

            I have been trying to reset my pc to factory settings but have been unsuccessful as the system comes back with "this computer cannot be reset". &nbsp;I don't know why, but I suspect that it has to do with the fact that when I first set it up, I used my mother's
 info as administrator. &nbsp;When she passed, I changed my MS sign to another name and password, which took about 30 days to be official. &nbsp;I also deleted her email from google. Apparently all this might be the cause. &nbsp;Can you tell what , if anything, I can do to
 reset my PC. &nbsp;Thank you so much.

<h2>            Windows 10 task scheduler Stop On Idle End false, task being stopped.</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>i am trying to set up task that will start on PC idle and continue after idle is ceased. So user can decide wheter to close or leave it running.</p>
<p>I created task in task scheduler with "Stop if the computer ceases to be idle" unchecked. The task is still being stopped after i move pointer or push any button. History in task scheduler shows that it is being stoped due to computer not idling anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a bug.</p>
<p>In any case there is export of my task in scheduler:</p>

<h3> simon bulgacs  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reinstall&#47;Uninstall Apps that Windows 10 is saying aren&#39;t there but the Icons are&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Over the past few weeks I've noticed that Apps are no longer working. They appear muted on the Start Menu list, see image &gt;</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>When I go to the App store it says the App is installed so won't download it, see image &gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14bb31c4-3f95-42fb-94da-834b54a2d552?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/14bb31c4-3f95-42fb-94da-834b54a2d552?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I go to the App section in Settings it says the apps aren't there meaning they can't be uninstalled, repaired or reset &gt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b726156-688e-450f-83e4-0c129fdbe2eb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b726156-688e-450f-83e4-0c129fdbe2eb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Over the past few weeks this has happened to different Apps including Mail and Calendar, weather, Maps, Sticky Notes, Microsoft Photos, Messaging, etc.</span></p>
<p>If I cannot uninstall them, as they don't appear there only their Icon, how am I supposed to reinstall them when Microsoft Store is stating they are installed? This is becoming very annoying and I'm worried a Windows update is going to delete important files
 and/or break my computer. I appreciate any help anyone can offer in relation to this problem.</p>

            Hi Simon, 
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you.
<br />I suggest you to reset all default Apps:
<br />
<br />1. Type "Powershell" in Windows search bar
<br />2. Right click on "Powershell"
<br />3. Click on "Run as Administrator"
<br />4. Type :
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers | foreach {Add-AppxPackage -register "$($_.InstallLocation)\appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode}
<br />
<br />and press ENTER.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that solves your issue.       
        </p>

<p>This has reinstalled bloatware and a couple of other Microsoft Apps that I uninstalled, however not the Apps I wanted reinstalling. Some of the Microsoft Apps it has reinstalled are suffering the same problem, says they are there but they're not there.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ran it several times, while connected to the internet, while not connected to the internet, with nothing running at all.&nbsp; Same problem, says Microsoft Apps are there but when you click on them there's nothing there.&nbsp;</p>

            I would suggest you to update your system to Windows 1809 that's the last release. You can do it manually using Windows Update Assistant, that you can get here: <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799445</a> then run and follow on screen instructions.
<br />Install the update, then see if the problem is still here.

            I installed 1809 and this is when the problem started occurring.&nbsp; It also turned off some of my drivers such as Wi-fi. So I rolled back to 1803 to see if the Apps reappeared,&nbsp; they didn't. However the drivers are working with 1803.&nbsp; The problem is something
 to do with Windows updates as the Apps keep disappearing, this isn't down to anything I'm doing. I also know of people who are using 1809 with the same problem. Some have solved it by deleting specific O/S updates, but I'm of the belief those updates will
 be reinstalled by Microsoft at some point creating the same problem again. This means it's a problem with the updates themselves and not reliant on different brands or specifications of computer.

            If you rolled back, have you performed a disk clean up?
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />
<br />Once done this, please repeat the powershell procedure.
<br />
<br />However I think that something goes wrong with the previous update and so you had some problems.
<br />I would suggest you to update your OS and see if the problem with the apps are still there once done.

<h2>            Modded Lobby Accident</h2>
                    
<p>My Gamertag:&nbsp;<strong>Abyss Bam</strong><br />
Friend's Gamertag:&nbsp;<strong>Naive Krim</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Today, my friend and I went into an online game of Free For All on&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em>. Whenever the game started, the whole lobby got unlock all (all guns, all camos, all challenges completed). Neither of us knows who exactly was modding,
 but I tried turning my Xbox off to delete the gameplay and whatever I "unlocked", but when I restarted the Xbox, everything was still there. I do not want to get banned and neither does my friend, because we did not know what happened, nor who was modding.
 I called Xbox Support and they told me to post on the forums so my friend and I don't get banned/suspended for something that we did not do.</p>

<p>Content from an Xbox account in Call Of Duty games, such as guns, camouflages, challenges, can only be unlocked if your gamertag is logged on an Xbox 360 modified console.
</p>
<p>If you turned off your Xbox(Disconnect) while you were in game, by the game's standards, it DOES NOT save your progress, and it counts as a 'loss'.
</p>
<p>Anyway, your account unfortunately did get a modification.</p>
<p>I believe it's up to the game devs and Xbox Live PET to judge what exactly will happen to your account.</p>
<p>I bet you'd get a reset, maybe to level 1, or maybe to the level you were before that happened.</p>

<blockquote>what&nbsp;can I&nbsp;do to unnistall or remove a program without accessing "control panel" ?</blockquote>
<br />
<p><span>Hi Eghy:<br />
<br />
</span><span>You can run its uninstaller from its directory in<em>C:\Program Files</em>
<br />
or <em>C:\Program Files (x86)</em>. Many programs have an uninstaller exe. <br />
I mean it’s NOT exactly Windows® that removes the program from the <br />
machine when you remove it from the Control Panel. <br />
<br />
In the Windows® Registry under the following registry entry path:<br />
<em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.</em> <span>
&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Lets give you an example: <br />
</strong>If you have Mozilla® Firefox® installed then you will find it under that<br />
registry entry (the uninstall path), some programs like Microsoft® Office <br />
use a <em>Class Identifier (CLSID)</em>, here is an example of such: <br />
<br />
<em>{22B775E7-6C42-4FC5-8E10-9A5E3257BD94} <br />
</em><br />
While Mozilla® Firefox® doesn’t use such. Anyway, if you go to that<br />
registry entry and you find the Mozilla® entry, select it and on the <br />
right-side you’ll see a list of values: <br />
<br />
<strong>Example:</strong> <br />
The String value <em>“DisplayIcon”</em> represents the icon of the program, that<br />
icon you’ll find in the list of program in the Programs and Features in <br />
your Control Panel. <br />
<br />
Now each program has a Standard Value which is called <em>“UninstallString”</em>,<br />
the Program and Features in the <strong>Control Panel</strong> will check for such string<br />
value when it is executed by the user (when you open the Program and <br />
Features). <br />
<br />
The “UninstallString” represents the exe file made by the manufacturer of<br />
that program, the value in that string is then executed by the context-menu<br />
in Programs and Features, so when you right-click and choose “Uninstall”<br />
the Program and Features will execute the manufacturers exe. <br />
<br />
The Mozilla® Firefox® uninstall string holds the following value:<br />
<em>C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\uninstall\helper.exe.</em> <br />
<br />
I can keep on going and I can explain the entire connection and <br />
how the Program and Features in the Windows® Control Panel <br />
really works. <br />
<br />
<strong>*</strong>It is recommend to use the Programs and Features from <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>the Control Panel. I would like to give you a suggestion, I suggest<br />
you make a shortcut of the Programs and Features to your <br />
Desktop, thereby you do NOT need to open Windows Control <br />
Panel, just open the shortcut. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance,<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>
<p><span>Have a nice day…</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,<br />
Fisnik</span></p>

<div>You should definitely *not* do it any other way. Any such</div>
<div>uninstallation is likely to be only partial.</div>

    <title>Xbox Live Rewards Lost Credits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrleecurtis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Rewards Lost Credits</h2>
                    <p>I logged in to check the status of my Xbox Live Rewards and noticed it says I am a member since March 2016 but this isn't correct. I have been a member for a lot longer than that. I experienced a major account issue in the past (I can't remember the date) but the issue was described to me as a Microsoft Account in "limbo". This was escalated to through different severity levels and support teams and was eventually resolved. I am a regular user of the rewards scheme but it appears any past credits have been lost as my Microsoft Account Billing Info only shows one deposit (of just £1.01) in September 2015. I'm confident I do and have done all of the monthly surveys so worry that somewhere along the line some of my past credits have become lost after my account issue was resolved. Would appreciate any help clearing up this issue.</p>

            <p>Hello MrLeeCurtis,</p><p>I&nbsp;see that you opted your account out of our program back in February 2015. I do not see any forum posts indicating you to pursue this course of action, so it looks like you may have manually opted out of our program and then recently opted back in back in May. While I can recover any old pending Credits from your previous account, I am afraid that we cannot restore any other attributes from your previous account. You should see these Credits pending by the end of next week as a 5 star MyVIP event dated from last month.</p>

            The best thing you can do is reinstall the original version of Windows 10 you are licensed for and it should automatically reactivate:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.
<br />
<br />Finding your key:
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (admin)
<br />
<br />Enter the following command:
<br />
<br />wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />The product key will be revealed, copy the product key then enter it
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:

            Hi  tahanimostafa1, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot

    <title>Best of... June Releases 2011. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isturbo1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best of... June Releases 2011.</h2>
                    
<p>So what's everyone's opinion on the big June releases? If October and November get a few flops (doubtful), then this might be the best month for the 360. No doubt it will be one of the best though. I'll try to name the big ones, but this month we had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red Faction: Armageddon </li><li>Child of Eden </li><li>Duke Nukem Forever </li><li>Alice: Madness Returns </li><li>F.E.A.R. 3 </li><li>Dungeon Siege III </li><li>Shadows of the Damned </li><li>...and a few movie games for the fans of the respecting franchises... </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what's everyone's thoughts? Votes? I'm sure there are a few very pleased with this month's releases. Probably a few disappointments as well. Personally, I haven't played any of them yet, but it is looking like the best month yet for the 360. Now as soon
 as GF gets their shtuff into gear, maybe they can hurry up and send me one of these toward the top of my list, lol.</p>

<p>I picked up Alice Madness Returns but only beat the original one so far. And I just got Shadows of the Damned last night at midnight but have yet to start that either. DSIII is the only other one that interests me but with the lame multiplayer they decided
 to go with, it's not a day one buy anymore. Might pick it up down the line when I'm done with the first two games I listed.

1) Have you made any changes prior to start of this issue?<br />
2) Are you able to open different files using VLC?<br />

I would suggest you to contact the VLC support for assistance.</p>

            <p>That is very weird stuff indeed. And you're sure both parties internets are fully up and running 100%? If so you may want to reach out to the developer on twitter, or the Xbox support team and see if they can investigate this problem further for you. It's a very strange thing to be happening indeed.</p>

    <title>April Updates break symlinks&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eric g-s  say:</h3>
<h2>            April Updates break symlinks&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a directory symlink setup so that I can put games on my SSD even though the full Origin/Steam/GoG libraries are on a HDD data disk.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this month's update the symlink no is no long read correctly. I have recreated it from an elevated command prompt, but it still fails. When I double click on it it goes to the folder (although that is labelled as in E: the HDD, not C: the SSD) and
 launch the game in question all I get is "your internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not accessing the internet, just another drive on the PC. For the sake of completeness I switched off the Firewall but that did nothing. I use Defender as AV so that shouldn't affect it. What has happened in this month's updates that would affect this
 and how can I get around it?</p>

            As I am unwilling to uninstall the cumulative update - it includes updates to fix known exploited vulnerabilities - I have resorted to registry editing to point Windows to the correct location. Has no one else reported issues with symlinks after this month's
 updates?

    <title>My pc gets stuck in a Startup Repair &#38; reboot loop on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vincedarko1976  say:</h3>
<h2>            My pc gets stuck in a Startup Repair &#38; reboot loop on startup  after i did an update for windows 7.</h2>
                    My pc gets stuck in a Startup Repair &amp; reboot loop on startup after i did an update for windows 7. I should also note that this issue started just after the update when my AVG antivirus suddenly crashed because of a bad .dll file. I uninstalled it then
 rebooted, but when I went to type in my password to log in nothing happened...as if keyboard had died. I reboot it again and that's when I got stuck in the startup repair loop.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The PC is an ASUS model CM1630 with a factory installed Windows 7 32-bit OS. So I do not have an original windows OS CD. I also have no backup boot CD or DVD because I never made one. Yes I know that's a huge mistake but I'm learning as I go along here.
 I have no option for creating a backup CD or DVD using another PC, nor do I have an external hard drive with a Windows 7 OS to attempt to boot from.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Startup repair cannot repair it automatically. Details show a bad driver but does not specify which. However, I have noted that when I hit F8 during startup &amp; attempt to start in safe mode it hangs at AtiPcie.sys, which is a graphics driver, and then it
 goes right back to startup repair.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It would not start up in safe mode at all regardless of which option of safe mode I chose. It would always loop right back to startup repair.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have attempted a system restore through the Startup Repair Advanced Options &amp; System Recovery Options menu. It only shows one restore point (which can't be right because I set up restore points on a very regular basis to avoid incidents such as this).
 I did select "Show more restore points.", but it still had that only one restore point listed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I scanned for affected programs and drivers, but it detected none.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I started the system restore it ran, then reported " System Restore completed successfully", it showed the date and time of the restore point, and instructed me to click the restart button to restart the computer. During restart it would not start
 Windows normally, and it went right back to startup repair.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Under the Advanced Boot Options menu, I attempted to boot with the last known good configuration, but it loops right back to startup repair again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also attempted the Directory Services Restore Mode under the Advanced Boot Options, but while loading Windows files it hung at AtiPcie.sys, then it attempted to boot in safe mode - Directory Services Repair, but then looped right back to startup repair.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also ran the windows Memory Diagnostics Tool, using the extended diagnostic, &amp; default cache setting, but that detected no problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have read probably 100 threads on this topic. Some suggested deleting AtiPcie.sys through command prompt &amp; that it would reload during my next attempt at restart, but 1 I don't know how to do that, &amp; 2 I'm afraid that doing that may make things worse.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Other threads suggested renaming AtiPcie.sys to AtiPcie.sys.old in command prompt, stating that it would allow windows to load completely, &amp; I'd be able to download a new AtiPcie.sys from http://www.dll4you.com/files/Atipcie.sys.html, http://www.sysfilesdownload.com/A/AtiPcie.sys.html,
 or 2-3 other similar sites, but I don't know how to renaming AtiPcie.sys to AtiPcie.sys.old. In command prompt.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried sfc/scannow in command prompt, but it says "There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete. Restart Windows and run sfc again." The system repair is not fixing the problem , and a reboot is not working, so sfc/scannow probably
 will not work at all. I've tried sfc/scan like 20 times back to back but it will not work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've even looked into possible options using my android phone via USB connection to fix the problem, but I couldn't find anything on that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I believe I've covered everything I've tried.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I run a home businesses with my PC, &amp; every minute it's down I am losing money. I have been at this for 3 days with no success. I'm trying to avoid spending money unnecessarily in a repair shop, but I'm beginning to believe that I have no other option.
 Someone please help. There has to be a way to fix this without taking it to a shop.</div>

</p><p>Looking at the specs for ASUS model CM1630, I find that you do indeed have integrated ATI/AMD Graphics and, taking you description of the symptoms into account, it may be malfunctioning. There are only two&nbsp; ways that I know of to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sending the unit in ASUS for repairs, so they can fix the integrated Graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Purchase a different GPU, Nvidia for example and install it in on one of the (<strong>Preferably the 1 x PCI-e x 16
</strong>)expansion slots available to you after disabling the integrated Graphics in BIOS&nbsp;.</p>

            Ok now I am really confused. I don't understand how going to the expense of replacing the GPU is necessary when the problem is simply a damaged or accidentally deleted driver. That's like replacing a perfectly good webcam, keyboard, mouse, or any other
 hardware when all it needs is a new driver to run it. If I could access Windows and the Internet I'd simply go to the ASUS website and download a new driver for it based on the specs. Obviously that's not an option in my current predicament though.

            &nbsp;I covered both scenarios, hence the link to your system's support page. If you think reinstalling the driver is all you need, rather than going to third party sites, refer to the support link.

<h2>            Download size has been increaing</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been trying to download Ark: survival evolved from the windows store. when I first started, the download began at 0 of 70.2 GB and the it progressed as expected without fail until it reached 70.2. after that it began to increment upwards displaying
 numbers like 83.1 of 83.1. I researched the problem and found several recommended fixes and I have tried many; some of these include wsreset.exe, troubleshooting, updating windows, entering the following command into powershell(although I am not sure I did
 it correctly so I may need to retry that) <span>&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently going to attempt to run a SFC scan but I would greatly appreciate&nbsp; any assistance solving this my internet Is very so slow, so redownloading would be most inconvenient, so if at all possible I would like to save the already downloaded game
 data as I believe it is completed and read for installation. in between me trying to fix it I would let it download more to see if it would eventually stop but it appears that was wishful thinking. It now displays that I have downloaded 117.3 of 117.3. if
 you could find time to help me with this I would be most grateful. </p>

<h2>            Sound</h2>
                    I was going through the programs I have installed on my laptop&nbsp;and deleting ones that I didn't know how they got there and I don't know if while I was doing that my sound stopped working or what but my laptop speakers won't work now. It says that I have
 no speakers or headphones or anything plugged in to produce sound but I have a speaker that is right below the screen that an hour ago worked perfectly. Also my headphones won't work. I went through all the troubling shooting and tried asking Google for help
 but I haven't had any luck. I was doing a three step trouble shoot and your web site and none of it worked and it led me to here. I have a hp notebook pc as the box says. I'm sure you would need more information than that to go off of but I don't know what
 that is and I really just want to know what to do and how I can get my speakers back to working. I don't know if this is something you can help me out with or not but I would really appreciate it.&nbsp;

            <i>"I was going through the programs I have installed on my laptop&nbsp;and deleting ones that
<br />
I didn't know how they got there"<br />
</i><br />
Assuming it did have something to do with you uninstalling stuff, it sounds like you probably uninstalled the drivers for the machines integrated audio.
<br />
It may have been a mis-click while you were uninstalling other stuff, or intentional.<br />
<br />
Option 1 - Do a <i>System Restore</i> to a time before you did the uninstalling. <br />
The problem here is you may not have a restore point for when you uninstalled the
<br />
audio drivers, and may end up having System Restore reinstall the stuff you still don't need/want.<br />
You can find&nbsp; out what will be affected (installed or uninstalled) by System Restore by clicking
<br />
on the '<i>Scan for affected programs</i>' button.<br />
<br />
Option 2 - Go to the HP web site and download the audio drivers&nbsp; - Possibly Realtek HD audio ?
<br />
We can only guess which audio without knowing which HP laptop you are using, but<br />
the web site will have a page where you can enter the model which will lead you to<br />
the correct driver download page.<br />
If when installing the drivers if you get a message that drivers are already installed... hmm.<br />
Looks like we'll have to investigate further. What I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
Laptops do come with a lot of bloatware.&nbsp; <br />
No doubt you have probably already figured out for yourself, but generally speaking,
<br />
if you don't know how it got&nbsp; there leave it, or "If it ain't broke....&nbsp; "<br />
At least until you know exactly what it is. <br />
<br />
- For the most part software does not take up a lot of HDD space, so that is not usually a problem.<br />
The main thing regarding performance from having a lot of software installed is to watch for software that launches in the background with Windows.<br />
You can limit the Startup programs via <i>System Configuration &gt; Startup </i>( type&nbsp; msconfig into the Run command or Start menu search bar to open System Configuration).<br />
Clear the tick box next to programs you are certain you don't need to have running all the time.<br />
- Another option&nbsp; is to use the Clean Boot procedure -<br />

<br />
<br />
If you continue having problems upload a report from <i>Speccy</i> to <i>Skydrive</i> so we can have<br />
a look at your system specs, and what is installed -<br />

    <title>Playing games in lower than native resolution&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kousik adhikary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing games in lower than native resolution&#33;</h2>
                    I used to use a 17"CRT monitor till now. A few weeks back it stopped working so I am thinking of buying a new 20"LED Monitor. I knew there was a problem with both LCD/LED displays if we change the resolution to something else other than the native resolution.
 Except of windowed mode is their any way to play old games in resolutions lower than the native resolution of the LED without any quality loss?&nbsp;I don't have a Graphics Card yet so some games is even needed to play at lower resolutions to run smoothly. Until
 I get a Graphics Card how to overcome this problem?&nbsp;I am thinking of shrinking the screen with black borders. Will that help and is it possible?

            Actually I ordered the product online. It hasn't arrived yet. I know about native resolution. I am talking about games that I don't want to run in that resolution but don't want choppy images either. Except for Windowed mode is their nay way to run a game
 &nbsp;in lower resolutions other than native resolution without choppy images that occurs in LCD/LED monitors? In lower resolution can I make the image small with black borders so that the quality doesn't fall. Will that help and is that possible?

            Got my monitor and it seems that even LEDs work fine in other resolutions like its native resolution in fullscreen. This is applied only for the ones that are preferred. The low quality occurs when the monitor is run on a resolution which is not&nbsp;preferred&nbsp;by
 the monitor. That is not a big problem for me. Loving my 20" Monitor from AOC.
