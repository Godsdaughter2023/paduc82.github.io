<p>yea, it's finally getting the 2k treatment it deserves. If you youtube it, there is off screen footage of the actual game. It looked like people were playing a demo, only 4 wrestlers could be used though, orton, cena, cesaro and gold dust.</p>

<p>So excited for this game. Bought every WWE Game since wwf smackdown on PS1. Not a huge fan of the show anymore more of a TNA fan BUT never going to stop getting the games. Trailer looks unbelievable. Just a little annoyed about the delay. I swear over half
 of games are delayed nowadays.</p>

<h2>            How to have all audio playback through headphones and override the speakers</h2>
                    
<p>headphones and speakers - interface</p>
<p>This is probably a stupid and basic question that I would ordinarily be embarrassed to ask. But I'm old enough not to be embarrassed about much anymore. I would like to have all audio come through the headphones and override the speakers. But when I plug
 in the headphones the audio comes through both. It worked ok a few days back, but not now. Help !&nbsp; Please !</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate this case, let's check the <em>Games</em> app on your tablet and see if the games you've downloaded are saved there. On your screen, please look for a green tile with white Xbox controller. The app is pre-installed, so you should be able
 to find it. However, if it's not available, then we suggest that you download it from the Windows Store. Here's how to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/legacy-devices/windows/windows-8-install-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Install the Games app on Windows 8</a>.</p>

            <p>Sorry about the late reply. The last few weeks have been hectic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on to the problem i don't need or want a Xbox account as i don't have a XBox online nor do i want one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The games i was trying to get were not XBox games. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So why would i need that App ( Though it is already on my Tablet ) It came as some of the Software already loaded. The Tablet is a Acer and has been updated. When you use that app it just opens the XBox store and that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found just one Game on the Tablet that downloaded. The rest showed they had downloaded but aren't anywhere to be found. Other Science type of programs i had downloaded, did download and install just not the game's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This game that did download i probably won't play much. I don't do Browser type of gaming much. And i'm not really into Slots. ( It was mostly a Test to see if it would show up ) I play mostly AAA games and some Indie games through Steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for XBox i have and Old Halo Collector's Edition. It is not hooked up to anything but a TV for the GrandKids when they come to visit. And they generally bring their own PS4's and such, so it never gets used. It doesn't require a internet connection either,
 &nbsp;which by the way is a small joy in itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Thanks for any help you can give</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Let's isolate the issue by trying to search and re-download the game from the Store. If it prompts you that the game is already installed, open
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> and check if the game is listed. If yes, try uninstalling and re-downloading it from the Store.<br />
<br />
If issue persists, perform a clean boot using the steps <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">
here</a>. <br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, kindly verify the name of the app or game for us to assist you further.<br />
<br />
Let us know the results.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<a href="http://g.imagehost.org/0025/Immagine_5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://g.imagehost.org/0025/Immagine_5.jpg</a> instead of using the correct

do (&nbsp;<a href="http://f.imagehost.org/0269/Immagine.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://f.imagehost.org/0269/Immagine.jpg</a> ).<br />
Here is an example sshot showing the bug: <a href="http://f.imagehost.org/0502/Immagine.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://f.imagehost.org/0502/Immagine.jpg</a> <br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This has been reported and confirmed by all peolple I know with very
<br />
different HW and Vista versions so I can say it's a real bug in the OS.<br />
</span><br />
It won't happen right after a fresh install but will start doing so after a while<br />
(usually after simultaneous copy from&lt;-&gt;to USB flashdrives) and Vista won't show<br />
the correct&nbsp;icons anymore from that moment on using instead that ugly yellow icon<br />
with a green little arrow <a href="http://g.imagehost.org/0025/Immagine_5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://g.imagehost.org/0025/Immagine_5.jpg</a>
<br />
for all kind of folders!<br />
<br />
It's just a minor cosmetical bug but I'd like it to be fixed by an hotfix soon <br />
beacuse even after SP2 nothing changed.

No, belive me. As I said this bug has been spotted on many Vista (clean) installations. After a while it simply gets corrupted and Vista starts using that ugly icon in the taskbar for all kind of open folders.<br />
I've been able to reproduce this even after a clean reinstall just to investigate. I didn't install anything (really!). And after some simple file copy from/to USB flashdrives it suddenly got corrupt showing that generic icon. For the first 1-2 hours it was
 ok.<br />
<br />
See yourself on many different Vista machines and look carefully to iconified folder icons (move back and forth among sub-folders)... I myself didn't notice this bug after 2 years using Vista :)

Not tested. But the OS bug won't change in any case... As I said you can find this bug on 9/10 Vista machines all with different cfg, clean install or not... It's a real (minor) bug this time and not a specific single-user problem.

<p>I have had this problem after transferring files from a USB before too. But i've had my laptop for about a year and ive only gotten the folder with a green arrow fairly recently. (or i've noticed it recently). However, I have (somewhat) of a fix for it.
 All I did was open and close the "Folders" pane in the Favorite Links pane, and pressed Alt a few times. It seems to have fixed it temporarily. So try it on your PC to see if it really fixes it, or I just got lucky.</p>

            I think the reality is, you need to get a new printer. The next best suggest is to do an Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate if you are not running either edition and download the free Windows XP Mode and use your printer through that.<br />
<br />

Print from a virtual machine<br />
<br />
There are several methods you can use to make a printer available to a virtual machine. The methods you can use are affected by whether a printer driver is available for Windows 7 and whether the printer is a local USB printer or a network printer. To share
 a local USB printer<br />
<br />
1. Note<br />
This method is appropriate when the printer driver is available for both the Windows 7 host operating system and the guest operating system. You only need to complete these steps once per virtual machine. This procedure assumes you have verified that the printer
 is working in the host operating system.<br />
Make sure the printer is turned on and that the printer driver is available for installation. For example, you can install the driver from the internet or from a CD.<br />
<br />
Redirect the printer to the virtual machine. From the virtual machine window, click USB and then click Attachdevice name.<br />
<br />
2. Install the printer driver in the guest operating system. You can install the driver from the internet or from a CD.<br />
<br />
3. Release the printer from the virtual machine. From the virtual machine window, click USB and then click Releasedevice name.<br />
<br />
4. Restart the virtual machine. From the virtual machine window, click Action and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
5. Navigate to the virtual machine desktop, and log on if necessary. (You will be logged in automatically if you saved the credentials.)<br />
<br />
6. The printer will be available for use in both the host operating system and the guest operating system. To configure a network printer for a virtual machine<br />
<br />
1. Navigate to the virtual machine desktop, and log on if necessary. (You will be logged in automatically if you saved the credentials.)
<br />
<br />
Note<br />
The following steps are general, so the names of the buttons may differ from what is shown.<br />
<br />
2. Open Control Panel, and then open Printers.<br />
<br />
3. Click Add Printer. The Add Printer Wizard opens.<br />
<br />
4. On the Local or Network Printer page, select the network printer option and complete the wizard.<br />
<br />
If you are running Windows XP as the guest operating system, you must manually install the printer driver for each printer you want to use. The following steps describe this process. To install a printer driver in Windows XP<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, and then click Printers and Faxes.<br />
<br />
2. Under Printer Tasks, click Add a printer. The Add Printer Wizard opens.<br />
<br />
3. On the Local or Network Printer page, select Local printer attached to this computer and clear Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer.<br />
<br />
4. On the Select a Printer Port page, click the drop-down control and select one of the TS number ports and click Next.<br />
<br />
5. On the Install Printer Software page, select Windows Update or Have Disk and complete the wizard. To print from a virtual machine<br />
<br />
1. Navigate to the virtual machine desktop, and log on if necessary. (You will be logged in automatically if you saved the credentials.)<br />
<br />
2. Do one of the following:<br />
<br />
* From the desktop of the virtual machine, right-click a file and click Print.<br />
* Open any application that includes a print option, and then use the print command.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. All printers available to the virtual machine are listed. Select a printer, and then click OK.<br />

            Try installing the printer driver first before connecting the printer.<br />
<br />
If you already did that, uninstall the printer, restart the computer, install the driver, restart your computer then connect the printer.<br />
<br />
Make sure you are installing the latest driver available for Windows 7, if there are not Windows 7 native drivers, then you can try using Windows Vista drivers.
<br />
<br />
You can also run Printer&nbsp; troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter<br />
<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 1709 update&#47;Internet Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpgeevan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1709 update&#47;Internet Access</h2>
                    <p>After the Win-10/1709 update is downloaded, applied/installed and rebooted, the
<strong>system loses Internet access</strong>. This has been reported in the Community discussions. However, MS has not offered a clear explanation or&nbsp;solution. All the usual ways to troubleshoot have been tried - resetting network, re-installing network adaptors&nbsp;(both
 WiFi and LAN), disabling antivirus apps, etc.&nbsp; Since everything failed, I had to roll back to the previous Windows-10 (1607).&nbsp; Although the generic error message is about the adapter that doesn't seem to be the case. Some of the changes in the system made
 while installing the new version, seem to block access to the default gateway. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After falling back to older Win-X/1607, the system tries to download and apply the&nbsp;update 1709 again and again. Knowing that an update will cause loss of Internet access, I have no other option than stop the update someway.&nbsp; Kindly provide guidance and,
 preferably, a tool to rectify the problem.</p>

<p>More or less the same problem,&nbsp; can download 1709 but when updating only gets to 75% before failing. Chat try to help but when they take control, you lose the connection when the first time the&nbsp;update restarts.</p>

<p>Not yet Patrick,&nbsp; too busy today to waste a whole day back and forward with Chat support (which is what I expect to happen again) but may have time tomorrow.</p>
<p>Once again today it started to run update without any warning but I think I may have found a way to stop it - ignore the warning to 'do not turn off your computer' and hit restart</p>
<p>I will post when I get a solution</p>

<p>Terror! It keeps coming back. If we allow it, then the update will go through leaving us without access to Internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Microsoft is listening to these discussions. If not, we might as well have this discussions elsewhere.&nbsp; BTW, how can be ask for MS to respond?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible for each individual to get direct help from MS. Instead, they should have studied the problem and worked out a solution or provided guidance on trouble shooting. I have seen some interesting third-party discussions on how to fix this.
 However, I'm not inclined to experiment because it takes too much time - first updating, then checking, if not rolling back, etc ... .. Oh no ... the update has started ... I need to stop!!!</p>

<p>Had 2 sessions with Chat tech's tonight.&nbsp; The first understood that I have spent hours with some tech's to only lose them&nbsp;at the point of the installation going into reboot when they have control of my computer so
<strong>she asked for a contact number </strong>so I was hopeful that I might hear from her when the expected dropout would happen (call me a pessimist)
<strong>BUT </strong>once again no call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A glutton for punishment I joined the queue again and this tech seemed to get the point that all her colleagues were failing doing the same old so she was going to try a clean installation to the latest version.</p>
<p>This time I had to bail on her for although she was assisting me with a quick back up of everything I could not stand to lose, she could not promise that I would be able to restore an old database program from a creator who is no longer around and which
 is not an app - I have to explore other options before I am prepared to sacrifice this favourite program</p>
<p>If you have no such problems then maybe save all your goodies and try the clean install option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily my tech savvy son has arrived for a few days so maybe he will help - too tired tonight but he did say we may have to try for a less recent version than 1709 (from the 1607 I am on now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to report that thinking a restart would stop the daily&nbsp;futile downloads instigated by Microsoft, isn't that successful as it just resumes where it left off AND it is a pain shutting down your computer whenever you take a break (as you know Sleep mode
 is a prompt to Microsoft to start downloading 4GB again!)</p>

            One good news! I had tweeted to @Windows and there is a response saying that they are willing to sort out the problem. I have been putting this off. Let me try applying the update and seek the help of MS if it leads to loss of Internet access again. Will
 report back if there is anything worth sharing.

<p>My final post on the subject so I will retrack</p>
<p>My problem was that my computer would not update Win10 from version 1607 to the latest 1709</p>
<p><strong>It</strong> would try to do it at least once a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would download the latest version ok but fail on the install/update</p>
<p>It would go to a black screen when installing (and yes I waited hours in case) - forcing me to turn it off</p>
<p>When I restarted it would resume at 75% installed (even when I tried updating to 1703 instead of the latest it was this same point) and continue installing until freezing at either 83% or 88%</p>
<p>I would then have to turn off again (and yes I experimented at leaving it for hours at this point too) and it would then automatically begin reinstalling previous version (1607)</p>
<p>Early days I got no error code but started to (possibly because my son started using a different update approach?) and the message was that it</p>
<p>"failed in the SECOND_BOOT phase with an error during MIGRATE_DATA operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were extremely patient and continued to join the queue for Chat at Microsoft Support.</p>
<p>We would have had sessions of up to 2hrs with at least 10 techs over 3 days</p>
<p>They all would take control of the computer and they all said they would fix the problem - LOL the last one was SO confident, telling us he had fixed this problem 100's of times and that he was our 'Superhero'</p>
<p>Like all the others he failed&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end we had to bite the bullet, save what we wanted, and do a complete reinstall. (then reinstall various aps ...)</p>
<p>I now have Win 10 latest version BUT the only thing I rejoice about is being able to turn on the computer and not have it go into update (every single day!)</p>

<h2>            Slow startup, upgraded Intel HD 4000 driver, still slow and now Edge not working</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Toshiba Satellite P875-323 and Windows 10.&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 in the summer and all was great until a bit before Christmas when it suddenly went from starting up in seconds, to taking about&nbsp;30 mins to&nbsp;1 hour to function properly
 at normal speed.&nbsp; I checked for updates on various drivers and some were then updated -&nbsp;it didn't improve startup from a restart, but did improve the time it took to come back to life after closing the lid.&nbsp; Then I went onto the Intel website where there was
 a link which is supposed to check the correct drivers for your computer and download the right ones, and it downloaded a further Intel HD 4000 update... and now restart is just as slow, after closing the lid it has gone back to taking ages to get back up to
 speed, and Microsoft Edge doesn't respond at all (literally, it doesn't even seem to know I've clicked it, so I am back to using Internet Explorer).&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Can there be a link betw
                </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about the slow start-up performance, please consider checking the Startup items of your PC. Having too much startup applications will require a lot of resources and boot time. Try disabling the startup applications that are
<em>unnecessary</em>. Please refer to these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Right click on Taskbar and click on <strong>Task Manager</strong>. you can also access
<em>Task Manager</em> by pressing <strong><em>Ctrl + Shift + ESC</em>.</strong></p>
<p>2. Click on <strong>More details</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53ee8b47-f157-4fd0-a22a-c027606bc96a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53ee8b47-f157-4fd0-a22a-c027606bc96a" /></a></p>
<p>3. Go to the <strong>Startup</strong> tab. <strong>Click to highlight the applications</strong> that you want to disable. Then click
<strong>Disable</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/785d5e71-79f7-4753-adde-467b203942b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/785d5e71-79f7-4753-adde-467b203942b2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is important to restart your PC once you have disabled the apps. There is nothing wrong to disable OneDrive if you have it on startup. You can always launch the apps once you booted the PC completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern about Edge not launching, check if <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC /scannow</a></span></em></strong> will resolve something
 or at least determine an error. It is also recommended to run the said command twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us about any result.<br />
<br />
All at its bests. </p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Thanks Marc, your help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled loads of Startup items, and sfc/scannow said there were no integrity violations, I have also gone through various control panel settings to optimise startup wherever possible, and tried a number of things suggested&nbsp;on various forums, including
 stopping it from going to sleep,&nbsp;which has at least prevented the necessity of a desperately slow 'wakeup', and my drivers are now up to date (most of them were already).&nbsp; Not everything helped, but some things helped a bit, and none of it hindered except
 that Intel HD4000 update&nbsp;which seemed to make the&nbsp;'wakeup' slower after the lid being closed and (possibly a coincidence) the next day Microsoft Edge stopped working completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the lid is closed, it is now taking about 10 minutes to work, and 20-30 minutes to get back to full speed, even though the icons and taskbar etc all show instantly&nbsp;when the lid is opened; but&nbsp;an actual Restart still takes over an hour!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I disabled various Startup items, I did disable quite a few but there are a bunch of things&nbsp;which&nbsp;I don't know what they are, and I was nervous of disabling something that is needed for the computer to start...&nbsp; Are there any particular culprits I should
 be looking for?&nbsp; Or is there a way of knowing whether something is needed/important?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely if I haven't installed anything new in the last few months, whatever my startup files and control panel settings etc, I should still be able to restart just as quickly as before?&nbsp; It seems to me the main problem is probably&nbsp;a Windows 10 update that
 my laptop doesn't like?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really liked Microsoft Edge for the first 5 months or so of using it, but now when I click the icon in the taskbar nothing happens, so I'm now using Internet Explorer.&nbsp; If we can't resolve the slow startup, is there an easy way to get Edge working again?&nbsp;
 I read some instructions for "resetting" it, but it said be sure to do a full backup first, which worried me... although I have got a recovery usb and have backed up my files, I am not very confident and&nbsp;don't want to have to use them!&nbsp; Do you know how likely
 it is, that resetting Edge would mess everything up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Angie</p>
        </p>

We understand your worries about disabling Startup programs. You're right that this will change a lot of things on your computer's performance, either it would be good or the other way around. I would like to set a bit of expectation about disabling Startup
 items. So, to at least encourage you to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup items are installed programs (or applications) that are automatically started by the Windows when the operating system starts. The problem is that there are many programs that are associated with unwanted software such as viruses and malware. These
 will really affect the PC performance, especially when starting the system up and shutting it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try running a complete computer scan using your trusted antivirus software. Regarding this, we would like you to visit this link on how to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17187/windows-10-protect-your-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">protect
 your PC using Windows Defender</span></em></strong>.</a> Hopefully, Windows Defender will come with something in hand now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also understand that doing this alone can be cautious. If you need someone on your side to do this, please feel free to contact one of our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/chat/4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Microsoft Consultants through chat</strong></span></em></a>. They can offer a remote assistance in order to help you disabling Startup items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're yet to tell if the issue has something to do with the Intel driver update, but just in case that all the steps were tried and the issue is persistent,
<em>please try contacting your computer manufacturer</em> in order to get the best advice about their hardware drivers for Windows 10.</p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I decided to take up the suggestion of contacting a Microsoft consultant through chat and he took control of my computer, said the best thing to do was to reset Windows 10, and&nbsp;did that for me and then left me to it while it downloaded, updated,&nbsp;restarted
 several times, etc.&nbsp; Unfortunately when it was all finished my computer was so slow it couldn't connect back to 'chat' - it kept timing out before making a connection.&nbsp; Hence my delayed response (I am sending this from work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my conclusion is that the problem is one of 3 things:</p>
<p>a) a virus that wasn't wiped when Windows 10 was reset - it can't have been a clean install as he kept my files and programs (MS Word still opened, albeit about 5 mins after clicking!)</p>
<p>b) a failing hard disk</p>
<p>c) a problem with Windows 10 that can only be resolved with a complete reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In desperation I have taken the computer to a local&nbsp;technician who is now testing the hard disk and if that is found to be ok he'll do a fresh install of Windows 10 for me, or possibly do a fresh install&nbsp;aswell as a new hard disk&nbsp;- frustrating because I
 got the free download but will have to pay for a clean install :( :(</p>

            <p>My hard disk has now been tested and is fine, and no virus, RAM etc - everything has tested fully ok - so I now have to
<em>buy</em> a fresh install of Windows 10. (My laptop came with 8.1 and apparently it's not advisable to go back to the factory version after upgrading)... So it's a bit like someone smashing my window (free of charge<span>) and then
 selling me a new one!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I already had the free upgrade (and not even by choice - it just started upgrading automatically when i wasn't looking) is there any way of getting back the cost of the new install?</p>

<h2>            Windows XP SP3 PC smps remains on, fans run, after shut down</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6b011c0f-49e1-4459-8cec-72dbf134706d" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aeef4385-0efe-4479-bc37-9e8c8a771cfc" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About a week back my HP Pavilion PC model t460i (Product DY006A-ACJ ) running windows XP SP3 and Internet Explorer 8, got stuck at boot up, showing hal.dll missing or corrupted. So I ran recovery option, expanded System32 folder to fish out one hal.dll,
 regsrved the new hal.dll, then the it coluld be booted up all right. Later I modified Boot.ini to add Recovery Option boot-up. The PC was working all right -- so it seemed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I discovered three malfunctions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) The PC could be shut down normally through shut down command, but its fans continued to run and smps power LED remained ON.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) Advanced tab in Power Options Properties does not show option for configuration of Power button, see attached image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;c) Turn Off Computer box shows Stand By greyed out, see attached image. If I enable Hybernate, I can see Hybernate button in the Turn Off Computer box that works. I have exported the current system information to a file named MyMSinfo32.txt for your scrutiny,
 but am not aware how to attach it with this query. Due to low disk space, I have disabled System Restore on all drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>d) I would add (on 02 Nov 2013) that the Background Intelligent Transfer Service is not working, it does not start automatically nor can be started manually, but its dependent RPC works all right. Event Viewer&nbsp;(System) shows the following error:</p>
<p>Event Type:&nbsp;Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;7000<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;02/11/2013<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;10:47:32 AM<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;N/A<br />
Computer:&nbsp;SC-9SSZN26CWA<br />
Description:<br />
The @%SystemRoot%\system32\qmgr.dll,-1000 service failed to start due to the following error:
<br />
%%1290</p>
<p>For more information, see Help and Support Center at <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of stalled BITS, Windows update does not work. I have used Microsoft Fix It but she said she could only fix some registry entries and corrupt files (possibly qmgr.dll).&nbsp;I also get DCOM error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My AMC engineers tried to fix the problems on 3&nbsp;days, but were unsucessful, they said Formatting and Reinstalling OS and all applications would be the&nbsp;only solution. I do not subscribe to their views.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be grateful if an expert from Microsoft can suggest a remedy. Views from dedicated enthusuasts of MS Forum are also welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and regards.</p>

            <p>I am not sure if anybody is bothering to read any of this, but I figured I would provide an update to my situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I couldn't find any solution to rolling back my system to Windows 8 (of any version) but I was able to download and reinstall Windows 10 Home 32B. After a few updates and patching, plus reinstalling all the necessary stuff, the device is working well
 for the most part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The part that isn't is the locking up issue that still remains, however I was able to narrow down the problem. It is related directly to my Intel SST Audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was the sound that would continually stop working and the freezing of my system occurred most times when I tried to run anything that required sound (YouTube, Grove Music, Windows Media Player, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the drivers and they appeared to be correct, but to be sure I uninstalled the audio drivers and restarted my system. I then noticed in Device Manager that an Unknown Device was listed which no doubt was my audio driver I uninstalled. I went directly
 to Intel's web site and tried to look for the driver. I attempted to manually install the driver but then when it was installing my system froze again. I reset my tablet several times and tried in Safe Mode and normal but the system locked up every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I just let my tablet sit frozen for a while and after about 10 mins I had a blue screen pop up with a sad face. The Error Code was as follows:</p>
<p>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to get my sound installed this pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before when my audio drivers were installed, Videos and other media would lock up the system. Now that no audio drivers are installed, I can play videos nice and smooth, but I have no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides having no sound and no recovery image on my system, it is working well. I can live without the recovery partition as I can reinstall W10 as I need now, but having no sound limits a lot of what my tablet can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me solve this DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION so I can finally reinstall my audio and finally get my tablet back to normal?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 has ruined my computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 has ruined my computer</h2>
                    <p>My computer is a little over a year old and I have never had any problems. It originally came with Windows 8. I had no problems upgrading to windows 8.1. I did the automatic upgrade to windows 10. When I did, my computer didn't function properly anymore.
 Everytime I restarted something different would stop working(touchpad, mouse, keyboard, sound, etc.) When I reverted I was faced with constant crashes and freezing. I did a factory restore on my computer and now I'm back to windows 8. The the utility tool
 to make a bootable drive won't work on regular windows 8. I tried to upgrade to 8.1 but needed to update windows 8 first. The update failed. I then ran the update troubleshooter. Updates worked. Then I tried to upgrade to 8.1. It crashed during the installation.
 Had to power down and do a system restore. Now my computer crashes every single time it tries to update and my overall performance is suffering. I've tried updating firmware and drivers in addition to using the troubleshooter. I tried working with support
 and got nowhere. This is a $2000 computer that now won't work for more than a couple days without having to reformat/restore. This is not ok and any suggestions would be appreciated. I just want a licensed OS that's better than windows 8.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Eric,
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use check disk command for any errors on hard disk <br />
Warning: Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted .For safety you can back up your data before using the check disk command.<br />
<br />
Use the check disk commands as follows: </p>
<div>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows Key + X,</strong> then choose <strong>Command prompt (Admin</strong>) from the context menu.
<br />
b. In search window type '<strong>cmd</strong>' and <strong>ENTER.</strong> Right click and select
<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong>.<br />
c. Type at the command prompt <strong>CHKDSK /P</strong> and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to scan the disk.<br />
d. Then type <strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R </strong>and press <strong>ENTER</strong> to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform
<strong>chkdsk.</strong><br />
Once <strong>chkdsk </strong>completes, boot to the desktop and then check.<br />
<br />
Important: While performing <strong>chkdsk </strong>on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when
<strong>chkdsk</strong> tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>:<strong> Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: you can use product key of 8 for 8.1 too then you can upgrade to windows 10
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if this helps.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Angel
<br />
<br />It depends on what you are actually seeing when you boot up your PC, please try this:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi Angelp22,
<br />
<br />If you can, go through the options in Advanced options in the order I explained above, each is non-destructive to your data, hopefully one of the other options will work for you, before you have to reset Windows, because resetting Windows will mean you will have to e-install your 3rd party applications . . .

<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that&nbsp;you are unable to change the password of an email account in Mail app and I will be happy to answer your query. I appreciate the effort made towards the fixes you have tried. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which email client do you use in Mail app for which you want to change the password?</li><li>Are you able to remove that specific email account from Mail app?</li><li>Do you receive any error message?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li></ul>
<p>The issue can be caused due to various reasons and to diagnose the issue, I would request you to refer to the methods below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run the App troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the
<strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Apps troubleshooter</span></a></strong>. This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Remove the account</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to, remove that specific email account. Once removed, log-in to your email using a web browser. Change the password and then try adding the same email account in Mail app</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Uninstall/Re-install Mail app</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On Start, tap or click <span><strong>Mail</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span>
<strong>Settings</strong></span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<span><strong>Settings</strong></span>.)</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span><strong>Accounts</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click the account you want to remove.</p>
</li><li>
<p>At the bottom, tap or click <strong><span>Remove account</span></strong> or
<strong><span>Remove all accounts</span></strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Removing your Microsoft account (the account you use to sign in to Windows) is a different process. This account is required to use Mail, and removing it will remove all of your accounts from Mail, Calendar, and People. To remove your Microsoft
 account, see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/how-add-remove-account-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>Hi Aman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, a corrupted power <span>plan</span> can cause strange issues with power and sleep settings. If you are using a custom power plan which you have created, delete it and use one of the built-in standard power plans. See if it resolves the issue. If
 the issue persists, the problem could be related to the display drivers. We suggest installing the latest version of the display drivers from the manufacturer's website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the issue with your external keyboard, have you tried to isolate the issue by using a different keyboard? Also, have you tried running the
<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter? If you haven't done so, we suggest that you run the troubleshooter to scan your computer, identify the problems, and attempt to fix the issues automatically. You may refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> and type <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search bar and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</li><li>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<p>Thank you Aileen Alf ,for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As to your suggestion for the first problem, I am not using a custom power plan but a slightly modified default one; in which I have only changed the brightness settings, what the power button or closing the lids( in both cases it has been set to nothing).&nbsp;
 As for updating display drivers, I don't have the sticker containing the product details and I am don't know any software for checking it. I hope that you have read my ending paragraph of how the PC goes into hibernate when on battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second problem, I have noted that whenever the keyboard glitches, all I need to do is out the computer on sleep(after disconnecting the USB keyboard), then switch the PC back on and re-insert the keyboard. I have tried running the hardware and devices
 and it couldn't identify the problem. I was also using another keyboard, which worked fine(unsure of exact product details), until I gave it away and started using this one. Currently, this keyboard is working better than it used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I use driver booster 4 to keep my drivers updated.</p>

<p>Thank you for the update, Aman. We're glad to know that the issue with the keyboard has been resolved. Regarding the other issue you are having, if you haven't ran the Power troubleshooter yet, we suggest that you use the automated troubleshooter to test
 the computer for power problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter isn't designed to fix every problem but it is a useful tool to try first. Run the troubleshooter and then check if the issue will persist. You may refer to the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key </strong>+<strong> X</strong> and select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></li><li><span>Type <strong>troubleshooting</strong>&nbsp;in the search bar.</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>View all&nbsp;</strong>on the left navigation pane. </span>
</li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Power</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Advanced </strong>and then click on&nbsp;<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Next&nbsp;</strong>and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, let's try to eliminate software conflicts by performing a clean boot.
<span>Applications and services that </span><span>start automatically and then run in the background
</span><span>can cause software conflicts.</span> If the problem doesn't occur in a clean boot environment, the issue might be caused by application or service interferences.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft article</a> for more information on how you can perform clean boot. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps provided in the same article on how to reset the computer to start normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop.</p>

<p>Sorry for the late reply, I will state the cause below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your first suggestion, the only problem the troubleshooter came up with (and fixed) was that I was using high performance mode (which it switched to balanced).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your second suggestion, the clean boot worked and I could put my PC into hibernate and re-login like normal. However, in the same clean boot, when I attempted to put my PC in hibernate(almost immediately after the first try), the laptop woke up to
 another clean boot. This second clean boot caused a small battery problem, which delayed my reply until now. Here's the details; the battery icon had a red x blinking on it and my battery LED was doing 2 blinks of white + 3 blinks of orange in quick succession.
 I fixed this manually as I did to the problem given below, although I believe I marked a different in the belief that I couldn't write the answer to my own question(which is now of course corrected). This isn't the first time my PC has had a battery problem.
 Here's the link to the previous battery problem.</p>

<p>Okay, the problem is fixed. I am not entirely sure of the details but I believe what I did in the previous comment with battery problem has fixed my computer somehow. I will re-type what I did down below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery icon had a red x blinking on it and my battery LED was doing 2 blinks of white + 3 blinks of orange in quick succession. I fixed this manually as I did to the problem given below, although I believe I marked a different in the belief that I couldn't

<p>
</p><p>So now hibernate works as it should. However, I would have never fixed this problem without your help Aileen Alf.&nbsp;Because of your suggesting a clean boot, my PC had a battery problem, because of which I manually fixed the laptop, which led to the fixing
 of the hibernate button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once again, thank you Aileen Alf, for your time and patience.</p>

<h2>            Why does the XBox One interface suck so much when compared to XBox 360&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just got an XBox One on Sunday. All along I was lead to believe that it was far better to the 360 in every way. So why is the GUI so awful for this machine?? Just turning off the console requires navigation through multiple options. I can't find a Download
 History, there is clearly no easy way to delete games or apps. Everything about the interface is clunky, confusing, and comes across as a complete step backwards from the very easy to use 360 screens. Am I just an idiot or do others feel like Microsoft really
 dropped the ball here?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Quiddity 67,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Sorry you don't like the UI for the Xbox One. If you have suggestions for improvements I would suggest going to
<a href="http://feedback.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a> and submitting changes you would like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't find a Download History</strong></p>
<p>A. You can go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;to review your purchase history. Also, if you go to your Games and Apps section towards the bottom of the home screen, then scroll all the way to the right (next to
 games or apps), you will see uninstalled purchased items.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q.&nbsp;there is clearly no easy way to delete games or apps</strong></p>
<p>A. To uninstall a game or app, go to the game or app tile in the "Games and Apps" section towards the bottom of the home screen. Press Menu, Select Manage, and Select Uninstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also recommend that you check out&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/V2PdHHsuc0w?list=PLA9n4SVxy6ZXaCPb2_P-f_CjnjpT2J4Dx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AKA Scratch's tutorial here</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/V2PdHHsuc0w?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/V2PdHHsuc0w?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>.

<p>I'm already aware of the solutions that you provided. My problem is that the overall interface is just so bad. In this day and age of easy to use apps on tablets and phones, it seems like you deliberately made the interface as contrary to this as possible.
 But then, in addition to my Android tablet, I have a second one with an MS operating system and it is also not as clean or easy to use as the Galaxy or my iPod Touch. You really need to get it together or you're going to be left far behind.</p>

<p>I am facing a weird problem on my surface pro 2 ,I have the following configuration:</p>
<p>surface pro 2 256 GB</p>
<p>mini display to HDMI adapter.</p>
<p>HDMI cable connecting the mini display adapter to my TV monitor</p>
<p>Samsung TV monitor FULL HD model T22C350MW ,its a 21.5 inches monitor</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I purchased 2 different mini display to HDMI adapters and one mini display to HDMI direct cable ,one of them worked on the docking station for ONE minute and never worked afterwards ,some of the adapters worked on the surface itself BUT NOT on the docking
 station ,some of them worked on specific HDMI ports but NOT on others while ALL of my HDMI TV ports work fine with my dish receiver.,till now I couldn't get ANY adapter / cable to work on the docking station.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>my Microsoft docking station was purchased new ,never dropped ,ALL docking ports (USB 3 ,USB 2 ,power ,Ethernet) are working perfectly fine.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Be leary of any company that claims they can automatically fix a lot of issues with oneprogram. Added that System Optimizers and/or Registry Cleaners are more likely to cause issues while fixing nothing. Think of them as Snake-Oil.<br />
<br />
PCHealthBoost has an extremely poor WOT reputation.<br />

<h2>            Search Icon and Start Menu not clickable</h2>
                    <p><span>Lately the search icon in the Taskbar on my PC does not respond to some search results when clicked.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I came across a thread on the internet advising that the Index be rebuilt. I did as instructed (it took a long time) but now, not only is the search icon not clickable as before, but even the start menu does not respond when clicked and the PC cannot
 be shut down. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even when the power button on the front of the PC is pressed, nothing happens. The red LED keeps flashing (as if something is happening in the background) and the PC fails to shut down. The only way then to shut the PC down is to unplug from the mains.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What could be the problem? Can someone please assist?</span></p>

            Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I've tried everything&nbsp;as advised&nbsp;in the link but still no joy.&nbsp; It's made no difference whatsoever.&nbsp; Both the Search icon and the Start Menu are still not clickable.&nbsp; What else can I try?

            <p>Try these following troubleshooting methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run DISM</strong><br />
The DISM&nbsp;may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong>Start Menu</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Run this command:&nbsp;<em>DISM.EXE /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</em></li><li>If the operation is completed successfully, close the command prompt and check if your issue has been fixed.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run System File Checker</strong><br />
System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the&nbsp;<strong>Start Menu</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Run this command:&nbsp;<em>SFC /scannow</em></li><li>This may take several minutes to finish. If&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>&nbsp;shows&nbsp;<strong>Verification 100% complete</strong>,&nbsp;close the command prompt and check if your issue has been fixed.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 1: Upgrading all drivers</strong><br />

            <p><span><span>Hi Allan : Thanks again. I have tried the three<span>&nbsp;
</span>troubleshooting methods as advised but in vain.<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>Method 1</strong> gives the following error message:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Error : Ox800fo81F</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>The source file could not be found .................</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Then if I try to find the log file, it says :
<strong>The system cannot file the path.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Method 2 :
</strong>sfc /scannow</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This message is displayed : “<strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Details are included in the CBS.Log windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios”.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Below is a screen shot of the log file.&nbsp; I cannot make head or tail of it.&nbsp; Can you?&nbsp; And, as regards method 3, my PC is up to date with all the latest updates.</span></span></strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c07b0cb3-263d-4cfa-9c94-927be74a8128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c07b0cb3-263d-4cfa-9c94-927be74a8128" /></a></p>

            <p>The system scans found errors and corrupted files that cannot be repaired on it's own. You need to use the
<strong>Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO)</strong> file to restore those corrupted ones. You can download the
<strong>ISO Image</strong> from this <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and follow the instructions on how to repair the system files.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 3 month gold live digital code - says it has already been redeemed</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I wonder if anyone can help as I am totally confused.</p><p>I bought my Son a 3 month Gold Live membership a couple of days ago to renew the other one that ran out a few days before that. I bought it from a Game store and got nothing more than a 25 digit code printed on what is effectively receipt paper. We went home and it was late so my Son went to bed and the next morning entered the code, but it says it has already been redeemed. I tried it and got the same. We tried doing it through the Xbox One and then through the website. I am baffled as to why it would be saying this.&nbsp;The code was generated there and then in the store so I cant see how it could be redeemed. We haven't redeemed it without realising it as have checked the purchase history and it is clear from what my Son have available to him on screen that it is not activated.</p><p>Can anyone offer any thoughts or advise. I hope we're simply doing something wrong?</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p><p>Greg</p>
