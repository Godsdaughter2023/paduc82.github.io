                    <p>I for many years now have been a keyboard/pad user &amp; I have always been at a loss as to why companies have not yet designed a keboard/pad that has 2 TAB keys, one on the left &amp; one on the right.</p>
<p>As a data entry administration officer I am always wishing I had a TAB key in the right hand side &amp; not just the left.</p>
<p>As majority of &nbsp;keyboards/pads have numeratical keypad on the right and yet there is no TAB key..WHY NOT??? I always have wondererd whom designs keyboards/pads men or

The tab key was placed on the QWERTY keyboard long before computers existed. &nbsp;With modern touch screen systems, nothing prevents you from creating your own on-screen keyboard that has the keys placed where you want.

            <p>Back in my early days of working with mainframes and accounting computers, I remember there being a tab key on the number pad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, if you look around, you can find manufacturers who can supply keyboards with this layout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, there's</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may also be possible to get a keyboard with software that is able to reprogram keys, so you can set the numlock key to act as a tab button.</p>

            It is the first time I have used this forum Brian I tried to find a direct email or contact address to Microsoft but alas I didn't, hence the reason I posted on here.......... Some of us are self taught computer people and not IT literate, so hence the
 reason for asking the&nbsp;question&nbsp;and at my age I am quiet proud as to how much I do know and have learnt by myself. Thought there might of been a suggestion area some where but hence no there wasn't. My apologies for the general computing question.

            It's probably better to approach third party hardware manufacturers.&nbsp; I see you've already posted to Logitech, which is a very logical thing to do.&nbsp; Many of these manufacturers have support forums, so you can ask whether people have recommendations for
 keyboards offering particular features/layouts.

<h2>            Activation Nightmares</h2>
                    I recently performed a "Clean Install" of windows 10, assuming that the same version would be installed as the one with which my computer had been preloaded. I was apparently in error! Instead of reinstalling Windows 10 Pro, the system reinstalled Windows
 10 Home which can't be activated because my digital license will only recognize and activate Windows 10 Pro! I went through all the steps delineated in Microsoft's instructions on how to resolve this issue using the "Troubleshooter" on the Activation screen,
 but when it said that I should click on the choice to "Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro" I realized that option is never offered! I have contacted Support which was worthless telling me to contact ASUS, which I did. ASUS referred me back to microsoft, and I just
 dread dealing with that goddamn "computer guy" who screens all Microsoft's Phone calls. Then when I finally do get to speak with an agent, I can't understand most of what they're saying because their accent is so thick (plus I'm f

<br />
<br />That will upgrade your Windows to Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Let the upgrade complete and restart your PC
<br />
<br />Then you need to remove that Product Key in order for Windows 10 Pro to activate automatically from the Microsoft Activation Servers

<br />Run this command and hit Enter:

 I need? Could either of you help me with this? Thanks again in advance!....Frank.</p>

            Hi Frank, the Installation created with the Media Creation tool will offer you the opportunity to install either the Home or Pro Editions of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />At the start of the installation routine, you simply choose which edition you want to install . . .
<br />
<br />I know you have already clean installed Windows 10, but actually reinstalling again would resolve this issue . . .
<br />
<br />If that is the way you want to go:
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Actually, this is what you need to do. 
<br />
<br />You need to inject the default product key then reactivate:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as adminstrator
<br />At the command prompt, type the following commands:
<br />slmgr.vbs -ipk VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T  (allows you to replace the current product key with the specified)
<br />
<br />Hit Enter on your keyboard
<br />Exit the command prompt
<br />
<br />Restart, then you should be upgraded to Pro.
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            Frank, try going offline by clicking on Action Center at far right end of task bar and choosing Airplane Mode.  Then copy and paste the Generic Pro Product Key again to see if it will change versions that way.  
<br />
<br />If this came from the Factory with Windows 10 Pro already activated (which is rare) then next install ProducKey app to read the key embedded in UEFI firmware chip, try inserting it to activate.  
<br />
<br />It's also rare that the installation media if created from media Creation Tool would force Home install without giving you a choice during the booted install, unless the embedded Key in UEFI firmware is Home version since the media is tasked to check there to preset the version installed.  Are you absolutely sure the PC came with the rare Pro Factory install?  This wasn't added later using an Upgrade or other method?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am experiencing the following: Windows is not genuine Your computer might be running a counterfeit copy of Windows. 0x80070005. &nbsp;The computer desktop background is black, and I receive the following error message on the bottom right corner of the screen:
 &nbsp;“Windows 7 Build 7600 &nbsp;This copy of Windows is not genuine”. &nbsp;Once this error occurred, I lost access to the Internet (I am on another computer) on the affected computer only. &nbsp;I am running Windows 7 Home Premium, 32-bit. &nbsp;What can I do to fix this without
 having access to the Internet? &nbsp;I tried starting my computer in Safe Mode and Networking, but that didn't work either. &nbsp;It says that I am not connected, and that Windows did not detect any networking hardware.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also tried to do a system restore, but it just hangs there when it gets to the point of "please wait while initializing ...".&nbsp; None of the maintenance and repair functions are working.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did a virus scan using McAfee, but none were detected.<br />
</div>
<div>I would appreciate any help. &nbsp;Thank you!</div>

            <p><span>Hi Trish,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You get message in the computer as
</span><strong>Windows is not genuine Your computer might be running a counterfeit copy of Windows. 0x80070005.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>I could imagine the inconvenience you experience when you are unable to use the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong>The situation may arise as a
<span>result of applying a Plug and Play Group Policy object.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>To overcome this, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span><span>
</span><strong><span>Disable the Plug and Play Policy</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>a. Determine the source of the policy. To do this, follow these steps:
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>i. On the client experiencing the Activation error, run the
</span><span><strong>Resultant Set of Policy</strong></span><span>wizard by clicking
</span><span><strong>Start, Run </strong>
</span><span>and entering
</span><span><strong>rsop.msc</strong></span><span> as the command.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Visit the following location:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Computer Configuration / Policies / Windows Settings /Security Settings / System Services /</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the Plug and Play service is configured through a Group Policy setting, you see it here with settings other than</span><span><strong>Not
 Defined</strong></span><span>. Additionally, you can see which Group Policy is applying this setting.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>b. Disable the Group Policy settings and force the Group Policy to be reapplied:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>i. Edit the Group Policy that is identified in Step 1 and change the setting to “Not Defined.” Or, follow the section below
 to add the required permissions for the Network Service account.<br />
ii. Force the Group Policy setting to reapply: </span><span><strong>gpupdate /force</strong></span><span> (a restart of the client is sometimes required)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Edit the permissions of the Group Policy</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open the Group Policy that is identified in Method A, Step 1 above, and open the corresponding Group Policy setting.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
</span><span><strong>Edit Security</strong></span><span> button, and then click the
</span><span><strong>Advanced </strong>
</span><span>button.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
</span><span><strong>Advanced Security Settings for Plug and Play
</strong></span><span>window click
</span><span><strong>Add </strong></span><span>and then add the SERVICE account. Then, click
</span><strong><span>OK</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the following permissions in the
</span><span><strong>Allow </strong></span><span>section and then click</span><span><strong>lock</strong></span><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Query template<br />
Query status<br />
Enumerate dependents<br />
Interrogate<br />
User-defined control<br />
Read permissions</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: The Previous rights are the minimum required permissions.
</span></p>
<p><span>e. Run
</span><span><strong>gpupdate /force</strong></span><span> after you apply the previous permissions to the Group Policy setting.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Verify that the appropriate permissions are applied with the following command:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>sc sdshow plugplay</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The following are the rights applied to the Plug and Play service in SDDL:<br />
<br />
D:(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;SY)<br />
(A;;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;BA)<br />
(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;IU)<br />
</span><span><strong>(A;;CCLCSWLOCRRC;;;SU)<br />
</strong></span><span>S:(AU;FA;CCDCLCSWRPWPDTLOCRSDRCWDWO;;;WD)</span></p>
<p><span><strong>(A;;CC LC SW LO CR RC ;;;SU</strong></span><span> is an Access Control Entry
 (ACE) that allows the following rights to "SU" (SDDL_SERVICE – Service logon user)</span></p>
<p><span>A: Access Allowed
<br />
CC: Create Child <br />
LC: List Children <br />
SW: Self Write <br />
LO: List Object <br />
CR: Control Access <br />
RC: Read Control <br />
SU: Service Logon User</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: If there are no GPO's in place, then another activity
 may have changed the default registry permissions. To work around this issue, perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the computer that is out of tolerance, start Registry Editor.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the registry key
</span><span><strong>HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-20</strong></span><span>, and select</span><span><strong>Permissions...</strong></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the NETWORK SERVICE is not present, click
</span><span><strong>Add</strong></span><span>...
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>iv.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In
</span><span><strong>Enter the object names to select
</strong></span><span>type Network Service and then click Check Names and OK.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>v.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the NETWORK SERVICE and Grant Full Control and Read permissions.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>vi.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>vii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After the restart, the system may require activation. Complete the activation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists, let us know and we would be glad to help you.</span></p>

            To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please also state the Version and Edition of Windows quoted on your COA sticker (if you have one) on the case of your machine (or inside the battery compartment), but do NOT quote the Key on the sticker!<br />

            <p>You can download the tool on any computer, and transfer it to the affected one using a USB stick.</p>
<p>You can then save the output in Notepad onto the USB stick, and upload it on the functional computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Non-genuine problems alone do not prevent internet connection - you must have other problems as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Please run a full CHKDSK and SFC scan....</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories</p>
<p>
Right-click on the Command Prompt entry</p>
<p>
Select Run as Administrator and accept the UAC prompt - the Elevated Command Prompt window should pop up.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
At the Command prompt, type</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and hit the Enter key.</p>
<p>
You will be told that the drive is locked, </p>
<p>
and the CHKDSK will run at he next boot - hit the Y key, and then reboot.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The CHKDSK will take a few hours depending on the size of the drive, so be patient!</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
After the CHKDSK has run, Windows should boot normally (possibly after a second auto-reboot) -
</p>
<p>
then run the SFC.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
Click on Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories</p>
<p>
Right-click on the Command Prompt entry</p>
<p>
Select Run as Administrator and accept the UAC prompt - the Elevated Command Prompt window should pop up.</p>

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
and hit the Enter key</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Wait for the scan to finish - make a note of any error messages - and then reboot.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Copy the
</span><span style="font-style: italic">CBS.log</span><span> file created (C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log) to your desktop (you can't manipulate it directly) and then compress the copy and upload it to your SkyDrive

<p>i am experiencing exactly the same thing on my laptop, despite having genuine windows 7! I am just about to run the CHKDSK scan but wanted to ask if I will lose any of my files? Would I also be able to send you the scan results please? I have no idea what's
 going on with it!</p>
<p>thanks so much!</p>

            <p>This is a rather ancient thread - you should start a new thread of your own detailing your own problems, and include an MGADiag report.</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool

<p>Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your

<h2>            Skype For Business&#58; Create online event, Sign in for testing. Not Organizer</h2>
                    <p>Everything is up and running, Skype for business 2015 is up and on standby. I go to&nbsp;broadcast.skype.com and input my credentials, Log in, and create new event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select my settings, and then I attempt to launch the link into google chrome. External message pops up and I launch application. Skype takes this in and then opens up the meeting, however, when I "Sign In As Team Member, (also note I AM the organizer.) It
 states the following. "Hello. You're in our virtual lobby, so make yourself comfortable. The organizer will let you in soon."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thing is, I'm the organizer. I've tried this in IE11, Firefox, Chrome. I've done it on wifi, I've done it on LAN. Using a hotspot. Same outcome every time. I'm at a loss and have been at this for hours. I cannot find anything online so I created an account
 here and am asking the question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be so appreciated!<br />

            <p>Hi Brent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you schedule the Skype Meeting Broadcast (<a href="https://portal.broadcast.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.broadcast.skype.com/</a>), by default you will be given the role
<strong>Organizer</strong>, who creates the meeting, invites attendees and reviews meeting reports. I believe you have selected “Secure” on the Attendees section when you
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Schedule-a-Skype-Meeting-Broadcast-c3995bc9-4d32-4f75-a004-3bc5c477e553?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Schedule a Skype Meeting Broadcast</a>. Take note of the <strong>Event team member</strong> and
<strong>Attendee</strong> you have listed in this meeting. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1da3b7c-c514-4f01-92b4-b5723d1c38c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1da3b7c-c514-4f01-92b4-b5723d1c38c4" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test (PC installed with Skype for Business client), I also receive the same notification. But the currently signed-in username in Skype for Business client, is different and
<strong>not included</strong> as <strong>Event team member</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d3b8d4c-4646-4dc2-ab2a-3840cbb5b1d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d3b8d4c-4646-4dc2-ab2a-3840cbb5b1d1" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>This message means that you are in the meeting lobby and was not listed as Event Team member. In order to admit you in the meeting, Event Team members or Organizer need to&nbsp;<strong>Admit
</strong>this new participant by clicking Admit button on the meeting. This behavior also happens on
<strong>Attendees</strong> listed on the meeting.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>On your “Standby” Skype for Business client, check the Gear &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Under Personal Tab &gt; Change the Sign-in Address that is included as Organizer or Event Team member in the meeting.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65ec2170-b576-4846-adb4-a5063153fc0b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/65ec2170-b576-4846-adb4-a5063153fc0b" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Now after you have changed the sign-in address, whenever you are listed as Organizer or Event Team member, you will see this screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've got an additional account I've created as the organizer. I've added myself as a team member. However when I've attempted to sign into the event as a team member I receive this very bland error message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I've got Microsoft O365 admin access on the portal for OWA. I've ensured I have the boxes ticked for Skype for business however my error remains. The individual that assisted with the set up of my test user account made that account work without transferring
 any knowledge to myself or any team member to reproduce the results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially when I launch the meeting with my own account as an event team member I receive this error and I'm not able to get past this screen listed above. So I'm unable to accept my test account. I am also unable to list the organizer as a team member.
 I used the check names function and nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely know that could be frustrating. I can understand how you feel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, do let us know if you made any changes to the system prior to the issue.</p>

<h2>            Where are DailyPic taken</h2>
                    There is an app in the Windows 10 store called DailyPic which I think has spectacular pictures. My question is is there a way to find out where they were taken? If I right click with my mouse I get file info on the picture but not where it was taken.

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about this, it's none of our intention for this to happen and definitely this is not the experience we want for you.
</p>
<p>•So, what we will going to do right now is that, please run&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a> , this will fix the hidden issue of your device.<br />
•After, we need to do the Windows update, Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Updates &gt; Check for updates.<br />
•Restart after the doing the Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep me posted the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />

<h2>            Windows XP default games</h2>
                    I have Windows XP on a Dell computer. I can't play my games such as: Free Cell, Solitaire and Etc. I have tried to Search for the file Free Cell, It is still in the Prefetch file and when I try to open it, says that Windows can't read the file. Also tried
 to go to Windows Components to click the box for games and says that I have to insert a CD. My CD/DVD driver does not work. Is there anyway that I can go to a website to try and download these games again and reinstall them?

            <blockquote>Microsoft should make a link to be able to download these games when all else fails to be done. People like me don't have the means to go out and spend money they don't have to be able to do what they need to do. I have priced CD/DVD drives and
 they are expensive for what I need. Sorry this isn't a question and I'm not mad. Just thought Microsoft should have a link.</blockquote>
<p><br />
I'm not sure that they could have planned for your CD/DVD drive not working/being defective.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>Use a friend's computer, make an ISO image of the Windows XP CD, put that on a USB drive, bring it to your machine, use a program to mount the ISO image as an&nbsp;virtual CD drive and&nbsp;get what you need&nbsp;that way.&nbsp; (First option I thought of.)</p>

It keeps telling me that I have disconnected from the app. My wifi has a strong connection and it was working perfectly fine this morning. I have tried singing out and then back in, deleted the app, changed wifi, and even used data.&nbsp;Every time it disconnects me from my party. My app and phone are both up to date.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This is the procedure to use the backup registry however it probably will not help in this case.<br />
<br />
There are backups in the C:\Windows\System32\Config\Regback folder.</p>
<p>Here is an article for XP and Vista is similar in scope. The config folder, and its contents should<br />
be rebuilt.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
This could be a serious error and need tech support from a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks<br />
at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Vista disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Vista or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though the titles<br />
are named differently.)</p>

==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

<h2>            Log-in and re-installation errors &#40;including 0x803F8001&#41; for XBox Live games</h2>
                    <div>Until Tuesday (NZ time) I was able to play all the XBox Live games I had installed on my computer. That included Solitaire, Jigsaw, Minesweeper, Mahjong, Ultimate Word Games, Sudoku, and Taptiles. I also had premium subscriptions for most of them. However,
 except for Solitaire, Jigsaw, and Minesweeper, most of them are now glitchy in different ways.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For Mahjong and Word Games, my one year premium subscriptions have disappeared, even though they weren't close to expiring. For a short period I wasn't able to log in to them either. After I did a system restore back to about a week ago, I was able to
 log in to them once again. So I am able to play those two once more, but without my premium subscriptions. I can't even renew the subscriptions, as when I click on the banner recommending a premium upgrade, I get a message which on Mahjong says "There was
 a problem connecting to the Windows Store. Please make sure the Windows Store is working and try again."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Then for Sudoku and Taptiles, they are worse. While my premium subscriptions for them are still there, as best as I can tell, they either won't log in to my XBox Live account, or I have trouble reinstalling them. I tried to reinstall Sudoku, hoping that
 would fix it. However, in the Microsoft Store I kept getting error code 0x803F8001, until the system restore, which did eventually lead to Sudoku reinstalling, although it still doesn't log in. After Sudoku reinstalled, I tested the uninstall/reinstall solution
 with Taptiles, now I'm getting the same error code trying to reinstall that. I don't want to do another system restore just to reinstall it, knowing full well it wouldn't fix all my problems anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing other games and apps from the Microsoft Store, e.g. Bingo, and that worked fine. The game even logs into my XBox Live account. And just so you know, the XBox Live App works fine as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already looked for and tried other solutions, including running wsreset.exe in the Command Prompt (Admin), I have tried resetting individual games in Apps &amp; Features, I have even tried re-registering the Microsoft Store app, but none of these have
 worked. On top of all that, I ran the troubleshooter for apps, but still no fix. What bugs me the most is that these problems appeared out of the blue. I didn't make any changes to my computer immediately prior to these problem arising, that might have caused
 them. So I'm not sure if the problem was caused by anything at my end, or if it was a result of something from Microsoft, e.g. upgrades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that on the Microsoft Sudoku Facebook page, other people are stating they're having problems with that game, while referencing the same error code. So I want to know what can be done to fix this, that is if the solution requires my doing something;
 anything, seeing as how others experiencing problems with the same game has me doubtful that the cause of this problem and its solution is at my end.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi!<br /><br />The following is a trick from another user:<br /><br />I cleared my game cache, closed the store, rebooted my computer, tried reinstalling the game and it worked.<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_store/trying-to-load-microsoft-jigsaw-get-error-code/2f402dae-a160-4786-8383-f23173fd2ff0">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a><br /><br /><br />I fixed . I had second profile on my laptop, so I downloaded Magic Jigsaw puzzle on that profile and then signed into FB. I used the same FB that I used with one I am having the issues with. Then went back to the first profile and tried to open the game the error was gone. <br /><br /><br /><br />ok not sure why it worked but i logged into the store (on the same computer im having issues with) under an account i made for my son and was able to reinstall the jigsaw puzzle game. once it loaded it logged me into my actual account and everything is working fine now. Not sure why 
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So the first solution, clearing the cache for the games, did not work. However, logging in to the Microsoft Store with another account, even though I had to create a new one, that did work. It at least fixed the installation and login problems. So thank
 you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I just need to fix the problem with the premium subscriptions for Mahjong and Ultimate Word Games.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You’re welcome.
<br />So, you can try this suggestion:
<br />
<br />I was able to do it after a few tries. 
<br />A tip: when you are re-registering your games and apps, wait for awhile.
<br />Both Mahjong and Word Games are back (at Premium) and playing fine.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/microsoft-mahjong-is-currently-not-available-in/beadc30a-a3ba-4aa0-b6ee-7997386e52fa">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<h3> michaelgibb1  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So that solution did not resolve my subscription problem. I did eventually manage to fix it though. It required uninstalling Mahjong and Word Games, then reinstalling them using the new Microsoft account, and then logging back in to the Microsoft Store using
 my primary account. Opening each game after that has restored my premium subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So everything is good and back to normal now.</p>

<h2>            Open Letter to the Xbox Development Team</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Xbox Development team,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears we have some apprehensions form the community about your recent decisions regarding your new Xbox. The community wishes to address this issues with you in an attempt to get some kind of further insight in to your design decisions. The following
 is a list of some of the most frequently voiced concerns about your new Xbox design:</p>
<div>1. Always on "or call back home every 24 hours" connection
<a href="http://kotaku.com/xbox-one-does-require-internet-connection-cant-play-o-509164109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
source</a></div>
<div>a.This issue is mostly opening some fresh wounds with EA's new Sim City game and the severe server issues it had,</div>
<div>b. If this is a real requirement you will be blocking out gamers with limited or no Internet connection (you won't see complaints form the gamers with no connection on these forums because... well... no Internet connection)</div>
<div>c. It looks like the majority of your player base does not want this, they want the Xbox to play games just as well off line as on.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>2. Kinect required to use Xbox <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/05/qa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
source</a></div>
<div>a. A lot of your core gamers were very underwhelmed by the current generation of Kinect because of</div>
<div>A. amount of room required to use it (it is impossible for me to use a Kinect in my apartment i don't have a room with the depth of spaces it requires)</div>
<div>B. Lack of responsiveness (does not "feel" as natural as you say it does)</div>
<div>C. lack of top end game support (a lot of your fan base feel that the Kinect games are "kiddish")</div>
<div>b. There was little information given on the topics above (only one covered well was responsiveness)</div>
<div>c. (tin foil hat time) It seams a lot of your core users do not want a camera and microphone that is connected to the Internet always watching/listening in the living room/bedroom/game room</div>
<div>A. With the U.S. Government's recent push to have back-doors in to computer systems (Facebook, Google, cell phones) (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/17/how-the-fbis-online-wiretapping-plan-could-get-your-computer-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">source</a>)
 so that they can pull up information on people with out their knowledge or a warrant this seams like the NSA's wet dream.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>3. Used or 2nd hand game ambiguity
<a href="http://www.joystiq.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-may-require-game-installs-close-out-used-game-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Source</a></div>
<div>a. A majority of the core users do not want to have to pay full price for a used item, or any amount back to the maker it is wrong and goes against
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
first sale doctrine</a></div>
<div>b. The way you are dogging the questions about how the new Xbox with handle 2nd hand games makes your users think the worst is the answer</div>
<div>c. If there is a fee to Xbox after a user buys a 2nd hand game from a retailer (like GameStop) this will be a deal breaker for a lot of your users.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>4. Backwards compatibility <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/05/qa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
source</a></div>
<div>a. There are gamers who hold on to all the games they ever bought (example I still have every game I ever for the NES, N64, Xbox, and Xbox 360) and we like to go back and play them from time to time.</div>
<div>b. This is more of a convenience thing, those gamers don't want or don't have the room to have all those consoles connected to their TV.</div>
<div>c. If the new Xbox is as powerful as you say it is and is built on the windows Kernel (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/windows/posts/10151507631687669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">source</a>) why can there not be an emulation
 program in the system to run the 360 games?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>5. The focus of your game console seams to be wrong
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xboxone/meet-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
source</a></div>
<div>a. You make an exceptional game console! Let the awesome games be what drives the new Xbox, the other things can be cool secondary features.</div>
<div>b. When you spend more time talking about a game consoles other features then its gaming you make the Core gamers uneasy, because that makes us think there was less time spent on the gaming features and capabilities.</div>
<div>c. Three games does not a gaming console reveal make.</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I have covered all the main points (I am sure I will be corrected here in the forums if i missed something)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to end with saying this has been a generalisation, this does not reflect all of your user base's opinions, and it should not. Games are a diverse group of people and making us all happy is a difficult task, but we are also lenient and sometimes
 forgiving. I think you are up to the challenge Xbox please don't prove me wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forever Fragging,</p>
<p>Mike "REV G33K" Tauler</p>

<p>Well put. &nbsp;A lot of people are ranting about different aspects of the new console, but this seems to sum things up pretty well. &nbsp;I know that with my family, the secondary game market and having to log your console into the internet every so often are the
 big concerns.</p>

<p>That is why I said it was more of a "convenience thing" I don't think being not backwards compatible is a game breaker just that I don't see why it can't be done.</p>

<p>Backwards capability is huge for a lot of people. Your telling everyone that the games they just bought " some big titles coming up guys" are nothing but trade in value. (= crap) madden and battlefield are nothing junk. Terrible idea in a lot of people's
 eyes. Ok so now someone will hop on here a d say "then don't buy anything until the new games come out" yeah that's not the answer, and if I was a developer I'd be pretty upset with this as well.

<p>While backwards compatibility wont affect whether or not I buy the new console, it will have a lot of bearing on WHEN I buy the new console if I ultimately decide to do so. &nbsp;With backwards compatibility, I would be looking at the system from the start. &nbsp;Without
 it, I will be more inclined to give the system a year or two until the price drops and there is a substantial library of games available for the console.</p>

            What is the error message you get when you try to use Sage 50 on Windows 10?
<br />
<br />According to makers of Sage:
<br />
<br />If you use Sage 50 Accounts and have recently upgraded to a Windows 10 computer, you may also need to upgrade your version of Sage 50 Accounts.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.sage.com/en-gb/products/sage-50c-accounting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sage.com/en-gb/products/sage-50c-ac...</a>
<br />
<br />We'll fully test and support future versions of Sage Accounts on all operating systems supported by Microsoft, including Windows 10.
<br />Current versions
<br />
<br />Tip: If you aren't sure what your version number is, you can check it in your software in Help &gt; About.
<br />
<br />New installations of Sage Accounts
<br />
<br />If you're installing Sage Accounts for the first time after installing Windows 10, the following versions are fully tested and supported:
<br />
<br />    Sage 50 Accounts v23
<br />    Sage 50 Accounts v22
<br />    Sage 50 Accounts v21
<br />    Sage 50 Accounts v20
<br />    Sage 50 Accounts v19
<br />
<br />Existing installations of Sage 50 Accounts
<br />
<br />If you have Sage 50 Accounts 2013 (v19) or above installed on your computer and you upgrade to Windows 10, your software is still supported. However, if you have any issues you may need to reinstall your software.
<br />
<br />Sage 50 Accounts 2012 (v18) and below is not supported on Windows 10.
<br />
<br />So, you need to determine which version you have the upgrade it or reinstall it.

    <title>YouCam Software is not working. All program icons are now YouCam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angus8275  say:</h3>
<h2>            YouCam Software is not working.  All program icons are now YouCam icons.</h2>
                    <p><em><u>Original Title: </u></em><strong>I don't know what's wrong! Or how to fix it!</strong></p>
<p>Ok so it basically started with the malfunction of YouCam on my windows 7. I un/re-installed the drivers for it and nothing happened. I wasn't sure if I did it correctly. So then I went looking through the YouCam folder in Program Files and found the driver
 installation file, named CLDrvInst.exe. So I right clicked and went Run as Administrator and incurred my problem. Now whenever I try to open any program (Google Chrome, iTunes, ANYTHING!) it just opens YouCam (which still doesn't work). The icons for most
 programs and applications have been replaced with the YouCam icon, although it still comes up with the correct file names. I tried to System Restore, but even that merely opens YouCam! My theory is that when I ran CLDrvInst.exe it set the YouCam driver to
 every program (including System Restore). I haven't tried un-installing Youcam yet as I wasn't sure if that would help. But I really do not know what to do. Please Help.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you facing the issue with other Start Screen apps?</span></p>
<p><span>2. When you say “<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Since the update everything worked fine”, are you referring to the Windows 8.1 installation?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Do you remember making any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Do you have any third party antivirus software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could be related to any recent hardware changes on the computer and Windows Store stopped to sync properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try the following steps and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try to reset Windows app Store and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to clear Windows Store cache memory:</span></p>
<p><span>a. On the desktop screen, press
<strong>Windows and R</strong> key to open run box.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong>
WSReset.exe</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try the steps provided by Syed N, Forum Moderator form the thread link and check.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-windows_store/i-upgraded-to-windows-81-and-now-when-i-try-to/5bdb6831-5395-4b07-a305-295242846c43?tm=1383671402936">I
 upgraded to Windows 8.1, and now when I try to start some of my apps, they just flash and then crash, and it just goes back to the Start screen.</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: The above mentioned link contains steps to uninstall antivirus software. Make sure you have the setup files or media available to reinstall the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>Important: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if the Date, time and Time zone is set correct.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to set the date and time:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>
Windows key + C</strong> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<strong>Date and Tim</strong>e” in the charms bar search.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click Change date and time button.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click <strong>
Apply and Ok</strong> to save the date and time.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Click on the Time Zone tab to check the Time Zone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also check if the Proxy setting is enabled. If enabled, try to disable the same and check:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
a. Press <strong>Windows Key +R</strong>, type <strong>inetcpl.cpl and press enter.</strong><br />
b. Click the <strong>Connections tab</strong>, and then click <strong>LAN settings</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Uncheck the <strong>
Use a proxy server for your LAN check box</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click <strong>
Ok</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 5:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists you may try to re-register the Windows Store app and check. Refer to the suggestion provided by “<strong>Luis Cantero</strong>” from this MSDN blog:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/notime/archive/2013/10/18/fix-store-app-in-windows-8-1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/notime/archive/2013/10/18/fix-store-app-in-windows-8-1.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Make sure you enter these commands in elevated mode. Follow these steps to do so:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>
Windows key + X.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Click on <strong>
Command prompt (Admin).</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:

</strong></span><span>Serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before
 you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to backup registry.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press “Windows key + R” from keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “regedit” without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the “drop down arrow next to “Computer” (to make sure you see only “Computer” option is listed there).</span></p>

</p><p>Since the issue got fixed after performing the Refresh of the PC, the issue could be related any corrupt installation of Windows 8.1 or corrupt system files.
</p>
<p><span>If the PC came with Windows 8 and you upgraded it to Windows 8.1, your recovery drive will include Windows 8, and you’ll need to always upgrade to Windows 8.1 after you perform a Refresh or Reset of your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Important: </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop

<p>Can you elaborate on what you did to 'refresh' your pc? I too cannot run STORE. PC is only about 3 mos. old and was working fine. Didnt have a need to use STORE that much but it always worked. Now the screen comes up with loading animation and thats it.
 CPU usage also above 40 percent for STORE and STORE BROKER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had Answer Desk on pc for 2 hours to no avail after they tried the usual recommendations like WSRESET, etc.</p>
<p>

    <title>Old Hard Drive not working on new PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomw99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old Hard Drive not working on new PC</h2>
                    I got a new PC yesterday, and i wanted to transfer data from my old broken PC to my new one. So I removed the hard drive, got a Dynamode usb enclosure and plugged it in, however now I am having massive problems...<br />
The hard drive did not always work it is very inconsistent, however it did once or twice and i managed to access all of my old files (after playing with some permissions and taking ownership) but it was late and did not have time to mess around transferring
 what i needed. So i set out to do it today, however i cannot access it at all now. I feel I have tried everything and been trying for about 4 hours, so thought i would get some expert advice!<br />
<br />
[u]So.. The Problem[/u]<br />
I plug the hard drive in and the blue LED on the chassis starts flashing and the disk starts spinning.<br />
I then get a "Local disk (E:)" appear in "This PC" and a "Safely remove hardware..." icon on the start bar.<br />
However in the This PC window, the address bar at the top, &nbsp;is loading the green bar slowly and just stops when it is full and under the Local Disk (E:) there is no information on capacity, (blue bar and 51gb free of 102) like my other two internal drives (C:\
 &amp; D:\) . When the hard drive worked yesterday the capacity info would be there and the green bar would have stopped "loading" it was kind of an indication I could click on it without my PC crashing...<br />
<br />
So what if i left or right click on the E:\ drive whilst it is "loading" ... Well file explorer becomes unresponsive and crashes if I end the task in task manager my screen goes grey and i have to restart the PC, however if i just unplug the hard drive it responds
 again instantly. The strange thing is it also catches up with what I have done for example, if I have right clicked it will flash up the drop down menu for a split second or left clicked an empty E: window will appear for a split second.<br />
<br />
The drive also appears in device manager and within this I can access properties which says "the device is working properly" and in the events log it had been configured and started, but that is as much as I can do.I have also uninstalled all external drives
 from device manager including the usb. This made no change.<br />
<br />
I have plugged in my other 2 external HDD separately, into the same USB port I am using for the hard drive and they work perfectly one takes (F:\) the other takes (E:\) path. I don't see that one taking E as well as a problem, but correct me if i am wrong??<br />
If i open disk management and plug it in, it will crash. If i open disk management after it has been plugged in it gets stuck on connecting to virtual disk service.<br />
I have ruled out the possibility that when i changed permissions and ownership of the drive this has messed it up because like i said it was inconsistent yesterday before I had done it, but again correct me if i am wrong?<br />
I also have up to date Bitedefender anti virus protection on this PC and my old PC and have run scans using Malwarebytes and roguekiller and got nothing!<br />
Yesterday when it did work and I initially began to transfer a few of my files the transfer speed was very slow ranging from 0 bytes to 1mb/s, average probably 300kb/s. Could this be an indication of something wrong?<br />
<br />
So I am stuck on things to do, I am thinking yesterday when it worked roughly three times i could have just been lucky! I literally just need about 10-15 GB of photos and data from it then I don't care what happens to it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am using a Dell Laptop my previous Laptop was also a Dell Laptop. Running Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;Tom<br />

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cause of it not being recognize or at times, gets recognize but could not get good results could be cause by the hardware itself and not with the new PC. To have the issue sorted out, it would be best
 to check on your PC’s manufacturer on what could be done to retrieve your files on the old hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have other queries, feel free to ask us.</p>
