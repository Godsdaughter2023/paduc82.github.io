<h2>            Mercenary Matchmaking</h2>
                    
<p>One of the reasons I quit MW3 in the first place was because I lagged so much more in&nbsp;a party than I did when I was solo &amp; I hate playing solo because most of the time I'd rather play 1v6 than have 5 randoms on my team. So, I decided to try Mercenary and
 I noticed something in the 20 or so pre-game lobbies I was in: in 9/10 of them, the 5 highest scores from the previous match get put on the same team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, I've been in pre-games lobbies where I was the only new player in the lobby, and when the teams were split up, the highest score on 1 team was lower than the lowest score on the other team. My frustration should be obvious -- I'm always put on the
 low-scoring team. Isn't this counterproductive to the spirit of the gametype?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal? Or is my sample size just too small? (preemptive <em>that's what she said</em>...)</p>

<p>For the size of the teams there are in mercenary TDM, it's near impossible to be "swapped" or even notice. For the most part it's for people who are in parties but want to play against eachother every once and awhile, but it's just easier to switch between
 FFA and regular TDM. Personally I prefer team tactical. The teams are small and the randoms, for when I played in mw2, actually played the game the way it was supposed to be played. Plus, most are a lot more communicative, rather than the music, high pitched
 rapping, or all-around d-bagness.</p>

<p>What are you talking about? How is it "near impossible" to split up the teams evenly by score when there's no parties allowed in the gametype -- ie, the lobby is 12 randoms 100% of the time. What you wrote makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, people who are in a party &amp; want to play against each other CAN'T play in Merc because no parties are allowed. They'd have to leave the party and join session, but even then, the lobby would still be 12 randoms 100% of the time.</p>

<p>merc is basicly the same as the standard game modes, it seems there is no mix when it comes to seperating the players into teams. it always puts the same players in the same team every match, also i don't see no fairness in putting all the 0 prestigers low
 level into one team against all the high prestigers, it just picks randomly instead of making the teams abit more balanced. &nbsp; &nbsp;p.s: seeing mercenary never over 2000 players it gives you a very slim chance of finding a game between 50-75ms at times anyway :(</p>

<p>In reg dom teams/parties are allowed though, so if you're seeing high scores put on the same team, they may be in a party...</p>

<p>What frustrates me about the mercenary playlist is not that it doesn't allow parties, but that it allows Xbox Live parties. Most of the time, when I go into that playlist, nobody's communicating as a team even though it's a team-based playlist. Even though
 the game is filled with random players, it doesn't prevent people from using Xbox Live parties like in the search &amp; destroy playlist &amp; that drives me crazy! Games in the mercenary playlist would be so much better if it ALSO prevented you from using Xbox Live
 parties. This way, it forces players to use in-game voice &amp; would help promote teamwork &amp; communication; then that in turn promotes fun, socializing, &amp; making new friends, making for a better community overall. I find it odd that Infinity Ward went with a
 lose-lose over a win-win...</p>

<p>Galactic Geek: I'm going to go ahead and disagree. Even if I'm not in an XBL party, I'll start one up by myself when I'm playing MW3 solo so I don't have to listen to the loudmouth squeakers or online tough guys or people that blast rap music or the people
 that make annoying noises during the loadscreen when you can't mute them or see who's doing it.

<p>---</p>
<p>You must have sensitive ears if you can't last the 5 seconds through the loading screen to mute them. You do know that your TV probably has a mute function, right? ;p</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>My advice is to mute everyone on the other team right away, while you're still in the menus; this works best outside of the mercenary playlist, especially if you're partied up with friends. Also mute anyone on your own team that you find disruptive. If you
 can't take either of those actions (like in the mercenary playlist, since you won't be able to tell who'll be on your team until too late) use my advice above &amp; mute your TV until the match starts, then mute the opposing team &amp;/or disruptive players; or you
 could simply mute everyone while in the menus &amp; then unmute those that end up on your team once you've started the match.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Although I can understand your frustration with disruptive players like the ones you've mentioned, I think you're doing yourself &amp; other players (like me) a disservice by not having an open line of communication &amp; teamwork. Take steps to silence those that
 annoy you, but don't overdue it &amp; lose out on an opportunity to have a greater chance at having fun &amp; making new friends.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>1) Which version of Windows7 are you using?</div>
<div>&nbsp;Is it Windows 7 Home Basic or Premium or any other version?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1: You may follow the steps mentioned below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open control Panel and go to Administrative Tools.<br />
2. In Administrative tools open Local Security Policy.<br />
3. In Local Security Policy right click Software Restriction Policies and click “New Software Restriction Policy”.<br />
4. Now Left click on software restriction policies and in the right-hand window you should see enforcement.<br />
5. Double-click on enforcement and set the policy to apply to “ALL USERS EXCEPT LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS”<br />
Approve the changes and check if you’re able to uninstall without any error message.
<br />
Make sure that you enable UAC once it is done.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<p>I know that I can do so in MS Outlook - type in Snooze field. But there I can't find any way to activate that field so I could enter there something.

<p>
</p><p>But thats pointless. In some Windows Phone forum there was a thread with same subject - for many years.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;No changes from Microsoft. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same retorical question like there in forum - do MS employers use MS software? Do they all have Windows phone, do they have in their computers Win 10 and they use that Calendar app?&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't belive . . .

<p>
</p><p>That sounds like the Log On Properties for the Service are somehow incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Star button/orb and in the box enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<p>Press the Enter key to open the Services applet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Services applet find the Windows Time Service, right click, Properties and make the Log On tab look like this (the Local Service account has no password):</p>

<p>
</p><p>After clicking OK to save the change see if the Service will start now.</p>

    <title>Windows for Workstations Licensing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianfp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows for Workstations Licensing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to keep using ReFS so need to be running Windows 10 Pro for Workstations (W10PfW) on a new PC I'm building. For flexibility I also want to have retail not OEM licenses so that I can transfer it to any new PC I build since I tend to refresh this PC
 (as in replace with a totally new self-built PC) every few years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm reading the Microsoft stuff that I see on the web correctly then I don't actually need to buy a regular Windows 10 Pro license first because Windows 10 Home direct to W10PfW is a valid upgrade path. If I have read that right then this is my plan and
 I would be grateful for comments on whether it will work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Buy a retail version of Windows 10 Home and install and activate it on my new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Go to the online Windows Store and buy W10PfW (UK price £149). It says in the description of that product that "Your use of this new software is subject to the terms of your original Windows Operating System License Agreement" so I assume that, since
 I would be buying from a PC with a valid retail license activated, that the W10PfW upgrade that I bought would inherit the transferability characteristics of the underlying Home license and not be locked to the current PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding now is that, although running the standard Win 10 Pro version was not a licensing prerequisite for buying the W10PfW upgrade, had I been running standard Win 10 Pro then the upgrade would simply have involved a new license key that would
 enable the W10PfW features already in the standard Win 10 Pro binary so no reinstall necessary. Since I would be taking the slightly cheaper route of upgrading from Win 10 Home however I would now need to jump through a couple of extra hoops...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Re-install the PC with Windows 10 Pro (the standard/only version because there is no specific W10PfW ISO download available from the Microsoft site).</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Activate my new Windows 10 Pro install with an XXXXX- ... -XXXXX format key that I assume would have been delivered to me when I purchased the £149 W10PfW product from the previous Win 10 Home installation on this PC. Or maybe the activation servers would
 already see the fingerprint on my machine as being entitled to run W10PfW so would automatically enable the new Win 10 Pro installation in W10PfW mode so all features such as ReFS formatting already enabled with no need to reenter the key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The End? I now have my PC running a fully licensed and activated copy of Windows 10 for Workstations under a retail license so that, if I wanted to replace my PC in a few years time I would be able to transfer the license across to the new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I understood all this correctly? I'd like to be sure before I go ahead because even with only buying the Home version the initial purchase of Win 10 Home Retail + W10fWS upgrade is a not insignificant amount of money so I want to be sure that it will
 buy me what I think it will, i.e. a fully transferable license (retail licensing terms) of Windows 10 Pro for Workstations.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 BIOS Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew bourgoine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BIOS Problem</h2>
                    So I was installing Windows 10 to my little Brother's laptop, when at the end of everything, the laptop restarted, and would only boot into BIOS. It wouldn't even load into Windows 10. After many attempts to get Windows to boot, we loaded an install onto
 a USB, and then attempted every installation method we could from the USB, even wiping the drives and partitions to perform a clean install, and windows 10 will NOT install on this laptop. Additionally, everything is gone now and the laptop is stuck. Has anyone
 had a problem like this, or been able to fix something similar to this issue?

                    <p>Just got a new MSI gaming laptop - the GS63 and very excited to use it. However, I've realised the CPU is running at 100% (in Task Manager) which causes the fan to run very loudly.</p>
<p>

                    I have windows 7 64bit and I can use the xbox 360 controller on it just find but the ring of light will not stop blinking. Apparently the quadrant lit is supposed to signal which "port" it is plugged into, but this just isn't happening.

            I had this same problem and it was caused by bad driver installation.&nbsp; To fix it here is what you should try:<br />
<br />
Plugin your controller<br />
Click start&nbsp; <br />
Click control panel <br />
(under hardware and sound in blue letters) click view devices and printers<br />
<br />
VERIFY THE UNKNOWN DEVICE IS YOUR CONTROLLER FIRST BY UNPLUGGING IT FROM YOUR COMPUTER AND SEEING THAT IT DISAPPEARS OFF THE LIST<br />
<br />
(If there is an unknown device) right click it and click properties<br />
Click the hardware tab <br />
Click the properties button<br />
Click the change settings button<br />
click update driver<br />
Click browse my computer for driver software<br />
click let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer<br />
scroll down until you see Microsoft common controllers for windows class<br />
double click it <br />
(On the list in the box that open select:) if you are using a wired controller: xbox 360 controller for windows version 2.1.0.1349 [8/13/2009]...if you are using a wireless receiver and controller: xbox 360 wireless receiver for windows version 2.1.0.1349 [8/13/2009]
<br />
click next<br />
&nbsp;(in the new box that opens) click yes.<br />

<p>&nbsp;I post this a week ago the update I put on March 10 destroyed my 360 they said it was not it then he said it could have cause it this is a way for customers to either buy another or repair, this updates are destroying 360 trying to tell people. They know
 this but tell you there not going to fix your game I think there&nbsp;should be a complaint filed,they send another update to try and fix what they have done but some are already destroyed Microsoft this is your FAULT.</p>

He's right, all you're going to get here is a bunch of people with the same issue and then another group of [rude] people telling you updates can't brick a console. I personally have't had this issue though my xbox is really old but there has been documented
 issues like this. Good Luck and Happy Gaming.</span></p>

<p>[quote user="SwellSuperior94"]How come it doesn't kill all Xboxes?[/quote]Because the actual update isn't causing the problem. It's the components used to do the update that cause the problem (like failed flash memory). Since the components used&nbsp;for firmware
 updates aren't used at any other time only a flash will expose if they're gone bad.</p>

<p>Well, i didn't even WANT the update...i had kept my console totally original from 2007 right up until November 2011, when i brought a new game Halo Anniversary...which loaded the NXE update to my console (i had no idea this was happening until i quit the
 game and got the shock of my life) I suddenly had all this stupid, childish avatar rubbish all over my screen and i could no longer play all of my 11 xbox games...WTF?</p>
<p>Posting about this on here has already gotten me banned 4 times, obviously, they don't want others to know that a long time customer (who's spent thousands on their products) is very unhappy about their tampering with my personal property...</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, when i call them on this, they just trot out the same old answers...sorry but you didn't play those games because they aren't on our list...and sorry, but we don't support those anymore (like they have any right to disable my property
 from working with legal copies of xbox games)...</p>
<p>XBOX is a joke, they have NO idea how to treat customers and couldn't care less whether you loose out in their update roulette, as long as your console has the latest update...all ready to consume more of their products, which they probably won't support
 next week...</p>

 plan for those xbox consoles. &nbsp;And let me say this, this incident happened less than a year ago-- we are not out of the clear, LOGICALLY or RATIONALLY, from similar incidents occurring once again. You may not like the term 'brick' but if MS confirmed [in 2011]
 a connection between an update and a system failure, then it's so-- just accept it. You're really not helping anyone by coming in here and disputing something that MS itself confirmed not even a year ago. If you can't settle for that, just post a link to one
 of your previous posts because it's a colossal waste of time to keep repeating yourself.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    Ok, the title might sound confusing. But my audio is coming out both my speak and headset but my computer isn't able to read that my headset is there on device manager nor audio control panel. I have reinstalled my audio drivers multiple times and still
 no avail.&nbsp;I am currently on a HP Laptop 15-bs0xx, if that helps.

            Hey John.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is the biggest issue we're seeing right now so I'd expect a Windows Update being pushed soon to correct the Audio issues caused by the most recent Update.  
<br />
<br />If you want to try to fix it first then   try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />1) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />3) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />4) Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br /> 
<br />While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />5) If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />6) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />7) Since it's likey caused by Windows Updates  you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />8) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> 9) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />10) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />----------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            We appreciate your response. To further isolate what's causing this error to appear, we would like to know if you have tried using a different brand of blank disc for this. Also, when trying to create a recovery disc, do you have a third party antivirus
 program running in the background?<br />
<br />

<h2>            &#34;Display driver stopped responding and has recovered&#34; Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A number of times over the past few months my display driver has quit working momentarily (either by freezing the screen or having everything go black) and recovering after a few seconds. These were always isolated incidences, not really close together,
 with the worst one turning my display off completely and not recovering, causing me to restart my computer manually. However, today this happened about 6 times in 2 hours, where it would freeze the screen, and (thankfully) manage to recover every time. This
 is the most this has happened in such a short time period. If it helps, I was often on social media when the crash would occur. I've also checked my driver, which is up-to-date. My laptop is between 4-5 years old, so it could be as simple as its wearing out,
 but I'd like to find other solutions before I have to invest in a new computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Meg</p>

            Hi megbabs, it is more than likely a driver incompatibility issue . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters section
<br />Select your graphics card, right click and choose properties, then click on the Driver Tab
<br />
<br />Please provide a screenshot of that dialog
<br />
<br />Please also provide the Make and Exact Model No. of your system . . .

<h2>            Why is my system boot-up much slower after the Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a high performance HP DV6 laptop and i put in a samsung 840 EVO 240GB SSD. The normal boot time for Windows 8.1 is around 10 to 15 seconds to boot up to the login screen and another 5 to load everything up after login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 a couple of days ago and i just noticed (laptop is on most of the time :D) that it takes around 90 seconds for it to boot up now. checked few times to verify that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To elaborate on that, when switched on, the BIOS loads swiftly, then the windows 10 logo comes up and in about 2 seconds, the screen goes black and the keyboard is unresponsive. Thats less then 5 seconds after switching on and remaining that way for another
 80 to 90 seconds after which the login screen shows up and everything is normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Jesinta</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting didn't turn up anything, all was fine there i guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In safe mode, it booted up in well under 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i tried the clean boot. Which included disabling all services other then the ones from microsoft and all startup programs. But no luck, the boot was delayed with the signs i mentioned earlier. So i reverted everything back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i forgot to mention one detail before. My display being an LCD display, there is a difference between the screen doing black/blank and switching off. In my case, during the 90 seconds delay i mentioned earlier, the screen actually is off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Do you have an AMD CPU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem on my laptop and was finally able to figure it out<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;and fix it. It was caused by the generic SATA controller driver Windows 10 installed for the AMD SATA Controller
 in my system. I had thought of this before and downloaded the latest chipset drivers from AMD but I didn't realize the installer didn't update the SATA controller driver. I had to do it manually in Device manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So for anyone else with an AMD based system that's having this problem, give this a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the latest AMD Windows 10 Chipset drivers at http://www2.ati.com/drivers/amd-catalyst-15.7.1-sb-sata-ahci-win10-win8.1-win7.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the installer which will extract the files to your hard drive and&nbsp;may update some other drivers. When it's done, reboot your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open device manager by right clicking "Start" and then click "Device Manager". Look under "IDE ATA\ATAPI Controllers" and then right click on "Standard SATA AHCI Controller" and click "Update Driver Software". Click on "Browse my computer for driver
 software" and then browse to where the AMD installer extracted the files. It should be "C:\AMD". Make sure the box for "Include subfolders" is checked then click on "Next". It should update the driver and rename it to "AMD SATA Controller". Click on "Close"
 and then reboot your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it, after rebooting you should be good. I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>lol, nope but i found the problem. Its the GPU, not the processor which is a 2nd gen i7 quad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GPU however is an AMD Radeon HD series along with an integrated Intel GPU offcourse. After i read your last reply, it just struck me and i tried to boot with the AMD card disabled and it booted in around 10 seconds....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird part is even after i manually updated the GPU's driver, the problem isn't solved.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi Likhitha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages... booting is as normal as it can be except the black screen which appears after 3-5 seconds of the windows logo and lasts for about 2 minutes after which the sign in windows appears (just trying to be accurate :)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for &nbsp;method 1, i guess the problem is pretty obvious since disabling the AMD GPU alone does the trick.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boots up pretty fast in safe mode too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont understand the need for method 2, since the problem was there during the first boot after i updated my windows 8.1 to 10 and did persist even after a clean install of windows 10. Infact this is one of the reasons i did the clean install in the first
 place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for method 3, latest drivers are installed i double checked with all possible options on that part....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iam guessing its a glitch with the AMD driver and OS interaction which iam assuming AMD has to figure out and fix. Not sure....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rarely reboot my laptop, but when i do, its kinda frustrating, not because of the wait, but because of the SSD being rendered useless :D...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have the same problem since moving from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>My configuration is:<br />
&nbsp;- PC = HP Pavilion dv6-6022ez<br />
&nbsp;- Display adapter = AMD Radeon HD 7400M series<br />
</p>
<p>Symptom: At every boot I see a roughly 80-second pause during the boot sequence with a black screen (with backlight). This occurs between the Windows 10 logo display and the login screen. &nbsp;I see the same pause (but with no backlight)&nbsp;when awakening the PC
 from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AMD Radeon driver seems to cause this 80-second "coma" (so to speak), since disabling this driver does indeed prevent the coma. However, without the correct driver, the display is inacceptable (incorrect resolution, etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried following and combining the suggestions given by people on other sites:</p>
<p>- Turning "fast startup" off, and then on.</p>
<p>- Installing various versions of the ADM driver: old version, newer version, and the latest "beta" version.</p>
<p>- Searching for a display-related option in my BIOS settings (there aren't any!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 80-second coma also&nbsp;occurred during these AMD driver installations and updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our beloved suppliers are not optimistic:</p>
<p>- HP doesn't officially support Windows 10 on this PC.</p>
<p>- AMD doesn't officially support this "legacy" display adapter on Windows 10: the best they can offer is a "beta" version which doesn't fix the problem.</p>

            <p>I think its kinda unfair to ask support for a 4+ years old laptop from the vendors, hence my initial post here. Anyways, mine gave in a couple of months ago (motherboard issue). In the long run, unlike desktops laptops are mostly use and throw kinda machines
 i guess.</p>

<h2>            Transfer of settings and files between user accounts</h2>
                    I have windows 10. Recently my start feature failed to work and there are are several options to sort this online. One I used was to create another user account. The 'start' button works on this and the instructions are to transfer settings and files from
 the old user account to the new one. The only option available appear to be to copy and post actual files/folders between the two but how do I transfer all the settings i.e. desktop, apps, programs, screensaver etc etc?

</p><p>But, you can only&nbsp;transfer files from the infected User Profile to the newly created User Profile. Why because, the installed apps, applications (I.e. Some applications) or Programs are dedicated to that particular User Profile. You cannot transfer or move
 them to newly created User Profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need, then you need to re-install those apps, application and programs in newly created User Profile. There might be chances where a new Cumulative update which will roll out in future will fix the corrupted User Profile. So that you can use that
 old profile again without any issue.</p>

 the Microsoft ID on my computer and then start a new Microsoft ID... .just a pain in the neck, all because Windows 10 doesn't work properly.&nbsp; That is why I'm considering moving to another platform.</p>

<p>I loaded Rosetta Stone in Windows 7. When I start the program, I get the message, "Application error 2111." This program runs in Widows XP so I ran the program compatibility utility. No LucK! Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
