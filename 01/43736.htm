<h2>            Surface Pro 4 ignores power settings when plugged in unless I reboot</h2>
                    <p>I have the SP4 with all of the latest updates, including the recent May 2016 updates. If I reboot my machine when connected to the Surface Dock, it honors the power settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I sleep/hibernate and use it, then resume/reconnect with the Surface Dock, it ignores them and continually shuts off my screen within 2-3 minutes, goes to sleep, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a major pain to wake the SP4 up. I just tried to log in and it hung trying to turn the Hello camera phone so switched to PIN. Sometimes, it simply will not resume at all without repeatedly pressing the power button. Since the screen never comes on
 when I am doing this it is presumably going to sleep, waking up but not fully waking up, going to sleep again, however many times I need to do it until it actually wakes up and turns the screen on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all the absurd power management issues aside, how do I get it to honor the power settings I have set, which is to not go to sleep when plugged in and not turn the screen off for 3 hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often I get frustrated and just reboot and then I am good until I disconnect/reconnect from the dock again. But sometimes, like now, I have a lot of things open an rebooting would be very inconvenient.</p>

<p><span><span>There can be many different reasons why Skype cannot access a webcam. There can be a driver issue, there can be a privacy filter blocking webcam, etc. Without information from DxDiag
 it is very difficult to make a qualified guess. At least, I can't.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Under Saarthal glitch&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I took a wrong turn early on in Under Saarthal and didn't meet Arniel, instead I found the amulet and did the rest of the quest, including killing that hard SoB draugr. Once done, I went back the College of Winterhold to tell the Arch Mage and was unable
 to find him. Is this because I&nbsp;didn't find Arniel and the other artifacts? And if I go back and find them will it sort the problem?</p>

<p>I don't think the number of artifacts matter, my first play of that quest I missed one ring and it didn't affect anything. Arniel is easy to miss but just points you to the right spot. He shouldn't matter but then neither should Dirge and he did. The arch
 mage is always someplace. When Toldir sends you back to the college the arch mage should be sitting in a chair in his quarters upstairs in the Hall of Elements. Did you flag the quest in your journal to see where he was? Since you didn't hit every point he
 might be someplace else. The other common place to find him is in the courtyard by the statue. BTW the artifacts are 2 rings plus the amulet, use the flag in your journal to find them in the shadows on the floor. Starting again should sort it out if the arch
 mage is truly missing.</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice Lady B, I eventually made my way back to the college and found the Arch Mage straight away. Not sure if it was a glitch or just operator error, doh!!!

    <title>Office 2007 Crashing&#47;Hanging Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -jhs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2007 Crashing&#47;Hanging Up</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>About a month ago, my Office 2007 apps began crashing by incessantly hanging up</strong>. Most of the time, a given app (esp Excel and Word, which are what I'll reference here) would hang on startup, but on occassion, the app would start OK but would
 still hang at unpredictable times. <br />
<br />
At these times, I would have to force-End the app and re-start it -- usually over and over and over again -- before, for some unexplainable reason, the app would start fine and run fine -- but 95% or so&nbsp;of the time, only for a while (the other 5% of the time,
 the app would run fine until I quit it, but I suspect only because I quit the app before such time as it might hang --
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> because it was suddenly "OK").
<br />
<br />
I read a Microsoft KB article that said <strong>if Word 2007 hangs, type winword.exe /a into the Run dialog box</strong>, and doing so almost always (about 95+% of the time) starts Word without it hanging. But it does not keep Word from hanging as it's being
 used. (NOTE: I don't know whether starting Word this way starts it in some kind of a Word "safe mode", ala Excel.)<br />
<br />
Another KB suggested that if Excel is hanging, <strong>create an Excel shortcut script
</strong>created by a provided utility. That one does not always work. Even stranger, if I repeatedly click the shortcut after Excel hangs at startup&nbsp;and I force-End it,
<strong>eventually Excel will start -- and give me the option to go to Safe mode.
<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>It doesn't seem to matter whether I choose Safe mode or not </strong>related to whether the app consequently hangs, though -- although it
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">seens</span> like it hangs more often on app startup if I choose Safe mode than when I don't (I have no collected data to support that -- it just seems like it).
<br />
<br />
<strong>If it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">does</span> consequently hang and I force-End it, the next time it attempts to start -- seemingling regardless of how I re-start the app
</strong>(in Excel's case, e.g.,&nbsp;whether by using the shortcut script or attempting to start the app directly) --&nbsp;<strong>I will be presented with a dialog box asking me if I want to start the Office Repair utility.
</strong>At first, I always answered Yes to that question, and the repair utility would dutifully do whatever it does. But it never made any difference related to repairing whatever is going on, so I quit running it after executing it probably 10-15 times.
<br />
<br />
Additonally, <strong>whenever an app would hang and I would force-End it, I would go into Processes to see if the process was still active</strong>. It
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">never</span> has been.<br />
<br />
The only two apps that I have <strong>installed</strong> in past month or so&nbsp;are <strong>
Revo Uninstaller</strong> (which I continue to use), <strong>and</strong> <strong>
Zsoft Uninstaller</strong>, which I used only once to do an uninstall and then uninstalled Zsoft Uninstall itself, as I liked Revo more. I share that because (1) you need to know what I installed relatively recently, and (2)
<strong>it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">seems</span> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
like</span> these problems started after I uninstalled Zsoft Uninstaller</strong>. Again, I have no data to support that assertion, but it is the only thing I can hang my hat on that seems to be in the right time-frame as to when this Office 2007 app-hang problem
 started. Please note that <strong>I am <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> claiming the Zsoft uninstall created some anomaly with Office 2007</strong> (I don't want to be unfair to the makers of Zsoft products, as their product may have had
 nothing whatsoever to do with this situation) -- <strong>only that the timing of the two events (uninstalling Zsoft Uninstaller after one use and Office 2007 beginning to hang) seems right</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">STEPS TAKEN TO TRY TO RESOLVE OTHER THAN ABOVE</span><br />
<br />
</strong>Besides what&nbsp;I've described above, I have tried everything else I can think of to resolve this issue (other than switching to OpenOffice) &lt;jk&gt;. For example:<br />
<br />
1. I am maniacal about running registry cleaners, and I have five that I use regularly to keep my registry in good shape. Unfortunately,
<strong>deep registry cleaning appears to have no impact whatsoever on this issue</strong>. (NOTE: After each attempted resolution step I take, I run the registry cleaners -- always after doing a Restart first. To date, this has had zero impact on the problem.)<br />
<br />
2. <strong>I completely uninstalled Office 2007</strong> <strong>using the</strong> Microsoft
<strong>Add or Remove Programs</strong> <strong>utility</strong>, then ran alll the registry cleaners I have on-board (again)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">after</span> doing a Restart when instructed and after the final update (even though not instructed to do so by the Windows Update utility). (NOTE: I'm pretty maniacal about doing clean boots, too, after doing any kind
 of maintenance work and/or updating on a step-by-step basis -- meaning I never try to do more than one maintenance step -- such as running Windows Update or running&nbsp;the registry cleaners or doing an uninstall&nbsp;-- before re-starting. I thought it&nbsp;important that
 you know that.)<br />
<br />
I then re-installed Office 2007 from CD, re-started, ran all the registry cleaners, went to the Windows Update site, installed all updates for Office 2007 -- including re-starting when instructed while running my registry cleaners after each Restart and re-starting
 after the final update. <strong>The problem continues unabated</strong>;<br />
<br />
3. <strong>I completely uninstalled Office 2007 again, this time&nbsp;using Revo Uninstaller</strong>&nbsp;(believing it goes deeper into clean-up than the Windows "Add or Remove Software" utility does) and going through the same routine as above.
<strong>The problem continues unabated</strong>;<br />
<br />
4. <strong>I used the latest version of McAfee Security Suite with the latest updates to do several deep scans</strong> as I performed the above steps, just to be sure.
<strong>It&nbsp;has never found anything</strong> other than a PUP. (NOTE: I did not just install McAfee for this purpose -- I've had the suite up-and-running for years now. I don't want you to think that I just installed it after running into this issue.)<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PLEA<br />
</span></strong><br />
I am at a complete loss as to what happened to cause this other than what I state above, or what is going on, or how to fix it. I would think there is a registry issue somewhere vs, say, a Process issue or a Services issue. But then, what do I know?
<br />
<strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I would deeply appreciate hearing how others resolved this problem.</span>
<br />
</strong><br />
I am <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> particularly interested in responses that describe having basically the same problem I am having
<strong>unless</strong> those responses also include how the issue was resolved, or include details of attempts at repair that I have
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> described above. No offense to anyone intended, but if you are simply experiencing the same problem that I am and you haven't been able to resolve it, either, and you haven't tried any other steps to attempt
 to resolve the issue other than what I describe here, please <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">don't</span>
</strong>write to tell me that.<br />
<br />
Thanks much.<br />

            1) Registry cleaners are a good way to trash your system, if you dont know how to manually edit the registry dont bother.<br />
Since you have, as you stated, been maniacal about using them there is no way of knowing what damage your registry has suffered, and a reinstall of an app wont neccesarily repair the damaged registry.<br />
(The MS Installer cleanup utility is NOT reccommended to be used with Office 2007)<br />
<br />
If this was my sys I would run a memory test, <a href="http://www.memtest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> by creating the bootable floppy or cd, and also the bootable hd utility available from your hd makers site.<br />
If all those test come back ok, I would then use <a href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.dependencywalker.com/</a>&nbsp;(An MS tool) and run eg Word through the tool to see if it revealed the faulting module<br />
<br />
But at the end of the day you might want to consider nuking the sys, reinstalling win and the proper hardware drivers (NOT from MS Update) then once critical updates have been done then reinstalling Office, and update again.<br />
Then test *before* installing anything else<br />

 Thanks for the attempt to help. I apologize for getting back to you so slowly. First, I checked the box to let me know when there has been a post to my question, and as often seems to happen, I was never notified. Secondly, I was diagnosed with cancer a few
 days after my post, and I've been a little pre-occupied with that ever since (How's THAT for giong for the sympathy card?).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I agree with your assessment related to registry cleaners and the like. While I admit I go overboard with them, I have stopped using all but the three I consider the most reliable and have been helping me keep my system running like a fine-oiled
 machine for years. I also have not had trouble with this issue until now, so I am pleased overall with the cleaner results. Unless you are a registry guru, I can't fathom how you keep your system/s running cleanly without using some type of registry utility.<br />
<br />
ANYHOW, getting down to the nitty-gritty, I am not going to reinstall my whole XP system just to try to solve this issue. I can live with it -- I jus hate it ... but not as much as starting all over. Besides I plan to move to 7 here in the mext month or so.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, I want to thank you very much for your quick response and for trying to help me out. Take care ...<br />

<h2>            Window disappears when cursor is moved.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 - In a program, if I have a dialog box and click on an option, I can see the list. If I move my cursor to select an option, the drop down box &amp; selection disappears. The same happens on the task bar and even in Windows search. Sometimes if I hold
 the mouse button down and drag it to the selection, it works, the keyword being "sometimes". Not only is this very annoying, but it makes some programs almost impossible to use. It almost looks to be some kind of priority or switching problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this POS HP computer about a year ago and it will not let me resume my participation in the Insiders Program, says "My organization manages Insider Preview builds through a telemetry group policy setting" There is an option to "fix this" but the
 selection is greyed out and can't be changed.</p>

            <p>OK.. So here's what I cam up with after 3 days and 2 hard drives...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset the computer to "Factory Reset" after backing up all my files on another drive. I then reinstalling the OS from the factory image on hard drive.&nbsp; I booted up and downloaded Firefox (Edge is WORTHLESS since it doesn't allow importing bookmarks from
 any other browser, except Internet Exploiter).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I played around with "fluffware" programs and things were normal. Of course Windows Update kicked in and had many updates available. I also installed several programs I normally use and again the problem resurfaced. Start from scratch again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I let all the updates install and played with the "fluffware". This time everything was normal. I installed my programs 1 at a time and checked. Everything was normal UNTIL I installed a program from Ashampoo called WinOptimizer 14. Voila! Things
 went back to the disappearing issue! I tried to uninstall WinOptimizer, but the problem persisted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, with a fresh drive and all the updates (including the version to 1607), things were normal. I installed the programs I usually use, EXCEPT the WinOptimizer. Low and behold, everything wored as it should. I took a chance an installed another Optimizing
 program (Advanced System Care Ultimate 10) and was amazed at the tings that program would do. After uninstalling things I didn't want in Win10, including the games and X-Box, I rebooted and things just went smoothly, as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll play with this for a week or two and see how things run, but right now, I'm oretty sure something within WinOptimizer screwed the system up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a beer!</p>

                    <p>I have windows 10. I am having a problem with the ENTER PIN box opening when I am on the internet trying to fill out a form. Example, I am on a airline site trying to set up a flight and the box opens, I close it and try to open a drop down box and it pops

            Hi Frank,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for posting your query in Microsoft Community and welcome to Windows 10 family.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand that the Enter PIN window keeps popping up whenever you try to access internet. We will certainly help you with this. Before going further, we would like to know more about the issue. Please answer the following questions.</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Does your account have Administrator privileges?<br />
2.&nbsp;Is this problem concise to one particular website?<br />
3.&nbsp;Which browser do you use to access websites? <br />
4.&nbsp;Have you tried to open with Internet explorer without add-ons?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Turning off and removing add-ons<br />
</strong>Add-ons can sometimes cause browsers to run slowly and crash, or they might pose a security or compatibility risk. You can turn off specific add-ons to help increase your browsing speed, or if you suspect they're causing problems for Internet Explorer.
 You can also remove add-ons that you're no longer using from your PC. It's a good idea to delete add-ons if you suspect they're causing performance, compatibility, or security problems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow the below steps to turn off add-ons.</strong></div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Open the desktop, and then tap or click the <strong>Internet Explorer </strong>
icon on the taskbar.<br />
2.&nbsp;Tap or click the <strong>Tools </strong>button, and then tap or click <strong>
Manage add-ons.<br />
</strong>3.&nbsp;Under <strong>Show</strong>, tap or click <strong>All add-ons</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Tap or click the add-on, tap or click <strong>Disable</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>Close</strong>.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Post us back with the results. We will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that you are facing issue with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed,&nbsp;m<span>ost programs created for earlier versions of Windows will work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. You can run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter on most programs to help detect
 and fix common compatibility problems.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note</strong></span><strong>: </strong>
Don’t run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter on antivirus programs, firewall software, backup software, disk utilities, or on system programs that came with Windows. This might cause data loss or create a security risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the methods provided below and check if you are able to run <strong>
Phoenix RC Simulator</strong> in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>In the search box,&nbsp;type<strong> run programs</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</strong>, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose&nbsp;the program you want to fix. If you don't see the program in the list, select
<strong>Not Listed</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Next</strong>, and then follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></li></ul>
<div>
<p><span>If the troubleshooter can't fix the problem, try changing compatibility settings manually.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p>Change compatibility settings manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be informed, these steps will not work with apps that come with Windows, or with apps you get from the Windows Store.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>In the search box,&nbsp;type the name of the program, right-click the search result, and select
<strong>Open file location</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right-click the program icon, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and then select the
<strong>Compatibility </strong>tab.</span></li><li><span>Select Windows 8 (</span>Runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Try this setting if you know the program is designed for (or worked in) a specific version of Windows<span>).</span></li><li><span>If you want to apply the settings for that program to all accounts on the PC, select
</span><strong>Change settings for all users</strong>.</li><li>You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When you're done, select <strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>These are to of the most recent DirectX files ( if 2010 can be called recent). Try running the DirectX Web Installer.
</p>
<p>This will install these two files if they are not already present in your Win10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If these files are present you will see a message to the effect that your DX is up to date.</p>
<p>If they are present they may be corrupt.</p>
<p>In this case you can either reinstall DirectX using the full DX installer, or delete the two files above</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- DirectX out of the way and still getting the error ? Try doing a copy/paste of the d3dx9_43.dll and X3DAudio1_7.dll from System32 to the Phoenix RC&nbsp; install folder.
</p>
<p>You also may want to post on one of the Phoenix RC forums, as this may be a common issue with the sim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"is there a compatibility mode that will work?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Probably not. 'Run as admin' would be the first option I'd try. </p>
<p>The rest is experimental. Windows version that is contemporary with the release date of a game</p>
<p>can help, but using compatibility when not necessary can also prevent games from running.</p>

<h2>            Battery 2 0&#37; and not charging following Office 365 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Book which is just 2 years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently replaced my office 365 business subscription with an office 365 home subscription, which entailed uninstalling and reinstalling office 365. Since then, Battery 2 will not charge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick web search suggests a Registry corruption or overload is a fault, however I'm reluctant to buy such fix-it software without a proper diagnosis. Windows troubleshooter doesn't help, and neither does the downloadable repair tool.</p>
<p>Any suggestions, e.g. return to a system savepoint prior to the office change (in which case would office still work)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in the UK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Andrew Brown.</p>

<h2>            Activation</h2>
                    <p>Excuse me, my English is not good.</p>
<p>Hi, I have a digital license assigned to my MS account (it was received via Insider Program) and everything was fine until today (4.11.2019). Yesterday (4.10.2019) I received a system message like "<em>your account needs attention</em>". I reassigned in
 and some time later I installed updates <strong>KB4495666</strong>, <strong>KB4493478</strong> with PC restarting. All was fine. I sent PC "to sleep". Today (4.11.2019) I woke up my pc and got a system message "<em>activation needed</em>", in
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt;<strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>&gt;<strong>Activation</strong> there is
<strong>Error code: 0xC004F213</strong>. "Troubleshoot" gives no positive result. I went to&nbsp;<strong>account.microsoft.com&nbsp;</strong>and in tab
<strong>Devices&nbsp;</strong>there are two PCs with the same name but physically I own only one. The first one dates Last check 4.11.2019, the second Last check 4.09.2019.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro, Version 1903, Installed on 4.09.2019, OS build 18362.53.</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to resolve your problem with Activation 
<br />
<br />I believe the most reliable solution is to attempt to force activate your copy of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below: 
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key+R to open the “Run” box. 
<br />
<br />2. Type “cmd” into the box and then press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to run the command as an administrator 
<br />
<br />3. At the command prompt, type the following commands: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs -ato 
<br />
<br />4. Press "Enter" on your keyboard 
<br />
<br />5. Type 
<br />Exit 
<br />to exit the command prompt 
<br />
<br />6. Restart your computer 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if the above process fixes the issue!       
        </p>

<h2>            Family Safety Windows 10 - Child Activity not Appearing</h2>
                    <p>Child received a new Win 10 laptop, I setup a new Microsoft Account for the child, added that account to Family (also on Win 10) as child, but no activity shows in report after several weeks. &nbsp;No browser activity (Edge activity is frequent), no app activity
 (frequent and observed use of Fresh Paint, Spotify, etc) and no screen time logs (on laptop several hours/day with absolutely no screen time shown). &nbsp;I have removed and re-added child, followed numerous MS links from other posts to do the same (check that
 account and Family Safety are properly configured) to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One curious observation - another child uses a surface pro (Win 10) and is a child under the family account. &nbsp;Under his name on the family screen it shows a "device" hyperlink that reveals the surface pro he is logging on to use. &nbsp;Family Safety activity
 is being logged and reported with no issues. &nbsp;No such "device" link is present for the newly added child even though her device (Dell Inspiron) is displayed on the Devices tab on the Family Account page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me figure out why I can only view activity for one child (the one with a Surface Pro) and not the one with a Dell?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Although the HP support forum is a good place to ask this question, I have some doubt whether you'll actually get a useful answer.&nbsp; As far as I can see, the main suggestion there is to completely uninstall and reinstall the HP printer software.&nbsp; That may
 or may not work.&nbsp; I didn't notice any positive responses to such suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're willing to take a few more diagnostic steps, perhaps I can suggest something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you want to connect the printer to your computer:&nbsp; USB or wi-fi?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, is anything related to this printer installed?&nbsp; For example:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Click Start, type Programs and Features into the Search box, and press Enter.&nbsp; If there are any HP-related programs listed here, what are they?</li><li>Open Devices and Printers.&nbsp; If there are any HP devices shown here, please list them.</li><li>Still in Devices and Printers, select (click once) any item in the "Printers and Faxes" section.&nbsp; Now click the link at the top for "Print Server Properties."&nbsp; Select the "Drivers" tab.&nbsp; If there are any HP-related items shown here, please list them.</li><li>Select the "Ports" tab and scroll down past the LPT and COM ports until you get to FILE: .&nbsp; Please list any ports that appear after FILE:</li><li>Make sure that your OfficeJet 6962 is powered on.&nbsp; Click Start, type Fax and Scan in the Search box, and Press Enter.&nbsp; Click the "Scan" button at the lower left.&nbsp; Click "Tools" in the menu bar and then click either "Scan routing" or "Scan settings."&nbsp; Was
 the scanner selected or not?</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;Sorry if seems that I bailed out on you yesterday. I got a call from my 90 year old mom saying she needed to go to the Dr. she is fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am trying to connect using a usb. OS is windows 7 ultimate. Following your instructions none of this seem to work when I get into devices and printers there no fax section I have to look in comp. c; drive to find printers and faxes there is no tab in
 the devices and printers for print Server properties. There is no ports tab there are no Items with a green circle with a check in it.&nbsp; This is my wife's computer and I am starting to think that she has a severely corrupted operating system even though several
 virus programs and malware adware programs claim other wise.</p>

<p>If "Devices and Printers" isn't on the Start Menu, then click Start, type &lt;&lt; Devices and Printers &gt;&gt; into the Search box, and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should see a screen like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that there is NO "Printers and Faxes" section?&nbsp; That would be very unusual.&nbsp; You should at least see the "Microsoft XPS Document Writer" and you previously said that you had an icon there for the HP 6960.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that there is at least one item in the "Printers and Faxes" section, click on that item and you should now see the link to "Print server properties" --</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/979ff589-89a5-49a3-9c52-36f846e88518?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/979ff589-89a5-49a3-9c52-36f846e88518?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on "Print server properties" you'll get this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Click on the "Ports" tab to see the list of ports and report what, if anything, is below "FILE:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click "Cancel" to close that window and go back to the main "Devices and Printers" window where you see the HP 6960 (at least you said that you had seen it there) and answer the following questions.&nbsp; If there is no longer an icon for the HP 6960, please
 let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to the "HP 6960" that is in Devices and Printers:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is there a warning icon next to this item?</li><li>Is there a white check in a green circle next to this item?</li><li>If the answer to 2 is "No," which item does have the white check in a green circle next to it?</li><li>Right-click the icon for the HP 6960 and select "Printer properties" then select the "Ports" tab</li><li>If there is a line in the table in the "Ports" tab that is highlighted and checked, what is shown in the "Port" and "Description" columns for that line?&nbsp; You probably will have to click and drag on the faint vertical line in the
 header row between "Port" and "Description" in order to see the full width of the "Port" column:<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The list of ports that you see when you go to Print Management is in a different order than the one you see if you click on the "Print server properties" link in Device Manager.&nbsp; The Print Management list is in alphabetical order while the other list is
 in the order that the ports were installed/created.&nbsp; If you would rather use the Print Management list, please expand the "Port Name" column so you can see the complete names and then include a screenshot of this in your reply.&nbsp;

<p>Hi AceRmk,</p>
<p>This issue can be caused by a program or memory error.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check in safe mode:</p>
<p>“Start your computer in safe-mode”: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> If the error does not appear in safe mode, then perform clean boot:<br />
To put the computer in clean boot state follow the steps in the article “How to perform Clean Boot”<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Once you find out which program is causing the issue, verify through the developer's web site that all updates or patches that may be available have been downloaded and applied.</p>
<p>If no patches or updates are available, attempt to uninstall and/or reinstall the program that is causing the issue.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Upgrade to Windows 10 Because of Nonexistent Incompatible Application</h2>
                    <p>Hi. This is my first time asking a question, but I'll be straightforward and detailed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Gateway brand laptop that's currently Windows 7 in Simplified Chinese (don't askme&nbsp; where I bought it; it was a birthday present). I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 10, but the little app at the bottom tells me that I can't upgrade yet because I
 have incompatible software that must be upgraded or uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The software turned out to be Microsoft Office Click-to-Run (I think 2010, but I forgot). So I uninstalled it using Control Panel, but the little app keeps saying that MOCTR (for short) is still here. I even downloaded one of Microsoft Fix-It applications,
 but the MFI can't even find MOCTR anymore. Windows Update won't even look for the Windows 10 upgrade package until MOCTR is uninstalled. I don't know what to do.</p>

            <p>Go to windows updates and click on Updates Available for your computer. Look for update&nbsp;&nbsp; number&nbsp;KB2952664 and click on it and it will highlight then press enter key on your computer. It should download the update on your computer. If it won't update then
 it will show a Microsoft repair&nbsp;tool link and click on it and the repair tool will find out why it wouldn't accept the update and the tool will correct the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have successfully downloaded the update you will have made a reservation with Microsoft to receive the free download of Windows 10 in the next few weeks. If you want to check for sure&nbsp;after the update is done just go to Microsoft.com&nbsp;and as the
 home page loads you will see a big box at the top of the page saying "Your reservation for windows 10 has been received and you will be receiving the download in the weeks to come. Hope this will be of help to you?</p>

<h2>            Cannot Extend C Drive with Disk Management</h2>
                    <p>Hey Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to increase the size of my C drive with Disk Management but when I right-click on it the "Extend Volume..." is grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading the answer on <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/cannot-extend-a-partition/d10ed64f-49fe-41eb-811e-04180feb3725">
this</a> page, I shrink the D drive and create a J drive from the free space. &nbsp;I move all the files from the D drive to the J drive, but there are some system files (around 4 GB in size) that I cannot move. &nbsp;When, in Disk Management, I right-click on the D
 drive, the "Format..." as well as the "Delete Volume..." is grayed out.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a supposedly music CD, but all I find inside is .cda files. I tried to open them separately with Windows Media Player, but none worked as I expected, nor does the CD shows in Media Library. After several very helpful humans responded to my question,
 I tried to eject the disc and reinsert it while having Media Library on the screen, and the content of the CD loaded correctly.</p>

<h2>            Computer goes to blue screen and then shuts off.</h2>
                    For the past 2 months I have had the problem with my computer suddenly going to a blue screen and then quickly shutting down.&nbsp; I just had a new hardrive installed and it is still doing the same thing.&nbsp; The guy who installed the hardrive for me said that
 the computer was left on overnight at his place and it never shut off once.&nbsp; Then I get it home and it does the same thing and I get a screen with the error Status: Oxc0000002 and says that a recent harware or software change might be the cause.&nbsp; I am unemployed
 and my computer is my lifeline to finding a new job.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?

<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div><font>&nbsp;</font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then
<em>Tools</em> tab, then click <em>Check Now</em>. Tick <strong>BOTH</strong> checkboxes then Start. Reboot. This will take overnight.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>SFC</strong></div>
<div>Check for file corruption by clicking <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><em>sfc /scannow</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Heat</strong></div>
<div><font>Heat can cause problems like this and also sudden reboots without crashing. Ensure your fans are not clogged with dust.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For Memory Diagnostic Results</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start</em> - <em>Control Panel</em> (and select <em>Classic</em> view in the left hand pane) choose

<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font><strong>Dump Files</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>
<hr />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Upload Them for Analysis</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Or upload the minidump files to your Public folder on Skydrive and copy the link from the address bar and I'll analyse them.</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Revert to windows.old&#63;</h2>
                    <p>my laptop had a power interruption and couldnt boot afterwards. &nbsp;I tried the windows 10 recovery disc but that still didnt fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i downloaded the windows 10 installation tool and tried that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i now have a fresh, bootable but very empty Windows 10 installation (64bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice the windows.old folder still has all my old stuff (data, program files, downloads, basically everything)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>is there a way of reverting to my old installation? &nbsp; I read some articles about how to revert to previous versions of windows but that isnt my case. &nbsp;Im trying to revert to a previous instance of the same version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is it possible? &nbsp; It would save me hours of reinstalling all my apps and settings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 10 64 bit with all the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any advice much appreciated.</p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'm assuming since Windows couldn't start that you ran a Custom Install but didn't clear the hard drive (which doesn't get it clean and therefore isn't a superior Clean Install) so that it archived your files in windows.old.  Unfortunately there's no way to roll that back.  
<br />
<br />To find your programs and set it all up optimally I'd refer to this Clean Install tutorial which includes everything that must be remembered in the preparatory steps and then how to replace it all in the Setup steps after install.  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can skip the actual install steps unless you want to back up your files and do it over to get a much better install than one which doesn't even wipe the hard drive and therefore is not clean.  You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />In the future if you have problems ask us here so we can guide you how to do the relevant repairs.  You can also bookmark this tutorial which includes everything that can be done to start Windows if it's won't:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for both the replies.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly, they didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to clean install and i'm now recovering all my apps and settings app by app.&nbsp; Very painful!&nbsp; But a nice clean install can't be a bad thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery option didn't show any option to revert to a previous version.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think my boot record must have gone bad - I couldn't even get the Dell Factory Reset to ever show up.&nbsp; (So I had to find all the right drivers too!&nbsp; Ow!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm nearly back up and running now.</p>
<p>thanks for trying!</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Gold Auto-Renewal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonokoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Gold Auto-Renewal</h2>
                    <p>When you create an Xbox account, does it assume you want auto-renewable? I barely play my xbox (let alone with other people) so there's no reason to (and I don't remember) setting up auto-renewal. Now I've been charged $9.99 every month for like a year and
 I've never gotten a single email or notification about it, the only reason I found out was because I was going&nbsp; through my statements. I know how to turn it off but I want to know if this is like a default setting or if somehow i accidentally turned it on.
 I would like all that money back but I'm afraid they'll refuse if it was in fact I that turned that setting on (which like i said i really dont think I did). Thank you.</p>

            If you set up Xbox Live Gold and pay with credit/debit card or PayPal, it will automatically start a renewal as you are entering a subscription service. You can go to&nbsp;<a href="HTTPS://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HTTPS://account.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;and
 cancel that auto renewal in services and subscriptions section.

<p>Hi, yes it is the default setting and it says that it will be auto renewed monthly when you first set your account up, so unfortunately i dont think you will be able to claim that money back, if you follow the link&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/xbox-subscriptions/how-to-cancel-xbox-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing/xbox-subscriptions/how-to-cancel-xbox-subscription</a>&nbsp;then

<p>I believe it's a default setting to auto renew if you've used a direct debit/credit card. Though there is an option to turn off auto renewal though.&nbsp;</p>

            When you set up your xbox live account and you decide to add a method of payment in order to make use of the membership, it's always good advice to check the billing and purchases registered under your account. Once you give the consensus of these payments,
 it's your priority as customer to cancel the payment or keep using the live service.&nbsp;

                    Hi. I've just received an e-mail from Skype saying "Your subscription expires soon. Just to let you know, that your 'World 60 mins mobiles and landlines - 1 month with Office 365' subscription expires in 3 days." My understanding is that my Skype subscription
 is connected to my Microsoft 365 subscription, and given that my Microsoft 365 subscription won't expire till January 2019, why my Sky subscription will be expiring in three days?&nbsp;

    <title>I just discovered my wifi adapter is set as an Access Point - Intel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ckbeme  say:</h3>
<h2>            I just discovered my wifi adapter is set as an Access Point - Intel said it is not capable of being an Access Point</h2>
                    <p>I was on the Intel support forum with about 10-12 posts about this problem. I was updating the drivers for the adapter, and looking at</p>
<p>the properties, and it said Network Type: Access Point. &nbsp;My adapter is a fairly high end Intel Dual Band AC 7265. When I contacted their support, they had me check a few things, and I sent them screen prints of my adapter settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is software called Vistumbler, free, and it tells you of any access points in your area. It also shows the MAC address, the SSID&nbsp;</p>
<p>the users are connected to, and the Router Manufacturer. Well, when I ran this program, sure enough I saw my Router Brand, I saw the 2 channels I had defined for both bands on my Router, and my SSIDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel said it had to be a setting in Windows, where a Mobile Hotspot got setup. They said it might have been done when I was hacked</p>
<p>back in July. The gave me this link, and when I go to it on the laptop, it doesn't have the options that are listed in the link. Here is the link:</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/c60dcfa3-c596-41d4-8c1a-b0d738e1d9fd/use-your-pc-as-a-mobile-hotspot</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inserted a pic of the page that link gives you. It's below my comments here.</p>
<p>When I follow the instructions, there is no Mobile Hotspot option. I am on an Ethernet connection on my Desktop, running Windows</p>
<p>10 Pro 1607</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try it on the laptop, the one that has an access point in the wifi adapter, it doesn't have a Mobile Hotspot option either, and it's still running Windows 10 Pro 1511</p>
<p>
</p><p>So are the instructions wrong? &nbsp;I'm super concerned about people having access to the laptop, especially when I just did recover (mostly) my data on my desktop. Laptop hasn't been fixed yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router has a firewall that lets you block IP address, or block a protocol/port combination. But the software that shows all the APs only show the MAC address. And this is really complex software - I don't even know if the MAC addresses (there are two)
 that show on&nbsp;</p>
<p>the report are the users MAC, or does my laptop have 2 extra MAC addresses cuz it has an Access Point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know NOTHING about access points. How do people get into them? Isn't there some security that they have to bypass?</p>
<p>I appreciate any help.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you in disabling your WiFi adapter being an access point, here are helpful information:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to disable a wireless Hosted Network in Windows 10</strong><br />
<br />
While the setup of a wireless Hosted Network in Windows 10 is not very complicated, Microsoft doesn't make very straightforward to remove the configurations when you no longer need the feature.<br />
<br />
Although you can use the stop or disallow commands, these actions won't eliminate the settings from your computer. If you want completely delete the Hosted Network settings in Windows 10, you'll need to modify the Registry.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important: </strong></p>
<p>Before you change anything settings on your computer, it's worth noting that editing the Windows Registry can be a dangerous game that can cause irreversible damages to your system if you don't know what you are doing. As such, it's recommended for you to
 make a full backup of your system or at least System Restore Point before proceeding with this guide.
<br />
<br />
1. Open the Start menu, do a search for regedit, hit Enter, and click OK to open the Registry with admin rights.<br />
2. Scroll down the following path in the Registry:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services\wlansvc\parameters\hostednetworksettings<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the HostedNetworkSettings DWORD key, select Delete, and click Yes to confirm deletion.<br />
<br />
3. Restart your computer.<br />
4. Open to the Command Prompt and use the following command:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; NETSH WLAN show hostednetwork<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; * You will know that you have successfully deleted the settings when the Settings field reads Not configured.<br />
<br />
5. Make sure you turn off "Internet Connection Sharing" in the physical network adapter that was sharing the internet with other devices. Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu, and select Network Connections.<br />
6. Right-click the network adapter, and select Properties.<br />
7. Click the Sharing tab.<br />
8. Uncheck the Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection option.<br />
9. Click OK to complete the process.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Things you need to know</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the wireless Hosted Network feature in Windows 10 allows you to implement an access point solution to share an internet connection with other devices, it's not meant to be a solution to replace a physical wireless access point.<br />
<br />
Also, there are a few things you want to consider. For example, wireless speeds will dramatically be reduced compared to the rates provided from a physical access point. Perhaps it would not be a big deal for internet browsing, but downloading or transferring
 big files could be an issue for some users.<br />
<br />
You also need to consider that your computer needs to be always turned on to act as a wireless access point. If the computer enters into sleep, hibernate, or restarts, your wireless hotspot will stop working, and you will need to start manually the feature
 using the NETSH WLAN start hostednetwork command.<br />
<br />
You cannot run a SorftAP and ad hoc at the same time on Windows. If you need to create a temporary network connection between two computers, setting up ad hoc will turn off SoftAP — you can run one or the other, not both at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

            <p>Jeserel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help. I'm creating restore point as I type.</p>
<p>But I don't think you read my post very thoroughly... I didn't create an access point. I believe I said Intel and I</p>
<p>discussed the matter, and we both thought the Hackers must have created the access point when they broke into</p>
<p>my PC. &nbsp;And I was asking how to keep people out of it, how to disable it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never wanted an AP. Don't need an AP. This was just a mystery, and I've been searching everywhere for an answer on how to "Disable an Access Point". I should have come to you guys sooner, but I was going to network forums</p>
<p>and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One page I found on Msft gave me a shell command, I thought it was netsh.... something profile</p>
<p>and when I entered the command, I got a result saying something about ALL Users Profile. Can you tell me the</p>
<p>command that might be that has a result of All Users Profile?</p>
<p>I just did the command you asked me to do, and I'm confused at the results. Im also going to give you a pic of the program I mentioned that shows APs in my area.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/268c8dd6-7a64-4821-a714-3d8bd28c02fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/268c8dd6-7a64-4821-a714-3d8bd28c02fe" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f5c243a-8775-4e7a-bb4a-05de11fa9f2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f5c243a-8775-4e7a-bb4a-05de11fa9f2b" /></a></p>

 forum and they told me my specific adapter doesn’t have the ability to be an access point. I quoted Intel where they said the only way my adapter could be an AP is if someone setup a Mobile Hotspot in Windows.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>Jesrael is the one that took that and ran. I simply don't want any security leaks due to having an access point that I DID NOT SETUP/DEFINE. I don't want or need an access point.</span></p>
 an access point.&nbsp;</span></p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">A&nbsp; " 'Soft' AP "&nbsp;is established ONLY by yourself. It cannot be established by any hackers.</p>
<p>well, I definitely did not setup a Soft AP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So you say? Well the reason I made the post was BECAUSE my wifi adapter says it's an AP. My Netgear router has an Option to create an AP, but I disabled that first thing.</p>
<p>Now that you've summed up and said the problem is that my wirelss adapter or router is radio-ing the neighborhood, how about a solution? &nbsp; And why do you assume the Netgear Routher could be subject to hackers, NOT the Soft AP? For one thing, according to
 your post - I don't have any SoftAP adapter - I looked at the device mgr as you suggested.</p>
<p>My router is shut down pretty tight. I use the router firewall AND the windows firewall, and the ESET Smart Internet Security firewall. So in my mind, the wifi adapter that says it's an access point is my giant security hole.<br />
<br />
</p>
 and installed it on my desktop about 2 weeks ago. During the install, software asked if I wanted this to be an Access Point. I said NO. Well, my USB wifi adapter I bought for desktop also shows as AP. Photos to explain the problem a little better, hopefully.
 If indeed you, Jesrael, and I are saying the same things, but using different terms for</span></p>
 my connection.</span></p>
 to get help and to hopefully learn something. I admint when I have a lack of knowledge on an issue. I wouldn't be posting a question on here if that were not the case.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had your trouble in mind and just yesterday I bumped into an information, that might help in your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all and again you should not be alarmed of an 'AP' or the term 'AP'. An 'AP' ist per-se just a sender of a signal.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 'router' sends a signal to feed a receiver such as your computer's ethernet adapter&nbsp;(by cable)&nbsp;or wireless adapter (through air)&nbsp;and so a router sends its signal by wire or wireless, Thats why you need it. It's questionable, why we still use routers, as
 we could think about connecting a phone/cable line directly into the PC.&nbsp; Think of the router as being a radio that has a plug for speakers. The radio receives a signal and routes/sends it to the speaker plug. A speaker connected to that plug by cable (=ethernet)
 or via air (=wireless) will play a sound. So the radio is nothing, but an AP for the speaker .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe my hopeless illustration (I just made that only for you) helps to understand, why e.g. INTEL told you that their adapter cannot be a sender (=AP). An adapter is never a sender! Hence cannot be hacked to become one.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f43fd129-2eb6-4041-b214-bc170dffb8d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f43fd129-2eb6-4041-b214-bc170dffb8d2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Back to your NETGEAR router (router=receiver AND sender):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a rented device* that you've got from an internet provider or did you buy the router yourself and connected it to your phone or cable &nbsp;line?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a rented device it's possible that the router is set by factory setting default to create a ''public hotspot'', even without your permission. or knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To figure the problem further:</p>
<p>-disable/deactivate (not uninstall)&nbsp;your WLAN adapter in "device manager"&nbsp;and</p>
<p>-connect your PC ONLY by cable (ethernet) to the router</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then observe what you have dropped here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3a63647-fb50-47ac-a2db-da3380e61e71" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d3a63647-fb50-47ac-a2db-da3380e61e71" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now -as your wlan adapter is disabled- and if still you see your NETGEAR router as an AP you already know, that the problem is in the router, not the tiny adapter W-LAN card inside your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell me your results...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>* if your NETGEAR is a rented device or branded by an internet provider you should address them and communicate that you don't want your router act as a 'PUBLIC AP'. Because it's thinkable that, if that your router is set by default as a 'public AP' that&nbsp;its
 access is not even protected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: Furthermore. Please make screenshots of your "Device Manager" screen, showing network adapters (inflated rolled-out view). That would help alot.</p>

<h2>            File Explorer refuses to acknowledge Dark Mode</h2>
                    <p>This website is absolutely useless when it comes to finding answers. Every place I search just tells me to go to my Personalization, Colors, switch the system to Dark Mode and magically File Explorer switches as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah... no, it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a dark Explorer recently. Had to format and redo my system drive, spent all night updating the system and even on the latest version of Windows here, it refuses to switch.

<br />
<br />From your screenshot, you are definitely not on the latest version of Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what Version No. and build No. of Windows 10 are you running?

            Hi GargosTheMighty
<br />
<br />Thank you for that screenshot . . .
<br />
<br />You are on version 1803 (1 year old), Dark Mode in Explorer was introduced in version 1809 and the current version of Windows 10 is version 1903, which offers even more personalization options
<br />
<br />Click the link below, then click 'Update Now' on that page to immediately get 1903 and bring your PC right up to date
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>

<br />This is what that settings page looks like in version  1903:

</p><p>You know what would be awesome? When you rebuild a machine and reinstall Windows and do all of the security updates, that it actually updated you to something even close to the most recent version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go through Windows Update and it tells me I am all up to date, but it turns out that I am at least a year behind in security updates and other things, that's pretty poor of MS.</p>

<p>My win10 virtual machine - I just started it up again (and I've reinstalled in previously - apparently it does NOT like being off line for any period of time) is booted.&nbsp; BUT the screen is just BLUE, and I have network / power / accessibility icons in the

<p>
</p><p>Cursor moves / works (if I click on any of those three icons, I get options) but I'm not logged in or getting to the desktop.</p>
<p>

<p>Oh, I also uninstalled weather, news, and Xbox apps, a few more as well since I don't use 'apps'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the "virtual machine" ran fine for 3 days after that.&nbsp; I left it run just to make sure I got updates.</p>
<p>Then I shut it down.&nbsp; Now, about 8 days later I try to boot it and I get the screen I described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted into the install DVD and tried to 'repair my computer' but it could not do so.</p>

    <title>BSOD when watching a video on youtube - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD when watching a video on youtube</h2>
                    <p>Hello . I get BSOD only when im watching a video on chrome (this happens on other browsers as well).It firsts start with just in fullscreen mode and just freezing for like 4 seconds , now is happening every time and it crashes with the sound from the video
 stucked in a loop . Sometimes this crashes affects my headphones , they start buzzing and making a static noise and stays like that for hours when plugged &nbsp;, they clear up after a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated the graphic card driver , the sound driver and some others that needed update .</p>
<p>
</p><p>note that its a laptop and its 5 months old : ASUS X550VX : i7 6700hq 2.6ghz, &nbsp;8gb RAM, nvidia gtx 950m , and windows 10 x64 version 10.0.15063</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made chrome use the dedicated graphic card instead of the integrated one and the BSOD's stoped for like 2 days and now i get them again , i got like 15 BSOD in total . I scaned my computer for malwares , memory test and its all good .I don't want to reset
 the windows just yet , i feel like its something repairable.</p>

Bug check description: The DPC watchdog detected a prolonged run time at an IRQL of DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem. This problem might also be caused because of overheating (thermal issue).
<br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.&nbsp;<br />
