<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Make Purchase</h2>
                    
<p>Trying to purchase the "Scott Pilgrim Knives Chau" DLC on the marketplace. Giving the error of 80167611. Looked it up and it is saying something is wrong with my billing info.</p>
<p>Checked my billing address on my banks side, everything fine there.</p>
<p>Updated my billing info on the console for the card and the website for my billing account info, still won't download. This time I tried on the website to purchase the content, still wouldn't go through.</p>
<p>Deleted the marketplace data on my consoles storage devices, cleared the cache on each, reboot my xbox and tried again, still wouldn't purchase.</p>
<p>No pending balances on billing.microsoft.com, plenty of funds in my account. Checked to see if the service was having a issue where I am, nothing posted.</p>
<p>The content should still be available during my time of purchase before 11:59PM Eastern Time. No body on the forums that I can tell is having a issue either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm having the same exact problem purchasing Dead or Alive 5 Legacy DLC.</p>
<p>Using my Paypal that I made numerous purchases on since November, and checked the Billing ID multiple times, even made a new one just in case, and still saying no authorization was found. I'm going to assume the Marketplace is down or under maintenance?</p>

<p>Tried to purchase the Season 2 of The Walking Dead for $5.00, giving the same error code. I have made several purchases with this card online since this issue started through Steam, ThinkGeek, and even Pizza Hutt.</p>

<p>Still doesn't work. </p>
<p>This has been going on since late November - this is ridiculous.</p>

                    Hi All
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been servicing a client with aN HP DC5800 with XP SP3 32 bit. &nbsp;It has been having a series of Windows update problems with the .Net framework, &nbsp;originally because the install directories were missing. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have to this point completely removed all versions of &nbsp;.Net (2 - 3.5) using this tool:<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2008/08/28/8904493.aspx</a>, and brought the system
 back to 3.5v SP1 with a cumulative update dotnetfx35.exe &nbsp; using the instructions at the end of this post, and verified 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2 and 3.5 SP1 were installed correctly using the netfx_setupverifier tool</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After this point, I was able to apply several updates using Windows Update, but I am currently at a point where KB982168 continually errors with&nbsp;<span>0x663.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Looking at the log file, a saw that the passage, located directly after my writing, contains what&nbsp;appears&nbsp;to
 me to be the offending error.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I'm wondering why it seams that, since I installed 2.0 -3.5 and verified they were OK &nbsp;with<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-components-postattachments/00-08-99-90-04/netfx_5F00_setupverifier_5F00_new.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-components-postattachments/00-08-99-90-04/netfx_5F00_setupverifier_5F00_new.zip</a>,
 that 2.0 SP2 seems to be getting this error.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Anyone have any clues/suggestions?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks lots. &nbsp; This is driving me nuts.</span></div>

<h2>            Downloads not opening</h2>
                    How come when I download an update, or a program, when the download completes there is no window opening that will allow me to install on my HP Laptop with Vista? The download seems to just disappear?

Are you using any download manager software?<br />
<br />
"When you use Internet Explorer to download a file from the Internet, you are asked where you want to store the file. If you don't specify where you want the file to be stored, programs, documents, and webpages are saved in the Documents folder, and pictures
 are saved in the Pictures folder."</p>

<br />
"When you start any download you may also see a check box labeled "Close this dialog box when download completes." If you see this check box, it helps to uncheck this box. You don't have to, but if you do, it will be easier to find the file after you download
 it." <br />
<br />
<br />
Check this setting too.<br />
IE/ Tools/ Internet Options/&nbsp; Advanced/ Browsing/ "Notify when downloads complete".<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If there are configuration problems the files may be downloaded to your Temporary Internet Files folder.</p>
<p>This Registry Key tells IE where to save downloads.<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer, see what is says about your Download Directory in the right hand pane.</p>

<p><span>Hi pastor walt,</span></p>
<p><span>Have you tried the steps provided by Linney MVP?</span></p>
<p><span>Usually when you try to download a file it will give an option to Save.
<span>&nbsp;</span>If <span>&nbsp;</span>you don’t specify a location, when you download files,
<span><strong>Windows</strong></span><strong> usually saves them in the Downloads folder</strong> which is located under your user name in the
<span><strong>users</strong></span> folder on the drive where <span>Windows</span> is installed (for example C:\users\<span><em>your name</em></span>\downloads). When you are saving the file, you can choose to save it to a different folder. Some different types
 of files are saved to different folders by default.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the following links to download the file:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Downloading-files-from-the-Internet-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Downloading-files-from-the-Internet-frequently-asked-questions</a>

</span></p>
<p><span>The download works in the same way for both 32bit and 64bit editions.
</span></p>
<p><span>The main differences between the 32-bit versions of Windows Vista and the 64-bit versions of Windows Vista relate to memory accessibility, memory management, and enhanced
 security features.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the following KB article.</span></p>

<p>You are lucky that you weren't at a higher level when you got reset. &nbsp;I know some people that "prestiged" twice and then got reset back to 1. &nbsp;(That means they were over level 200)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a fairly common problem in Gears 3 to have your level reset while you are playing multiplayer. &nbsp;It happens when your player data file gets corrupted, which can be for a number of reasons. &nbsp;Epic and Microsoft both know about this problem, but
 they won't do anything to fix it or help you get your level back.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Like Silent Rage said; "continue on..."</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you decide to keep playing Gears 3, I would recommend backing up your save data file to the cloud or a separate USB flash drive a couple of times per week (depending how much you play).</p>

                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been attempting to update my machine running Windows 10 to the Fall Creator's update (version 1709) and it repeatedly fails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently am running version 1703 on a Dell N5010 64 bit laptop running an Intel Core i3 M350.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to manually update through the native Windows update system and get error&nbsp;0x80070002.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is to the point where it is repeatedly attempts to update with the following dialogue window and it repeatedly fails and returns error 0x8007001f&nbsp;:</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Your device needs the latest security updates<br />
Microsoft can't install important security updates on your PC until you install the most current version of Windows 10.<br />
To ensure things go smoothly:<br />
- Keep your PC plugged in.<br />
&nbsp;- Don't turn your PC off or close it.<br />
We're doing our work behind the scenes. Feel free to keep working, and we'll let you know when everything is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to download and install the update via the following install option:<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10<br />
</p>
<p>I have attempted to install it from within Safe Mode using a flash drive, but it said the laptop doesn't support it when in Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Ry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by downloading and  installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If Version 1709 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist you can also roll it back within 10 days at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery and block it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<p>Microsoft knows about this glaring error but are not prepared to do anything about it. They would rather some user to come up with the solution and are not devoting any effort themselves to fix the problem. In short they don't care.</p>

<h2>            Mass Effect 3 will reward completionists with better ending</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><strong><span>Just something interesting from GamesRadar by mouth of the honorable Casey Hudson. I didn't read much of it to avoid any potential spoilers. But, I can say, it is good news
 for the completionists and is a great incentive to get people to play what the devs made for them.<br />
<br />
I think it was the Docs of BioWare that said this over a year ago that nothing is more frustrating than puting together&nbsp;a nice 40+ hour game, then someone beats it in 15 hours avoiding a lot of side quests and other adventures, then whines about no DLC, well,
 the 25+ hours you put aside is then essentially your DLC that you already paid for, why not give that a try.<br />

<p>this seems like a no brainer considering how many decisions Mass Effect 3 will have to wrangle in the end. not sure if this is good or bad but its probably not a good thing for a lot of players</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the big consequences/benefits of their decisions will be pretty hard to miss but the easter eggs in Mass Effect 2 were pretty weak, hopefully Mass Effect 3 has more than a few throwaway conversations in store</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>also, ppl that dont "complete" the game and whine about dlc have to be few and far between, that doesnt seem like a logical fit. ppl that finish an RPG "one-and-done" style arent likely to buy dlc</p>

<p>I doubt the people that don't fully complete the game and then proceed to whine about DLC are few and far between, I would bet to say that there's actually a surprising percentage of people like that.&nbsp; They could purchase the DLC as well even if they are
 of the RPG "one-and-done" crowd if it interests them enough.<br />
<br />
After all, it's obvious that Mass Effect 2 was focused to move more towards the shooter crowd or at least broaden the genre to include people that might not normally play a game like Mass Effect, so what the docs at BioWare said above I could fully believe
 given the expansion of the fan base.<br />
<br />
I am glad that those who fully playthrough each Mass Effect game, like myself, will be rewarded for doing so for Mass Effect 3's ending as that's how it should be.&nbsp; That's not being over-biased or anything, it's simply that those who do fully enjoy the game
 and everything about it should be rewarded for doing so.<br />
<br />
Of course not to take anything away from the people that only play through the main storyline only and do zero side quests in both games, as if that's what they're interested in doing, then that's fine and their ending's should be on par at least and not be
 given disparity because they didn't fully play through the games.<br />
<br />
But to be perfectly honest, the side quests in my view are what shapes the character you create anyhow and not just the core canon story elements you see during the main plot line, so for those that take the time to do them then again should be given the best
 possible ending for Mass Effect 3.</p>

<p>Makes sense in a way to have it like this. I am a completionist too, I don't go forward with the major part of the story(such as Virmire) until alot of the subplots are completed. Besides, the side missions are what complete Mass Effect, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Obviously collecting some races to help you in the fight will be side-quests.</p>
<p>For instance - do you choose the quarian or the geth? or both? or none? not choosing either will it result in continued war? choosing one or the other could result in one decimating the other and becoming hero's. Choosing both they live happily ever after.</p>
<p>Then other races. If you decide to enlist the Krogan perhaps they become hero's again if not they may not even be mentioned at all.</p>
<p>Whilst what I've said above is just speculation (their stories could be completely different) I assume the ending will involve something similar depending on the species you were able to enlist.</p>
<p>It's clear if you don't enlist any then there will be billions dead and the humans will win but lead an almost destroyed galaxy.</p>
<p>Obviously they aren't going to mention all the side-quests. Stuff like whether or not L2 biotics got reperations naturally won't affect the end-game.</p>

<p>[/quote]Just as they can't make you or anyone else only play the main plot?&nbsp; See how the argument can be swayed both ways.<br />
<br />
BioWare has already stated that there will be variable endings depending on certain things.&nbsp; So yes, the ending should be different for everyone, it would be quite odd for the ending to not be different depending on past choices made as that has been the entire
 point of the trilogy from carrying choices made throughout ME 1 and ME 2 until the ending.&nbsp; Now no I do not expect the ending for those who do everything imaginable to be completely different from those who only do the main storyline quests, don't mistake
 what I say.<br />
<br />
However, I do expect the ending to be much more fulfilling to those who have done everything as it does make sense.<br />
<br />
People who have taken the time to do the side quests should have a fuller ending in context as opposed to someone like you who does not. That doesn't mean that things are or will be drastically different in how the ending will be portrayed for ME 3, it should
 simply give a fulfilling closure to all the choices that have been made from ME 1 and ME 2's side quests that up until this point, were basically for nothing as a majority were simply relayed through simple e-mails in Mass Effect 2.</p>

<p>agreed. [IMO] it also takes several playthrus for many those decisions to sink in and personalize the canon, making everyone's shepard feel different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sometimes those decisions have little to do with the canon and more to do with playing a game as well.&nbsp;a good example could be my [failed] Mass Effect asari companion cheevo hunt. 5 or 6 attempts at that cheevo has cemented Julia Shepard's canon both games
 so far</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and if chasing that cheevo and its consequences negatively affect the finale in ME3 so be it. Kaiden will always die on Virmire no matter what, Julia will never be friendly with male members of her crew: i even have a save ready for ME3 with only female
 surviving cast members&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bioware is making you play the whole game:&nbsp;if you dont do loyalty missions and make some bad choices along the way you will die in Mass Effect 2 and never make it to part 3.&nbsp;bioware says ME3 will reward completionists differently and there should be benefits
 to exploring the game and experiencing as much content as possible. that said the final cut scenes probably wont vary too much but how the story comes together in the end will be very different</p>

<p>With <span>Windows</span> Media Player, you can create gradual transitions between songs in your playlists by turning on crossfading. When you do this, the volume at the end of one song fades out and gradually decreases while the
 volume of the next song fades in and gradually increases. Crossfading is available only when you play
<span>Windows</span> Media Audio (WMA) or MP3 files that are either in your library or on a data or HighMAT disc. Crossfading is not available with audio CDs.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Yes you do need a Gold Subscription in order to play games online on XBL. It looks as though you are a Gold member already so you already have what you need. Just an FYI, it is cheaper
 if you buy a 12 month sub as opposed to a 3 month or 1 month sub (the latter is only available online). If you shop around online rather than in retail shops, you can find some great deals on the 12 month subs.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Messed Up My Audio</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have an MSI GS43VR GRE Phantom Pro laptop running Windows 10 home edition. It recently went through a large update, taking a few hours. After the update, everything seemed to be working fine until I played a video. The right speakers were a lot louder
 than the left, and extremely distorted. And every little background noise could be heard as loud static. The same thing happened with headphones too, meaning the speakers are fine. I went on to update all my audio drivers and restart my laptop, yet the problem
 still persists (I have Realtek High Definition Audio). I do know the Windows update made changes to the audio drivers, but I don't know exactly what. How do I fix my audio (or audio settings)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I apologize if I post this in the wrong category. I keep getting post errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took my laptop in to Micro-center to fix the problem. It took them over half an hour to fix it and I do not quite understand what they did. But, now my laptop doesn't detect audio devices. In other words, try to stick with Windows 7. It's one of the best
 and most stable platform out there. Windows 10 is buggy, glitchy, always has compatibility issues, and always has problems.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />If driver worked in a previous version of Windows 10, I would downgrade to that release. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi John..  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are a number of ways to get the Display driver so you know you've checked all sources and tried all drivers before abandoning the latest version.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />To install older versions go here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.phpThen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.phpThen</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Then save a System Image backup of the completed older version install so you can go back at any time if you get a version upgrade before you can block it:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>2-Day Free Trial Code for Gold. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            2-Day Free Trial Code for Gold. </h2>
                    
<p>Yes, I have an unused code for Gold, if anybody wants it. I got it free with my copy of Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and I don't need the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you redeem it, you can download MGS V: Ground Zeroes and Metro: Last Light. for free with gold. You can redeem it on the the 31st, and then you can download first batch of free games with gold on the 1st September.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Bob
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: rstrui.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />This will start the system restore wizard. Choose a restore point before the problem started.

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james  s. nixon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to Win 10, but I soon discovered that all was not peaches and cream after the upgrade finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Win 7 Ultimate (64 Bit) to Win 10 (64 Bit)</p>
<p>At the end of the upgrade session I discovered that my SATA&nbsp;Plextor PX-755A DVD Writer/Reader no longer worked.</p>
<p>I could see the devise in the Motherboard (MSI G755 series, circa 2007)&nbsp;set-up, but it did not show up in the Devise Manager in Win 10.</p>
<p>Also, my LG SATA WH16NS40 DVD/Blue-Ray reader/Burner does't show up in the motherboard setup screen</p>
<p>or in the Win 10 Devise manager. Both of these units where working perfectly in WIN 7 environment prior to
</p>
<p>upgrade.</p>
<p>I'm really frustrated with the problem, I talked to Plextor Tech. Help and they&nbsp;said that they are aware of the problem that it is a Microsoft issue and they do not plan on coming up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;new driver for Win 10 applications. The LG Unit is a mystery and
 I have not had time to query them about updated drivers for Win 10.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hitman Sniper Challenge</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the digital edition of Hitman to get the Sniper Challenge DLC/demo.</p>

<p>Finally got the code, and unlocked everything at 50 million points. &nbsp;But when I start up Absolution I get a message saying that I need yet ANOTHER code to transfer the rifle unlocks to the main game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The million dollar question is...WHERE DO I GET THE TRANSFER CODE.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            new dell latitude 7380 with windows 10 bluetooth issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new laptop with windows 10 on it. And every time I connect either my kingston&nbsp;Bluetooth&nbsp;keyboard or my surface one, after about 5 min one random key will act like it is stuck and do&nbsp;the following"ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd"
 and continue to do so until I remove it from my devices. It will still continue to press&nbsp; the&nbsp; "key" evey&nbsp;after I turn off the keyboard and remove the batteries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you!</p>
