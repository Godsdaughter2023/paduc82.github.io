<p><span>However you can try to fix the issue by following the steps given below.</span></p>
<p><span>-Press these keys simultaneously on your keyboard to change it the setting you want.<br />
CTRL + ALT + UP&gt; Normal mode<br />
CTRL + ALT + RIGHT&gt; Rotate 270<br />
CTRL + ALT + LEFT&gt; Rotate 90<br />
CTRL + ALT + DOWN &gt; Rotate 180</span></p>
<p><span>-Right click on my computer&gt;manage&gt;device manager&gt;expand the display adapter option&gt;right click on the display adapter card&gt;click on uninstall&gt;restart
 the computer if you are prompted to or click on hardware changes. This would load the default settings of your display adapter card.</span></p>
<p><span>-Check the advance properties of your display adapter card make sure that the buttons that lets you rotate the screen
 are set to default.<br />

<h2>            Is there A WAY TO RETRIEVE LOST SENT &#38; DELETED EMAILS FROM ALL FOLDERS FROM ALL TIME, 2015 TO PRESENT, in Windows Live Mail 2011, in Windows 10&#63; HOW&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IS THERE A WAY TO RETRIEVE LOST SENT &amp; DELETED EMAILS FROM ALL FOLDERS in Windows Live Mail 2011, in Windows 10, laptop app, NOT phone?
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If so, HOW?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My ISP tech DELETED &amp; RECREATED my Windows Live Mail 2011 account in an attempt to get my email working properly again. However, ALL my SENT &amp; DELETED EMAILS Emails got wiped out from ALL folders (including my personally created storage folders) for 2015,
 2016, &amp; 2017- ALL now missing/lost. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I even asked her a couple of times if my emails could get deleted doing that, but she repeatedly reassured me I would still have &amp; be able to access/read my email on their server.
</span>Well, she was wrong, except for the INBOX, which was all that was left on BOTH their server and in my Windows Live Mail 2011 downloaded email.&nbsp; Which is good &amp; I am thankful that at least I didn't lose ANY of my INBOX email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I shouldn't have trusted her, I guess, but I didn't know any better at the time and just wanted it fixed. I just assumed my ISP techs knew more than I did. And she just ASSUMED all my email would still be on their server &amp; didn't ask or check it
 first. Both our "bads". (Don't assume anything any more. It's hard to get good help these days, apparently.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now the ISP says they can't help me get my lost emails back because my SENT &amp; DELETED emails aren't on their server, AND, of course, they don't support Microsoft products. Nice. I finally figured out the reason my SENT, DELETED
<span>emails from </span>both current and storage folders are not on the ISP server is because I don't create, send, delete, or store emails DIRECTLY ONLINE from their web server in the first place. I
<span>emails from </span>both current and storage folders are not on the ISP server is because I don't create, send, delete, or store emails DIRECTLY ONLINE from their web server in the first place. I
<span>do all that in Windows Live Mail 2011 on my laptop because anything like that you do online</span> is just not inherently as safe.</p>
<span>do all that in Windows Live Mail 2011 on my laptop because anything like that you do online</span> is just not inherently as safe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ISP posited the idea, or perhaps just wishful thinking to make me "feel better", that perhaps Windows Live Mail 2011 in Windows 10's "fairy" may have "magically" STORED my lost SENT &amp; DELETED EMAILS FROM ALL TIME SINCE 2015 TO PRESENT AUTOMATICALLY SOMEWHERE
 ("over the rainbow" maybe?) IN MY COMPUTER HARD DRIVE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF I should have been so lucky as to even <em>have </em>had a "Good Email Fairy" looking out for me that caused that to possibly have happened, WHERE MIGHT I TRY LOOKING TO FIND IT? WHERE DO I EVEN LOOK IN MY COMPUTER (ie
<em>where</em> in the hard drive? or w<em>hat </em>other places?) FOR THIS POSSIBLE "MAGICAL KINGDOM OF LOST EMAIL" THAT I MIGHT RESCUE THEM ALL?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can PLEASE HELP ME RECOVER MY LOST EMAILS. I keep them for my memory, reference, info, timelines of things, records of purchases, recall of conversations, etc.&nbsp; And no, unfortunately I did NOT have a Restore point created either&nbsp;<span>before
 I lost my email.</span> <em>(I know, dumb, right? But that's what happens when</em>
<em>you don't know what you don't know. AND</em> <em>I don't ever remember that being mentioned in upgrading to Windows 10</em>)&nbsp; In fact, this mess is
<em>how</em> I <em>found out</em> (the hard way) that Windows 10 DOESN'T periodically AUTO-CREATE Restore points for its customers like it did in Windows 7, or XP. Of course,
<em>had I, </em>and others known this or other things about Windows 10,&nbsp; <em>I/we might have just stayed with Windows 7 or XP</em> indefinitely! Ahh, but therein lies the rub, perhaps, no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, I might have been able to S<span>ystem R</span>estore to a previous time &amp; gotten ALL MY LOST EMAILS back that way. So beware: If you don't
<em>remember </em>to CREATE your own Restore point BEFORE you need it (and you never know when
<em>that's </em>going to be) this is what can happen I guess. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question remains: Does anybody know IF IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL MY LOST SENT &amp; DELETED EMAILS FROM ALL TIME SINCE 2015 TO PRESENT IN
<span>WINDOWS LIVE EMAIL 2011, IN WINDOWS 10, </span>MAY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN MY COMPUTER BY DEFAULT/AUTOMATICALLY&nbsp; (w/o me having to have necessarily designated it as such) SO THAT I MIGHT RETRIEVE THEM? AND IF SO? WHERE DO I LOOK AND HOW DO
<span>WINDOWS LIVE EMAIL 2011, IN WINDOWS 10, </span>MAY HAVE ACTUALLY GONE SOMEWHERE ELSE IN MY COMPUTER BY DEFAULT/AUTOMATICALLY&nbsp; (w/o me having to have necessarily designated it as such) SO THAT I MIGHT RETRIEVE THEM? AND IF SO? WHERE DO I LOOK AND HOW DO
 I DO IT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OR, do YOU all at MICROSOFT store customers' emails somewhere?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Thanks in advance to anybody and everyone </em>that has ANY ideas or, even better, solutions to this dilemma! I hope
<em>somebody out there </em>knows, so I can either retrieve them, or call-off this maddening "Search and Rescue" for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,&nbsp; NOT a Techie--<em>obviously</em>! &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(PS. Hmmm, I wonder if I could get my lost emails from the FBI, CIA, or NSA?&nbsp; (wink, wink) You know, since they now collect everything from everybody in ginormous databased dossiers,

<p>What an unhappy story. It's not helped by the fact that it took the Microsoft moderator three weeks to move your question to the right forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an account is removed from Windows Live Mail, a warning is shown:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa345d6b-a993-4e58-9fe7-edbf1b9308ba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa345d6b-a993-4e58-9fe7-edbf1b9308ba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The warning is incomplete: it should point out that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
all</span> the account's folders and their contents will be permanently deleted. I don't know why your tech didn't realize this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a splendid function called <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17143/windows-10-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
File History</a> which is capable of storing copies of folders as their contents change. If you had configured this to back up your store folder, all your old messages would have been saved many times over. I take it you didn't do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to answer your questions: if you didn't back up these messages one way or another, they're most probably gone for good. There is no fairy who saves them for you, and Microsoft is certainly not in the business of storing users' email (except for that
 in Microsoft email accounts like Hotmail, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid your only possibility is to use a file undelete utility like <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/recuva" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recuva</a> to search your drives for deleted files with the extension .<strong>eml</strong>. Sadly, so much time has passed since the vandalism happened that the chances of success are not high; the more you use the computer, the greater the probability that
 a deleted file is overwritten with new data and thus rendered irretrievable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry not to have better news for you.</p>

    <title>Monitor standby freezing computer. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doomedmarine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor standby freezing computer.</h2>
                    Seems to be a ridiculously common problem for Windows 10 users. Computer goes into power saving modes and freezes. Multi-display, primary display will still show desktop, secondary display will go black (but still be on, No mouse or keyboard control though)<br />
<br />
I have decided to make my own post seeking help where I can list my specific hardware etc.<br />
Also I have looked at many other threads and around the web and none of the suggestions I have seen work.<br />
<br />
I have disabled "Turn off display" on all power profiles still freezes as if it is still trying to shut them down despite being disabled.<br />
Under advanced power settings, PCI Express, turned off Link State Power Managment. Still freezes.<br />
Increased VRAM and rebooted, still freezes.<br />
Regardless of what I do, if I leave the PC unattended for a few minutes and it has zero activity it freezes and I am forced to hard reboot it.<br />
<br />
This has only been an issue since upgrading to WIndows 10. PC has worked fine with Windows 7, 8 and 8.1.<br />
<br />
Hardware:<br />
i5 3570K CPU<br />
32GB G-Skill DDR3 ram<br />
ASRock Z77 Extreme 6 Motherboard<br />
Galax GTX 970 GPU<br />
Monitors are Acer V203HV (secondary) and an Acer G236HL (Primary)<br />
<br />
Using Windows 10 Pro latest up to date version.<br />
<br />
Some help is massively needed. I cannot be sitting at my computer constantly to keep it awake, but I cannot leave it and have it freeze and require a hard reset/reboot every 5 minutes. I am concerned this could potentially damage my PC's hardware, especially
 as my PC is sometimes on for 24 hours straight and I cannot as I said always baby sit it.I so much as go to the toilet I will be frozen when I get back.<br />
<br />
As it seems to be an ongoing issue for a huge number of Windows 10 users, I think MS needs to pull it's finger out and patch it. Generic copy paste advice that seems the norm here does not seem to be working for anyone.<br />
Sorry if I seem overly blunt just frustrated with this nonsense. I am open to any well thought put specific advice though and would massively appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can think of myself is if it is not an issue with Windows 10 (which seems unlikely due to how many have it) that it is related to my nVidia GPU and its drivers perhaps?<br />

            Thanks for the typical Microsoft cookie cutter response.<br />
Basically format your PC and reinstall Windows is the answer?<br />
Seriously?<br />
<br />
When this first happened around the time of Windows 10's retail launch I tried a format and reinstall and the problem remained, combination of Microsoft Updates and NVidia drivers I assume it went away. Came back and left at random. One thing I was sure of
 it was software, either Windows 10 or nVidia or combination of both.<br />
<br />
As an update. If I run windows trouble shooter and select the power trouble shooter the PC freezes the exact same way it is when idle when the troubleshooter is run.<br />
<br />
Seems crazy so many people having this issue will no doubt also have a huge variety of PC hardware combinations and it would be all of them having the issue with hardware.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling the nVidia driver and using DDU (display driver uninstaller) and rolling back to driver verison 376.09 the freezing stopped.<br />
Or did since I made the post. Started again last night and I am going to try the same again and see if it fixes the issue again.<br />
<br />
Maybe instead of making either useless generic replies, or suggesting extreme measures like a format and reinstall, Microsoft could try employing some help that is of some actual use and will try to work with people to resolve their issues beyond "NUKE IT ALL"
 or "Have you tried turning it off then back on"<br />
<br />
Meh, trying nVidia, maybe they will be more help even if they only provide the drivers for my card.<br />
<br />
Be rather annoyed to reformat and reinstall to find the issue creeping back in after a while. Might be time to roll back to 8.1, never had an issue with that and the same hardware. Windows 10 is great when it works, but these kind of more common than they should
 be issues and Microsofts inability to address them properly kills the product.<br />
Been a mess with nVidia and Windows 10 since day one.<br />

<p>Unfortunately I was not able to get this to work. Does anyone have any idea how to configure this successfully.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>No background music in Age of Empires II Collectors Edition. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alandier  say:</h3>
<h2>            No background music in Age of Empires II Collectors Edition.</h2>
                    <p>There is no background music in AoE II and AoE II Expansion.<br />
I have tried just about anything and have looked through the internet for persons with the same problem.<br />
Apparently the problem is somewhat common for the collectors edition, since the background music for AoE II stays on the cd, after installation, for streaming while the game is playing.
<br />
I have tried some different things, but none were succesful.<br />
<br />
Yes, i have turned up the computer volume and it has nothing to do with a not-existing "Music On/Off" button.</p>

            I believe my friend has the collectors edition and it play music just fine. I think the problem is that either the user is using a No-CD patch that does not support in-game music, his audio settings are wrong for disk-to-game streaming, or that perhaps
 he may have a download version of the game that had the music stripped out to conserve disk space.

<p>This may help for future reference. If the DVD media does not contain the files to begin with, then you are out of luck. If it does, it is probably compressed in a archive format, similar to what&nbsp;Activision does with their game development.Tthere may be
 a compatibility problem with CD/DVD drives and this game. Originally, If I am not mistaken, an audio cable was required to be plugged into the user's sound card and CD/DVD drive to transmit data to the audio chipset. Newer drives do not use the technology.<br />
<br />
You could give this a shot:<br />
<br />
Click Start, click Control Panel, click Performance and Maintenance, and then click System.
<br />
Click the Hardware tab, and then click Device Manager. <br />
Click the + (plus sign) next to DVD/CD-ROM drives, right-click your CD-ROM drive, and then click Properties.
<br />
Click to check&nbsp;the Enable digital CD audio for this CD-ROM device check box, and then click OK.
<br />
On the File menu, click Exit to close the Device Manager window. <br />
<br />
ALSO! Take a look at this:<br />

It would be odd if the collectors edition was missing the OST and then the original edition had it.<br />

<p>Llevo ya demaciado tiempo esperando para una solucion para este problema, hay demasiada gente que tiene el mismo problema y no es posible que no puedan mandar una actualizacion para arreglarlo. Es claro que mi consola no es el problema, ya fue reparada por
 "microsoft" y pense que eso resolveria el problema, pero NO fue asi. El disco es claro que tampoco es el problema por que esta impecable, sin ningun rayon, intente con otro disco "nuevo" y o sorpresa, tampoco funciona, espero que me den una solucion para este
 problema, por que es demasiado claro que es una actualizacion que metieron y no deja reproducir el disco. Buena tarde y espero su respuesta.</p>

<h2>            fatal error c0000034 applying update operation 282 of 116925</h2>
                    <p>Title is the error message I see when I start up windows.</p>
<p>I'm probably responsible for that though. This is how i got there: My computer froze after successfully downloading and installing service pack 1, still running windows. SP1 was not applied however, to my knowledge. After rebooting the update at startup
 worked a couple of stages but got stuck at 0% at the (windows installation/reparation? with flowers) colored screen. I did a hardware reboot and know I get this error message when windows tries to redo or finish the update at startup/boot.</p>
<p>I can access the windows harddrive from Ubuntu on another drive (via BIOS). However I don't have a cd/dvd drive.</p>
<p>System: Windows 7 Professional 64 bit, Athlon II x4 2.9, 4 GB ram, 60 GB ssd.</p>
<p>Any ideas welcome!</p>
<p>edit: I also tried the automatic startup repair but it couldn't resolve.</p>
<p><br />

this made windows bootable: <br />

                    <p>HI , i have high latency/ping only on this single computer on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the ping stays above 200 constantly and i have no idea why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have checked everything i could find online and nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ethernet and wifi is working 100% even cross testing on other computers.</p>
<p>my NIC is working 100% , it has no loss and has a 1ms ping.</p>
<p>ping to router is 1ms.</p>
<p>ping to other computers on network is 1-5ms.</p>
<p>drivers for NIC and ports updated (uninstalled and updated more than once)</p>
<p>no new programs were installed before the problem.</p>
<p>no virus on pc.</p>
<p>i do not have firewalls active. not even from anti virus (uninstalled it)</p>
<p>no other programs in background using bandwith</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have done countless things to try and resolve this and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it resolved for a few hours after verifying my windows 7 pro CD-Key and when i woke up this morning after doing updates through the night it is back to being like it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am absolutely dumbstruck and can not think of anything else that could be causing this.</p>
<p>the problem is only on the computer and tracert does not help me find the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as i see it something is delaying data on my system.</p>
<p>can anybody help me please. it is driving me insane and making me feel stupid.</p>

    <title>Moving from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and Family Sharing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomsdad04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and Family Sharing</h2>
                    
<p>Hi - we currently have an Xbox 360. &nbsp;There is a child account which is used permanently and has Xbox Live Gold on it. &nbsp;The Gold expires soon and at the same time we will be getting an XBox One. &nbsp;There is also a Parent account associated with the child account
 but this does not have XBox Live Gold.</p>
<p>So when we unwrap the shiny new XBox One on Christmas Day we can migrate the child account across but it will no longer have Xbox Gold as it will have just expired.</p>
<p>Will it be best for me to add XBox One Live Gold to the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Parent</span> Account and then the Child Account can be part of Family Sharing (and I can add other accounts if I want for other kids), or will renewing the XbOx Live Gold on the Child account still allow Family sharing with both adults and children alike?</p>
<p>Hope someone has some good advice for me!</p>
<p>Andy</p>

<p>As the family sharing option on the Xbox one is a little bit different to the option on the 360 it is definitely recommended the way you describe it. Set up the adult account and get it a gold subscription. Then set up the child account(s) &nbsp;and add them
 to the family and all the family associated accounts are able to use the gold subscription as well as all the digital purchases of the parent/adult account. And of course you can also add another parent/adult account, too.
</p>
<p>Only getting a gold subscription for the child account only works for the specific child account and will not be valid for the adult or other family associated accounts.

    <title>Scott Pilgrim or Charlie Murder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxnappydugoutxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scott Pilgrim or Charlie Murder</h2>
                    
<p>I already own Scott Pilgrim, which I bought a year or so ago but never really played. I liked it cause it reminded me of River City Ransom but just got sidetracked playing other games. I just DL the demo to Charlie Murder and really liked it but it reminded
 me of a lot of Scott Pilgrim. Is Charlie Murder worth the $15 or would I be fine with Scott Pilgrim and just save the 15 bones. What are the (unobvious) differences between the 2. Just curious. Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanx.</p>

<p>just checked,it is free from the 16th.</p>
<p>At $15 its worth buying a month of gold instead,if you want the game.</p>
<p>If you bought one month today,you would get dark souls,charlie murder,super street fighter and whatever game is free on the 1st of july, bargain four games for the price of one month of gold.</p>

<p>I am using Adobe to edit and add text, and then trying to use Microsoft Print to PDF to flatten/save the changes that I've made to the PDF, but I am unable to open the new PDF file after using Microsoft Print to PDF to flatten/save the changes.</p>

            In my case, I use Microsoft Print to PDF for mostly emails in MS Outlook 2016 with Windows 10. I have no problems opening most PDFs with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC. The ones that&nbsp;do get the OP's error message&nbsp;when opened in Adobe Reader seem to be the ones&nbsp;heavy
 with HTML. When I try to open those with MS Edge, I get a page that says:
Couldn’t open PDF
<p>Something’s keeping this PDF from opening.</p>

<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Go back to the last page</span></li></ul>

            <p>I used to work in the print industry, where everything must be in PDF, and yes you are correct for some reason MS Office does somehow create a non standard PDF by clicking Print to PDF</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have constantly had issues with printing PDF's created in MS Office, all characters come out as Squares, Adobe will not open them sometimes, text overrun . . . the list goes on</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best option for you is to download a Virtual PDF printer like DoPDF and install it.</p>
<p>Then when you want to make a PDF from any file from any application, simply click 'Print', select the DoPDF virtual printer, set your options and tell it where to save the file</p>
<p>
</p><p>DoPDF can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.dopdf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>, there are many other free Virtual PDF Printers available online</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this Helps!</p>

Microsoft Print to PDF creates a file with .pdf extension that has different administrator or special security permissions that I can't change.&nbsp; While the file appears as a PDF because it has the extension, otherwise I cannot open, modify, or delete the file.&nbsp;
 I cannot give myself permissions using any of the standard Windows 10 menus.&nbsp; I have the full version of Adobe Acrobat 8.1 installed, as well as Acrobat Reader, and have no problems creating, modifying, or opening PDFs using any other means.

            Hi Steven
<br />
<br />Are you doing this in classic Paint or Paint 3D? Because in classic Paint, when I want to use the same color fill, I ensure both of the following have the same color.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22b445ef-e64f-49ef-94e3-260ccb3d4e6a?upload=true" />

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
Mobile phones usually have a built-in software that automatically installs the necessary USB drivers in order for the PC to recognize it. However, if Windows does not detect any drivers from the mobile device when it's connected, the PC or laptop will act as
 a charger for it.
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest checking the phone manual or related forum pages for suggestions or you may choose to contact the manufacturer support for additional assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, you may browse through the <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/support-mobile/lg-LG440G" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LG website</a> for the device drivers you need to install on your phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, please do let us know.</p>
        </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might be a problem with either the mouse or keyboard.<br />
Do you have a spare mouse and keyboard to try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want you to try a factory reset on the monitor if you haven’t attempted one already.</p>
<p>1. Press the Menu down in the bottom right corner of the monitor.</p>
<p>2. Once the on screen display appears toggle down to factory reset.</p>
<p>3. Select on that option</p>
<p>You might see your monitor go dark a couple times but that is normal. Test it out after the reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

Why should I have to create an email account for each user? &nbsp;Why should users be forced to have a Microsoft account to use a computer? &nbsp;Even children? My desktop is supposed to be a stand-alone computer, not a dumb terminal attached to a mainframe. &nbsp;I don't

            This forum for for TESTERS. Also you are NOT forced to have a e-mail account you can use a local account. Only if you want to use the windows 10 apps do you need an MS account. Guess what if you want to use the Google app store or Apple store apps you
 needs accounts for them too. Feel free to go back to Windows 7 or use Linux or OS X.

            <p>We all do, MS does not care and it is on purpose that they do that and the only replies your gonna get are from MS lovers like the one who replied before me. I totally understand and MS could be so much better if they removed literally 95%, thats not a made
 up number, only 20 things are needed total out of the crap that only a hand full of users would ever use. The need to focus on us and not the mainstream hipsters. Does any one even have a clue on how much better and faster our machines could be if it was running
 on 20 services only, like win7, but like i said they do not care at all because the majority of its consumers are stupid in the head and will continue endorsing windows, then come on here to complain and get no where.</p>

<p>I have a good friend who is pushing 90 and she had a Vista laptop.&nbsp; I moved her up to W10 Home which meant I had to wipe her hard drive.&nbsp; Just loves W10 and finds it faster than Vista.&nbsp; Not a heavy user but does her email and web sites, as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with all PCs that come to me for attention, they leave with Start10 which makes the interface very much&nbsp; like W7.&nbsp; They also leave with Teamviewer remote so I can monitor or fix from wherever I happen to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Different strokes for different folk.&nbsp; No way does she need or have a Microsoft account.</p>
