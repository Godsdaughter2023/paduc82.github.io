<p>Can't be Avast Mail Shield as I don't use that AV software </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting. There have been many reports of errors identical to this over the years, and in every case that I've been involved in, Avast (or AVG since some time after their amalgamation) has been the culprit. Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I've already tried&nbsp;temporarily disabling my long-standing and unchanged antivirus software&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You'll understand that the error message you're seeing <em>can't</em> be coming from a mail server if the program wasn't able to connect to it. Therefore it
<em>must</em> be coming from some other application that's insinuating itself between Windows Live Mail and the mail server. This is almost always an anti-virus program, but it could also be anti-spam or other security software. It would have been helpful if
 you'd told us which AV you are using. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll also realize that your anti-virus software doesn't remain unchanged for very long - it has to be updated at frequent intervals if it's to keep pace with changing threats.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Deep scan revealed no issues and software check hasn't thrown up any conflicts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no suggestion of any sort of malware here. Anti-malware software has to be invasive to be effective, but there has to be a balance between the degree of
</p>
<p>interference and the usability of the applications involved. <br />
<br />
Again, the error message you're seeing is <em>not</em> coming from TalkTalk's mail server. It's from somewhere closer to home.</p>

<h2>            Dell Optiplex 780 USB Drivers</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an environment looking to deploy Windows 10 in a few months with various Dell model machines. The latest drivers from dell are all Windows 7 drivers and for the most part appear to work well EXCEPT the USB drivers. After the machine has completed
 its build and applied drivers from a store on SCCM 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers are ICH10 drivers which are applied automatically from Intel and they fail stating "An error occurred during the installation of the devices. The driver installation file for this device is missing a necessary entry" bla bla bla.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded a new set of ICH10 drivers from another site as Intels own site is almost impossible to get anything from and the auto detect thing they have doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to get the USB devices all working by updating the drivers manually EACH by selecting the Microsoft ICH10 devices from the browse for a driver dialog. This is impractical on hundreds of machines. I have removed ALL ICH10 device drivers from SCCM
 and they do not install from what I can tell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I remove a driver which shows up as an unknown device when installed as it does not install correctly?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am more than happy to remove completely manually using registry edits, inf hacks, driver file removals etc. I would be more than grateful for any file information for the Intel ICH10 drivers locations and names as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Ok so after a period of investigating I have found a few things.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Running <strong>pnputil -d OEMFILENAME.inf -f</strong> removes the driver from the windows driver store and it works</li><li>Skipping apply drivers from SCCM does NOT install the problem driver</li></ol>
<p>This means that the issue is a driver on SCCM. I am going to mark this as complete now as it is not a major issue. I hope this helps someone else</p>

http://calendar.live.com</a>. Please refer to this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The workaround that I can think of is you export the Microsoft Works calendar in .ics format and then import the .ics to the calendar at

<p>If I sign in, do my emails, contacts, and calendar events all automatically get copied to Microsoft servers?&nbsp; I don't really like having all of that out on the Internet anywhere.&nbsp;

Please define 'it'.</p>
<p>The question was what happens to emails, contacts, and calendar events when you sign in.</p>
<p>Signing in has no effect on emails.&nbsp; If the accounts are setup using http or imap protocols, then the emails will sync.</p>
<p>If you use WLMail without signing in, the default contacts and calendar will be used.&nbsp; The first time that you sign in, the default calendar events will be uploaded to the Microsoft server.&nbsp; This only happens on the first sign in.</p>
<p>The default contacts are not uploaded.&nbsp; You have to export and import the contacts.</p>

<p><br />
On the version I am using, it appears to work as follows.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I sign in, it doesn't seem that my emails have been put on MS servers.&nbsp; I have not set up with http or imap, as you indicated would be needed.&nbsp; I don't know how to do that, but I don't want to anyway.&nbsp; I don't want my emails on their servers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like none of my calendar items or contacts are on their servers either.&nbsp; Again, this is the way I want it.&nbsp; I don't want that stuff on their servers, but I would like to find a way to import calendar events from MS Works into my local Live Mail
 calendar.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an aside, it looks like there is a way to import contacts on the MS server, but I didn't see a way to import calendar events there either.&nbsp; Events I have on my local calendar were not imported to the copy on their servers when I signed in.&nbsp;

<h2>            Potentially permanently glitched &#34;Avoid Me&#34; reputation status</h2>
                    <p>To whom it may concern,</p>



<p>Greetings,
 I've had an "Avoid Me" reputation for some time now, even though if you
 add up all of the reports in the past six months, I've only been 
reported an average of one time per month for the last 6 months, so I 
was just wondering why it is I am permanently stuck with the lowest 
reputation score possible? I feel like that's a little bit harsh 
considering I never broke the rules in the first place, and I've read 
over the entire COC 20 times over the years by now, so naturally I know 
the rules probably better than most XBOX/Microsoft employees, and 
there's no logical reason as to why I still have the bad reputation 
score. I'm not a toxic gamer, so people are probably just jealous of me.
 I know one person just reported me recently simply for outbidding him 
on a car in the auction house in Forza Horizon 3. This gamertag hasn't 
been able to play in an online public match since February 2017 because 
of this (what I am assuming to be an undeserved "Avoid Me" reputation 
bar on my account), and so at this point I'm honestly not even mad, I'm 
actually honestly and genuinely interested to know what's going on?</p>





<p>All 6-7 aggregate reports filed in the last 6 calendar months are shown to me here: &nbsp; 
</p>



<p><a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/reputation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/reputation</a>
</p>





<p>There's
 even a contradiction on the reputation/enforcement page of the website,
 because it shows a green "Good Player" under the "Your Reputation" 
banner on that screen, but then when I sign into my gamertag on the 
website it will then show me the "Avoid Me" reputation bar that has been
 widely keeping me from normally playing online games for quite some 
time now.</p>



<p>Any help/feedback would be much appreciated, and I'm really looking forward to an answer on this one.</p>



<p>Have a great day!</p>



<p>Kind regards,</p>



<p>-Robert</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 freezing after about 1 to 2 minutes after login</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am using Windows 7 Professional 64 bit on my first gaming PC build. It has taken me a lot of research to get all the parts in place and putting all the connections in the right place but I've got everything wired down and the OS installed. I updated
 all the drivers with the Asus CD that came with the mobo and all the video card drivers that came with my video cards CD, as well as searched online for all the latest updates and drivers for Windows.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, after I boot the machine and log in, my machine will freeze regardless of where its at or what it is doing. This could be anywhere from idling at the log in screen to installing a game on steam, but it always takes a few minutes. I've sat in the bios
 for hours and nothing has happened but without fail after Windows boots, the machine will freeze after a few minutes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've installed Memtest 86+ on a bootable USB and ran it once, it came back clean. From what I hear, I should run it a few times but I will when I have more time (busy with work and school). I've also run a few chkdsks. I say a few because when I restart
 my machine to do the chkdsk, it will find bad clusters (about 8 of them) and fix thim. The process once took 8 hours, so I don't know if that is how long it is supposed to take. But after it comes back that it has finished with chkdsk, I will reboot as required.
 Upon loading back up, chkdsk tells me everything is clean and windows boots. Then freezes, causing me to force my machine off. After turning it back on AGAIN, it will prompt for another chkdsk and find more bad clusters. Rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've reformatted at least 4 times now, it seems like it could be fromthe updates as the machine won't start freezing until AFTER I get everything installed. (I Ninite at least 10 programs, install Steam, save all my credentials, then update Windows because
 it will prompt restarts).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been at this on and off for almost a week and I've going crazy, PLEASE&nbsp;can anyone help? Specs below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asus IV Gene LGA 2011 mobo</p>
<p>Rosewill extreme series x850</p>
<p>Intel Core i7-3820 Sandy Bridge-E 3.6GHz</p>

<h2>            My WiFi adapter continues to disconnect and disable itself</h2>
                    So I moved back to school several days ago and from the get-go I've been having problems with my WiFi. I can't stay connected to the WiFi for very long and after a while my WiFi adapter will ultimately just disable itself and I'm unable to enable it again.
 I'm ultimately forced to restart my PC, but for whatever reason it's having problems restarting as well. It gets stuck on the restarting screen before it crashes and restarts that way. I wasn't having these problems at home when I was connected to my personal
 internet connection, but now I'm connected to the school's WiFi so I'm unable to check the modem/router directly. Additionally my phone is able to stay connected to the same WiFi network without having any problems, so I wouldn't expect it to be a problem
 with the network. All of my drivers appear to be up-to-date on the WiFi adapter and the problem has persisted through multiple restarts over the course of several days. I really don't know what else to do at this point, so if an

            Hey EO.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates by installing and running Hide Updates tool from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Most Uni's and colleges also have IT Support help desks that must work with you to get you connected and will help you find out why not.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Microsoft Rewards Xbox App not working</h2>
                    Today when I tried accessing the Microsoft Rewards app, it kept telling me that I needed to update my current location before I could use it. The problem is that my location has never changed so there's nothing to update. I've tried that anyway along with
 restarting the console and uninstalling/reinstalling the app but nothing works. I never had this problem before so what's going on?

<p>Hello Jason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question on the issue with the app. There have been a few posts on this issue already this morning. There could be a update coming out for this. Make sure your console is up to date on all apps. Go to my games and
 apps check under updates. Are you currently enrolled in the insider program?</p>
<p>

            I also had the same error popped up. I never updated my location or did anything other than check back into the app later on and everything worked fine. Anytime something like that happens, it seems to temporary and fixes itself.

<h2>            Windows 7 Professional - Multiple use</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>I am posting here to highlight what I feel is a gross injustice in Microsoft’s pricing policy for Windows 7. I have chosen to install Windows 7 Professional and have three computers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>One is a high spec machine which I use mostly for music production, photo editing and more processor intensive tasks. The second is a working laptop for day to day internet and admin use.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The third is a netbook for keeping records on the move. I wish to have Windows 7 Professional on all three as I would like to make use of the extra features not found in the Home editions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I chose to purchase the full version as two of my computers were running XP which would require a clean install and the third had Vista which again need a clean install for Windows 7 Professional and as the online retailer I chose was offering the full
 version at the same price as the upgrade. <span>&nbsp;</span>I have successfully installed and activated the software on my number two machine.
<span>&nbsp;</span>After installing on my netbook I get a message that Windows 7 cannot be activated on that computer as it is already activated on another,
<span>&nbsp;</span>After installing on my netbook I get a message that Windows 7 cannot be activated on that computer as it is already activated on another,
<span>&nbsp;</span>the other being my number two computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>the other being my number two computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Having investigated further it seems that in order to run Windows 7 Professional on all three of my computers I have to buy three separate copies thereby obtaining three separate activation codes one for each computer. Based on the pricing from Microsoft’s
 own online store (I know that many places are offering discounts as the copy I have was purchased for around £150) this would cost £659.97 (around £450 with ‘street price’).<span>&nbsp;
</span>However if you elect for Home Premium you can have a single copy for £149.99 or a three licence pack enabling you to activate Windows 7 on three separate computers for what appears to be the same price.</p>
<p>My question is why are other versions of Windows 7 excluded from this option of having a multiple licence deal.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Many households must have more than one computer these days and it would stand to reason that you would want to upgrade each one of them. If Microsoft are so keen at squeezing more of our hard earned out of us could they not at least have a system whereby
 you can purchase an additional licence code (up to a certain number) for a reduced fee so that you are not forced into buying complete product that you neither need nor want?

            You don't need to buy the Full version for any of your computers. All three qualify for the cheaper Upgrade version of Windows 7.

<div><br />
<div>As I have XP you need a&nbsp;clean&nbsp;install so no upgrade installation, same with Vista, there's no upgrade from Vista Home to Windows 7 Professional it's a clean install. The full version gives you the option to upgrade or full install but there's no upgrade
 available for either XP or Vista Home so the upgrade software would have been little use for me. Even if I had the upgrade I would still need&nbsp;three&nbsp;activation&nbsp;codes.&nbsp;</div>

            You can use a Windows 7 upgrade disk to do a clean install on a computer with Windows XP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Using a Windows 7 upgrade disk to do a clean install on a computer with Windows XP</strong>
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (http://windows.microsoft.com/upgradeadvisor) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Save your files and settings on an external hard drive using Windows Easy Transfer (http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer). If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer. Alternatively, you can copy
 files you want to keep on a USB flash drive, CDs, or DVDs.<br />
<br />
3. You'll need to manually reinstall your programs, such as Microsoft Office, after you install Windows 7. Gather the installation discs for your programs and any associated product/license keys. You might be able to download some programs from the Internet.
 For example, Windows Live Messenger can be installed from download.live.com/messenger.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed, use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files and settings.

<div>I've done this already.</div>

<div>What I don't want to do is buy the full product or the upgrade product twice more just to get two more activation codes so that I can run Windows 7 Professional on my other two computers. maybe I'll just go on eBay and buy codes off these guys:-</div>

            Microsoft posters in this forum have stated that those keys on eBay are illegal (unless they come with a DVD I believe).<br />
<br />
Yes I read your post - you were stating that you have to buy a Full copy of Windows 7 if you have XP installed. I was posting the correct information so other people who read this thread don't get the wrong info. Which is - You can use a Windows 7 upgrade disk
 to do a custom clean install on a computer with Windows XP.<br />
<br />

<strong>How many Computers Can You Install One License On?</strong> <br />
<br />
If you purchase one (1) Windows 7 edition, you may install and activate it on just one (1) computer.<br />

"As I have XP you need a&nbsp;clean&nbsp;install so no upgrade installation, same with Vista, there's no upgrade from Vista Home to Windows 7 Professional it's a clean install. The full version gives you the option to upgrade or full install but there's no upgrade available
 for either XP or Vista Home <strong>so the upgrade software would have been little use for me</strong> . "<br />

That is suggesting you have to buy the Full version, but in that situation the Upgrade version will work. In most areas of the world the Upgrade is cheaper then the Full version so I wanted to post the correct info.<br />

Unfortunately Microsoft doesn't offer a discount for the Professional version, just the Home Premium Family Pack Upgrade.<br />

    <title>Recycle Bin thumbnails - not all disappear when Bin is emptied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> span-unit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recycle Bin thumbnails - not all disappear when Bin is emptied</h2>
                    <p>For the past 3 or 4 weeks, whenever I empty my Recycle Bin there are 1 or more thumbnails that do not disappear. The files have been deleted and emptied from the Recycle Bin - but the thumbnail(s) remain. When I refresh or close/reopen.. they will disappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only been noticeable the past few weeks.. before, emptying the Recycle Bin resulted in a blank screen. I add to and empty my Recycle Bin frequently and this kinda bugs me - I always worry about little things like this when they suddenly begin to
 occur, as there is always a chance of malware.</p>

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you think an app or driver that you recently installed caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: </strong>If you suspect any kind of malware, I would recommend you to perform a scan with Microsoft Safety scanner and check if it helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Typing with the xbox one controller</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I bought an xbox one a few days ago, and there's this problem when I try and type on the controller to send a message or search with internet explorer. if I make a mistake while typing and try to delete the word, the backspace bar sticks down on the screen,
 and causes it to mess up. Heres an example of what it looks like:</p>

<p><span>"Hi ma te, doy ou want top lay titanfall?"</span></p>
<p><span>when it should look like</span></p>
<p><span>"Hi mate, do you want to play titanfall?"</span></p>
<p><span><span>Please let me know if you have been experiencing this error, or if I'm the only one :)</span><br />
</span></p>

<p>I think typing with the controller is a pain in the you know what when using IE, it's ok for messaging, but I don't use it on the web, on the very odd time I do use Xbox for IE, I have a cheap USB keyboard that works perfectly. I cannot say what I experience
 is down to a bad controller though, it works perfectly.</p>

<h3> christiandyott  say:</h3>
<h2>            Official 1080i patch info&#63;</h2>
                    I don't want to ramble about why, I've seen other threads about this topic, but never a yes/no/reasonable response other than 'buy a new TV' or '720p is better' (IMO it isn't) Does anyone have any official (or non-official) statement about XBO receiving
 an update to accept &amp; output 1080i? If yes, is there any relative timeline for this? Thanks in advance for any real info; I have to say this is the most disappointing thing about my XBO purchase, otherwise I think it's pretty good and should only get better!

<p>I wouldnt count on it being patched in since its not something people widely want. &nbsp;They have never meantioned anything about it either, im sure it could be added in but im not sure they would. &nbsp;Is there a reason why you don't want to use 720p? I can understand
 youd want it if your tv only accepts 1080i and not 720p because i know some first generation hdtvs couldnt do 720p. &nbsp;Not to sound like a negative nancy to push this on you but I dont really see the reason to want 1080i other then your tv doesnt do 720p/1080p?
 I know 1080i sounds better and closure to 1080p but it isnt. &nbsp; 1080i when viewing static images would look better then 720p but when it comes to stuff moving youd really want to use a progressive based resolution. &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be added but there is really no
 new new on anything being added besides the twitch streaming. &nbsp;They added in extra resolutions on 360 so it may be done on xbox one but i wouldnt hold my breath.</p>

<p>How do you know its not something people widely want? &nbsp;Obviously, you have not see the numerous threads with multiple replies in these forums and the requests on social media begging support for answers on when a patch for 1080i support will be added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether 1080i or 720p is better depends on several factors such as content, TV type, viewing distance and just comes down to user opinion. &nbsp;Progressive is better for FAST moving video (like sports).&nbsp; Interlaced is&nbsp;better for anything without fast motion
 (not just static images) and the interlaced "motion blur" that occurs with fast moving video is not always noticeable on all TVs or to all people. &nbsp;So some people prefer the higher resolution of 1080i to the progressive scan of 720p if they don't notice any
 "motion blur".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most TV shows like sitcoms, dramas, etc... that do not have fast moving video will look better in 1080i than 720p because of the higher resolution. &nbsp;Most TV channels in the US broadcast in 1080i for this reason. &nbsp;And most cable boxes output in 1080i. &nbsp;Many
 people consider the Xbox One's scaling of 1080i TV content to 720p a downgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox One's GPU has a built-in scaler. &nbsp;The PS4 uses the same GPU and it supports 1080i. &nbsp;And the only reason MS has given to not including 1080i is because of the "motion blur" and that seems like a ridiculous reason to not include a resolution option,
 especially when there are many people that own 1080i only HDTVs (if MS is in to making choices for people than they shouldn't have included 720p either, since 1080p and 4K resolutions are better than 720p). &nbsp;So I see no reason why it would not be added.&nbsp; Also,
 Major Nelson said on reddit that there are teams looking at issues like this and that things are going to improve.</p>

<p>+1 for requesting support for 1080i as an output for the XB1. </p>
<p>my Mitsubishi DLP only accepts 1080i as an input and auto scales to 1080p. it does the deinterlacing on the disply. so having to use the XB1 as 720p is not what i want. And downgrading my DirecTV STP to 720p is an ugly option i will not consider. thanks</p>

<p>Just following up here... I know there are a lot of people that would like this too based on numerous threads and Google searches on the topic. &nbsp;I have a tv that accepts 1080i, 720p, 720i, and 480p and i. &nbsp;It upscales to 1080p with negligible to no motion
 blur, and there is a noticeable difference between 1080i and 720p; I also have DirecTV which only outputs up to 1080i--and a major reason I bought XBO was for the tv integration. &nbsp;I won't argue numbers of those who do or don't want this, but it seems like
 I'm far from alone. &nbsp;I think NJDevils probably answered it best, which is very disappointing. &nbsp;I only wish I could know if it will be patched or not with some official acknowledgement of all these requests, both myo own and others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Who makes these ridiculous decisions at MS? Seriously, I own a Mitsubishi 1080i only tv. I know it's old, but the darn thing looks fantastic to this day. I was EXTREMELY disappointed when I fired up my XBO only to be told 480P only is available. My freaking
 PC which is also connected to my 1080i TV has absolutely no problem adapting games to 1080i. This is inexcusable for MS to do. How do you guys stay in business making such ridiculous petty decisions. To force people to play online only is absurd. To force
 people to spend an extra $100 for a glitchy camera peripheral is also ridiculous. You have this thing called competition which in my honest opinion winning this next Gen battle. If you're going to make a next generation system with ram issues, resolution issues,
 audio decoding issues and sell it over priced you better look over your shoulder as your customers dump you and move to Sony. It is ridiculous in this day and age to not consider AUTOMATIC AUDIO DECODING, why on earth do I have to switch options manually?
 My $60 bluray player has more common sense than your supposed next gen tech. Don't get me started on your non-existent app market which is killing you with the younger crowd. I am no media person but as a guy who's currently working on his MBA, I am on a daily
 basis questioning your decisions over at MS and using you as an example of horrible management. Why do you people go live with operating systems that require apps if you're not going to have your
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> together? &nbsp; The reason I post this is because I believe in your products and have been fooled for the last time. I spent $500 of my hard earned money on a system that is a train wreck at best. One would think that after years
 of dealing with similar issues with XBox 360 that you would have anticipated the problems your system is currently having. Here's an idea for you, why on earth not make all your xbox live games also available on Xbox one and Windows 8? My freaking phone has
 the power to run most of those games, why is this rocket science over at Microsoft? The PS4 does 1080i, why is this not an option for your inferior tech? &nbsp;Sincerely, a *** off and very disappointed supporter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a 1080p tv that accepts 1080p, so this issue doesn't affect me. &nbsp;But not having a 1080i option is a pretty significant feature the Xbox One is lacking. &nbsp;1080i is better than 720p, unless the game's native resolution is 720p or less. &nbsp;1080i is the
 same resolution as 1080p, just with half the frame rate. &nbsp;It's essentialy 1920x1080 at 30 fps. &nbsp;Everything will be as detailed as 1080p when there's no or little motion, but there will be more blurring during motion. &nbsp;How much more depends on the TV and its
 deinterlacer, but it's usually not that severe. &nbsp;A lot of people probably wouldn't even notice the difference between 1080i and 1080p. &nbsp;For a game that's natively higher resolution than 720p, 1080i would always be a better choice than 720p. &nbsp;The small increase
 in "motion resolution" wouldn't be worth giving up all those pixels.</p>

<p>There will never be an excuse for removing features.</p>
<p>The fact they had to go in a fix many features that were common in the 360 shows lack of planning.</p>
<p>You many argue that this is a small issue but it should be a non issue.</p>
<p>Give the consumer the choice of resolution and other options so this won't even be a problem.</p>
<p>It is a big slap in the face when you buy a new Xbox one and it looks worse than your old 360.</p>

<h2>            USB Printer not responding after sleep - MP780</h2>
                    I have a Canon MP780 printer. After Windows 7 (x64) goes to sleep and wakes up, I can not print. The job remains in the Queue...but the printer just sits there. The Canon does go into energy saving mode, but waking it up manually doesn't do anything either.
 The job remains in the Q. Attempting to reprint it does not work either. I have the latest drivers.

<p>I will answer my own question. The solution that worked for me was to remove the Canon driver and use the windows update method. For whatever reason downloading the Canon driver and installing that way doesn't work (and research shows that others have had
 the same difficulty).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So...remove the printer. Then use windows update to download new drivers. Then plug in the printer once again and select it from the list of windows update supplied drivers. The printer, fax, and scan functions now work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks everyone.</p>

    <title>Flash stops working, windows 10, Midrosoft Edge and Internet Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Flash stops working, windows 10, Midrosoft Edge and Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I have seen a billion people saying their adobe embedded flash is not working. Plus I see no solutions for my situation and my situation seems unique.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works, the settings are all correct and everything is enabled. However, I can watch YOUTUBE.COM without any issues, but it stops working in different popular sites. I clean my browsing history every time I exit. It will work for a while, then stop with
 no mention of any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So freaking maddening. I wish Microsoft&nbsp;would allow us to download a clean complete system behind a partition that doesn't require a computer expert. I believe I might need to do that. I don't know if its related, but my computer has never been the same
 since I took it back to windows 8 from 8.1. I got the free upgrade to 10, and I paid for 10 pro. But my problems persist. Taking it back again, would not be a good option since I had a bunch of problems the first time I backed it up to windows 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one suggest a fix for the embedded flash. It acts the same in both Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer. HELP!</p>
