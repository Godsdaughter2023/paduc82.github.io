<h2>            Task manager does not show all memory usage</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>past few days I have been watching my&nbsp;Laptop performance and I noticed that for&nbsp;some reason my Task Manger does not show all memory usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop has 8 GB of RM and&nbsp;TM shows 33% usage&nbsp;which is&nbsp;~2.6GB memory usage and&nbsp;some basic math with Windows Calculator shows only&nbsp;&nbsp;~1.3 GB usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone explain me where are the rest 1.3 GB and why there isn't any record of&nbsp;it :?</p>
<p>

</p><p>In task manager it lists processes and apps.&nbsp; It does not list things like shared video ram, fast cache, etc.&nbsp; For a more accurate view of ram usage you should use resource monitor.&nbsp; In task manager&gt;performance tab&gt;open resource monitor (or type resmon in
 search)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically Win 8.1 takes about 1/2 of the ram and puts it into fast cache (a good thing) so that when you launch an app it launches faster.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 starter cant log in</h2>
                    I just bought a netbook from a friend but he cant rememeber the password, it contains windows 7 starter. ive tried creating loging into the admin account but as it turns out the admin account is his account, there are no others, not even a&nbsp; guest&nbsp; acount.
 ive tried multiple password recovery programs from windows and it wont go through. he claims to have gotten a virus before he put it on the shelf for about 4-5 months. ive tried everything i could think of, even the computers system recovery but it requires
 the admin password. im now to the point where i think i need to burn a system recovery disk but i would like to know what this will do, will i lose all the contained info on the netbook? will this reset the password? will this enable me to create new accounts
 or log on to the admin account without a weeks worth of effort? any help would be appriciated, thanks.

            OK, below you will a rather painful procedure to reset any password. Before I start I need to make you aware of a few things.<br />
<ul>
<li>Using an infected PC is risky. You might infect your friend's machines and if you happen to have a virus that collects EMail addresses then your contacts will receive lots of spam mail without being aware that your machine is responsible.</li><li>The previous owner was negligent in several regards. Windows 7 has a nifty facility to create a password keyfile to protect the owner in case he forgets his password. It was created especially for people like him.</li><li>Having a single admin account is risky, for obvious reasons. Create and test two admin accounts, then keep a printed record of their details.</li><li>Find out from the manufacturer's home site how to restore the machine to factory condition. I think you should do it. It would give you a machine that is guaranteed virus free and you won't have any password hassles.</li></ul>
You can reset any password by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp;7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp;8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;9. Reboot normally but hold down the Shift key permanently.<br />
10. When challenged for a password, tap the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerharduslourens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 and also have installed Windows XP running in a virtual machine.&nbsp;I installed&nbsp;the Windows 10 upgrade but when I tried to access the virtual&nbsp;machine &nbsp;I got the message that VMCPropertyhandler.dll was not found in Windows System 32. I tried
 to download the file from&nbsp; the internet but got the message&nbsp;that the download was not safe. Clicking on a caption on the internet "VMCPropertyhandler.dll for Windows 10"&nbsp; showed that the page does not exist. I restored Windows 7 and searched for the property
 handler. It is and always was in Windows System 32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recently bought a Packard Bell laptop with Windows 10 installed. The laptop also has a file called Reimage Plus 2. This program checks Windows and regularly reports hundreds of serious errors in Windows 10 and I have to regularly run a Reimage Repair.
 The reports regularly show that the following processes have crashed:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Windows Restart Manager</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsiInstaller</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office 2016 Licensing service</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows Immersive shell</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft.Photos.exe</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solitaire.exe</p>
<p>The program also states that there are shared .dll errors.</p>
<p>It does not seem safe to install the Windows 10 upgrade and judging from the many posts in internet regarding the VMC property handler&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;seems to be &nbsp;unsolvable. Please can somebody tell me what my best course is. At present I am prepared to continue
 with Windows 7 even if Microsoft discontinues support. I will simply buy 3rd party virus protection software and reset Windows Update to avoid updates.</p>

            Thanks Andre &nbsp;for the response. I am using the virtual machine utility that I downloaded from the Microsoft website at the time I bought and installed Windows 7. This was in order to run my Windows XP stuff. Does this answer your question?

            Windows Virtual PC does not work on Windows 10. You need to use a compatible virtual machine utility such as Oracle Virtual Box or VMWare Player.

<p>I am looking at the reports for my son's gaming activity and the times do not match up at all - it shows him playing games at 3am, which I know is incorrect.&nbsp; I checked the console's clock and time zone and this is correct.&nbsp; Is there somewhere else that
 I should be looking to fix this time alignment problem?</p>

<p>Please understand that they were refering to the Xbox Live time showing, if you are having an issue with your Xbox.com timezone double check you have the correct timezone selected in your settings on the forums. &nbsp;If it still shows the wrong time it will
 be something that will be fixed. &nbsp;You can access the forum settings on the main page. &nbsp;I hope this helps you Metal10957</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

<h2>            Skype in Windows 10 not recognising my mike</h2>
                    <p>When I try to make or a receive a skype call, my mike is not working. I can see video and hear the caller but they cannot hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has got progressively worse and since uninstalling skype and then trying to reinstall and finding that it is automatically on my laptop the mike function now never works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed all advice about testing the audio device updating drivers, removing enhanced functions etc, but nada. Everything tells me it is up to date and functioning properly when it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the problem with my laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! Skype is essential to my work, as I work internationally and to many friendships!</p>

<p>I have just done an echo test on the web based skype and it worked perfectly.</p>

</p><p>The issue is obviously with the version of skype we are using - the 'official desktop app', which is frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi James_S,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
What I recommend is getting a good backup of your XP partition.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Back up all important information before you perform&nbsp;this operation. &nbsp;Save the backup to an external location, such as a CD or external hard disk.
</li><li>Start your computer from the Windows XP CD. To do this, insert the Windows XP CD into your CD drive or DVD drive, and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> To boot from your Windows XP CD, the BIOS settings on your computer must be configured to do this.
</li><li>When you see the "Press any key to boot from CD" message, press any key to start the computer from the Windows XP CD.
</li><li>At the <strong>Welcome to Setup</strong> screen, press ENTER to start Windows XP Setup.
</li><li>Read the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then press F8. </li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen AND SELECT AND <strong>FORMAT</strong> THE
<strong>VISTA PARTITION</strong> THAT IS LOADED ON THE SYSTEM.<br />
<br />
After it is formatted, no need to continue with the install.&nbsp; Just abort the operation.&nbsp; Be very careful to select the right partition to format.
</li></ol>
<p>If you are still receiving the error at boot up we may have a little more&nbsp;corrections to resolve in the bootcfg /file, but that should be on the XP side so we will cover that error if it occurs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep us advised on this so we may further assist you as necessary.<br />
<br />

 been working for a week to find out the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took apart my graphics card (an nVidia GTX 260) and cleaned out all the dust, clean wiped and installed fresh drivers from nVidia, and still no joy. I stress tested my card to see if it was indeed hardware failure, and even had a replacement picked out
 at Newegg ready to order. But I noticed that after installing THE LATEST DRIVER DIRECT FROM NVIDIA, Windows Update would go ahead and install the driver itself later on, and once it did the error would return once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked 4 times now, and when I wipe out all the old driver files, and redo it the computer runs without issue, and I put in a good 6 or so hours in Warframe one time just to confirm it. But once Windows Update does its thing, the error starts happening
 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to get Windows to stop updating the driver (which I kid you not, is updating to the same damn version number), using methods like "System Information-&gt;Device Installation Settings", and messing with group policy, and yet it still updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand requiring security updates, that I get and am fine with. But why the (and yes this cuss word is warranted) absolute **** can someone who knows what they are doing not at least disable something like driver updates? I've been doing tech support
 for family/friends on windows machines for years, and have kept this desktop running for 8 years now. I know enough to at least keep things like graphics drivers updated (which windows update should defer to programs like nVidia experience which can do the
 auto updates better), and should be allowed to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, TL;DR - Windows Update is **** up my gfx drivers and causing TDR failures, how the hell can I get this **** to stop?<br />

            <p>Yes, Im sorry... I spaced out and posted it in Vista.&nbsp; Im&nbsp; running XP.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue started when I hit a webpage and "something" downloaded.&nbsp; A java logo came up, a file downloaded befoare I could stop it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would redirect IE, it changed my Office word normal.doc. but it would also run an ad, music, etc, in the background (the
 ad sounded like Yahoo), with IE NOT running.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I pulled up task manager, there would be as many as 5 IExplore tasks when I was NOT running IE.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran AVG, Malwarebytes, Superantispyware, Microsoft MRT..&nbsp;&nbsp; A few adwares, a couple of Rogue virus.&nbsp; All cleaned up nicely.&nbsp; I have since run all of the above.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have since run all of them again, in safemode, and they find nothing, but Im still getting
 IE tasks without actually running IE.&nbsp; Im also still getting redirected to sites when using Bing or google...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks..</p>

<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and Restart IE<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still
<br />
installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other
<br />
possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right.
<br />
Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about
<br />
it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and<br />
run - not all are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

If needed and you suspect malware :<br />
<br />
Check for malware and when you are sure the system is clean run the cleanup.<br />
<br />
Do a thorough check as often this sort of malware is accompanied by a much tougher to detect
<br />
and remove payload. Better to go overboard now rather than pay the price later.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;them
<br />
in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />

<h2>            No internet connection</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo Ideapad netbook that has stopped connecting to the internet. It will not connect by either ethernet or wireless and has been doing this since being restarted last night. The internet is working for 3 other devices connected to the same
 router. I can't even get into the modem settings. The windows troubleshooting identifies a problem with the identity of the dns server but gives little help. Device manager shows no issues on the PC.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried a number of solutions as Google shows this to be a common problem. The solutions I've tried include un-installing and reinstalling the network drivers, flushing the dns, turning off the firewall and removing all recently installed and updated
 programs. I've also tried setting the preferred dns in properties and disabling ipv6 and the virtual wifi miniport, all to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am hoping that might be another solution that doesn't involve a factory reset.</div>

            You might try "system restore" if you haven't already. If your not&nbsp;familiar&nbsp;with it, it's a program that comes with windows that allows you to restore your settings to a previous date. You won't loose any data or anything like that. Here's a good article
 on it.

<br />
My daughter's Lenove ideapad had the same problem arise at the same time.&nbsp; No changes were made to the configs.&nbsp; Neither of the answers above is helpful - but thanks anyway of course.&nbsp; A system restore is a pain at best, and is unlikely to be a permanent fix.&nbsp;
 No config changes were made, so I wouldn't know what to change back.<br />
<br />
Could it be a Windows Update issue?<br />

<p>The update KB2705219 could be the cause and uninstalling that has fixed the problem for some users.</p>
<p><em>To uninstall an update - Control panel, Programs &amp; features, [left-hand side of the window] View installed updates. Wait until the system has finished searching for the list of updates. Select required update then right-click &amp; Uninstall.</em></p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>In another thread [<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/my-computer-today-installed-windows-7-updates-but/89a94830-e26f-48d2-8d95-d81eb503eee6">My computer today installed windows
 7 updates, but my internet has been lost. But the network is visible. what has caused this?</a>] a user has identified this McAfee notice -</p>

<p>Whilst it remains the case that uninstalling the Win7 update KB2705219 fixed the problem for at least two users, you should do the McAfee fix, if applicable. At least two users had also reported having removed then reinstalled McAfee and their systems were
 back up &amp; running correctly afterwards.</p>
<p>I have McAfee but the connection started working again of its own accord so I thought I was clear of problems. However, when I checked it said it had been doing routine checks for updates but failed when I told it to do one manually. So staying with McAfee
 without following their removal-reinstall procedure would have put my PC at risk by not being updated.
<em>Actually, I removed it then installed Microsoft Security Essentials instead &amp; my IE response is quicker than I have known it [even though I had had the McAfee add-ons disabled for ages]. My home network survived the replacement without any new setting up

<p>I've had to run the MCPRT removal a few times before and it caused a licence problem if the PC was not connected to the internet during the removal. The McAfee support chat had to reset their records to allow reinstallation-reactivation. Here's their chat

            Thanks very much for that reply.&nbsp; You clearly know a few things!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It turns out that she had not installed KB2705219.&nbsp; In fact, it is on a list of failed installs (all 31 of them) because the relevant windows service (I forget the name) is not allowed to access the internet.<br />
<br />
It might help for me to mention that <br />
<br />
1) She can still connect to our home network.<br />
2) Turning off the McAfee firewall did not alleviate the problem.&nbsp; BTW, She has the McAfee AntiVirus Plus product.<br />
3)&nbsp; Now, McAfee sees home network resources but warns her that another machine (mine) is running an older version of McAfee<br />
<br />
I am still inclined to uninstall McAfee, but I will ask her to call or contact Lenovo first.&nbsp; I am getting fed up with McAfee anyway.&nbsp; They have started blocking legitimate sites I regularly use, and most recently they have blocked Amazon.com pages on two different
 occasions.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Well, please pardon the venting, and thanks again for your help<br />

            <p>Do you have a system image from a time when updating was working correctly? &nbsp; This might be the best place to start troubleshooting from so you can see the effect of each of your steps.&nbsp; If you don't have an image then it will make troubleshooting more difficult.&nbsp;

<p>I held off uninstalling McAfee until earlier today.&nbsp; I was worried that I'd have to get to grips with the detailed settings of my home network in Windows Firewall and I hadn't made the time to study the subject.&nbsp; As it turned out, I uninstalled McAfee and
 Windows Firewall just accepted the network without any manual adjustment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So I could have updated to MSSE instead six months ago when I found out how&nbsp;poor McAfee [tech support] Chat staff were.&nbsp; As&nbsp; my subscription lasts until January, I just put the job off continually.</p>
<p>I have also had frustrating page not found etc problems in IE.&nbsp; Mainly on this site as I tend to open &amp; close dozens of threads in any session.&nbsp; Amazon was also sometimes a problem for the same reason [many tabs open while I'm comparing products trying to
 make a decision].&nbsp; I didn't know whether it was McAfee at fault or some Windows / IE function.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Since uninstalling McAfee then running its removal tool&nbsp;then installing MSSE [in that sequence], I have deliberately been running all day with this site &amp; some news sites to try to break my excellent IE performance but have failed to do so.&nbsp; It seems that
 removing McAfee was the best thing I could have done.</p>

            Try this, go to tools, internet options (in internet explorer), then go to the connections tab at the top, from there click on "lan settings", if you have "use a proxy server' checked, un check it, and see if that fixes the&nbsp;internet&nbsp;issue. Also, have you
 tried going to a command prompt and pinging a website like www.google.com or something like that? if not, give it a shot, and let me know if you get any replies, and what ip address it replies with (if it gives you a reply). Another thing you might want to
 try is doing an ipconfig from a command prompt on the lenovo, and doing the same on one of the machines that are working to see if they have the same gateway address.

<br />
This is a belated response because I have been extremely busy and out-of-town.&nbsp; First I want to thank DarkIQ and Try*3.&nbsp; Second, I'd like to describe what I did to solve the problem:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Uninstall McAfee<br />
2.&nbsp; Install Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
3.&nbsp; (Optional) Install Noscript on Firefox.<br />
<br />
I did this on three PCs.&nbsp; The problems with McAfee were <br />
a) loss of internet connectivity on the Lenovo<br />
b) Prevented Mozilla from updating Firefox on my wife's Dell.&nbsp; I found out about this while diagnosing why she could no longer watch videos:&nbsp; Adobe would not update without the Firefox update.<br />
c) Blocked legitimate sites on my Dell, in some cases interfering with business.<br />
<br />
Thanks again DarkIQ and Try*3.&nbsp; I appreciate your time and talent.&nbsp; I am just fed up with McAfee.<br />

<p><span>Hello cylaw,</span></p>
<p><span>This problem occurs if the Media Center certificate is corrupted or if the Network List Service is not running.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To fix the problem, try the methods mentioned in the below article:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>While attempting to use your Xbox 360 console as a Media Center Extender, you receive the error message: "Configuration Error"</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/932342</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>For the service not running,</span><span>I suggest you to&nbsp;<strong>run SFC scan</strong>
 to find missing or corrupt files that may be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows 7 system files are where they should be as they were by default and not corrupted,
 changed, or damaged. </span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and&nbsp; select Run as Administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>sfc
 /scannow</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You
 should see the following on-screen message:</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</span></p>
<p><span>Beginning verification phase of system scan.</span></p>
<p><span>Verification % complete.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for helping.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have tried the steps in the 932342&nbsp;article before I posted this article but unfortunately it is of no help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided to try it again.&nbsp; Shown below is the scan I performed</p>

<p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>

<h2>            Sharing Files</h2>
                    <p>We use Windows 7 Pro 64 in our office, for a business operated by my wife and myself. We have a peer to peer network with a dedicated workgroup. Folders that our staff need to access are shared, everyone, read/write so that staff can scan docs to applicable
 folders/files. However, there are a number of folders which my wife and I want to be able to "share" with each other, but not have these folders/files seen by our staff? So far as I can tell, you either share a file with "everyone" or "nobody". Is there some
 middle tier? If so how do I configure these folders/files for this purpose?</p>

<p>i just hooked up my old org. xbox360(first release model)</p>
<p>took the new update(s).</p>
<p>JUST about every title i put in will not play at ALL.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Madden06 works just great?????</span></p>
<p>burnout:revenge doesn't(i know it's up for shutdown,not the point here)</p>
<p>battlefield3 will not read.</p>
<p>battlefield:BC2 will not read</p>
<p>and instead of me going on and on about what won't work let us getting into the why(s)??????</p>
<p>That is my question</p>
<p>WHY doesn't the xbox read my discs(that work on other systems(both an org. xbox360 &nbsp;release(year2) and the slim model)?????</p>
<p>BUT only ONE title from 2006 reads/plays just fine, none of my other titles work; this is a jasper board xbox and never had issues with it until i packed it up just over a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>IF this is due to XBL console update then i should not have to pay for it to be repaired at all..(Being it is no fault of mine,but&nbsp;the fact is being caused by an update=<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft XBL&nbsp;broke my system and/or
 made it unworkable</span>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Once again i'll repeat that<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> it will only read MADDEN:06 and no other titles</span>; being it reads a game it's not a disc drive issue.</strong></p>

<p>PLEASE to those that are upset about this issue,KEEP THE LANG. CLEAN THIS TIME...Breaking TOU/COC in the forums isn't helping to resolve the issue,it's just causing the topic to be ignored.</p>
<p>Guess i wasn't clear enough..</p>
<p>every possible SO-CALLED fixes people are suggesting have been done so many times i forgot how many.</p>
<p>this system wirked just fine before i took the console update(new firmware);</p>
<p>the system WILL read ONE disc MADDEN:06</p>
<p>it WILL NOT read newer titles(all play fine not only on slim model but also on a 2006 model(offline for 2006;no update installed, system was never plugged into the internet),strictly an XBL update issue that needs to be address,even on my slim model alot
 of my arcade titles i bought along time ago come up as trails(AT FIRST)</p>
<p>EX:CATAN=when i load title and go to rank match(or options) it states i need to buy title before showing as a bought title, this started right after the format update.</p>
<p>even some disc titles state i need to buy an online pass and have to reload title for it to take.</p>
<p>things that i have done:</p>
<p>EVERYTHING remove HDD; clear cashe even deleting and re-downloading doesn't change what's going on.</p>
<p>Even took HDD and hooked it up to another org. xbox360(bought at sametime as the one NOT working right)</p>
<p>that console worked (without update installed)Console is not ban,either.Just to make sure of that i went into chat with support and had console ID checked against online bans,system is clean(which i already knew)</p>
<p>As for PAYING for my org. xbox360 to be repaired for something that IS being caused by the update, IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN..(as it is out of warrenty,being what caused the issue is an update that shouldn't matter)This what support is pushing for,at my cost(120.00
 or higher; shipping not included)For an extra what 50-79 i can buy a new one,NOT GONNA HAPPEN. Fix the update thus fixing the issue. Greed has been and always will be the down fall of a company; ingoring costumers just makes it worse.</p>
<p>And i am starting to believe what others are saying on this issue; The update was put out for more then just one reason and one of the reasons was to kill off the older systems(org. white consoles from release date up to 2008 models(that i have been able
 to find out,if there is later date models,PLEASE post date of your console that this glitch has claimed and killed system...
</p>
<p>PLEASE; do not; think i'm not thankful for the help.</p>
<p>If the system would not read ANY disc i wouldn't even have posted this.(would have just went with system is shot dvd drive/ optical eye went,BUT it reads at least one disc title(very old title,but it plays)</p>
<p>so the dvd drive does work.</p>
<p>yes, i have the new slim250GB,this was my back up incase the slim went and i had to send it in for repairs (i figured at least i would still have something to use until it was returned.</p>
<p>IF MS XBL wishes to do away with older (org xbox360's) fine..BUT a company of this size making more money then they will ever in 10 life times be able to spend,should at the very least buy them back at a fair price(being the issue IS because of thier new
 update) &nbsp; </p>
<p>the saddest part is the org. xbox360 system RUNS alot more quieter then my slim,it even took the update twice as fast compared to my slim.</p>
<p>sorry about the lenth of this.</p>
<p>i'm gonna try one last thing and formatt the HDD,as it is the only thing i have not tried.(doubt if it will work,can't hurt)</p>

<p>no </p>
<p>didn't resolve it,after going thru some research bottom line is the dvd drive will need to be replaced(I'm just lost as to why (NOW)two titles will work; madden:06 and viking.(if no disc would read i would understand it to be wear and tear(10-15hrs a day
 does overwork a system,but then all my titles are installed to HDD(so that should have cut that down)</p>
<p>IF this wasn't a jasper motherboard i wouldn't even care.. yes, it is an old system the only issue i ever had with it was the optical eye went out once before about 6 months after i got it,was repaired and worked great,once i picked up the slim i let my
 oldest son use it, was only on live for alittle bit(BUT wasn't online or played at all since around late sept 2011,the new format update wasn't out or installed)</p>
<p>BUT let me say sorry for being an tool on this issue; alittle out of line(maybe)thinking XBL would put out an update with the intent to do away with older(white)consoles(still a maybe)

            <p>Hello CAMEL! First of all, I can assure you that there is no intent to do away with older consoles - our updates have been certified for all consoles, from the very first Xbox 360 off the line to the latest Star Wars console. Unfortunately it sounds like in this case that your console will be in need of a repair to resolve an issue with disc read errors. I can certainly understand your frustration with this! You can set up a repair via our online service center, here: <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">myservice.xbox.com/.../Welcome.aspx</a> . Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns. :) </p>

<p>OK,this is how i fixed my issue with this:</p>
<p>as it turned out,all the issue was dirt build up inside the tray along the rim.</p>
<p>which caused the eye not to pick up on the fact a disc was put in..</p>
<p>unknown to me the ol' lady let the grand kids to play on the system(5 and 7 yrs. old)i did pay any mind to how dirty disc tray was.</p>
<p>The fix= 6-10(depends on how much build up is is along the rim of tray) q-tips and a bottle of cd/dvd cleaner(that's what i used) spray q-tips(not the tray)and begin cleaning the whole tray.</p>
<p>Now after that if your xbox still won't read disc(at your own risk,but then if it isn't working you got nothing to lose)use a optical eye disc cleaner(MADE FOR GAME SYSTEMS)others will scratch the eye,causing more damage thus making you to send your xbox
 in for repairs(getting a new drive installed)</p>
<p>SORRY people for making this out to be XBL fault; hangs head in shame for not checking everything out first and just accussing(spelling)on a update.</p>
<p>IF neither one of these options fix the unreadable disc issue(this also includes other fixes that are in this post by others); YOUR OPTICAL EYE IS SHOT.</p>

<p>no problem,i should have done this to start with,it is a old system and i should have known this,being i wasn't using it never thought about it.(of course candy coated hands didn't help much either)</p>
<p>i mean i do this at least once a week on my slim(but that one you can really see the build up,yeah i have a bad habit when i switch to an arcade title i remove disc put it in case,and leave the tray open(plus me being a smoker DOES NOT help at all)BUT yeah
 i could not believe how much got built up just not on the tray but inside the drive(what i could reach with Q-tip,pulled a nice hunk of junk out of the drive).</p>
<p>I would say (for systems in a smoking household)this causes alot of peoples issues.</p>

    <title>Task Scheduler Fails - Requested Operation Requires Elevation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonhainer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler Fails - Requested Operation Requires Elevation &#40;0x800702E4&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I use a product called SQLBackupAndFTP to do nightly backups of my SQL Server Express development environment. &nbsp;SQLBackupAndFTP creates a job on the Windows Task Scheduler to make this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to work perfectly, but ever since my system has been upgraded to Windows 10 Anniversary Edition, it has stopped working. &nbsp;Now I get an error message on the Task Scheduler that says, "The requested operation requires elevation. (0x800702E4)" &nbsp;This
 seemed odd, since the job is assigned to a user with appropriate privileges, and the "Run with highest privileges" option is set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I was researching what may have changed, I discovered the following web page from a separate product called Macrium Reflect. &nbsp;Macrium describes a bug whereby tasks created using version 1.0 of the Task Scheduler API fail to elevate properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Windows+10+Aniversary+Update+issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure enough, when I deleted the task entry created by the third party software and recreated it by hand in the Task Scheduler interface, it worked perfectly. &nbsp;The manually created task bypasses the other software's API calls, and then everything works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to document this on Microsoft's site, so that other folks may find a workaround to the issue more quickly.</p>
<p>

            <p>We have the same problem on Windows 10 version 1607.</p>
<p>We use the Task Scheduler API 1.0 to create scheduled tasks, that will run whether user is logged on or not and with highest privileges.</p>
<p>But when we try to execute this task we get the error "The requested operation requires elevation. (0x800702E4)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>We get this error only if the account who execute the task has a session opened.</p>
<p>If we change the execution account to other that has not session opened, it works. Or if we use the default administrator account who doesn't pass through the UAC (User Account Control) to elevate privileges, it works also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found the report of the problem in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update (Version 1607).</p>

    <title>External hard drive vanishes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suzers  say:</h3>
<h2>            External hard drive vanishes</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 about 3 weeks ago. I have an external drive that is always recognized when powered up but then vanishes when idle...maybe between 5 and 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>In power options, advanced settings the hard disk is set to be turned off after 999 minutes.
</p>
<p>The USB selective suspend setting is disabled</p>
<p>In device manager, USB controllers, generic hubs and root hubs set to <em>not</em> turn off the device to save power (on power management tab)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These settings have not corrected the problem. I tried using microsoft support chat last night and hoping to have better luck here. The chat support was not helpful. Sadly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the troubleshooting steps your have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, do let us know if the issue persists when you connect the external drive through a different USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Change "Turn off hard disk after" time</strong></p>
<p>You mentioned you set the hard disk turn off time to 999. I would suggest you to set the time to "never" and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>1. Type <strong>power options </strong>in the search bar and open it</p>
<p>2. Click on "<strong>change plan settings</strong>"</p>
<p>3. Click on "<strong>change advanced power settings</strong>"</p>
<p>4. Expand "<strong>hard disk"</strong> and "<strong>Turn off hard disk after</strong><strong>"
</strong>and change the time to <strong>"</strong><strong>never</strong><strong>".</strong></p>
<p>5. Click <strong>ok.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>1. Type troubleshooting in the search bar and open it.</p>
<p>2. Click on "<strong>view all</strong>" on the left pane.</p>
<p>3. Run the <strong>hardware and devices </strong>troubleshooter and follow the on-screen isntructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Clean Boot</strong></p>
<p>Check if the issue persists in clean boot state. <span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You
 need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Perform a Clean Boot?</a> (Applies to Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span>Once
 you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot "to reset computer as usual.
</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do get back to us with the result. We will be glad to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>I followed the directions for the settings, the troubleshooter and clean boot as specified. The drive is connected to another usb port but still the same results. If left idle the drive still vanishes. After the clean boot the drive was gone in about 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning the drive off and on makes the pc recognize the drive but it still will not remain recognized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing regarding this issue and also for the delay in getting back to you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right click on Start menu or Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, under <strong>Universal Serial Bus Controllers</strong>, double-click on the 1st Root Hub.
</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Go to the Power tab to see if the drive is connected to it. If not, try the next Root Hub. If so, click the
<strong>Power </strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management</strong> tab. Uncheck the box that says: "<strong>allow computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>".</p>

            <p>I had already de-checked this setting on all the USB possibilities in device manager...maybe a week ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one additional clue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just now I turned the external drive on, decided to eject it with safe eject and I got a message that the device was not removable and could not be ejected or unplugged. I could certainly live with this if the drive would just stay put and stop vanishing!
</p>
<p>Any clues? </p>

            <p>No errors if any kind. It does make a Windows sound and then vanishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the setting changes above have changed any behavior of the external drive removing itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help but I'm on a train to Paris (not terrorized!!) and will be gone for a week, no laptop, no external drive problems until I get back! Thanks</p>

<h2>            You don&#39;t have permission to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to this folder. Clicking Continue Does not work.</h2>
                    <p>I have an external hard drive from a Windows 7 laptop which I am currently trying to access the files of on a Windows 8.1 laptop. There are 7 folders in the hard drive, of which 4 I can access perfectly and the others I am completely denied access to. It
 will have the prompt "You don't have permission to access this folder. Click continue to permanently get access to this folder." I will click continue, the load bar will get to roughly 99%, but will never finish and I never gain access to the folder. The only
 difference I see between the folders which I have access to and the ones in I which do not is the fact that I technically shared the inaccessible folders with my homegroup and the currently accessible I did not. If I plug the external hard drive in back to
 the windows 7 laptop it works fine, but I need these files to be accessed from my new, Windows 8 laptop. I do not now if this is a permission issue, a sharing issue (which I don't see how it could be since it's directly plugged into the 8.1 laptop) or a combination
 of the 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried it with other computers with 7 that are in the homegroup and those also are denied access to to the folders and have the same infinite loading process to gain access to the folder.</p>
