<h2>            Gamer tag Reset</h2>
                    &nbsp;To all the active members currently on Xbox we don't really have access to any old OG gamertags. So I think a gamertag reset is needed so active members can get the gamertag they always dreamed of having. For accounts that have been inactive for two years
 plus should have their gamertag reset to an Xbox generated&nbsp;tag so active Xbox Live Gold Members can claim the gamertag as their own. OG gamertags are hard to find and hard to obtain since the owners of the accounts have been inactive and no longer are reachable
 so there's no way an active member could even buy the gamertag from said person. I think active members with Xbox Live Gold should be able to obtain these gamertags after a reset so that the gamertags they've always wanted can be put into good use. I propose
 Microsoft to find all the inactive accounts and reset their gamertags to an Xbox generated tag

            There is already a policy in place for this. If the person does not sign into their account for 5 years (starting in 2016) the gamertag will be freed up. Keep in mind that the gamertag system is in use on other Microsoft services as well, so even if it's
 not in use on an Xbox, it may be in use somewhere else.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Rohith,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>T</span><span>his error message might occur if there are issues with Windows components such as .Net Framework or Microsoft Visual C++ which are required to run the game. Also, compatibility of the game with Windows&nbsp;10 could also be one of the other
 reasons for this issue. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to reinstall .Net Framework and Microsoft Visual C++ and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong><span>Refer to the link to download and install the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package from Microsoft Download center:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=40784</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before running it, Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and choose <strong>
Programs and features</strong>. Check if the Microsoft Visual C++ package is listed within the list of installed programs. If yes, right click on it and choose
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Then, locate the setup for the package that you have just downloaded. Double Click on it and follow the onscreen instructions to install the program.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Proceed to the next step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>.Net Framework 4.5.1 is included on Windows 10. Let’s turn off and turn on features for .Net Framework version 4.5 as well as version 3.5 from Programs and features to troubleshoot the issue.
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Follow the steps below to Disable and Enable the .NET Framework.</li><li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>W</strong> and type <strong>Windows Features</strong> in the Search Field.</li><li>Select <strong>Turn Windows Features on or off</strong>.</li><li>In the window that opens, uncheck the <strong>.NET Framework 4.5</strong> and select
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Also, uncheck the box for .Net Framework 3.5(if it’s checked). If it’s already unchecked, check the box.
</li><li>Restart the computer.</li><li>To enable it again, follow the steps ‘<strong>a’</strong> and ‘<strong>b’</strong>.</li><li>Check the box for the .NET Framework 4.5 listed there and select <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>To get a detailed description on the steps listed above, refer to the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh506443(v=vs.110).aspx</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if you receive the same error message. If yes, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the list shows the version that you are trying to run is not compatible, run the game in Windows compatibility mode and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Locate the folder that has the .exe file for the game. Right Click on the setup file and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box which states “<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>”.</li><li>Select the version of Windows on which it worked earlier or it is listed as compatible at compatibility center from the drop down list.</li><li>Click on OK. Double Click on the application file and check if you are able to launch the game.</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></span></p>

<p>You laptop lacks enough performance for more demanding games like the ones mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that the CPU has is 24 shaders which is not a lot of GFLOPS</p>

<p>Hi Francois,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s no option to turn off automatic downloads of Windows update. As a workaround, we suggest following the steps below to turn off Windows updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>Administrative tools</strong> in the <strong>Cortana search box</strong> then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>On the pop-up window, <strong>double-click</strong> on <strong>Services</strong>.</li><li>On the second pop-up window, look for <strong>Windows Update</strong>.</li><li><strong>Right click </strong>on it then click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the third pop-up window, click the drop down option beside <strong>Startup type</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Disabled</strong>, click on <strong>Apply</strong>, then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will stop Windows update being installed on your device. If you want to install Windows updates, you have you go through the steps again to turn it on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this resolves your concern.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 is not genuine &#38; error code 0xC004F063</h2>
                    
<p>Recently my laptop's windows 7 ultimate OS said that this copy of of windows is not genuine, so I tried to go online to resolve it.</p>
<p>When I went to the website they told me to go to (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/DownloadValidationSupport.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;Error=52&amp;sGuid=0491ab8d-4e8e-45ce-8fab-f03615d59081&amp;OSV=6.1.7600.2.00010100.0.0.001.00.1033&amp;GenuineInfo=C004F063&amp;ls=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/DownloadValidationSupport.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;Error=52&amp;sGuid=0491ab8d-4e8e-45ce-8fab-f03615d59081&amp;OSV=6.1.7600.2.00010100.0.0.001.00.1033&amp;GenuineInfo=C004F063&amp;ls=3</a>),
 I downloaded the update and after it finished I clicked "continue" but it kept telling me to wait for it to finish installing, even though it has already finished. So, no help there.</p>
<p>When I tried to type in the activation code that came with the computer, it said that it doesn't work with my version of Windows 7 (funny thing is, my computer came with a disc labeled "Windows 7 Professional" yet after I installed it to my computer, it
 shows up as Windows 7 ULTIMATE).</p>
<p>When I used a program to find my true activation code, error code 0xC004F063 came up. I read somewhere that to fix that, I have to downgrade back to my previous version of Windows, which is XP, and re-upgrade back to Windows 7. I tried to do that but i never
 got past the 2nd step, which told me to insert the Windows 7 disc into my drive and restart the computer. The Install Windows window never came up after restarting.</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me how to solve error code 0xC004F063? I think that's the root of all my problems, since I don't think any product key will work due to that error code. And please do NOT tell me to contact Microsoft support or anything like that
 because I do not have the time or patience to go through those steps, so please just tell me directly&nbsp;how to solve it.</p>

<p><span>Hi notifly,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Adding to Andre`s suggestions, check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If you are able to boot normally then,
 try uninstalling and reinstalling the product key and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start and type “cmd” (without quotes) in the start search box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>From
 the programs list right click on cmd and select “Run as Administrator.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the command shell type the following command and press Enter after each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>slmgr –upk</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>slmgr –ipk (<em>your product key)</em></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Activate
 the copy again and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>You may first try online activation if it does
 not try the Phone Activation again as you tried earlier.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>You may try validating Windows online and see
 if you can correct the problem. Go to the below mentioned website and click “Validate Windows”.</span></p>

<h2>            Transferring Halo 3 save file between accounts </h2>
                    
<p>My friend was using my Xbox account to play halo 3, I was hoping there was a way to transfer his save to his account and possibly the achievements too. Is that possible?</p>

<p>nope nothing is transferable between accounts and even if you could transfer saves the achievement unlocks would be not functional on the other account sorry.</p>

    <title>Slow startup after Windows 10 Threshold 2 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Slow startup after Windows 10 Threshold 2 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi those @ Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>I updated my Windows 10 Home Toshiba Satellite&nbsp;L50-B yesterday, which was&nbsp;the major Windows 10 Threshold 2 update. After updating I noticed that starting up my computer&nbsp;is glitchy. Firstly it displays&nbsp;the Toshiba logo and loading symbol as per usual, then
 after a while the screen blacks out briefly and then returns back to normal, except the loading symbol turns slower. After a while, the Windows startup sound plays and then I am presented with the lock screen. I have got fast startup enabled and I haven't
 got any weird setting turned on or performed any registry tweaks. I do have a dual-boot configuration with Ubuntu, but that worked fine before the update.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            Do you have Avira antivirus installed by any chance? &nbsp;Avira is causing hanging for an extra 30 seconds on "Welcome" screen after logging in on my system. &nbsp;For me it's Avira that is not totally compatible with the latest Windows update. &nbsp;(Although it sounds
 like you're getting hanging before the log in screen, so you might have a different problem)

            <p>Same issue after threshold update.&nbsp; In my case the slowing seems to occur after entering the password.&nbsp; I have an ssd with windows 10 dual booting with Ubuntu.&nbsp; Before, it very quickly launched without the additional 20-30 second slowing.&nbsp; I have looked
 at the startup programs and they don't appear to have changed from before when the system would launch within 15 second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way in a dual boot you should have the "fast startup" turned off--it doesn't interact well with grub 2.</p>

            <p>Same Issue as OP. Windows 10 Home x64 with dual-boot configuration (ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS) and I just did the Threshold 2 update. Now I get a painstakingly slow boot into Win10, with fast boot disabled. I tried it with fast boot enabled as well, didn't make
 it better.</p>
<p>Details: Black screen after grub menu (was there before, but now it's longer), then the green startup screen appears for some time (~15 sec, didn't notice that one before), then I get to the login screen (~15 sec again, no password so I get to the desktop
 automatically) and here I roughly have to wait another 15 sec before I can really use anything properly, which wasn't like this before as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, the update broke the grub2 bootloader, so that I couldn't resume the update after the first automatic restart at roughly 32%. An error was displayed and I could only access the grub rescue command line. I then had to manually change the boot
 configuration and the update continued, but I had to do so after every automatic restart of the update.
</p>
<p>I don't know if anyone else had the same issue, but it would be nice if the updates didn't fiddle with the bootloaders configuration (as far as that's techincally possible).</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue as the original poster on both of the laptops in my household, both of which are standard Windows 10 builds with no dual boot as per some of the other examples above. &nbsp;Since the last update the loading screen hangs after the password
 is entered at the 'Welcome' spinner for 20-30 seconds. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on both of the laptops and only started to happen immediately after the last windows update was applied to each of the machines, prior to this the welcome screen used to only last a second or so before the desktop launched.</p>

            <p>There is a built in delay in grub 2 before the OS will load unless you hit enter.&nbsp; I presume yours is an additional delay after selecting the OS to load and hitting enter?</p>

            <p>I don't think so, I set up grub the same as before Threshold 2 and I didn't have any issues back then. How would one set an additional delay after selecting the OS, or why would that functionality be built in anyways? Doesn't make sense to me. Maybe you
 could elaborate?</p>
<p>Even if, the the green "Windows loading..." screen, which appears is taking way to long to load. Never had that issue before, did a clean Win10 install in October and it worked well since with very low boot times. Just until I did the update...<br />

            Hi Slivver, I have the exact same problem 30sec hanging on the Welcome screen after entering password (started after the last Windows Update). &nbsp;Do you use Avira Antivirus? &nbsp;I found out that there was some kind of a 'conflict' between Avira &amp; the new Windows
 update - uninstalling Avira returned boot speeds to normal. &nbsp;I've reported this to Avira, and they have a bug report from me.

            <p>Hi Robbo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Kaspersky antivirus so I don't think that's my issue. &nbsp;I've have also noticed that the slow start-up can be intermittent on subsequent reboots. &nbsp;It appears that the first time I start in the morning it is always slow however if I perform reboots it
 will occasionally restart as it did prior to the update whereas other times it will still take 20-30 seconds... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if this might be something to do with network discovery as my Synology storage array seems to start up at the point at which the Welcome message occurs. &nbsp;It may be that Windows is now waiting for a response from the network share before continuing.
 &nbsp;The storage array was attached before the update though, so if that is the issue then the pause is definitely connected to a change in the way Windows handles network shares in the update,</p>

            <div>
<p>Just an idea I had when you indicated there was a delay on loading the Windows OS.&nbsp; Lots of references in Ubuntu literature about this but it may well be another issue.&nbsp; You problem seems different than the delay that I experience which occurs after Windows
 has loaded and after the password is entered.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On my system Ubuntu is the default OS in Grub 2 there is a 10 second delay before Ubuntu loads by itself.&nbsp; I can short circuit the delay by hitting enter.&nbsp; For my Windows 10 partition to load I have to move the selection to the Windows OS and hit enter there
 is no delay in launch. Have no idea if the delay you are experiencing is the delay with Ubuntu noted above, from your response I presume it is not.
</p>
<p>You might try to run boot repair in Ubuntu and see if it fixes this delay which may indicate a grub problem rather than a Windows update problem though the timing is certainly indicative of the latter

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft community and thank you for posting the question. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can define a default view to each folder type. (for example Documents)<br />
<br />
1. Select a file in Windows Explorer. (for example Documents)<br />
2. Set the Details Panel to the format you want.<br />
Right click title bar and select and arrange columns titles.<br />
Set panel view.<br />
<br />
3. Apply the view to all folders of this type.<br />
(Organize &gt; Folder and Search Options &gt; View (tab) &gt; [ Apply to Folders ] &gt; [Apply] &gt; [OK]<br />
<br />
Also you may refer this below provided forum link.<br />
<br />
<strong>Change folder views and behavior</strong><br />

<p>Ciao,</p>
<p>Lo schermo è vuoto dopo aver acceso la console?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Verificare che TV e console Xbox One siano entrambi accesi.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Verificare che nel TV sia impostato il segnale di ingresso appropriato (HDMI).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Controllare che il cavo HDMI sia collegato correttamente alla console.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Controllare che il cavo HDMI sia collegato correttamente al TV.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Eseguire un avvio a freddo sulla console Xbox One tenendo premuto il tasto di accensione nella parte anteriore della console per circa 10 secondi, quindi riaccendere la console.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Ripristinare le impostazioni dello schermo. A tale scopo, attenersi alla procedura indicata di seguito.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Se nella console Xbox One è presente un disco, rimuoverlo.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sulla console, tenere premuto il pulsante Xbox per cinque secondi per spegnerla.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tenere premuti il pulsante Xbox e il pulsante di espulsione finché non viene emesso il segnale acustico di accensione della console.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nota: la console verrà avviata in modalità a bassa risoluzione (640 × 480). Per ripristinare le impostazioni, premere il pulsante Menu, selezionare Impostazioni e quindi Schermo e suono.</p>
<p>Fammi sapere se risolvi?</p>

    <title>Can Easy Transfer be run more than once on receiving system&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can Easy Transfer be run more than once on receiving system&#63;</h2>
                    Can Easy Transfer be run more than once on the receiving system?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have installed Win 7 on a separate drive from XP and am able to switch between them by booting from their respective drives.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have made an Easy Transfer between them and now plan to install and test my programs on Win 7.&nbsp; Once I've got everything running correctly and all the migration issues are resolved, I'd like to make a second clean run of Easy Transfer from XP&nbsp; just before
 the final cutover to Win 7.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
By "clean run" I mean that I want everything on the Win 7 system to be completely replaced by the new data and settings from the XP system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Will Easy Transfer do this?&nbsp; <br />

            <p><span>We apologize in delay in response. I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Boot the computer in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Safe mode</strong></a><strong> </strong>and check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted.</span></p>

</p><p>I foll<span>owed your&nbsp;</span>instructions<span>&nbsp;and everything worked until the last step where&nbsp;the&nbsp;option'Safe Mode'&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;as&nbsp;'Eatable&nbsp;safe mode'. &nbsp;I chose this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer opened with 'Safe Mode' appearing on the top right. &nbsp;The 'Searches'&nbsp;<span>file still appeared. I was not connected to the internet. &nbsp;On trying to open a word file I saw "Microsoft Office cannot verify the license&nbsp;</span>for<span>&nbsp;this

<h2>            When attempt to access the WindowsApps folder with either administrator account, the system says I need administrator rights and denies access</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Serious Administrator Problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have two accounts on my computer. &nbsp;One is a Microsoft account, the other is a local account. &nbsp;Both show as type administrator accounts in settings. &nbsp;When I attempt to access the WindowsApps folder with either administrator account, the system says I need
 administrator rights and denies access. &nbsp;The properties security tab says (administrators&lt;my_computer_name&gt;\administrators) have read and execute access. &nbsp;I am also having issues were apps (Micorsoft Solitare Collection and Microsoft Store for example) work
 for one user (the local one) and not the other. &nbsp;I believe that windows 10 problems associated with user access and control merit considerably more coverage and attention than has been evident in these forums to date. &nbsp; I can only hope that a windows machine
 running a portion of this nation's critical infrastructure is not impacted by what Microsoft apparently considers to be an issue of little importance given the extended time this issue has gone unresolved and minimally discussed here.</p>

            Creating a new user account is a band aid to address the symptoms. &nbsp;I was plagued with the critical error start menu error for a long time. &nbsp;There were times when the problem appeared resolved, only to re-appear again. &nbsp;I believe the start menu issue and
 this administrator privilege one are both spawned from the same deep registry/profile related issue. &nbsp;The issue of how two user accounts became corrupted remains. &nbsp;What assurances can you give me that any new accounts will not become corrupted on my or any
 other machines? &nbsp;These issues have been with me since Win 10 was deployed and all we get from Microsoft are work-arounds to address symptoms. &nbsp;I understand you can only pass on what you are told from the entities that support you but from the posts in these
 forums, these issues persist and responses to do system file checks, powershell commands to get app packages, and create new users are getting old. &nbsp;

            <p>I have also been having similar problems even back from the Windows 8.1 days. The administrator privileges are very limited in Windows 10.&nbsp; For example, I try to delete an old profile whose property page says that it has 3 folders with 0 files in them. Each
 time I try, a pop up says that the folder is being used in another program, or, I don't have permission to to access the file. Clearly, this is nonsense. If I am the Administrator of the computer, I think that the only area of the computer I should not be
 able to control, is the Executive.&nbsp; I spend hours trying to figure out why I cannot remove the name of another computer that had joined my Workgroup and has long been turned off. Still, I am not able to figure this out.</p>

            That will be a very small thumbnail sized photo...<br />
try making the largest dimension 120 pixels.<br />
<br />
If you use a utility like the freeware Prish resizer<br />
that has a compression option, the pixel dimensions<br />
could be greater: (you could experiment to see <br />
what works best for you)<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

<p>Okay thanks for you fast answer. </p>
<p>But this brings me to a different question?</p>
<p>Why are the disk cheaper to buy than an game key, although you can resale the disk later.
</p>
<p>I mean that doesn't make any sense to me? Shouldn't it be changed? &nbsp;</p>

<p>If the publisher decides on a sale and then sets the lower price you get the price online gamestores however can decide whatever price they want even if thry lose money on it</p>
<p>Discs also can be damaged or worn</p>
<p>Vs the dlc you dont worry about damage or losing the disc</p>

<h2>            USB mouse not working after boot-up until unplugged&#47;re-plugged</h2>
                    <p>The mouse is a Sumvision Kata.&nbsp; It works in bios, but for about a month I've nearly always needed to unplug and re-plug it before it will work in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now on 1709 Build 16299.371 via&nbsp; KB4093112.&nbsp; Update KB4074588 which apparently initiated the problem is no longer shown in the list of installed updates, so I can't uninstall it.&nbsp; Also, I can't install KB4090913 , which was meant to fix the problem,
 because it is "incompatible".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the suggestions in other threads about USB mice not working - nothing helps. All the drivers are up to date.&nbsp; The USB 3 ones are dated 12/03/2018 (significant?) with no roll-back option available.&nbsp; My work-around is to hibernate rather than power
 off, but it's not satisfactory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I expect an update to fix this?&nbsp; If not, what else can I try?</p>

<h2>            Bought brand new mouse in sealed box it resulted as refurbished, seller said it was from Office 2011 bundle</h2>
                    Hello to all forum members.<br />
<br />
I'm currently struggling with a fraudulent (I believe so) seller from a very popular Australian E-commerce web site ( I don't know if I can post the name) who sold me a mouse packaged and "sealed" with sticky tape as brand new but when I opened the package
 the mouse resulted as clearly used plus a problem with the usb wireless key not popping out from mouse's case.<br />
<br />
The misleading seller sent me the mouse through a drop shipping friend's business which I think they buy from Ingram Micro.<br />
Both "seller" and "sender" use the "same" fake business address, to be more clear they use a "self storage" facility address so to avoid any responsibility.<br />
<ul>
<li>The seller refused to give me any document stating product and seller details so I won't be able to deal with warranty issues and I already read that this specific mouse has got too many complains regarding the usb wireless key burning out.<br />
</li><li>The seller has claimed that I tried to scam him by telling lies.</li><li>The seller refused to refund "full" amount plus delivery return fees by saying it's my responsibility, but it costs nearly the same as per the mouse price plus it's not my fault so I rejected.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>I need help from forum members who know anything about Microsoft Refurbished program, how is it possible that I got a sealed brand new mouse then I open the box and the mouse resulted to be refurbished?</p>
<p>I believe the seller knows it because I know he worked in his friend's business (drop shipping shop) so I believe there must be some refurbished hardware stocked around and being sold as brand new, and that is why the price is so LOW!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Mouse's details from box: <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 4000</li><li>S/N 0206203291415 EC</li><li>Lot NO. 1113</li><li>WO: D13688</li><li>Model No: 1383,1447</li><li>Manufacturer: D5D-00087<br />
</li></ul>
<p>From mouse: <br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Model 1383</li><li>P/N X821385-029</li><li>PID 02062-523-2914156-31113<br />
</li></ul>
You can PM me for any questions that may not be posted on the forum regarding addresses and businesses involved or even photos.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">On this E-commerce site I bought "3" same computer mice all advertised as "brand new":</span><br />
<ol>
<li>Mouse received without packaging (I knew no problem at all) it was advertised as brand new but it was second hand, I got refunded.</li><li>The mouse object of this long thread (sorry guys).</li><li>The last mouse I received just while I was writing this thread, SAME as above, brand new packaging but the mouse was clearly used because I can see it from its pads, it must be a refurbished one. Waiting seller's answer!</li></ol>
Thanks in advance for help!<br />
<br />
Edit: I got confirmation (with invoices) from the third seller that the mouse was bundled with Office 2011, so is that the case that Microsoft bundled refurbished mice with its products and not telling customers?<br />

Thanks very much for helpful information.<br />
<br />
I think the main problem here is that Microsoft bundled refurbished computer mice in brand new (and sealed) packaging without informing customers.<br />
This lead to unprofessional distributors, retailers and sellers to sell the mouse stand alone without the main product which was Office 2011.<br />
The e-commerce site I'm talking to seems flooded by those mice so there must be a general retailer here in Australia selling them.<br />
I already twice contacted Microsoft by e-mail and I got no where, I can't call Microsoft with my mobile because in Australia 1300 numbers are charged as "premium" so it'll cost me too much only to talk to someone maybe based in Philippines who only reads standard
 scripts.<br />
And why I've to spend so much money on the phone just to tell Microsoft it did the wrong thing?<br />
<br />
I hope someone from Microsoft will be able to tell me where the mouse came from by reading the serials so I may deal with the fraudulent seller who is refusing giving me any paper stating the mouse and seller so in the future I may deal with warranty.
<br />
The third seller agreed to reimburse now I'm still fighting with the second who is really fraudulent.<br />
<br />
I changed the thread title accordingly with my last findings as well as I wish Microsoft will take customers' feedback as a good chance to improve it's marketing strategies.<br />

Thanks for replay but the web links are totally "off topic".<br />
The computer mouse (mice) I'm talking about came sealed in original Microsoft packaging and it was (were) bundled with Microsoft Office offer.<br />
I can't see how my issue relates to Microsoft's online scams!<br />

            You can bet Monopoly$oft has nothing to do with this scam/fraud/rip-off, etc. It's just a case of<br />
the Dodgy Bros. at work. <br />
Who<span style="font-style: italic"> is </span>the seller then ? Someone on e-bay ?
<br />
If you didn't get the mouse from and e-bay seller contact the ACCC and lodge a complaint with them.<br />
e-Bay and Pay-Pal are pretty responsive to fraud as well.<br />
- One of the best ways to get a good deal on a good mouse if from the e-Bay Logishop.
<br />
He has regular 30% off&nbsp; sales (as does DELL on their stuff) on all Logitech products. The real deal too.<br />
<br />
This would be the first red flag. No new MS product would be sealed with sticky tape, shrink wrap only,<br />
and I reckon if it were bundled with Office it would still be individually packaged within the extra packaging.<br />
<br />
So typical of a fraud to indignantly challenge your challenge to his integrity. Be wary of all hubris,<br />
even from non-politicians&nbsp; ;)<br />
<br />
I would not be at all surprised if the copies of Office are pirate as well.<br />
Check the link below just to see how good they can be -<br />

<br />
- The really bad thing with pirate copies of MS products is, due to the way the market their software<br />
(I don't recall the technicalities, it's complex ) it can take months before your OS or other software changes it's mind and tells you it is not genuine. Meanwhile the pirates have disappeared into the either.<br />
<br />
<br />
was <span style="font-style: italic">supposed</span> to be living in Darwin, and he was<span style="font-style: italic"> supposed</span> to have ten copies on hand.<br />
After four days I emailed him to ask when he posted the package.<br />
Jump ahead two weeks and three messages and no response from the seller .<br />
Made a claim with e-Bay and Pay-Pal against the seller. One final unanswered message.
<br />
Pay-Pal forwarded me a tracking number. The link resulted in a 404 error in Chinese script.
<br />
I'd already suspected fraud after two unanswered messages, but now I knew it was fraud, and even if the package did contain a genuine copy of Windows I was not going to accept it as Windows activation is regional.<br />
I left a negative feedback. After three more negative feedback (including one from another add for<br />
Win7 Pro) the seller closed his account. <br />
Pay-Pal did do the right thing and refunded my money, in full.<br />
I bought a genuine copy of Win7 from U-mart.<br />
Forward to about three weeks ago. <br />
A package from central China arrives with a very credible pirate copy of Win7. <br />
My first impression was the green colour of the box was a bit pale, but then I saw all the other<br />
indicators of pirate MS software that is in the article above, so I binned it.<br />
- I did start to file a report with Monopoly$oft but they wanted all his details, which I had already
<br />
deleted from my e-bay account, and couldn't be bothered trying to get back.<br />

Firstly sorry to hear about your unhappy transaction and thanks very much for useful information.<br />
The seller is from e-bay (just after me he got 2 more negs) so that means I cannot go through ACCC?<br />
I already complained to e-bay and paypal telling them that this is a fraud case and told them the seller gave a fake address but they kept on sending me stupid scripts, e-bay keeps on diverting me to paypal while paypal keeps on sending scripts, it's like playing
 against two football players they don't let you touch the ball!<br />
The seller is using a self storage facility as his own business address, I already contacted them but they rebuffed by talking BS about privacy.<br />
The seller got no registered business, what he does is using a friend/partner (maybe wife) registered business as drop shipping who buys from Ingram Micro, they both use the same address at the self storage facility in Queensland.<br />
<ul>
<li>I contacted Ingram Micro and got no answer.</li><li>I two times contacted Microsoft alerting about "fraud" but they kept on sending out standard scripts and inviting me to call a hardware support 1300 number, guess what I'll waste my money on the phone to talk to someone wanting to sell hardware!<br />
</li><li>I bought the mouse without the software then I found out about the bundle with Office.</li><li>The package seems legit and it got Microsoft sticker with all numbers, this isn't an isolated case as this is the third purchase I made on e-bay by buying the same product advertised as brand new and it came in the same package sealed with sticky tape.</li></ul>
<p>What is the right channel to rise the ring bell to Microsoft?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.<br />

            It's really Pay-Pal that you need to deal with, and they do take there time on occasion.<br />
What I did, because you can only lodge one complaint form, is to 'message' them with an 'update'<br />
of more information, through another one of their contact options. <br />
I did this twice because the first time was mostly a form letter, so I started politely explaining that I<br />
had already done the by the numbers thing.<br />
I listed a few more points about how the seller had received the negative feedback and then bailed,
<br />
and the product being advertised as originating in Oz, and gave some veiled threats
<br />
about visiting forums, and whether I could ever trust anyone on e-bay or the Pay Pal service again.
<br />
You want to keep the threats subtle though.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you may have already done similar. <br />
There 'contact us' form is there in the mix. I don't recall which page it's on, but it's not too difficult<br />
to find.<br />
Not sure what the ACCC will do for you, but they're worth a try.<br />
<br />
Good luck to yeah, mate.... <br />

PayPal was intentionally misleading and protecting their "valuable" customer instead of listening my voice, I think it might be PayPal Australia acting stupid.<br />
<br />
I just sent a complaint through the Financial Ombudsman, now we see what is next.<br />
<br />
Though I expected more support here from Microsoft's team instead of getting useless scripts as per the above.<br />
Thanks mate, I'll keep informed taaa<br />

            Hi, Table
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend reviewing the RAM Memory
<br />
<br />Using these steps requires you to restart your computer, so make sure to save any files you may have open and close any running applications before proceeding. Here goes:
<br />1.- Open Control Panel.
<br />2.- Click on System and Security.
<br />3.- Click on Administrative Tools.
<br />4.- Double-click the Windows Memory Diagnostic shortcut. A quick tip: Alternatively, you can also use the Windows key + R keyboard shortcut, type mdsched.exe, and click OK to launch the tool.
<br />5.- Click the Restart now and check problems option.
<br />
<br />I would recommend you to check your Hard Disk with chkdsk.
<br />
<br />1) On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and S key at the same time, then type cmd in the search box. 
<br />2) Right-click Command Prompt, then select Run as administrator. 
<br />3) Type chkdsk /f /r, then press Enter on your keyboard.  
<br />4) Press Y on your keyboard. 
<br />5) Press the Windows logo key and R at the same time, then type mdsched.exe. 
<br />6) Click Restart now and check for problems (recommended). Your PC will restart immediately. 
<br />7) Wait for the scans to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi  Table, I am Rob, an independent and a 12 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />1. Event ID 100 means something has caused Windows to boot slowly. That  usually indicates a driver and/or hardware caused issue. Most often it will be the video card or driver. So check that and install or re-install the latest driver. If using a separate graphics card, not built-in to the motherboard, remove all power then reseat it and all other cards, memory, and cables.
<br />
<br />2. If needed use the Clean Boot method to diagnose the issue :
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

            Let's try running this uninstaller then re-install the latest video driver. Just follow the easy instructions on this page.
<br />
<br />Display Driver Uninstaller - Free
<br /><a href="https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dr...</a>
<br />
<br />Also check with the video device maker's support, docs, and forums for any possible diagnostics and for any known issues.
<br />
<br />-------
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that though the video driver and device are the main possibilities they are not the only ones.
<br />
<br />Use the previous posted methods to check in Event Viewer around the time of the error to see if there is any additional pointers (there may not be).
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />If needed please use the Clean Boot Method to see if that helps identify a cause (see previous post).
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />Probably would be a good idea to ensure the BIOS, chipset drivers, and all major drivers are updated.
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            If you are over-clocking anything STOP!!!
<br />
<br />So you ran the uninstaller and then re-installed the latest video drivers?
<br />
<br />And you used the Clean Boot method and with nothing loading you still had the error?
<br />
<br />If both of those are Yes, then it certainly reduces the methods we can use with software to troubleshoot the issue.
<br />
<br />1. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible including minimum memory. Nothing plugged in except keyboard and mouse. You should even try swapping the memory in and out in various combinations as possible (though this error would be unusual for a memory issue).
<br />
<br />Be sure you did remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables. If you can't reseat the video card then you probably will need to take the system to a shop to have it done.
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />Stress test the system - especially the video card however ALL the system and not just it.

<br />
<br />The main utilities used there are all Open-Source/Freeware such as CPUID, Prime95, Furmark, and Memtest86. You do not need to buy anything,
<br />
<br />======
<br />
<br />3. Last resort is to eliminate software causes as much as possible. Then if the error then still happens it has to be hardware.
<br />
<br />Try backing up all data off the main drive onto other partitions or drives and then Refresh/Reset or best re-install Windows Clean.

            I do overclock the cpu and gpu but the issue still persists without overclocking, however I will stop if I was told to, I did stress test everything and it was stable, no crashes at all or anything like that with temps pretty low. I can't do a clean boot
 because everytime I close msconfig everything goes back to normal.&nbsp;

            Are you clicking "Apply" in msconfig before closing? Are you using an Admin Account?  
<br />
<br />Try doing it in Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />Since it does not stop when you reset all clocking to defaults it is possible that the GPU or even the CPU has been damaged. Or there is other hardware issues, such as the motherboard. I recommend you keep it at the defaults while troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />Did you simplify the system as much as possible even down to minimum memory? And reseat all you can?
<br />
<br />Since it is not temp related this sure seems like a hardware failing issue. 
<br />
<br />After doing all you can and if nothing helps, I would re-install Windows Clean. If that does not help them it has to be hardware.
<br />
<br />Please keep me up to date.
