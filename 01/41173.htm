    <title>Unsupported Disc Error MW3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larsnz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unsupported Disc Error MW3</h2>
                    
<p>It seems im not the only one having this problem as i see from other member posts... :(<br />
I turned on my xbox this morning and played MW3 with my friend split screen offline with no problems. Later i decided i should renew my xbox live gold membership to play online. I played for a few hours and had no problems at all. We had a break and i turned
 off the console. When we tried to play about an hour later i got the "Unsupported disc error" and cannot seem to get some games to work at all any more. I thought this was strange and tried cleaning my disc and rotating it etc but had no luck. I then also
 tried my brand new copy of halo CE anniversary and that gave me the same error. However i tried the discs in my friends console and they worked fine although it once gave him the error on the MW3 disc too. Luckily forza 4 LCE is currently working fine on live.
 No matter how many times i try MW3 or halo they wont work even though last night and this morning they worked 100% flawlessly. I was not connected to xbox live though so im thinking this is my problem but now they wont even work offline... I have had two xbox's
 the first of which is currently suffering RROD and no longer works. The xbox im currently using is also old so im wondering if this also could cause the error. I am no longer under warranty and cannot afford fees to fix or replace. I dont believe there is
 any issues with my xbox as most games work still and ones that dont work still work on my friends console however he got the same error as me until i rotated the disc. He does not have a live connection though if this helps. From research of this problem and
 as stated in another post in <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/2368/t/128486.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/2368/t/128486.aspx</a>&nbsp; i saw there was an update applied recently to do with files on the discs. I have looked into this update and this seems to be the only possible indication off what is causing my errors.
 Is there way i can reset these files as it may potentially solve my problem? Resetting my cache doesn't seem to do it. I will try rent a different copy of MW3 and see if it works as my discs both have slight scratches around the edge of the disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can i do and is there any easy fix as i cant see that much could change in the period of an hour...</p>
<p>Ive played xbox 360 for years (online and offline) and never had any issues like this at all</p>

<p>Microsoft tried to get the upper hand on people who play illegal copies of games by updating everyone's consoles without their knowledge. &nbsp;Unfortunately for the geniuses responsible for the update, it has also affected legit copies of certain games the same
 way it did the illegal copies. &nbsp;Your console now thinks your legit MW3 disc that you paid $60 for is an illegal copy and therefore will not boot it.</p>
<p>Then you have these "support techs" running around here pretending they don't know what's causing the problem and having you waste your time "troubleshooting" imaginary causes for your problem.</p>
<p>You really took the piracy crowd by surprise with this one, Microsoft. &nbsp;Dumbasses...</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply mate. Does this mean i will no longer be able to play MW3 unless i buy a new copy?? I cant afford &nbsp;new copy at the moment as its not exactly the cheapest game on the market and Microsoft are not the type to offer compensation as they
 will just push the blame onto activision and &nbsp;vise versa..</p>
<p>In regards to the "illegal copies" does in any way this implicate my console could be recorded as illicit &nbsp;and if so are there any further implications this causes?? I googled it and apparently i might be eligible for a ban or some related consequence. This
 is not fair by any means and by the looks of things Microsoft have not spent enough time analysing this updates implications on the xbox community.</p>
<p>By all means i agree with modders who abuse games to be dealt with accordingly but there is a definite line that should not be crossed which involves the unfair treatment of loyal customers. This needs to be sorted and resolved before there are further problems.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>Im sorry for the problems that you all are having, theres 3 steps that you can do to try and fix the following issue. 1) Return your copy to the retailer for an exchange 2) Try to game in another console or

<p>@rebel grim I called my local gamestop and they stated that have exchanged over 30 copies cause of the error and guess what they call with the same issue ........ so I guess this time you guys did a major mistake. Push hidden updates I don't see how that
 is fare for us legit customers. So now I'm out of 60 bucks plus I can't play my game. How fare is that!

<p>All these suggestions to sort this problem out do not work!!! I know you guys are trying to help but surely you must know most people on this forum know to clear cache, take games back ect. When is a representative of Microsoft or Activision going to man
 up and admit there is a big problem? There are more comments on this and other xbox forums to warrant some kind of response. It's turning into a joke!!! &nbsp; I am not paying for repairs or swapping again when all other games work fine!! Had a good session on
 BF 3 this afternoon, no problems at all! </p>

<p>I have the SAME PROBLEM. Not only is it with MW3 but Batman Arkham City as well, "unsupported disc" error. Microsoft you did it again. Can you just leave things be so we can play our games? Like honestly, if your "silent" updates are going to affect us legit
 gamers then don't even try! I am so ticked off right now with this darn company, it's making me sick.</p>

    <title>Surface Laptop Poor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisbing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Laptop Poor</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface Laptop i7 in Jan 2019 directly from Microsoft online in Hong Kong.&nbsp; After two weeks of use, the cover colour and coating was fading and coming off.&nbsp; I called Microsoft Hong Kong which I think is serviced by Microsoft in China.&nbsp; They said
 they would not be able to fix this issue and their solution is to collect my laptop and give me a replacement.&nbsp; After more than a week, I received a replacement BUT the TOUCH SCREEN did not work properly - one FIFTH of the screen on the right side had no touch
 response.&nbsp; I called Microsoft again and complained why they do not test replacement machines properly before sending it to me.&nbsp; They will again come to collect this laptop and replace with another one and that will take a week or two.&nbsp; However, to my surprise,
 Microsoft told me each replacement laptop they give me will only be what they call a "renewed" laptop.&nbsp; It is not a brand new machine.&nbsp; I think Microsoft take other returned or rejected machines, renew and refresh it, and then give to customers as replacement
 laptops when they can't fix problems.&nbsp; I paid a lot of money for a BRAND NEW Surface i7, 16RAM, 512GB, machine just a month ago but when they cannot fix it, they give me USED replacement!!!&nbsp; To me that is a rip off!&nbsp; Why am I paying so much money for a used
 machine?&nbsp; And they don't even check the replacement machine properly before sending it to me!!&nbsp; Looks like I won't have a laptop to use until end of February.&nbsp; Who will compensate me for that?&nbsp; And the machine they will give me will be another so-called "renewed"
 laptop!!&nbsp; Will they test that replacement laptop properly before sending it to me?&nbsp; &nbsp;I asked Microsoft whether I can get a refund so that I can buy a Macbook instead because I have no faith in the next replacement they will give me.&nbsp; Microsoft said NO.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to fix infinite reboot loop&#91;Inactive&#93;</h2>
                    <p>[edit: I reinstalled windows]I've been trying to fix this problem for a while now. I have windows 7 ultimate and my PC reboots half-way through the windows logo animation. Here is what I have tried(everything I've tried both through my PC's WinRE and my
 bootable windows flash drive WinRE):<br />
- Boot into safe mode(gives the same result as booting normally)<br />
- Launch startup repair(found a problem, but could not fix it)<br />
- SFC on C drive(found problems, but could not fix some of them)<br />
- Recover files from RegBack(didn't change anything)<br />
- Memory Diagnostic(result: no hardware errors)<br />
I really want to avoid reinstalling windows. Thank you for any suggestions.</p>

<p>When I see a STOP error 7B and the second parameter ends in 00034 and the last two are all zeros I think that somehow the system is not properly communicating with the hard drive.&nbsp; These kinds of problems are usually not problems with the Windows installation
 which is why none of the things you have tried so far have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the system BIOS there are settings that define the type of interface to the HDD and if they get changed or somehow get set back to a default/wrong setting you might encounter this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can happen if the CMOS battery on the motherboard failed or is failing and then the system loses AC or battery power the settings can get into a state that is incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I don't have your laptop I can't tell you what the right setting, what the setting is right now or what adjustments to make so you will have to look for and find it yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Toshiba support pages it looks like to get into the BIOS after powering up you press the F2 key to get into the BIOS Settings, then look for something about Advanced settings (they have no images).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before making an adjustment you should write down the setting the way you find it so if things get worse you can put things back like they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make an adjustment, save the settings and exit the BIOS setup and see how things look.&nbsp; If it doesn't work make another adjustment knowing that you can always go back to the settings you wrote down before making any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be an option to choose Default Settings which may work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I can think of at the moment but others may have some other ideas.</p>

            <p>Hi Divya R,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers to your questions as follows:</p>
<p>1. All other updates installed successfully without problem</p>
<p>2. Error message for installing this update is "installation failed".</p>
<p>Have tried your method&nbsp;but failed again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer crashed the other day and could not start. Probably had virus infection. I used a recovery disc to reinstal the Windows XP prgram. Then, I used Windows&nbsp;"removal of malicious tool"&nbsp;software to make a full scan but found no problem. However&nbsp;this
 update problem continues.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is not working properly with dedicated gpu</h2>
                    <p>So I installed windows 10 2 years ago, but since the creators update, I can not play games unless I use the intergrated gpu. The gpu I use is a Asus GT520MX</p>
<p>See error:</p>

<p>Edit: I think it's a problem with directx12, since it's a directx error and windows 10 got the new directx, which is unsupported for gta v, anyone knows how to use directx 11 or 10?</p>

<p>Hi Nick, </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>You have an older machine with integrated graphics (Sandy Bridge) and the NVIDIA GT520MX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First check to see if there is an updated BIOS for your machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>most of the drivers are on the windows 10 dvd, or windows update</p>
<p>
</p><p>the machine is also in legacy support so the last driver for it from NVIDIA will be on windows update too</p>

<p>
</p><p>that type of error should not be seen as it suggests there is a coding problem with the DX11 calls to DXGI etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>not sure what is up with the VC2010 libraries as being beta either, should be RTM&nbsp;</p>

<h3> skierdadnh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book second monitor resolution poor</h2>
                    <p>Had the Surface Pro 3 and connected it to external Samsung monitor and was able to get 2560x1440. &nbsp;Got the Surface Book with the GPU and now can't get that, can only get 1920x1080. Tried a variety of adapters and HDMI cables but nada.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talked to Microsoft support and they said buy the surface dock and that would allow the higher resolution. &nbsp;Got the dock, and it worked for a day but it went back to 1920x1080. Called Microsoft support and they said replace the dock, which i did. &nbsp;Got the
 new dock and it didn't work for about an hour then it started working, for a while. I turned my Surface book off, disconnected from dock (had a business meeting). &nbsp;Got back and plugged Surface Book back in through the dock, and back to the 1920x1080. So frustrating.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still have the Pro 3 and plugged it in using the same hdmi/mini-display adapter and bam, it gives me 2560x1440. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Product Key not working for Windows 7 starter upgrade to Win 10</h2>
                    I have two Asus EEEPCs that came with Windows 7 Starter. &nbsp;The product Key is on the bottom of the devices. &nbsp;And they are completely legible. &nbsp; These are 4 ish years old and over the years the Windows installations crashed, one of them I installed Linux,
 the other I played around with installing Android. &nbsp;Today, &nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 for both of them, wiped the drive and did a complete install from USB. &nbsp;One of them went flawlessly, the second &nbsp;installation will not take the product license key, period.
 &nbsp;I even tried to change the only TWO characters that could possibly be incorrect due to rubbing O vs Q and still nothing. &nbsp; is there a way to email Microsoft a picture of the product key and have someone tell me what the heck is wrong with it?&nbsp;

    <title>Network printer connection is lost. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed a senior statesman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network printer connection is lost.</h2>
                    
<p>Periodically my network printer refuses to print. When I check the port, I observe that the ip in the port does not match the ip of the printer. Changeing the port to one with the proper IP does not help.</p>
<p>Rebooting is my usual solution although deleting and reinstalling the printer also works.</p>
<p>I believe this is due to IP being assigned by the router(DHCP) and equipment being turned on in various sequences results in the IP changing. Router is Linksys WRT310n, Printer HP 3600n, OS is XP Pro and Vista</p>
<p>How can I get the print spooler to reestablish the correct link when it changes. In XP I have checked an option that says maintain connection by name even if port changes, but it does not seem to have an effect.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Some Routers can do IP reservation. I.e., you can leave the Printer's IP on Auto and the Router's DHCP will always assign to it the same IP.</p>
<p>If the Router does not do IP reservation, then configure its IP to a static IP out of the DHCP range and redo the sharing.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>After establishing Static IP, or IP reservation. One can do what you did, or delete and reinstall.</p>
<p>The important thing is to provide&nbsp; Network peripherals (Printers, Servers, NAS, etc.) address that does not change, so they can be found always at the same place.</p>

            <p>Most likely the EFI file from your previous OS (W7, 8, 8.1--whatever you upgraded from). &nbsp;Windows Install generally doesn't remove these when upgrading or reinstalling an OS--they can't really be manipulated using Disk Management Tools either since they
 contain protected files.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>They can be removed using Command Prompt.&nbsp; I generally don't bother with them since they take up very little space, or if they really bug me and I want them gone then I will delete them.&nbsp; If you decide you don't want W10 and want to revert to your previous
 OS then you will likely need this file so wouldn't mess with it for now.&nbsp; I think it is 30 days trial period that allows for downgrading back to your previous OS.</p>

<h3> jacquesvan---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sticky Note resize problem after 1903 release preview update.</h2>
                    This problem started after upgrading to Win10 1903 Release preview.<br />
When I open a sticky note it takes up the full screen. If I open a second one it will split the screen vertically with the first one with a slider in the middle. I can not resize the notes vertically by dragging the corners as I used to. If I exit tablet mode
 I can resize the individual notes as before, but only if I EXIT TABLET MODE. I disabled the "Snap Window" feature in settings to no avail. I ran the troubleshooters and then completely uninstalled and reinstalled the app. That didn't work either. The app is
 pretty much useless to me now. I liked to have a small sticky note window open to copy text from another app. That is impossible now. Sticky notes has basically become a full screen text editor for me. Might as well use Wordpad.

    <title>SP4 Just Disappeared and I Can&#39;t Get a Replacement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasjbischoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            SP4 Just Disappeared and I Can&#39;t Get a Replacement</h2>
                    <p>There's not really an appropriate category for this post, but I woukd like to put it out here anyway. Here's my story:</p>
<p>I ordered a Surface Pro 4 on Wednesday, August 16th with 3-7 day shipping. On the third day (Saturday), I checked package tracking. "Delivered Friday, August 16th, 12:51 pm. Left at garage. No signature required." No signature required?? That's odd... But
 hey I got my Surface! I ran outside and checked all around my garage to find... absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>Well, no big deal. My town is pretty crime-free. I was home at the supposed time of delivery and heard no knock or doorbell, so FedEx must have misdelivered it. I checked with the neighbors. None of them received it by mistake. I asked my mother in case
 she picked it up. She told me she came home from work at 5:00 pm on Friday and saw nothing. Okay, now this is getting to be an issue.</p>
<p>I contacted FedEx, who told me I should have Microsoft file a claim for a missing package. Done. The Microsoft employee I spoke to told me that the claim would take until August 29th to finalize. "That's unfortunate," I thought. "I leave for &nbsp;college that
 day and really need this Surface for use in my classes, but if that's the time frame it takes to provide me with quality service, then I will gladly wait."</p>
<p>I hear back from Microsoft on August 28th. The "CSS Post-Sales Specialist" I spoke to told me that FedEx had investigated the matter and determined that the package had been properly delivered. There was no signature required, so they had fulfilled their
 obligation to Microsoft when they left the package at my garage. Thus the claim was denied.</p>
<p>I was told to file a police report for a stolen package and to then file a claim with FedEx myself. I did both of these things, but with no cameras outside my house, a police investigation will likely go nowhere, and I don't see how filing the same claim
 with FedEx but by myself will change their results.</p>
<p>It will take 5-7 business days for FedEx to investigate my personal claim, and I would be fine waiting that long if not for the fact that my classes start tomorrow. So I called up my good friends at Microsoft and asked if they could send me a replacement,
 as any respectable company would do in this situation.</p>
<p>"Sorry, nope."</p>
<p>"Honestly, I feel that Microsoft is responsible for this problem by not requiring a signature on my $1,100 purchase."</p>
<p>"But sir, we don't require signatures on any of our packages. We haven't for over 30 years!"</p>
<p>"But... Why?"</p>
<p>"We find it helps reduce theft."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry... What??"</p>
<p>"Yeah sorry, I can't help you."</p>
<p>"Then I would like to speak to someone who can, perhaps your superior."</p>
<p>"No one here is going to provide you with a replacement."</p>
<p>So that's where I'm at. I'm out the $1,100 that I spent all summer working for; I don't have a computer for classes tomorrow; and I'm incredibly disappointed with Microsoft for the way this situation was handled. I am upset that they allowed such a large
 purchase to just be left outside my garage, and even more upset that they refuse to make up for this mistake by simply providing me with a replacement. I'm all out of the energy to continue dealing with this situation, and because the customer service representative
 I have been assigned to is refusing to cooperate with me, despite my incredible patience up until this point, I feel that this forum is the last place I can turn to for help.</p>
<p>Microsoft: I love your products, but I hate your business practices. I am never ordering a product from the Microsoft Store again.</p>

    <title>I can&#39;t add a pin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I can&#39;t add a pin</h2>
                    Hello everyone, I have the Windows 10 home version and now I can't add a pin (I had this option working but one day when I did "reset this pc" it stopped working and I got back to my password). I already tried to delete the Ngc folder but I can't find
 the AppData folder in&nbsp;C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService.<br />
Can anyone help me?&nbsp;<br />
Thanks in advance!

            If you cannot Add or Remove the PIN in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in Options even after a restart, then unhide Hidden Files in File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; Folder and Search Options &gt; View tab &gt;  tick box to Show hidden Files.
<br />
<br />Browse to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />
<br />Delete or rename to NGC.old this folder to reset the PIN.
<br />
<br />
<br />You may need to first take ownership of the folder:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you delete or rename the folder it will recreate it so you can add a PIN normally in Sign-In Options.  You may need to restart the PC first.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sometimes your Adobe Reader installation can become corrupt for one reason or another. Removing then reinstalling Adobe Reader might help resolve the problem. Using the Adobe Reader and Acrobat Cleaner Tool can remove a broken installation sometimes caused by an operating system upgrade or update. Depending on the website or your organization’s workflow, you might need to use an older version of Adobe Reader in order to view some PDF files. Users can download Adobe Reader 11 from the Adobe Reader Distribution website <a href="https://get.adobe.com/reader/enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://get.adobe.com/reader/enterprise/</a>.

            If you are running Adobe Reader DC,  there is a known incompatibility with Windows 10 since the Creators Update
<br />
<br />I would suggest uninstalling Adobe Reader DC and then installing the older Adobe Reader XI which can be downloaded from the Adobe Website:

    <title>Windows 10 Update Issues and Watchdog Violations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirariver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update Issues and Watchdog Violations</h2>
                    <p>So for a little while now I've been having issues with DPC Watchdog Violation crashing my computer half the time. It gets to 100% and doesn't restart itself though it says it will (and I have left it at times for hours, still no restart on it's own). I've
 tried to update the new Windows 10 updates, but the Watchdog error always crashes it right before it's about to finish, and I'm stuck with no new update. This morning I woke up to find not only more Watchdog Violations, but things like Skype and other programs
 come up with a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b69a7cdc-ed95-464a-b918-0bfe70fe9fc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b69a7cdc-ed95-464a-b918-0bfe70fe9fc0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating all my drivers individually, I have tried scanning the disk, but neither helped. I did an update scan, and this was the result:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7389843b-58a7-4af6-a003-74ebb1c279cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7389843b-58a7-4af6-a003-74ebb1c279cf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't actually fix anything, so I'm not really sure what to do now. I'm a uni student, and all of my files are on this laptop, and I don't seem to have any portable harddrives that are working with my laptop. If anyone can offer any insight or help I
 will be super grateful, as I'm just so completely lost right now.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had installed some things recently before the issues began, but they were uninstalled and my computer scanned for any viruses after they weren't useful for what I needed at the time. I am in the process of the System Files checker, but other troubleshooting
 I did was downloading Driver Easy to try and fix missing drivers. Before I installed anything, I looked up Driver Easy on some forums and saw that many people found it unhelpful, so I uninstalled it and scanned for viruses, but nothing else. The report from
 the System File Checker is quite long, and I don't seem to have a way to attach the file, and I don't seem to be able to perform the check on the Command Prompt. I'm sorry if this hasn't been as helpful, if there's other information I can give to help, let
 me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the Windows Update Troubleshooter again, with the same result, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Kira.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Okay, so after trying to reset once again, I got this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried every option, but none of them worked. I'm really freaked out, is there a way to fix this?</p>
