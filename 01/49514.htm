            <p>Yes, there is a sound recorder.</p>
<p>But its very limited in what it can do. You'd be better downloading and installing Audacity (or a similar audio editer) which can also record, playback and edit sounds. Google and you'll find it.</p>

<h2>            Terry Trevail</h2>
                    Has anyone else, like me, found their upgrade to Windows 10 a complete disaster? My life has been made a misery since I upgraded. My laptop is completely screwed up and I have had to get my old laptop, running Vista, back into operation. None of my devices
 would connect after the upgrade (Nokia smartphone, MP3 player, printer, etc) and Bluetooth seems to have disappeared. I can´t connect to secure web sites, such as banking, and my touchpad and pointer have gone haywire. This is a disgrace and Microsoft should
 be ashamed to have released such a **** product, full of bugs!

            Thank you for your reply Sumit. If you Google "Windows 10 is a disaster" &nbsp;54,900,000 pages are found in 0.45 seconds. I think that speaks for itself! By the way, I am not a computer Geek. I have a computer to write letters, do online banking and financial
 transactions, and search the web for information. I don´t expect to have to know the inner workings of the system I am buying. The product is **** and it´s a disgrace that a company like Microsoft can get away with distributing it. You say "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do
 a clean Install and everything would be sorted out." What the Hell does that mean? I don´t speak "Nerd" so haven´t a clue what you are talking about. If there is a fix to the problems some clear instructions on how to achieve it would be useful!</span>

            <p>It is entirely up to you if you want to restore your old windows(provided you are in the 30 day period).</p>
<p>Nobody is forcing you to upgrade, it is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>You can still revert back to your older OS even if your 30 day period is over by doing a fresh install of your earlier windows version.</p>
<p>You would have to install all your applications etc again though.</p>
<p>If you want, i will provide you more specific instructions.</p>
<p>Even I had problems with windows 10 in the first week after the upgrade, but a fresh upgrade wiped them all.</p>

            <p>Nobody forces people to upgrade, but MS certainly do push it hard on unsuspecting people</p>
<p>via the nagware that gets installed via Windows Updates (don't tell us about the option to disable that</p>
<p>because 'casual' users more often than not will not find the 'fix').</p>
<p>This soft 'free upgrade' coercion pushes many people onto Win10 who were otherwise quite happy with their&nbsp;</p>
<p>existing OS, and who have no need for the new 'features' on Win10, much less the telemetry, mandatory updates,</p>
<p>Store (and other junk on the Start Menu that cannot be deleted), and DRM blocking</p>
<p>
</p><p>110 million installs does<em> not</em> equate to 110 million happy campers. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monopoly$oft is doing everything in it's power to push Win10. That is irrefutable.</p>
<p>The 30 day 'trial' is also a trap. Most 'casual' users cannot determine accurately what things they don't like</p>
<p>about Win10 that would make them want to go back to their previous OS, vs those that they may get over in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Win10 is dictatorial regarding what users can, and can no longer do on Win10, and they are pushing at least
</p>
<p>one of these 'features' (DRM blocking via Windows updates ) onto Win7/8/8.1 users&nbsp; in yet another effort to push</p>
<p>people who have rejected this dictatorial draconian, Big Brother knows best, stance back to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I truly feel sorry for people who upgrade laptops and OEM PC's with limited options for doing roll backs.
</p>
<p>Murhpy's Law plays heavily enough with the 'upgrade', but rolling back is even more fraught with potential disaster.</p>

            I think Boss Dweebe (see below) sums it up extremely well. I am now past the 30 day period having tried to persevere with Windows 10 and having downloaded new drivers for all my devices, which at least has partly remedied some of the problems. I would
 now be worried that going back to Windows 7 could create more problems having changed so many of my settings to try and make Windows 10 work! Some clear instructions on how to do a fresh upgrade would be helpful. I am willing to try anything! I´ve even started
 to look at adverts for Apple Mac computers so if a fresh upgrade can save me €1,000 it´s worth doing!

            <p>Clearly you are an expert, Sumit. An Insider and all the other stuff shown but, with great respect, you're wrong e.g.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. "110 million installs, just you had a problem does not mean everybody had."</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You're an Insider but you appear not to have seen this thread, that was created in the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Windows Insider&nbsp;Program</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
 by a Moderator on the 23rd January 2015</span>. Look at how many pages there are! TerryandSally created this thread on the 22nd October 2015!</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_search/start-menu-doesnt-appear/a7c56613-277c-4993-bb74-08650dce7b21">Failed Start Menu thread</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And look at this thread. Nearly as large and created by that Forum's Moderator on the 5th October 2015:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/critical-error-start-menu-and-cortana-arent/84860df1-9b74-411f-a1ba-c4d6df0544ac">Critical Error Start Menu thread</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you know about them? You owe TerryandSally an apology in my view for your dismissive first reply. Then you tell them this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. "N</strong><strong>obody is forcing you to upgrade, it is entirely up to you."
</strong>Microsoft lied when their adware told me this: "We see that you haven't upgraded yet so why not try our new offer&nbsp;- download&nbsp;the Upgrade and run it late when it's more convenient?" So I did - no advice from them about removing AV software first but
 with that one click, the bl**dy thing was installed, not downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. "You can still revert back to your older OS even if your 30 day period is over by doing a fresh install of your earlier windows version."</strong> Surely this is disingenuous - as an Insider you&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>must</strong></span><strong>
</strong>know how complicated this is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong><strong>"Do a clean Install and everything would be sorted out."
</strong>I'm an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Outsider</span>, a mere dumbo, a mere customer. Do you know what level of expertise is required to do this? It's Intermediate** per an MVP/Insider/Wiki Author
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

<p>
</p><p><strong>And&nbsp;will&nbsp;a clean&nbsp;Install actually&nbsp;fix the problem?</strong> Not according to many MVPs and other Insiders - their views can be summed up in this extract from a reply posted by another mere customer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"My IT guy says once your Start menu is corrupted, it's all over." &nbsp;</p>
<p>He goes on to say that his IT guy "is going to do a clean image with the added info that MS is not sharing with commoners, and he believes all will be well."</p>
<p>He also adds a very disturbing (if true) comment that&nbsp;his IT guy at work says that "MS has solutions to the Critical Error that involve drivers and firmware updates that are not included in Windows Update,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/is-it-true-that-microsoft-have-the-solutions-to/217fd882-d4a2-466a-8f32-fdbf5826062e">
new thread here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>5. Finally you refer them to a tenforums article. </strong>Do you genuinely feel that customers can do it? Read the Warnings etc. It's just too hard unless you're someone with your expertise, Sumit</p>
<p>
</p><p>In closing, a year ago at its Press Launch to announce the release of its improved version of Windows 10, Microsoft said it had cured the Failed Start problem. That was around the time the 'Failed Start Menu' thread&nbsp;so either MS were genuinely not aware
 that they still had the problem = incompetence or they knew about it and kept it quiet = lies.</p>

            <p>Did you get this resolved.&nbsp; I started having this problem on the same day you did. I was reloading my system back to factory settings.&nbsp; After reload, windows updates were going fine for two days, then the problem started.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reloaded the system back again
 to factory settings,&nbsp; same results.&nbsp; Tried a 3rd time and I have come to the conclusion that it is a windows update itself that has caused the problem, because nothing else is going on with the system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Would like to get updates running again on my system.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 below is what i entered on a different posing:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried most all of the suggestion provided so far in a separate discussion with no fix found yet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Background Intelligent Transfer Service will not start.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is preventing windows update to be installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here is the basic history:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reloaded the HP Phoenix pavilion system back to factory reset only because of slow response time. No virus, malware issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This system is used for one purpose – to use for video editing, the only programs loaded on it is Pinnacle Studio, and Eset virus and malware protection, nothing else.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>No printers, no extra hardware, only website it goes to is Eset and Pinnacle.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After doing the reload, windows updates are performed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Since it has to do catch up, it takes a few days to process them. So, the updates go without a hitch for several updates, and then suddenly they all fail.</span></p>
<p><span>So I reloaded the system back to factory settings for a 2<sup>nd</sup> time, same thing happens, and tried a 3<sup>rd</sup> time and again, same results.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It appears to me that the only thing that can be causing this issue is the windows updates themselves. With the exception of the Eset and pinnacle software, nothing else is done to the system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On the first reload, I had run all the updates that were available at the time before loading Eset and Pinnacle.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was thinking that maybe after they were loaded it created the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But on 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> attempts, the software was loaded immediately after the reloads before updates were applied.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The results were the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>Updates proceed for several days, and then they fail.<span>&nbsp;
</span>These are some of the things suggested and tried thus far, so please do not suggest them.</span></p>
<p><span>Msconfig, selected with minimum services running, updates failed. </span>
</p>
<p><span>I did the SFC /scannow from cmd prompt, no problems found. </span></p>
<p>I booted in <strong><span>safe mode</span></strong> to run windows update,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>FAILED</p>
<p>Compared registry file another windows 7 computer where updates work fine, did not see any difference in regards to Background Intelligent Transfer services.</p>
<p>Tried performing only one windows update at time.</p>
<p>Ran automatic troubleshooter from within the error message “WindowsUpdateDiagnostic.diagcab” to check for this particular problem
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>this did not work.<span>&nbsp; </span>It saw that there was a problem, but did not know how to fix their own mess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloaded and ran windows file “msxml4-kb954430-enu.exe” <span>&nbsp;</span>- Did not work.
</p>
<p>Tried the following but access was denied<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Click <strong>Start</strong> and type in <strong>cmd</strong> in the start menu search. Once the
<strong>cmd</strong> option is displayed in the Start Search results, <strong>right click
</strong>on it and click <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.<br />
<br />
2. Then copy and paste the following command (in bold) to the command prompt and hit Enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>Reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BITS\Parameters /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d %windir%\System32\qmgr.dll</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>Tried this as well and it did not work:<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">On a good system running Windows 7:<br />
<br />
1. click on <strong>Start</strong> then type <strong>regedit</strong> and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor.<br />
2. Find the following key in the left hand pane of the registry editor: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\wuauserv</strong><br />
3. Right click the key itself and choose Export (Make sure you are right clicking on the word
<strong>wuauserv</strong> in the left pane) <br />
4. Save the export to a USB drive, or other means of transferring files between computers, and name it something like
<strong>WindowsUpdateService</strong><br />
<br />
On your problem system:<br />
<br />
1. Insert the removable USB drive or other means of transferring files between computers.<br />
2. Find the file you exported to the drive from your uninfected system.<br />
3. Double click the file (You may be prompted by UAC if it is enabled. Please provide credentials)<br />
4. You will get a warning from Windows about adding registry information. Please click
<strong>Yes</strong> to continue, then click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect</span></p>
<p>Basically have tried most anything and in the end, the results are always the same:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Background Intelligent Transfer Service will not start.<span>&nbsp; </span>
HELP… cannot do any updates on a windows7 system that I make a living on.<span>&nbsp; </span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Getting closer and closer to buying an Apple computer each and every day next time I need a new computer.
</p>
<p>If you have a suggestion, please don’t assume I will now exactly&nbsp; what you mean, so please provide detail.

            Yes I did get it fixed, I had a missing registry file and had to manually add it back and it seemed to fix the issue, though I did upgrade to windows 10 shortly after fixing the issue, and can't remember the file I had to add or the location in the registry,
 but as soon as I find the forum post again I will link it.

<h2>            Keeping a USB drive open in Windows XP Professional 32 bit</h2>
                    &nbsp;I am trying to move a lot of .jpeg files from a USB flash drive to my hard drive.&nbsp; Every time I open the flash drive, it stays open for a few seconds and then, suddenly, I am looking at the Control Panel and, whenI try to return to the USB drive screen,
 I am told to put a disc in the drive--which is occupied by the USB.&nbsp; How do I handle this?

<div>While Windows XP with SP1/SP1a or SP2 is no longer 'supported' - it's just a matter of getting the installed Windows XP patched to SP3 to fall back into that 'supported' category.</div>
<div>My suggestion - to make things simple - if you install cleanly, just download and install Service Pack 2 for Windows XP first. Reboot a few times. Then download and install Service Pack 3 for Windows XP next. Reboot a few times. Then start visiting<a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/</font></a>
 and continue installing the 90+ post-SP3 updates.</div>

    <title>Broken Controller&#47;Support Problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Broken Controller&#47;Support Problems</h2>
                    
<p>When I fist unboxed my console, the first thing I noticed was that my right bumper didn't 'click'. I checked the left one and it did make a click sound so I automatically assumed something was wrong. Once I finally finished the installs I started playing
 Call of Duty: Ghosts, the right bumper on this game is to throw lethal items, I noticed that if I tried holding down RB it would randomly let itself go and throw the item. This happened a few times before I for sure knew it was a problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So on Nov 27th I contacted support and made a request to get a new controller and they gave my my 1st order#. I read that I would need to send in my controller first, then wait for a replacement to be sent. Since I didn't find this method to ideal, I started
 a live chat with an agent expressing my thoughts on why I didn't like the method. He said he looked into it and found out that he could actually have a controller sent to me without me having to send in my controller at all (let alone first). He told me the
 only catch is that my replacement wouldn't be a Day One Edition. I was fine with this since he told me I'd get to keep my original day one controller anyways and was given my 2nd order#. I would check the progress of my order every day since I was told it
 would take about 10 days (not sure if he meant for it to be sent or to actually arrive). So on Dec 16th when I saw my order was still marked as 'in progress' I started another live chat and asked for details about my order. The lady told me that the 1st agent
 I spoke with misinformed me, and Microsoft does not actually offer the service he told me I would get. She apologized and said she'd look into if there are any other methods instead of me sending in my controller &nbsp;and waiting for the replacement. After a few
 minutes she told me she could send a request to 'the factory' to have a controller sent to me, THEN I send my broken controller in. I was ok with this, since I didn't want to be without a controller or have to buy a new one to use during my wait. She gave
 me what I thought was an order# and we ended the chat. I immediately plugged in the order# to check the status and nothing appeared. So i thought I just tried too soon and it might be up tomorrow. So the next day I checked again and still nothing, not to worried
 but just curious I started another live chat. I explained the whole thing to this new lady and she was telling me how the first guy screwed up, and the second lady was partially correct. She told me the second lady had just sent a request to request a new
 controller (not actually sent a request to have a controller sent) and that the method probably wouldn't work and just get denied. She told me again how I could just send in my controller and wait for the replacement. She recommended that I could buy a controller
 and return it within 30 days to the retailer which would seemingly screw the retailer over? This idea especially didn't seem appealing since it had already been nearly 3 weeks since my initial request. She assured me there were no other ways to go about this.
 So I just want to know if this seems right? I was lied to twice* and don't feel like I was given all that great of support. I even blatantly asked to be compensated since I figured, why not but she told me no, they don't offer any. I don't really know what
 the point of this is, just to share my experience with filing a replacement request I guess. I hope no one has a similar experience though, because this has been terrible.</p>
<p>A bit of ramble, as if everything above wasn't enough. I understand their policy, for needing the consumer to send in their broken accessory before they send a replacement. It makes sense, for OLDER accessories. Since this is a new accessory, that was given
 to me inside of a new console box I feel that there should have been different ways to go about giving replacements. Even if I were to take the initial offer of sending in my controller and waiting for the replacement, that would still take at least 2 weeks
 leaving me without a controller for that period of time. For a brand new console, that I just paid $500 for I find that unacceptable. I feel that Microsoft is trying to protect themselves from getting screwed over (sending controllers before they receive the
 broken ones) which makes sense except for the fact that I was screwed over first, by being sent a dysfunctional controller. Between all of the technical problems throughout Xbox One and now my broken controller, I really don't see myself doing this again if
 I could go back. This has been a terrible experience and I really hope they do a better job of going about this in the future.</p>

<p>I spoke with another support agent 12/17/13 and he told me a pretty ridiculous way to go about getting a replacement. It didn't work but I'm not 100% sure I want to share it due to the fact it was terribly sketchy and could get him in trouble.

<p>I have been going through a very similar situation trying to a broken Day One Edition controller replaced J, Xbox customer support seem to be useless so far regarding this issue - If they didn't straight up lie to me and say I would most definitely get a
 working Day One edition controller returned to me I wouldn't have bothered wasting my money and time and sending it in the first place.</p>

<p>I haven't even sent mine in yet. I'm waiting for the advocacy team to reply or for Microsoft to come up with a better solution to handle these situations. There are going to be A LOT more people with complaints once they open their Xbox One on Christmas
 haha.</p>
<p>Btw, my controller luckily isn't 100% broken, the broken bumper works 80% of the time and is mostly faulty when I try holding it down (it will let itself go even though I still have it pressed).</p>

<p>Similar situation here as well. The rumble feature on the right trigger of my day one controller is REALLY loud and only works intermittently, my other standard controller works fine.</p>
<p>I've just finished chatting with a support representative who after some confusion told me that I have to shoulder the expense of packing and shipping to the Czech republic! That's going to cost me 1/2 the cost of a new controller. There's also no guarantee
 that I'll get a day one edition controller back.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Remove Photoshop CS or third-party plug-ins from the Photoshop CS3/Plug-ins folder.<br />
<br />
1. Remove all Photoshop CS and third-party plug-ins designed for Photoshop CS from the Photoshop CS3/Plug-Ins folder.<br />
<br />
2. If you've set the Photoshop CS plug-ins folder as an additional plug-ins folder in Photoshop CS3, choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Plug-Ins and Scratch Disks and do one of the following:<br />
<br />
- Deselect Additional Plug-Ins Folder.<br />
<br />
- Click Choose and select a folder that doesn't contain Photoshop CS plug-ins or third-party plug-ins designed for Photoshop CS.
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists post the issue in Adobe Photoshop forums.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t enter my password after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ellew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t enter my password after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I know many people are having a log in issue but I think mine might be slightly different.</p>
<p>y</p>
<p>I get to the light blue log in screen, where it identifies me as Elle and asks for my password. &nbsp; The only other icons on the screen are a next button and a button that allows me to get the screen keyboard and to magnify. &nbsp; Above that it says "Not Elle?"
 which will highlight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter what I know to be an incorrect password, it tells me so in yellow writing and allows me to re-enter the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can &nbsp;physically enter the letters for the correct password in the box. &nbsp; However, after I hit enter or hit the next button (which often takes a few tries) I get a blue processing circle. &nbsp; It moves a if it is processing, nothing ever happens until the
 screen goes black. &nbsp; I then have to C-A-D or manually power down to get back to the same screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried making the USB reboot tool and I was able to reboot off of the USB by hitting F12 and getting to the reboot option - but same issue when I got to the password screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont think it is my keyboard as i can enter the wrong password and my password for my home computer doesnt have anything funky in it like symbols. &nbsp; I dont think it is my mouse because I can actually click on things and enter the wrong password and get
 a reaction</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure exactly where to go next but any suggestions would be welcome. &nbsp; It an older comp (Alienware Aurora R2 64 bit running Windows 7 previously. &nbsp; I'd be happy just to have WIndows 7 back - &nbsp;I reallly didn't want 10, it just started downloading.... &nbsp;
 :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Elle</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. &nbsp; I am logging in with my local system admin account</p>
<p>2. &nbsp; I am entering it correctly multiple times &nbsp; I have checked for caps lock etc</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I purposefully entered the password incorrectly in order to check the next button/return functionality, and to check to see if I needed to use my Microsoft account password</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;I not have a power button with a restart option on the login screen</p>
<p>5 &nbsp; F5 does not give me a safe mode reboot option-neither does f8 (or f2 or f12)</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;I only have one account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating. &nbsp; My computer is now a doorstop due to windows 10</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I would suggest you to login to a web page using another computer, if you are using a Microsoft account, check if you are able to login to a web page if yes try changing your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then try to login to your computer and check. Ensure you have working internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After rebooting my Windows 7 machine today, I found myself getting the message "Logging out..." a split second after I attempt to log into my account. I found an "Unspecified error" in the event log and used Process Monitor to track down the events that
 occurred right before the error.</p>

</p><p>From my other admin account, I can still access both of that account's hives (ntuser.dat, UsrClass.dat) just fine by manually loading them with regedit, but they don't appear in HKEY_USERS unless I load them there manually. Deleting UsrClass.dat doesn't
 help (but it does get recreated, so that strongly suggests the problem isn't in there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to fix it in-place due to just how much work I've put into this profile over the years. If regedit supported overwriting one tree at a time, I'd just back up ntuser.dat and replace parts of it until it works. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, it's more interesting this way.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I made another account and loaded the entirety of these two hives into it. That account was able to log in. I then overwrote the broken account's ntuser.dat and UsrClass.dat with the other account's versions, and...it still can't log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: After I made that new account, I replaced its <strong>entire user profile folder</strong> with a directory junction pointing to the broken account's profile folder, and the new account is able to log in just fine and has all the personalization settings
 and everything that the broken account had.</p>

<p>Hello Mason,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue can potentially be caused by the following reasons:</p>
<p>- The user profile is corrupted.</p>
<p><span>- The&nbsp;</span><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)"><span>UsrClass.dat</span></span></strong></em><span>&nbsp;file at the following location is missing:</span>
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows</span></strong></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">- Folder redirection is enabled to redirect Application Data folder into a Roaming Profile.</span></p>
<p>

            Greetings Tussya,<br />
<br />
That's a great question. The Surface Pro will run Windows 8 Pro, and will be able to install drivers for printers just as a laptop or Desktop would. You can print over WiFi with the Surface Pro.

<h2>            Adding music to windows movie maker</h2>
                    I downloaded some music from limewire pro (I even payed for a 1 yr subscription) then transferred that music to window media player. &nbsp;However, I can't figure out how to add it to my movie. I click on add music, but can't seem to find the file. &nbsp;Forgive
 me, I'm a rookie. &nbsp;Do you have any suggestions?

            <p>Open up Windows Media Player and find the music you want to use. Now right-click on it and choose 'Properties'.&nbsp; You should see the full path name of the file and where it exists on your computer.&nbsp; You can highlight that complete name and copy it (<strong>Ctrl+C</strong>).&nbsp;
 Now when you are in Windows Live Movie Maker and adding music, just paste (<strong>Ctrl+V</strong>) that filename into the filename box.</p>
<p>An alternative, perhaps faster way to do this, is to right-click on the song in Windows Media Player and choose 'Open file location'.&nbsp; That will open up Windows Explorer with the file selected.&nbsp; Now just drag that file right into your Windows Live Movie
 Maker window at the spot where you'd like the music to start.</p>

<h2>            Skype to go connection and minute rates and fees</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account has Skype credit. But unfortunately I can't find one single web page that shows the per minute fee and connection fee for every available country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember there was such page but now the links takes me to just one place where it suggests me a country and 3 ways to pay (Country subscription, World Subscription and Rate)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I can click a small link to get more information (connection fee and minute rate) just for that country. So I have to search them one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a Skype official web page with every rate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Xbox Fitness End of Life&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just received a notification that Xbox Fitness is going EOL in a years time. &nbsp;Frankly, I'm extremely disappointed with this decision. &nbsp;The decision to cancel a product is a hard one and to tell people in a year that they cannot even use the content that
 they have paid to use is plain wrong. &nbsp;I can replay my Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One and now you are telling us that we cannot play a game specifically for Xbox One that we've purchased? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd really like Microsoft to reconsider Xbox One support for existing content so we can continue to work out and enjoy the service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a very rude decision you take. Xbox Fitness is good for your health and can not simply stop you. Think about your customers.</p>
<p>It's one of the reasons why we have opted for Xbox One</p>

<p>I think I could cry real tears over this. As a mother of small kids and living on a one paycheck income Xbox fitness has really enabled me to push myself. I even bought a couple videos because I wanted to make sure they got some money out of me using this
 amazing game! I'm just... Heartbroken. I feel like I'm being broken up with in advance. How rude, Microsoft, how very rude.</p>

<p>i dont care about what i spent, because its been a life changer for me, but i am going to look into legal options just as a way to try to salvage it... give use the workouts as standalone apps, or just port it into windows if your too lazy</p>

<p>Who made this decision?</p>
<p>Xbox Fitness has a passionated community, awesome people.</p>
<p>This game got a lot of people into fitness and working out, I quite a few &nbsp;people that only use their Xbox One to play Xbox Fitness.</p>
<p>And what about my purchases?The workouts are pretty expensive for me as college student and now you´re just shutting down Xbox Fitness and I won´t be able to use them anymore?</p>
<p>I always thought that Microsoft/Xbox changed when Phil Spencer became the head of Xbox, but this is the same old behavior...</p>
<p>Unbelievable</p>

<p>I will be bugging the hell out of Xbox Support for full refunds on all workouts. This is not okay. If they had made it so any downloaded workouts were able to be used after the complete shutdown on 7/2017, that'd be one thing. But we are losing complete
 and total access to content we paid money for (and quite a lot of money for).</p>

<p>This is so incredibly disappointing. As a father of three, it was much more convenient to use Xbox Fitness from my home than any other means of exercise. I cannot find the time to get out to a gym. I'm not sure what I'm going to do... I guess I'll use lame
 workout videos.</p>

<p>Stupid and ridiculous decision to completely shut it down. If you want to stop updating it, whatever I guess....but to shut it down completely?! Give me a break. I have used this service from day one and I have loved it from the start. I've bought content,
 and loved using the free content as well. It's all I use the kinect for, and it makes working out fun. Xbox fitness has kept me consistent and transformed my body. Market it more and put money into it rather than shut it down. You can have a million testimonials
 from people like me. It's such a good product even as it is. Sell Xbox fitness with kinect as a peripheral, like the guitar with guitar hero. Don't shut it down. DON'T SHUT IT DOWN! You work off feedback correct? DON'T SHUT IT DOWN!! We need to start a petition
 or something to reverse this stupid decision.</p>

            <p>This is going to sound crazy but I fixed the problem on total accident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I was installing a new version Autodesk Autocad 2016 and I was having an issue where the activating license was coming up blank. So I checked solutions online and found one that worked which was to use a McAfee uninstaller to removing anything
 that was left behind if you have previously used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ran the uninstaller, restarted my computer and lo and behold autocad 2016 works. I then opened up skype to talk to my friends and I noticed skype's home page was now working when it had not been before I ran the uninstaller, I then decided
 to check the windows 10 button again and now it works, its no longer a blank screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I don't know if this will work for everyone but try using the McAfee uninstaller found on here<a href="http://support.esri.com/cn/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/41057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.esri.com/cn/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/41057</a>&nbsp;just
 ingore the text and run the uninstaller and hopefully it works for everyone too.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code that you encountered can be cause by either of the 2 factos:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – Please check with provider if it is required or not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – This is caused by a 3rd party program since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />Try to uninstall and restart your PC to fix the issue:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Display adapters
<br />Right click the current display adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />Exit Device Manager
<br />Restart PC 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, please let me know. 
<br />
<br />Also If you can't update with that screen, install it with the Windows update installation media: 
<br />
<br />Fix windows update errors here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />But your best bet to install the latest update would be to go through Greg's clean install guide here: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Or for something with a little less instructions you can go here and download an installation media for the update, then follow the instructions on the page for updating your PC : <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
