<h2>            Farmville Zygna games not loading Win 8.1, IE 11</h2>
                    <p>I can't get Facebook to load quickly and games freeze,will not load. I have tried compatible view,Firewall off, zero add on's running, desktop view, any view doe's not matter. The game &nbsp;asked for Java to be installed and &nbsp;I think we need a Java that is compatible
 with this window's so that we can play the games also. I have checked with Facebook,adobe,and now I am asking you for help. I am having to use my old computer with Vista to play games. I see several have same issue as this and I have tried all the support
 that was listed. I have tried using Chrome also with the Window's 8.1 for the games. So I am hoping that this can be addressed and solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for looking into this as money was invested and would just like to be able to use the computer, Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p><span>Hi PclarkLW,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to several reasons like outdated or incompatible display driver, missing updates etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us try these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if this particular update is installed or not.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 8.1 and Windows 8</span></strong><span>:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2886439/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2886439/en-us</a></span></p>

</p><p><span>Disclaimer: Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not
 guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In Windows 8.1, Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) is turned on by default for Internet Explorer and for Internet Explorer for the Desktop. This provides Users a more seamless
 experience, and offers additional security by making it more difficult for malicious software to run.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When in Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM), add-ons are disabled. Users can still use add-ons in Internet Explorer for the Desktop, but you need to click on the notification
 that appears, and select "Run add-ons", which will turn Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) off.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Turn off the Enhanced Protected Mode (EPM) and check the issue status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the reply posted by “Ganesh Achar B” from this thread and check if this helps.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may update the Display driver and check.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right click on the video driver and select “Update Driver Software”.</span></p>

<h3> rebeccacooper1  say:</h3>
<h2>            All of my files are gone</h2>
                    <p>So last week I went on holiday and had my laptop ready to do some homework while I was there, but when I went to open it, all of my files, documents, even just about any history of my use on that laptop was gone. I didn't have wifi while I was there so I
 just figured it wouldn't let me access anything until I logged back into my Microsoft account. Only, when I did log back in today, I still cannot access them. I can't find the restore option anywhere in my settings, and I did try searching for it, but it was
 no use. Before I went away, my laptop had stopped displaying my chosen background and had updated once again, without my permission, despite the fact that I had chosen to postpone it. My files aren't in my recycle bin, and I don't know what else to do. I just
 want my files back. I had so much important information on here and now, it's all gone. What should I do to get it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have my apps, but all of my files are gone.</p>

            Go to Add/Remove programs and uninstall the Sonic Update Manager. This is a useless program which isn't working for you anyway.

            Go to Control Panel/Add- Remove/Record Now and Remove. Then restart. I no longer have Veritass in the middle of my screen! Hope it works for you! Just in case- Go back into Control Panel, do the same thing to check! It could take a couple of times.

            <p>Hello blank000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, you may need to get a cleanup utility for some versions of Veritas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is not the case, I would recommend contacting Veritas as they ultimately own the install/uninstall process for this software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know.</p>

                    My wife recently received an MS Surface tablet.&nbsp; Initially, she set her password and was able to use the device without problem.&nbsp; However, after 2 days of light use, the device does not recognize her password and will not let her log in.&nbsp; How can we resolve
 this so she can reset her password and gain access?

            Mario -- sorry for my delay in responding, but I needed to recover the answer we had found.<br />
<br />
My wife's Surface would not accept her password and so she could not log in to use most of the suggested solutions for "resetting" a password.&nbsp; We had to do a complete Factory reset using the following steps (which I found on the Web and which were successful):<br />

The only way to start a full RESET without signing into Windows is to interrupt the Windows Startup process a couple times to get "<u>Windows Automatic Repair</u>" to start, as follows:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Turn off the device by holding the Power button for 6-10 seconds<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Tap the Power button to turn it back on.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Once the Surface Logo appears, wait for the "circling dots" to appear and then hold the Power button for 6-10 seconds to turn the device off again.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Repeat step 2&amp;3 until the Surface Logo appears with the words underneath saying "Preparing Automatic Repair".<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Recovery Mode will now start.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; At the BITLOCKER screen, tap "skip this drive".<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp; Tap "Advanced Options".<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp; Tap "Troubleshoot".<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp; Tap "Reset".<br />
<br />
10. Tap... "Just remove my files".<br />
<br />
11. Reset process will take about 20-30 minutes -- and <b>ALL DATA WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE DEVICE.</b><br />
<br />
After the "Reset Process"&nbsp; completes, the OOBE/Start Up Wizard should start and the customer can complete the setup of their Surface device.<br />
<br />
Please note that we used this process because <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) we could not log-in to the Surface device AND <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) because we had no personal data to save.&nbsp; <b>If you have personal data that you don't want to lose, you will have to find a different way to reset the Surface</b>.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.&nbsp; It worked for our situation and the Surface has continued to work perfectly since.<br />

    <title>Kinect displays broken image for a second, then powers down with red - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kalebfenoir  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect displays broken image for a second, then powers down with red light &#40;360&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Until recently my Kinect was working perfectly. In some respects it still is; the microphone still hears me enough for chat and voice recognition to kick in, but the camera seems to either not work, or receive a broken image. Querying the Kinect through
 the console gets me a &nbsp;C00000C2 error, which does not make any sense, as the Kinect has not moved location or been moved to a power bar with less power than before.</p>
<p>I cannot force an update (as directed by the troubleshooting) by trying to play a Kinect game, as the software appears to be up to date already. The sensor's motor appears to work fine, though since the camera appears to be receiving only a partial image,
 it refuses to engage its movement much.</p>
<p><br />
Standard troubleshooting does not seem to work, as it revolves around moving the USB around the AUX hookups, or just unplugging and replugging the Kinect, with the only result being 'And now it works, right?'<br />
<br />
When I talk of a broken image on the Kinect screen, I mean that, on the Dashboard it shows up for a second as an almost Scottish Tartan of black and white vertical and horizontal lines, before shutting down completely. When a Kinect game is attempted to be
 played, the image shown is mostly empty, save for patches of distortion across the middle of the screen, and up to the right corner, much like that one Tetris shape that looks like a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>As stated, the Kinect has been in the same spot for the last year, with no issue till today. Power was fine, camera angle was fine, scanning was fine, movement was fine. It just does not work now. Solid red light on sensor, and shutdown.<br />
<br />
Has anyone run into this, or can offer advice above and beyond the standard troubleshooting? I'd appreciate it, as some of the games I play do require Kinect enhancement.</p>

<h2>            Struggling to delete my subscription</h2>
                    <p>I've just received an email (to my work email address) saying that my subscription for a Skype number (3-month subscription, £14.71) has been successfully renewed. I want to cancel this as I haven't used it for years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble is, when I try to log in to Microsoft Online with that email address, it says there's no account. When I log in with my personal address, there's no subscription. So where is the subscription!?? The money is going out of my bank account but I can't
 find out where/how it's being used, or how to stop it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the order number and transaction date so I presume if I can speak to a real person they'd be able to look up the order and cancel it from there. But I can't find any number to call... Argh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions welcome :-)</p>

</p><p>If you receive the confirmation email from Skype, kindly check the order details and look for your Skype name. Use it to sign in to Skype or you may try to reset your password. If you are no longer have access to the email address linked to your Skype account,
 the only thing I can suggest you is to answer the verification form. It is the only way to recover a Skype account since account recovery process is fully automated. Kindly submit a request through this link:&nbsp;

            Hi Ashish_707
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            Facebook app no longer starts on my machine&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi<br />
<br />
Yesterday I realised happily that new version of Facebook released, and a new Messenger app. I love them, therefore I wanted to try. For my surprise the Windows Store said It can't launch the app because I need "direct3d, with level 9.3 or higher" The same
 problem at Messenger. I checked my DirectX version. It's 9.E and feature level is 9.1 I downloaded Directx11 from your website, installed it, but still Directx9 apperas in dxdiag. What can I do? Is it possible that EVERY person with a little bit&nbsp;older video
 cards won't be able to use Facebook and Messenger??? That wouldn't be the best thing I think.</p>

            Hi Péter,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand that you are unable to launch new version of Facebook app and Messenger app on your system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do not worry, we will assist you to resolve the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li></ul>
<p>I like to inform you that Windows 10 support DirectX12. However, for DirectX12 to work, even&nbsp;the hardware such as&nbsp;the Graphic card or Display Adapter must also support DirectX12 on your Computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the Graphic card supports DirectX9.3, then you may try updating the Display/Graphic drivers and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><div>1. Press (Windows key + X key) and click on “Device Manager”.</div>
<div>2. Expand “Display adaptor”.</div>
<div>
<p>3. Right click on the display adaptor driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Also in case updating driver doesn't work, then go to the manufacturer's website to download the latest version of the driver. Then, uninstall the current version and install the latest version. Make sure to restart the Computer when uninstallation is
 done.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>

<p>Driver update is not avaible, it says I have the latest. I'm thinking about that my video card don't support Direct 3d 9.3 level, but in this case it means I wont be able to use the new apps until I change my video card?&nbsp; It launched aero glass on Vista
 and 7 and a Facebook app makes trouble? &nbsp;The older Facebook app launched very well. In this case I suggest to give the ability to keep or manually install&nbsp;the older version. Or...I don't know what would be the best solution.</p>

            Hi Péter, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• What is the previous operating system on your computer before upgrading to Windows 10?&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This issue might occur due to the incompatible Intel G33/G31 chipset family (Microsoft Corporation, WDDM 1.0) graphic card driver on your computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
As a work around, I suggest you to uninstall the Intel G33/G31 chipset family (Microsoft Corporation, WDDM 1.0) graphic card driver and reinstall the latest Intel G33/G31 chipset family (Microsoft Corporation, WDDM 1.0) graphic card driver&nbsp; in compatibility
 mode and check, if it works.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Follow these steps to install the Intel G33/G31 chipset family (Microsoft Corporation, WDDM 1.0) graphic card driver in compatibility mode.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
1. Download the latest Intel G33/G31 chipset family (Microsoft Corporation, WDDM 1.0) graphic card driver&nbsp; from the manufacturer’s website:
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
2. Right-click on the setup file and click on "Properties".<br />
3. Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box "Run this program in compatibility mode” and select previous Operating System from the drop down.<br />
4. Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Also, I suggest you to contact the technical support team of Intel G33/G31 chipset family (Microsoft Corporation, WDDM 1.0) from the link below and check, if it helps.<br />

</p><p>If this problem is quite recent, run System Restore to wind back the clock to a time when the computer was working properly as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to "System".</li><li>In the next menu, click the link to "System Protection".</li><li>Next, click the System Restore button and then at the bottom, click "Choose a different restore point" and click "Next".
</li><li>From the calendar which appears, choose a date when the machine was working properly. If there aren't enough dates,checkmark the option to show more restore points.
</li><li>Click Next to proceed and then confirm your choices.</li></ol>
<p>System Restore takes about ten minutes to run during which time the computer will reboot. At some point, you'll be faced with a black screen where nothing appears to be happening. But eventually, the usual login screen will appear and you should be back
 to normal again.</p>

            <span>Hi Dandykid69,</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers community.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this behavior, remove the user account from the Guests Group and from the
 Domain Guests group. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
<br />

</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong> , point to <strong>Programs</strong> , point to <strong>Administrative Tools</strong> , and then click
<strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong> . </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Users</strong> folder, right-click the user account that you want, click <strong>
Properties</strong> , and then click the <strong>Member Of</strong> tab. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the
<strong>Guests</strong> group is in the <strong>Member of</strong> list, click <strong>
Guests</strong> , click <strong>Remove</strong> , and then click <strong>Yes</strong> .
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the
<strong>Domain Guests</strong> group is in the <strong>Member of </strong>list, click
<strong>Domain Guests</strong> , click <strong>Remove</strong> , and then click <strong>
Yes</strong> . </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong> , and then exit the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.

<p>Try what Unbeatable95 is suggesting first for sure. Something else you may want to confirm is if your Xbox 360 console is connecting to Xbox LIVE properly. Easiest way to do this is to run a Connection Test from the settings area of the console. Keep us
 posted! </p>

</p><p><span><span>Hi Arlene, </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that you want to remove the password on Windows 10 during the start up. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please answer this question to get more clarity on this issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you logging to the pc using the Microsoft Account or the Local account?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you sign in to Windows with a local account, you can choose not to enter a password. If you are using the Microsoft Account then you will not be able to remove the password. When you create a user account, you can
 choose between two types of accounts: a local account for that PC or a Microsoft account, which works on all the Windows 10 PCs you use. We recommend using a Microsoft account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you sign in to Windows with a Microsoft account, you need to use a password. Your password helps keep your account secure, no matter what PC you sign in to or what apps, settings, and services you use while you're
 signed in.</span></span></p>
<p>

    <title>Saving an attachment via file explorer to SharePoint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony vargo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saving an attachment via file explorer to SharePoint</h2>
                    <p>At some point in the past few months the following behavior presented itself when saving excel and word files (that are attached to an email) to our SharePoint document library via file explorer. Once file explorer displays and we go to select a folder to
 save to, IF there are more folders than fit in the display of file explorer window, you have to single click the FE display window before you can select the folder, otherwise if you scroll down and attempt to double click the intended folder, FE selects the
 first folder within the list of folders, not your desired folder. It does not occur if saving a PDF.</p>
&nbsp;How do we get file explorer to not act in this manner?

<h2>            Warning, Windows 10 Home 1803 has serious problems with Gaming</h2>
                    <p>If you are running home or if your computer updated to Home v1803 there are some serious compatibility issues, basically the update is borked and will cause game crashes and BSOD name it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are one of those that are experiencing crashes and you have 1803 you have a few options, roll back to 1709 or install a 1709 fresh build or wait until MS releases a hot fix to address these issues. If you have 1803 look at the Administrative Events
 under custom view in the Event Viewer (right click search - Event) it's a total nightmare from module faults to network disconnecting to permissions being denied to Security Center faults name it it's all there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it's not the game or graphics card but basically a very very bad build release. How in the world can a build like this make it to release is beyond me.</p>

            I have had the same issues. I have had more and more BSOD errors with 1803 when I had zero before.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had been running Project Cars 2 using Oculus Rift and streaming with OBS Studio and I have had Project Cars 2 quitting to the desktop with a bug report window (never ever had that before), stuttering and glitching graphics (frame rate glitch/tiny corruption)
 and audio (random crackling in audio) and straight up BSOD screens. I have had heat issues which I didn't seem to have under 1709 either but I am less convinced they are to do with the crashes as the CPU should throttle if over heating and whilst it was hot,
 it wasn't at a critical level and neither was the GPU.<br />
<br />
Anyway I have installed liquid cooling now to get rid of any heat issue with the CPU but I too have rolled back to 1709 to be safe. After rolling back I streamed without any issues what so ever for over 1.5 hours. Maybe the cooling has solved it or maybe there
 is a deeper issue in 1803.<br />
<br />
As the issues have come at a time when I have had other changes too it's hard to 100% blame 1803 but I will say I was having none of these issues before the update even with heat etc. and I have zero issues after the roll back so for now I shall be sticking
 with 1709.&nbsp;<span>There seems to be a lot of issues reported with increased BSOD screens (increased from zero to about 5 for me) with 1803 and I believe it was actually delayed because of BSOD issues also. It's worth noting I had assumed the first
 BSOD was the Chrome/Cortana bug but even since the patch to fix that the system was unstable gaming.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
I need to trawl through the logs to see exactly what happened if I can before considering trying 1803 again I only experienced issues when gaming, more so when streaming. Maybe it's just the cooling that caused the problem but it seems many others are seeing
 the same issues too.

            There is&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;no answer to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot get Aero to work,&nbsp;I've been now looking and trying solutions for two weeks now.&nbsp;

<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div>So why cant I use Aero? &nbsp; As per&nbsp;<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/259e9f14-b162-40c9-9acf-77cbdef96133">ShreyasMohanty</a>&nbsp;I tried that and more like uninstall drivers, swapping the Video card into a ASRock Gen7
 M0B and didn't worked with Aero swapped card with supplier same on both M0Bs &nbsp;tried it in an ASUS PQ-LE worked after some fiddling. &nbsp; &nbsp;Have tried the&nbsp;</span>GeForce GTX 550 Ti in five different M0B and sometimes first go it has Aero, other time after fiddling
 for a while it does work with areo, as for the Fatal1ty Z68 M0B, nothing works. &nbsp;I tried new hard drive GPU etc... &nbsp;It is something in Windows that is F'ked up. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>(While typing and installing new system)</div>
<div>Accidentally, &nbsp;I've just discovered this.... &nbsp;A clean install of the OS with no drivers other than the Windows7 generic Drivers, go put the the&nbsp;highest&nbsp;resolution and Areo works... YEPPY!!! &nbsp;Must put resolution at&nbsp;highest&nbsp;settings</div>
<div><i><b>&nbsp;BUT!!!&nbsp;</b></i></div>
<div><i>&nbsp;</i>As soon and i do a Windows update I'm back to square one. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm&nbsp;going&nbsp;to uninstall the obvious updates that could be at fault and see what happens. &nbsp;I might be inclined to post back in a few days if I discover which one it is.... &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hey ShreyasMohanty,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven't already,&nbsp;work through both of the suggestions provided by Dena in the quoted text&nbsp;below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi ShreyasMohanty,</p>
<p>Check the manufacturer's website to make sure you have the most recent graphic driver. You may also try booting the computer in a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> state to eliminate software conflict.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
If those steps don't help, try updating your motherboard's BIOS. You will need to visit your computer manufacturer's or computer's motherboard manufacturer's website to download the latest BIOS and find instructions on how to update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are unable to perform a boot in your Computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time. Do not worry, will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>We have been seeing black screen issues of several types after upgrading to Windows 10. The main causes observed so far are driver issues, output to unexpected port, and possibly also issues with the Lock Screen app. Please use these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you see the black screen <strong><span>only</span></strong> <strong>
<span>after sign-in </span></strong>and you can see a mouse cursor:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>While at the black screen, try using CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager.
</span></li><li><span>If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span>
<ol>
<li><span>If this resolves the black screen, use corruption resolution steps (dism, then sfc), and run the all apps PowerShell command in
<a href="https://vkbexternal.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/VKBWebService/ViewContent.aspx?scid=KB%3ben-US%3b3080495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">3080495</span></span></a>.</span></li></ol>
</li><li><span>If this does not work, use File, Run new task in Task Manager to start an Administrator CMD window. Use this to create a new administrator user with the following commands (changing “&lt;password&gt;” to something of the customer’s choosing):<br />
</span><span>net user test &lt;password&gt; /add<br />
net localgroup Administrators test /add</span><span> </span></li><li><span>This will give you a test user to try, which will confirm if the issue is user or system-specific.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you see the black screen or have a flickering screen <strong><span>before sign-in</span></strong>:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span>
<ul>
<li><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></li><li><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></li><li><span>Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters </span>
<ul>
<li><span>If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></li><li><span>If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></li></ul>
</li></ul>
</ol>
<p><span><span>Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Okay, that's a a little dramatic, I know.&nbsp; But after the most recent update ( I think it was the April 10 update, it was surely in the last week); I am having the following problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Start Menu.&nbsp; By clicking, or by pressing windows key.</p>
<p>Can not right click on the taskbar.&nbsp; For example, right clicking on File Explorer no longer works, nor any other right-click action (on taskbar icons).</p>
<p>Many pinned items on the taskbar do not work at all -- Calculator, Calendar, Windows action center (I think that is what it is called).</p>
<p>Search not working.&nbsp; Right clicking on the start menu icon brings up the context menu, clicking on search does nothing.&nbsp; Everything else on this menu seems to work.</p>
<p>Can not click to change the time/or time settings (not that I need to, but still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched online for solutions for a few days, and come up empty.&nbsp; I seem to have more problems than most are reporting.</p>
<p>I have tried the following powershell commands:</p>
<p><code><strong>sfc /scannow </strong>-- It said it found some corrupt files, and was successful in fixing them.&nbsp; Nothing changed.</code></p>
<p><code><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</strong></code></p>

            Hey Martin,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the only solution I'm aware of would be to reinstall windows, but the good news is that you can save your data to an external drive so that you do not lose any of your data!
<br />
<br />Instructions on the procedure are as follows:
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel
<br />Click on System and Security
<br />Click on Backup and Restore
<br />On the left pane, click the "Create a system image" link
<br />Under "Where do you want to save the backup?" select where you would like to save it
<br />and then click the "Start Backup" button
<br />
<br />If you would like assistance on the reinstallation of Windows after you have done the backup, feel free to let me know.
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Carson       
        </p>

            Could you check if you are able to log into the built in Administrator account normally?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Check if the desktop loads successfully and you can launch apps.

<p>Hmmm... well I ran cmd.exe as an administrator (just not the way you said to do it, because if you read my post, those are the very problems I am having -- no start menu and I can't right click).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway I ran it as administrator, typed in net user administrator/active:yes like you said, signed out and signed back in.&nbsp; There was no option for switching to an administrator account, because my only account on this PC
<em><strong>is</strong></em> the administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying though.</p>

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />

If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Xbox is one of many components that all come with a Microsoft Account.  See here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-is-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/what-is-microso...</a>
<br />
<br />I Xbox interfering with your attempt to play games in Windows 10?   
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Xbox is a part of your Microsoft Account. Every Microsoft account gets a XBox ID which lets you earn achievement. I would rather ignore it and not sign into it.

<br />        Locate and select the friend you want to remove.
<br />        Select Remove.
<br />        Select Yes.
<br />        Repeat for all friends.
<br />
<br />    To remove your friends using your console, follow the steps under "Remove a friend" at Find friends and connect on Xbox Live.
