<h2>            loading in safe mode - windows 7</h2>
                    Hi ,<br />
How can I load my windows 7 in safe mode ?<br />
I installed windows 8 and windows 7 , now after anti virus update I am facing problem in windows 7 booting.<br />
It boot successfully but as soon as desktop is loaded , there will be a graphical corruption and turns off by itself.<br />
So I want to load windows 7 in safe mode and want to uninstall anti virus which may resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
I googled and tried many ways, like pressing F8 before getting windows logo, etc nothing worked out.<br />
<br />
Can any one give me a proper solution, steps for this ?<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards,<br />
Sadanand<br />

            <p>To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. &nbsp; If that doesn't work, I'd boot from an install or repair disc and do a repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h2>            laptop lid closed external hdmi monitor restart windows hangs</h2>
                    <p>I have my HP laptop connected to my Sony TV using the HDMI connection. I use an external wireless keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>It works fine until I try to restart the computer.</p>
<p>If the laptop lid is closed and only the external display is showing, when I restart, the computer display never reappears, even though the computer seems to have restarted successfully.</p>
<p>I have found no way to get the display to return, and the only thing left for me to do is hold the power button down and repower the computer.</p>
<p>When I repower it, leaving the lid open, it restarts, with both internal and external displays showing. I then close the lid and resume using the computer.</p>
<p>When doing things like updates and installing software, I have to pull&nbsp;the laptop off the shelf to open it's lid so it doesn't get hung when restarting, and this can be somewhat inconvenient.</p>
<p>Is there a way to configure Windows to enable me to restart the laptop with the lid closed?</p>

            <p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>I appreciate your reply.</p>
<p>My laptop is the HP HDX9300 "Dragon". It has&nbsp;a 20" internal monitor with native resolution of 1940x1200.</p>
<p><a href="http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/ho/WF05a/12139188-78299199-78299212-78299212-78299212-80247383.html?dnr=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/ca/en/ho/WF05a/12139188-78299199-78299212-78299212-78299212-80247383.html?dnr=1</a></p>
<p>I have the latest nvidia drivers and the latest HP chipset drivers.</p>
<p>I recently reinstalled Windows 7 on the machine, and I have not installed any third party software other than Windows 7 Ultimate with SP1, and the nvidia drivers. There is no anti-virus software running yet. So, the information in the link to the other thread
 had no relevant information to solve my problem.</p>
<p>That thread was relevant, in that it's original poster seems to have been experiencing the same problem as I, but the response does not provide a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious to know if anyone can reproduce my problem. Connect a Windows 7 laptop to an HDTV HDMI connection, and using a external mouse, restart the laptop with it's lid closed. Will it boot back up to the TV display, or does it hang?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get a solution, I'll post it here.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Bren</p>

            I have a similar issue - brand new HP ENVY hooked to a DELL monitor and USB keyboard.&nbsp; I'd like to keep the laptop closed as it's in a very dirty environment.&nbsp; When I need to reboot the laptop, I have to get it off its shelf and open it up.&nbsp; I have the
 latest drivers and Norton.&nbsp; I'm at Windows 10, however.

    <title>Child Can&#39;t Log Into Computer - Ran Out of Time, Signed Out of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lainangel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child Can&#39;t Log Into Computer - Ran Out of Time, Signed Out of Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Please read carefully so that you do not supply an answer I've already mentioned does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter is part of my Microsoft family account to limit her computer usage. Otherwise, she'd be on it all day every day and all night and not get up for school or do her work. Due to the different amounts of time she can have on various days, I don't
 have times already set up. It goes on a request basis (15 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or 8 hours). In order for the family settings to work, she MUST BE LOGGED INTO her Microsoft account (this is what allows her computer to talk to mine and vice
 versa). If she is NOT logged in, her computer doesn't get updates. This is very very very important for anybody trying to help to please read and understand. If she is NOT logged in, changing her time settings, giving her time, and everything else DOES NOT
 WORK because her computer isn't getting the "update" because she's NOT logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We lost internet earlier (just a blip) but it apparently logged her out of her Microsoft account without us knowing. Then she ran out of time 2 minutes later. This means she is LOGGED OUT of her Microsoft account. I repeat, SHE IS LOGGED OUT OF HER MICROSOFT
 ACCOUNT. This means that her computer WILL NOT get updates from my computer. Please DO NOT suggest that I</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) give her more time (it won't tell her computer bc it's logged out and she's not getting any updates from my computer)</p>
<p>2) open up for the full day (it won't tell her computer bc it's logged out and she's not getting any updates from my computer)</p>
<p>3) remove her from family and re-add (it won't tell her computer bc it's logged out and she's not getting any updates from my computer)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for repeating this so many times but every time I post, I have several people tell me one of these solutions, but they DO NOT WORK because she is LOGGED OUT OF HER MICROSOFT ACCOUNT. That means NOTHING I do on the family account will get to her
 account because it cannot communicate while logged out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From her computer, I cannot request more time because she is LOGGED OUT OF HER MICROSOFT ACCOUNT. The "my parent is here" does nothing but give a blank screen. There is only one user on the computer; cannot create another without logging in. So please do
 not say to create another account on her computer...I can't do that without logging in, which I cannot do while she's logged out of her Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer seems simple: log into her Microsoft account. Again, please read carefully. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH HER MICROSOFT ACCOUNT. I had a "tech" person tell me for over 2 hours how to "fix" her account when it's not broken. Her account is FINE. I
 can log into it just fine with other devices. Her account doesn't need fixed. It doesn't need a password reset. It doesn't need an update. Again, I'm sorry for repeating and making this so long but it seems whenever I try to explain this, I get "answers" that
 are EXACTLY what I just said it wasn't. So please don't tell me to remove her account or fix her account...I can't remove and add it because it won't update her computer while she's logged out of her Microsoft account. When adding a new person to an account,
 one needs to LOG INTO THAT DEVICE AND VERIFY THEIR MICROSOFT ACCOUNT. That's the problem...I can't log into HER computer to verify her Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...she can't request more time or log in because her stupid account logged her out. She can't log back into her Microsoft account ON HER COMPUTER, NOT MINE without requesting more time....can't request more time without logging into her Microsoft account...you
 can see the catch 22 here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...summary...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I cannot give more time or open up time - it won't update her computer while logged out of Microsoft account</p>
<p>2) I cannot remove/add child - it won't update her computer while logged out of Microsoft account</p>
<p>3) I cannot add a profile or change the account type - that would require me being able to log in first</p>
<p>4) I cannot run or download diagnostic tools - that would require me being able to log in first</p>
<p>5) her account doesn't need fixing or a password reset - her account is just fine - I just can't get to log into it</p>
<p>6) logging into her account on my computer does nothing - her account is just fine - I need to log into it with HER computer to verify it</p>
<p>7) yes, we're connected to the internet</p>
<p>8) yes, she's on my family and everything is set up properly</p>
<p>9) this is not a new account - it has been more or less working for a while now other than the massive amounts of bugs nobody ever fixes</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to find a way to LOG INTO MY DAUGHTER'S MICROSOFT ACCOUNT ON HER COMPUTER WITHOUT LOGGING INTO HER COMPUTER ITSELF so that it will be able to communicate with my computer (Microsoft family) so that she can request more time so that I can
 give it to her....problem is, it seems that the only way to log into her Microsoft account is to first log into the computer...which she can't do without logging into the Microsoft account first....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize this is so long. I've been through seven "tech" people who honestly, I'm not sure what they're getting paid for. Every single one of them tells me a solution I've JUST said doesn't work or isn't the problem. Like I said, one person took 2 hours
 telling me how to fix things thinking that I forgot her password....I didn't....hopefully there's a walkaround for this. While I appreciate the thought of the program to keep kids from being on their computers 24/7 when they're supposed to be doing other stuff,
 it's chock full of bugs and it doesn't seem like the company has a single person trained in the field. I've searched online, found hundreds of people with this issue, and not one single real answer...just a bunch of people telling them that if they can't log
 into their account....they need to log in and download something (maybe I'm dumb here but if they could log into their account in order to download something....they wouldn't need to download that thing to log in, now would they?) Hopefully an answer exists
 because this is beyond frustrating that such a major corporation has such massive amounts of bugs for so many years and not one person on the planet who has an answer.....</p>

<p>Hi Lain,<br />
<br />
Since we are not able to login to the device to perform troubleshooting steps and find out what exactly is causing the issue, it would be best to reset your PC. Resetting your PC lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls
 Windows. Kindly perform the steps found in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a> under <strong>Reset your PC</strong> section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.<br />

            That doesn't work. It still has her account which means she still can't log in. In other words...as long as my daughter has a computer, she can't log into that computer. I also can't erase her profile bc it's set as admin (as opposed to standard). I also
 can't create a new profile to move her over without being able to log into hers first. I also can't use the command prompt to override it while on lockout...permission denied. I also can't use the command prompt to open up a browser while logged out in order
 to log into her microsoft account....permission denied. I also tried to bypass it by booting in safe mode with networking to log in....except safe mode with networking has no network!!!! Trust me, you're not dealing with an ignorant person here. Your step-by-step
 "have you tried restarting it?" manual won't work here ;)

    <title>Video freezes, nvidia 8800GT, probable driver issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garylisk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video freezes, nvidia 8800GT, probable driver issue</h2>
                    Looking at their forums, it should become apparent that nvidia does not care about problems their customers are having. Therefore, I have to turn to people they might listen to or work with to solve such problems - Windows and Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 Ultimate x64 (Retail). My video card is a nVidia Geforce 8800 GT.<br />
<br />
The issue is that the video is locking up, flickering, freezing, and even sometimes causing the "blue screen of death" - The problem is widely reported, and is also widely misdiagnosed as overheating. The card is
<strong>not</strong> overheating, let me be quite clear on this. The card is also
<strong>not</strong> old and ready to die (Another common misdiagnosis by techs who would brush difficult problems away.)<br />
<br />
The issue is: Whatever nVidia has done with their drivers, they do not get along with Windows 7. The issue, if you search the web, is exclusively a Windows 7 problem.<br />
<br />
I saw an article earlier regarding something that was implemented in Vista that would detect if the video drivers were crashing, and attempt to close and restart them without rebooting. I can not remember what this feature is called, nor can I find that info
 again (I found it while at work and did not save the URL sadly) - but it certainly seems like that's what is going on.&nbsp; The video will flicker while I am in a game, the game will freeze, and then after a second, the screen will go black, then the game will
 come back up, but at lower graphic detail. Evenually, the game will do the same thing again, and go back to full detail.<br />
<br />
That's just a theory, though, of course.<br />
<br />
I have tried the latest nvidia drivers, as well as the drivers from Windows update. I have not yet tried the nvidia beta drivers, but have read from other users that there was no luck in using them.&nbsp; Some users reported luck when using the default drivers of
 WIndows 7, or the Windows Update drivers, but I had no luck, and many others also didn't.&nbsp; I may try rolling back to some much older Vista drivers to see what happens.<br />
<br />
In any case, my purpose here was less to get an answer, and more to really just spread the word more about this problem. Maybe a Microsoft employee will see this post and report it to someone who can have their people talk to nvidia's people, so to speak, because
 nvidia people do not frequent their forums. There are threads there with issues unsolved from over 2 years ago, and those are similar to some other issues we still have today with TV-Out. But that's another topic entirely.

            Well, no problems so far beyond some flicker. The flicker does make me nervous, but otherwise, no crashes in almost 24 hours. I have been running Folding@Home on it constantly and it doesn't seem to have had any issues with that, either.&nbsp; Folding@Home
 has it running at 97-98% GPU usage constantly, and it's sitting at 67 degrees Celsius, which is just fine. It is looking more and more like it was my 8800.<br />
<br />
But I do still wonder what the ____ could have caused it to act so crazy, hmm...

<h2>            Microphone level adjusting itself randomly.</h2>
                    <p>English is not my first language so sorry if you don't understand it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Ramon and i'm 17 years old. Recently my microphone level adjusted itself when I started up Counter Strike Global Offensive. But know it adjusts itself randomly. So I searched on the internet to get more information about this and found out that
 many other people have the same problem. And there was only one video that had a&nbsp;temporary fix. I couldn't find any help on the microsoft forums either. So i'm going to adress this issue again and try to explain what the problem is exactly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So first it started with me starting up Counter Strike Global Offensive. My microphone level adjusted it self from 100% to 0%. But know it does it just randomly. Im talking about this thingie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on speaker icon &gt; Recording devices &gt; Double click the microphone &gt; Levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91daba7a-0dcb-4baf-99f6-c151fee01c8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91daba7a-0dcb-4baf-99f6-c151fee01c8d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This bar keeps adjusting itself randomly and I can't find a fix for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating and annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plz tell me that after 4 years (i could only find videas and forums about this issue from 2013) someone has a fix for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Help, cant reserve my copy of Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter t. knowlton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help, cant reserve my copy of Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I know there have been lots of posts regarding this subject but Ive tried all the solutions to no avail. &nbsp;I have a toshiba laptop E305 with Windows home premium installed. &nbsp;Under that configuration the icon showed up and I was able to reserve my copy. &nbsp;Unfortunately
 the HD crashed and instead of reinstalling the home premium from the recovery disks I purchased a copy of Win7 Professional, wiped the drive and installed a clean copy. &nbsp;Now the icon will not show up. &nbsp;I used windows update to bring the opsys current, used
 all options on the Win10Fix-full.bat and I still dont get the icon that will allow me to reserve a copy. &nbsp;Is there anyway I can get a full copy of Win10 Professional by just supplying the keycode that came with win7 pro disk? &nbsp;What are my options? &nbsp;Any help
 would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Audio Jack Problem</h2>
                    When I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10 from windows 8.1 Pro for the first time I faced a problem regarding the 3.5 mm audio jack of my laptop. Whenever I connected any earphone to the audio jack no sound would come. I had to lower the volume to zero and
 increase it and then sound would come. Please help me to solve this problem.

            <p>Hi Kaustav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience experienced by you and will certainly help you in the right
</p>
<p>direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model no. of the headphones?</li><li>Do the headphones show similar behavior when connected to a different system?</li><li>Does the sound&nbsp;from the internal system speakers vary when you raise (or change) the volume?</li></ol>
<p>The issue seems to be arising with the headphones hardware as you are able to hear the audio but the headphones seem incapable of producing louder volume of sounds. However, I would still suggest you to try the following methods in order to diagnose&nbsp;problems&nbsp;with
 Windows&nbsp;to narrow down the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div><strong><em>Step 1.</em></strong> Ensure the headphone or microphone is fully and firmly inserted into the correct jack.<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Step 2.</em></strong> Plug in the headphone and see if the same shows up in Control Panel.</div>
<div>a) Right-click on sound icon in the taskbar and select “Playback devices”. See if the&nbsp;Headphones&nbsp;are listed.</div>
<div>b) If not, right-click on the blank area and select “Show Disabled Devices”.&nbsp;</div>
<div>c) Right-click on your&nbsp;headphone and select “Enable ”.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong><em>Step 3. </em></strong>Check the volume property. Ensure that Make sure that your speaker volume or headphone volume isn't muted or turned down too low. Some laptops&nbsp;have an external volume control on the outside of the case. Check the external
 volume control on your laptop model to make sure it's not turned all the way down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Run the audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A troubleshooter is an automated tool that can find and automatically fix some problems with your PC. The
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=260596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>As of now, try the above steps and check if the issue gets fixed.</p>

    <title>Install Win 8 keeping OEM recovery partitions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gunmoule  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Win 8 keeping OEM recovery partitions</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently bought a new HP Pavilion Sleekbook and it came with Windows 8 x64 installed. Thing is that I use to perform a clean install with original MS disk, mainly to get rid of all preinstalled OEM bloatware. Problem is I want to keep the ability to
 use the OEM Recovery partition in order to restore the notebook to its factory state any time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I boot my Win 8 install, here is the partiton table:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Part 1 WINRE 400 MB Recovery</div>
<div>Part 2 unlabeled 260 MB System</div>
<div>Part 3 unlabeled 128MB MSR (reserved)</div>
<div>Part 4 unlabeled 674.4 GB primary</div>
<div>Part 5 RECOVERY 23.5 GB OEM (reserved)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Question is which one of theses are safe to erase in order to keep the HP Recovery stuff and the F11 hotkey mechanism?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My guess is that Part 2 3 and 4 are the ones that a normal WIN 8 install creates, right? These would be the ones I want to erase?</div>
<div>Part 5 obviously is HP recovery partition so I wont format it, but what is WINRE partition? Will a fresh install from original Win 8 disable the F11 hotkey ability?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for your help</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Battery drain while in sleep mode &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus GL551. It original had Windows 8.1 on it but I upgraded to Windows 10 a few months ago. Ever since it has been running Windows 10 the battery will drain completely within 10-12 hours while in sleep mode. When it had Windows 8.1 this was not
 an issue. There would still be plenty of battery power even after a few days of not being used and in sleep mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that is is coming out of sleep mode periodically and draining the battery. Just the other day I had been watching a YouTube video. When It finished I closed the lid of the laptop putting it to sleep. About two hours later, with the lid closed the
 laptop started playing the Youtube video all by itself. I had not touched the computer and the lid was still closed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin&nbsp;</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Please REMOVE wlanext.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been disturbed by the high CPU usage of&nbsp;<strong>wlanext.exe</strong>&nbsp;for nearly two years, just like many other users with the same problem.</p>
<p>This program keeps starting and running when Windows starts, even I disabled WiFi module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a few days ago I&nbsp;<strong>DELETED</strong>&nbsp;wlanext.exe in C:\Windows\System32 (with restore point), and it turned out that Windows runs NORMALLY without this annoying program! Since then I never have any mistake on WiFi or any.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think&nbsp;wlanext.exe does nothing but takes 25% of CPU. :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore,&nbsp;please REMOVE wlanext.exe!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My Preferences do not stick. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> officeatlas  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Preferences do not stick.</h2>
                    <p>I go to Settings and type "What's my version?" Search Results answer? No results for what's my version. So, why don't you make it easy to find my version?</p>
<p>I go to Settings and type in winver and Search Results answer is "no results for winver"</p>
<p>My problem is I need to include a screen shot.</p>
<p>My problem is when I choose "Always use this app to open .pdf files" and hit Okay, it does not accept my answer and next time it asks me again. This mean 4-6 clicks to print out an attachment. This is labor intensive and carpal tunnel prone. Time is money
 and the more time I spend trying to open a document is time better spent on something else.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Problem is when I type winver into the run command line I cannot copy and paste the text to put it into some blog post. Who thought that up?</p>
<p>This machine is MS Win 10 version 1803 ( OS build 17134.165). Why do I have to type that in? Why isn't Copy and Paste utilized for such an important piece of data that gets used whenever someone asks, 'what version are you on'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>QuickPrint from Outlook does not work. Quick print is not recognizing what app needs to be used. Whether Excel, adobe, Word. And I want to turn off the "This is from an outside source- it could harm your computer" warning. Yeah. It's all from the outside.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Still can't get .pdfs from email to do the QuickPrint without asking me what application I want to use for opening it. Even when I choose the app and "Use This one all the time" it still asks me every time. And even then it does not print it only opens it.
 Whereupon I have to choose print. </p>
<p>This takes a forever amount of clicks for all the emails and files attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish the email would also be able to print embedded graphics or pictures. It asks me only where I want to save it. No Quickprint.</p>

 Like that. Alternatively the Windows key plus Print Screen will allow you to save the screenshot to pictures (in your screenshots folder) from which you can then copy and paste it into a message like this:</p>

            <p>Hi Nathan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will definitely help you in getting the time set correctly on your computer and hope to make your Windows 8 experience a great one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are a few steps you can follow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the status of Windows time service.
</p>
<p>a. In the desktop window, Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>b. Type services.msc in run Window.</p>
<p>c. From the services Window find 'windows time' and double click on it.</p>
<p>d. If service status is stopped, click on start and press ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try restarting the Windows time service and check</p>
<p>a. Single click on time and date display at the right bottom of screen.</p>
<p>b. Select internet time tab and click change settings and click update now and press ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check if the correct time is set in the Bios from the computer manual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable accessing the Bois, please contact the computer manufacturer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have issues, contact the computer manufacturer and get the
<b>cmos</b> battery check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting
 properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this resolves the issue. You can write back to us if issue persists and we will be glad to help you further.</p>

<p>Start your computer by inserting the Windows startup disks or the Windows installation disk if your computer can start from the CD drive.</p>
<ol>
<li>When the <strong>Welcome to Setup</strong> screen appears, press R to select the repair option.
</li><li>If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the Windows installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.
</li><li>Type the administrator password when you are prompted to do this.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If no administrator password exists, press ENTER. </li><li>At the command prompt, on the drive where Windows is installed, type <span>chkdsk /r</span> , and then press ENTER.
</li><li>At the command prompt, type <span>exit</span> , and then press ENTER to restart your computer.
</li><li>After you repair the volume, check your hardware to isolate the cause of the file system damage.
</li></ol>
If this procedure does not work, repeat it, but type <span>fixboot</span> instead of
<span>chkdsk /r</span> in step 5.
<p><strong><span>IMPORTANT: Running Chkdsk /r can cause you to lose data. If you have not backed up your data, first do so with one of the data retrieval methods described below.</span>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Data retrieval</span> - 1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to
 copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use
 #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and Knoppix will be able to see the Windows files. If you are using the USB thumb drive or the external hard
 drive, right-click on its icon (on the Desktop) to get its properties and uncheck the box that says "Read Only". Then click on it to open it. Note that the default mouse action in the window manager used by Knoppix (KDE) is a single click to open instead of
 the traditional MS Windows' double-click. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, use the K3b program.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -

            Make sure Hyper V is disabled. This is virtualization software that is part of Windows 10, and had the effect of slowing video and disabling audio for all media players. Under Control Panel, Turn Windows features on or off, uncheck Hyper V. (If it's not
 checked, then that's not your problem with slow video playback!)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Store still supports Windows 8.1. If you're unable to update your game via Windows Store, run the

 of the game to ask for game-related specifics like if they have a standalone update or alternative way to update the game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the error "<strong>This version of Windows is no longer supported by Windows Store. Get the newest version of Windows.</strong>", we recommend that you check this

<h2>            program mouse wheel &#40;push to right&#41;</h2>
                    Hi;<br />
<br />
The most often-used function of my mice is the ability to push the scroll wheel sideways to the right, open a link in a new browser tab.&nbsp; This is default action for most every mouse I've used.<br />
<br />
Got a Wireless Mouse 5000 for Christmas, and I can't find any mention of programming this switch.&nbsp; I realize pressing down on the scroll wheel achieves this action as well, but it requires much less pressure to simply nudge the wheel to the right.<br />
<br />
What am I missing here?&nbsp; How do I program this switch?&nbsp; I can feel the switch activate, but it does nothing.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            When I rotate the wheel, nothing happens.
<p>If the wheel does not work in any program that has a scrollable document open (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer), make sure that IntelliPoint wheel support is enabled:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
Using the mouse that you want to configure, start IntelliPoint.<br />
(Click&nbsp;<b>Start</b>, point to&nbsp;<b>All Programs</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Microsoft
 Mouse</b>, and then click&nbsp;<b>Microsoft Mouse</b>.)</li><li>
On the IntelliPoint&nbsp;<b>Wheel</b>&nbsp;tab, make sure that the&nbsp;<b>Enable vertical scrolling</b>&nbsp;check box is selected.<br />
<br />
If that does not resolve this problem, try reinstalling IntelliPoint, making sure to select the correct mouse during Setup.</li></ol>
<p><b>Note</b></p>
<p>If scrolling works in some programs (such as Microsoft Word or Internet Explorer) but not in others, even though they have scroll bars, those other programs might not support the scroll wheel.</p>
When I rotate the wheel, my window sometimes disappears.
<p>You can use mouse wheel to scroll, and you can also use it as a button. Clicking the wheel switches to other open programs on your desktop. Sometimes while scrolling, you might accidentally press the wheel and unintentionally switch to another open
 program. This is why the active window seems to disappear, but it is actually still open on your desktop. If you want to return to the previous window, click the wheel until that window appears again, or use the Windows taskbar to switch to the window that
 you want.</p>
<p>To resolve the problem, avoid pressing down on the wheel while scrolling.</p>
<p>You can also disable the wheel button, if you prefer to use the wheel only for scrolling.</p>
To disable the wheel button
<div>
<ol>
<li>
Using the mouse that you want to configure, start IntelliPoint.&nbsp;<br />
(Click&nbsp;<b>Start</b>, point to&nbsp;<b>All Programs</b>, click&nbsp;<b>Microsoft
 Mouse</b>, and then click&nbsp;<b>Microsoft Mouse</b>.)</li><li>
In the&nbsp;<b>Wheel</b>&nbsp;button list, click&nbsp;<b>Disabled</b>.</li></ol>

            Thanks for the response.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I've tried all the settings.&nbsp; The only setting that's related to my issue appears to be "Enable horizontal scrolling".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I want to be able to use the right-tilt mouse wheel in the same fashion as other mice, in this case, to close open tabs in IE, Firefox, Notepad++, etc.&nbsp; So far, no luck whatsoever.<br />

<p>Hi naringas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Task view is a good feature to toggle in between tasks you perform on Windows 10. Be advised though that editing the registry may do more hard than good on your machine. he operation that you would like to perform on Windows isn't available yet as of the
 moment. However, this would be a good suggestion that you'd be able to raise to our
<strong>Windows developers</strong>. To raise your idea, you can post this to your
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback Hub</a></strong> and add the full details and share it as well here on your thread afterwards.
 This way, other community members would be able to up vote your idea specially if they feel that you best described the idea.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to reply on your thread.</p>
