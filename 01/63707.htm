<h2>            Windows 10 login requiring PIN number, but I never set one</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently restarted my windows 10 laptop and when the login screen appeared, I was asked for a PIN number. I don't recall setting a PIN number - and when I click sign in options and select password (I don't have one) entering a blank field prompts an
 "Enter information" dialogue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer avoiding resetting my PIN number if at all possible.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Control Panel, go to Devices and Printers section. Alternatively, you can press Windows + R and type
<strong>control printers</strong> and click OK.</p>
<p>2. Right click on your printer and select <strong>Create shortcut</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Windows couldn't create a shortcut in Control Panel, hence its asks you to create a shortcut at Desktop instead. So in the confirmation prompt, click
<strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Go to Desktop and you'll find the printer icon/shortcut there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Else try this, if above doesn't works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Control Panel, go to Devices and Printers section.</p>
<p>2. Find your printer icon and drag it to Desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

                    During the last few days, <span style="font-weight: bold">I installed CCleaner Software to takes care of my Registry</span>. In the CCleaner
<span style="font-weight: bold">I pretty sure that I change some of the settings in Option.</span>

<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">My problem is that; after I uninstalled the CCleaner, I can no longer copy or paste whatever files exist in my system. What happened to my computer? Does this have something to do with Clipboard Service? I can't find Clipboard
 Service in services.msc like Windows XP.</span> <span style="font-weight: bold">If this concern with the Clipboard Service, how can I turn the service back on? Is there any options like Microsoft Fix It? Help me ASAP. That is urgent. Thanks.</span><br />

            <p>Changing the download directory isn't the issue, its being able to specify various locations based on what you are downloading, then also rename BEFORE you download, as many sites have very cryptic naming on their files and it makes NO sense to download
 them automatically...</p>
<p>Please add this back in and don't try to fix it. Remember the adage, if it ain't broke....don't fix it?</p>

<p>I'm sure&nbsp;this is helpful to those who had issues with the location of the default downloading however not having the option to choose to 'save as' posses more issues than simply being able to choose the location that you want to save the downloaded file.
 When you click the option to save as it provided the ability to choose the file name as well. This is a&nbsp;big issue for me specifically and possibly many others who like to download music. when I download my music I like to type the artists and song titles correctly
 and not simply have them saved as their default titles, without this ability I am currently unable to download my music without having unwanted file titles for the songs I download. is it possible to have this issue fixed and regain the ability to select the
 option to be asked what I would like to do with downloaded files (E.g. - Open, Save or Save As)

            <p>It is better to have the "Save As" feature. I was playing around trying to find a way to add it to Edge. I was unable to, but I did find a very easy work around. When you are on the page you want to download from, click the More Actions (the three dots)
 button on the top right. Next click "Open with Internet Explorer". This will open the page in explorer and everything will download with the Save As option just like before.&nbsp; You can paste in a new tab or on the page. You just cant open in a new window because
 that will open Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            This Microsoft EDGE has to be the biggest Piece of **** I've had the misfortune of using. What kind of moronic company&nbsp;does it take to release a browser in 2015, that doesn't have an option to save where you want it. Not to mention, right clicking on a
 pic or video has not option to " SAVE AS" I'm sorry but the idiots that wrote this utter pos should be fired for incompetence.&nbsp;Sadly it's not surprising being that they come out with a new operating system every few years that never seem to improve. I'm going
 back to mac, Microsoft is a joke!

            <p>I'll be honest that I'm using Chrome for my web-browsing and only using Edge because I'm too lazy to get something else for PDF viewing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right-click on a PDF, the only option is "Save As" but that's what I was looking for (and maybe you, too)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dunno if it helps you all - and I do agree this should be accessible via More Actions "...", too.</p>

</p><p>1c. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you ever done a Refresh? ...a Reset?</p>

<h2>            Problems Booting my Computer - Windows 10 into the infinite loop of &#34;preparing automatic repair&#34; HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have a Dell Studio XPS 7100 and I recently installed Windows 10 (from the factory Win 7) and everything seemed to be working fine for a couple of days.&nbsp; The only recent thing I've done is add a user profile to the computer.</p>
<p>But now when I turn on my computer, I get the Dell start up screen, then I get a black screen with a small blue Windows logo and a message saying "Preparing Automatic Repair" It is there couple of seconds, then my machine reboots to the same screen, over
 and over and over in an infinite loop, saying "Preparing Automatic Repair." &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I shut down the machine and wait a few minutes, it reboots and does the same thing.&nbsp; I waited once until the next day and did get to the screen where it says I can reset the computer. When I do that, it starts "resetting" and there is a % counter at
 the bottom of the screen going up towards 100% - but during the process, I get a message saying there was an error and the machine was not reset.</p>
<p>If I then click or or continue (can't exactly remember what the button said) it starts to reboot, and I go back into the infinite loop of "preparing automatic repair" HELP!</p>

            <p>Hello -</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I attempted to repair my desktop computer with a media creation tool, and with the advanced options available through the Windows 10 problems screen.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the computer starts the process.... It attempts to fix the computer and even shows the the reset % for 30 minutes, but eventually stops working and becomes idle. I have attempted this process four or five times, and even let it "repair" over
 night; but to no avail.&nbsp; The computer gets stuck, and I have to hard-power off the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can boot to safe-mode, I can even boot to the start screen sometimes, but eventually the computer freezes up or restarts itself only to start the infinite loop all over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next suggestion?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>This is NOT a hardware issue. I am able to boot to diagnostics, and have run the test twice. Everything passes. There are no errors on my hard drive, all of the components are working correctly, and I am certain it is just a software issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have moved all of my important files to an external hard drive. How do I wipe the hard drive clean, &nbsp;back to the default factory settings from which the computer came?. It is a dell studio 7100.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have never had ONE problem with this computer until the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;This is a Microsoft issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>DUAL SCREEN RANDOM WINDOWS &#47; DIALOG BOX POSITION - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salrandazzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            DUAL SCREEN RANDOM WINDOWS &#47; DIALOG BOX POSITION</h2>
                    <p>I'm using windows10.</p>
<p>When I use a dual screen configuration the operating system decides in a random way where to open a new window/dialog box, even if it's originated by a previous one. I never know where a dialog box will appear, if on the left or right screen.</p>
<p>Example, if I'm working on network configuration on the left screen, a property dialog box could appear on the right one. But not always, without a constant criteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be useful if a dialg box would appear on the same screen that originated it.</p>
<p>In the same way, it would be nice if a new window (program/app just started) would appear on the same screen where I launched it using the start key.</p>
<p>Is there any way to configure this behaviour?<br />
Or some forum to propose this enhancement to windows engineers?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Japanese text becomes boxes when copy-pasting, why&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 Ultimate.<br />
I can view Japanese text just fine, but when I copy and paste it turns into boxes.
<br />
I can no longer re-name anything (documents, videos, pictures, etc.) in Japanese, which is bad, I need this fixed.<br />
This did not used to happen to me, so why is it screwing up now?<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I just went back through my folders and EVERYTHING that -used- to have a Japanese file name is now also turned into boxes.<br />
If the Japanese gets back to displaying correctly will all my files get their names back?

<p>A quick check for you.. </p>

            <p>Unless there is a hardware fault with your console, it won't be an issue with memory usage. &nbsp;The Xbox One has 8GB of RAM, of this, 5GB is reserved for Games, and 3GB for system and apps use. &nbsp;No game can access the other 3GB.&nbsp;So no matter what background app you have running, it won't make the system run out of memory.</p><p><br /></p><p>Either your console has a serious hardware issue with game crashing or it has an issue with the power supply. &nbsp;Make sure you plug your console directly into the wall socket or a known working power adaptor that is not overloaded or faulty and does not have a surge protector. &nbsp;Surge protectors can cause the console to become unstable.

<h2>            Restart Loop</h2>
                    After installing the newest Windows 10 update, my computer is now stuck in a restart loop that gets as far as showing "Attempting to recover installation" and then "Restoring &nbsp;your previous version of Windows" which each stay on the screen for maybe a
 second each before the restart fails and tries again. What should I do?

            Hi JamesSimmons5,<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to verify, what changes have you made prior ti getting this issue? Were you able to have this work before? Are there any error messages? Have you tired putting a different CD? What trouble shooting steps have you done so far?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

            Hello there KHVin. Looks like your graphics card is either dying or  you need to update it. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Start your PC then just as Windows loads - press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a shut down. Do it 3 times. You may only need to do it twice, but on the third start Windows will boot into the recovery environment.
<br />
<br />You can also hold shift &gt; press restart in the start menu to do the same
<br />
<br />1:
<br />Go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; Startup Repair
<br />This will try to make Windows repair itself.
<br />_____________________________________________________
<br />2:
<br />you can also go to Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Option &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart
<br />After you restart, press the button you need to to get into Safe mode, usually 4
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you can then open Device Manager via pressing win+x &gt; Device manager &gt; update all drivers that you may be able to.
<br />Restart your PC after that.
<br />_____________________________________________________
<br />
<br />
<br />When updating drivers for your GPU, I suggest running ddu to clean out the entirety of the GPU's drivers and registry files, then install them fresh. This ensures adequate installation.

<span>I've had my Xbox One for about 3-4 weeks now. It had been working fine for about 3 weeks until my games (FIFA 14 [DIGITAL], NBA2K14 [DISC] and Dead Rising 3 [DISC]) periodically started to crash to the desktop. Now, I can't play them anymore. I've tried
<span>I've had my Xbox One for about 3-4 weeks now. It had been working fine for about 3 weeks until my games (FIFA 14 [DIGITAL], NBA2K14 [DISC] and Dead Rising 3 [DISC]) periodically started to crash to the desktop. Now, I can't play them anymore. I've tried
 hard reboots, reinstalling games, removing FIFA out of the equation, switching accounts everything. It doesn't work. Ive also had the slightly niggling, if not as big, problem that upon startup, the green Xbox One splash screen seems to have small groups of
 pixels flickering, as if they died and quickly responded again. Is this a hardware issue or another software issue? Does anybody have a fix to this? I'm seriously considering getting a PS4 because of this, or just simply getting my money back...</span><br />

<h2>            how to stop error navigating to CHKDSK </h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have been running CHKDSK (My Computer &gt; c: &gt; Properties &gt; Tools &gt; Check Now) and I have run it 3 times with both boxes checked for Windows to automatically fix file system errors and also to attempt recovery of bad sectors. Someone told me that it can
 sometimes finally make a good change after 3 or 4 times running CHKDSK. I will not run it again tonight, so that it is not running if you should call me.</p>
<p>For some weird reason, when I click the Properties, a Windows Explorer box pop up that says Windows Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close. There is a Debug button and a Close button. If I click Close, it shuts down my Desktop temporarily
 and then ends my effort to reach the Tools &gt; Check Now, so I just move this window out of the way and continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I click the For more information about this error, it says Windows Explorer - error signature, AppVer 6.0.2900.5512, ModName unknown, ModVer 0.0.0.0, Offset 20204905 and there is a button to&nbsp;click for technical information which says Exception Information,

<p>From your description, I would come to the conclusion that your hard drive is going bad.&nbsp; If you can, back up as much as your data as you can ASAP.&nbsp; If your machine won't boot, you can try booting from a Live Linux CD such as<a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Knoppix</a>
 and do your backup from there but if your disk is as bad as it sounds, this may not even work.</p>
<p>The next step would be to reinstall Windows doing a complete reformat (not a "Quick" format) of the hard drive.&nbsp; If this works, wait a while before committing critical data to your disk.&nbsp; If the new installation starts going bad in a day or two, then consider
 replacing the hard drive.</p>
<p>Disk manufacturers have some disk testing programs on their website.&nbsp; It might be worth a try, but I've had some bad disks in the past which pass those tests just fine but then the disk seems to "forget" sectors overnight.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

<p>I have a USB Maxtor e: drive with a full backup of my c: drive including all docs using Acronis True Image software. My machine boots and runs fine right now. I have been trying to run a program called SpinRite to work on this issue, but have been having
 problems. I have run CHKDSK three times now with both boxes checked to fix errors (My Computer-Local Disk C:-Properties-Tools-Check Now-Automatically Fix &amp; Attempt Recovery selected) and it takes a long time (perhaps 8 hours or so) and a Windows Explorer box
 always pops open when I navigate to it saying Windows Explorer has encountered a problem and needs to close. Clickng the Debug seems to do nothing. For more information, click here says Error signature APPName: explorer.exe, AppVer 6.0.2900.5512, ModName:
 unknown, ModVer: 0.0.0.0, Offset: 20204960. To view technical info about the error report, click here says: Exception Information, Code: 0xc0000005, Flags: 0x00000000, Record: 0x000000000000, Address: 0x0000000020204960, System Information, Windows NT 5.1
 Build: 2600, CPU Vendor Code: 756E6547, CPS Feature Code: AFE9FBFF, CPU AMD Feature Code 00EDE824 and lots of stuff after that. When I go back and click the Close button on the initial "encountered" box, it temporarily closes my desktop and all icons at the
 bottom of the screen but not this IE site and then they stay off for half a minute and then they come back on.</p>
<p>I recently did a reimage/reinstall/reformat of Windows at Microsofts urging, due to an issue with Security Essentials not running and not being able to be uninstalled so that it could be reinstalled (me and plenty others had this same issue). So I reformatted
 and started over about a month ago. Not fun! I didn't wait a while as you suggested and just moved forward with installing all programs and loading My Docs.</p>
<p>Do you think that my next step should be to investigate what Toshiba has to offer to test my MK6006GAH disk? I have suffered several shutdowns the last few days while working on my pc. A tech helper at Acronis had this happen last night while he was helping
 me via online access. It shut down and restarted. He says to have my ram check, check the power supply (??PS) and he asked me if I feel that the system runs hot (my kids say that it does feel hot on the screen - it is a tablet). He said maybe the cooling&nbsp;fan
 has failed. He suggested that I send this tablet to Motion Computing (the mfg) to have these items explored. What do you think I should do?</p>

<p>It is the job of Windows Explorer to navigate the disks, make sense of what's there, and make sure everything goes where it belongs.&nbsp; Should a bad spot in the disk appear where Explorer needs to read and Explorer reads erroneous data, it may try to make
 sense of it and act on it or it may just throw up its arms and give up.&nbsp; This is probably what's happening when Windows Explorer crashes with the error.&nbsp; Chkdsk also does its best to recover when it discovers a bad spot on the disk (that's why it takes so
 long), but often it makes things worse than before if it doesn't interpret the charred remains correctly.&nbsp; My guess is that your system runs just fine as long as you stay away from that bad area on the disk.</p>
<p>So the next step is to ask why the bad spot in the disk appeared.&nbsp; If your system shuts itself down instantly and without warning while it is trying to write data to the disk, that could easily cause the problem.&nbsp; On the other hand, loading bad data from
 a disk and executing it can crash it too. The two most common causes of instant and random shutdowns are overtemperature and bad RAM.&nbsp; To address overtemp, there are some programs that you can download that will monitor your CPU temperature just like the thermal
 circuit does.&nbsp; I found the freeware "Core Temp" helpful for this. &lt;<a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/</a> &gt; .&nbsp; If you look around, you can also find some RAM test programs.&nbsp; The problem is that RAM tests also tend to put
 a lot of stress on the CPU which again can cause overheating -- but probably worth trying.&nbsp; If your machine can run a RAM test without shutting down, you probably don't have a thermal problem.&nbsp; Microsoft has a RAM diagnostic procedure here<br />
&nbsp; "Hardware Malfunction Results in System Error"&nbsp; &lt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315223</a> &gt;</p>
<p>The other cause of a bad spot in a disk is a bad disk itself.&nbsp; I once dealt with a disk failure mechanism on a laptop where I would re-install Windows on the drive and it would work fine for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Leave it sit overnight and it wouldn't boot
 the next morning.&nbsp; I reinstalled Windows over a dozen times before I realized the problem was the disk drive (sometimes I'm a bit thick-headed).&nbsp; Disk tests do a good job of reading and writing in various patterns on a disk drive but are almost always done
 over a short period of time and what I had was a problem where it would "forget" when sitting overnight.&nbsp; Replacing the disk drive ended up solving that problem for good.</p>
<p>Pick your path and good luck, let us know if you solve it.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

            <p>If U have not resolved this issue by the time you see this then I would guess that some of your utilities have corrupted your OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would blow the partition(fdisk), rebuild it(fdisk), and then reformat of&nbsp;the HD.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would then reinstall the OS and only use utilities you know are safe.</p>
<p>I would upgrade to 7 though you should make sure you have at least 3 Gig of RAM, a decent video output that is compatible with DirectX 9&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many 3rd party tools are not all they are cracked up to be.</p>
<p>If you do not want to bother with that: Run a couple of anti-malware scans such as Spybot S&amp;D or Malwarebytes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then I would get rid of NORTON or Symantic suits and grab a free be like Avast.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try not to use AVG, a clever hacker ‘broke’ mine and<span>&nbsp; </span>
I ended up doing the same thing that I mentioned at the start.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>No matter what you choose make sure it is nice and safe.</p>

            <p>Thanks Harvey for all of this info! </p>
<p>I wanted to tell you that I hadn't seen any of these errors on this tablet PC but I haven't been trying to navigate to CHKDSK to run it. But I did just try to go to
<strong>My Computer &gt; RIGHT CLICK ON c: &gt; Properties &gt; Tools &gt; Check Now</strong>, and my PC stopped proceeding when I did that first right click and then it left that little box hanging there and it is still there while I am typing this even though the Start
 stuff that it came from has disappeared like it had done in the past which had caused me to&nbsp;ask this Question.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell you that I just recently did a clean install with the mgr CDs and one is named Operating System Recovery CD. Then I went to the Motion Computing's sites at
<a href="http://www.motioncomputing.com/products/software.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.motioncomputing.com/products/software.asp</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.motioncomputing.com/support/driver_download_1600.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.motioncomputing.com/support/driver_download_1600.asp</a>
 and I updated everything and then&nbsp;I installed Office 2003 and any programs that I own using CDs or downloads. I updated everything as much as possible using File Hippo and I also ran&nbsp;Windows Update manually in all 3 categories.</p>
<p>I bought the max RAM from Memory 10 at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html</a>&nbsp;that is available for this tablet which brought it up to just 1.5 MB after I learned how to have the PC identify the new
 RAM.</p>
<p>Lots of work! Even more work when you consider recovering My Docs from a USB One Touch hard drive and also importing my fingerprint profile and all of my saved passwords in the built in fingerprnt reader that logs me into Windows and helps me with user names
 and passwords on tons of websites ....</p>

            <p>I had to do a Ctrl/Alt/Del &gt; Shut Down &gt; Restart to get out of that jam after I tried going to
<strong>My Computer &gt; RIGHT CLICK ON c:</strong>. I had to click on several End Nows to get to a Restart.</p>
<p>And I wanted to tell you that the Motion site that I just linked in my other Reply says that this LE1600 can run VISTA. That contradicts what you said about the RAM needed for 7. Is 7 newer or better than VISTA? I have no experience with anything for several
 years except for XP.</p>
<p>I did use Spybot S&amp;D for a while before I did the Clean Install.&nbsp; But I haven't ever reinstalled it since that time.</p>
<p>I've got Malwarebytes on it now and have been pretty happy with it in the past. Someone had me install it but I can't remember the issue that we were working on. I do remember that it fixed the issue.</p>
<p>I've never liked NORTON or any Symantic stuff and I don't ever put it on my pcs. And I've even run some program that I was told about on this site that removed any old stuff from various anti-virus programs - one at a time.</p>
<p>I've used Security Essential only since my Clean Install and I immediately had it do a Full Scan. But it was on a Clean Install, so .....</p>

            If you don't even know what these features are, don't even bother with it, stick with Windows 7 Professional, its more than enough. BitLocker is for encrypting hard disk and portable storage devices. It requires that you chipset supports the Trusted Platform
 Module 1.2 (thats a whole other story). <br />
<br />
If you want such capabilities, look into using TrueCrypt. (Its free)<br />

<p>1) If you're playing the CPU - the difficulty has to be at least Professional. &nbsp;Anything under that and your XP won't increase.</p>
<p>2) This happens to me ALL the time. &nbsp;Connection to EAS FC is lost. &nbsp;I've probably missed out on loads of XP, because of this.</p>

    <title>disabling digital signature for driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jurjenb  say:</h3>
<h2>            disabling digital signature for driver</h2>
                    I got a HP notebook, not even a year old. Windows7 came pre-installed.<br />
After a while I suddenly noticed that my optical drive wasn't working any more. Error 52: couldn't verify digital signature.<br />
<br />
I contacted HP for a new driver with valid signature, the guy told me to re-install Windows. Of course I'm not going to do that, it'll cost me a week to restore everything to the point I am now (Windows 7 has a lot of new features I simply HATE, so it takes
 a lot of tweaking to get everything to taste, not to mention all the software I have to re-install and re-configure).<br />
<br />
So I'd like to disable the verification of the digital signatures (yes, I understand the risks, I happily accept them). However, I tried several things: group policy editor, the DOS commands to turn them off (“<strong>bcdedit.exe -set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS"
 with and without "bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON" </strong>”, but the error persists.<br />
<br />
How do I get rid of it? I do not want to revert Windows back to square one and I do not want to get an external optical drive.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Tried it twice, but it just pops back up as before. Now Windows is even complaining that my copy of Windows isn't genuine (which is rubish, it came OEM with my laptop)!!! Updating the driver again results in Windows saying the 'best' driver software is
 already installed.<br />
<br />
Does SOMEONE know how to disable the verification? I'm getting desperate!<br />
