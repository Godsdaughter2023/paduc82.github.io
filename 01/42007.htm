<p><strong><span>Hi Smilinglady,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you receive a 1935 error when you try to install software, the Windows file system transaction log has become corrupted. The transaction log is
 used by the Windows file system to recover when a file error occurs. </span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><span><br />
To correct this install error, you need to clear the log -<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open an Administrator command prompt: Right-click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; Command Prompt and select "Run as Administrator" and click "Allow" for the elevation prompt<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the command prompt, type the command below:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This assumes that C: is the drive in which Vista is installed. If it is installed on another drive like D: (please change the drive letter
 appropriately).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reboot the system.<br />
e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Install the software and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to perform a SFC scan and check.<br />
<strong>To</strong> </span><strong><span>Perform a SFC Scan</span></strong><span>&nbsp;-</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>,
 click &nbsp;<strong>All Programs</strong>, click&nbsp; <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click &nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
 password, or click &nbsp;<strong>Allow</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Type
 the following command, and then press ENTER:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan -<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may check if you can install the software in clean boot. Clean boot will help identify if any non-Microsoft service is causing the
 issue.<br />
<strong>To perform the clean boot follow the step 1 mentioned in the below article and then try checking in this clean boot state -</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue gets resolved check which non-Microsoft service is causing the problem; referring to the article and following other steps.<br />
<strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
c. </span></span><span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Samsung VP-D353 not working with Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Sumsung VP-D353</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have a Samsung video recorder that records onto DV tapes. Previously I would capture this onto computer quite easily using Movie Maker on a computer with Windows XP. I notice it does not seem to be supported via Windows 8. I do have another video
 camera that also uses DV tapes a Samsung VP-D381 but this was connected via firewire. Are there cables available that are USB to the PC at one end and the small firewire at the other? Are there drivers available for oeither model for that matter to allow use
 with Windows 8? Thanks in advance for any assistance!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Connectivity Problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Connectivity Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every since I built my PC, I've been having connectivity issues. When I boot up my computer, if I don't hear the noise of a device recognized (like when you plug in a USB), I know off the bat the Internet will not work properly. It doesn't allow me to access
 some websites, saying "The DNS server isn't responding." When I run the troubleshooter, there is no errors. I have tried setting up a manual DNS server address of a primary of 8.8.8.8 and secondary 8.8.4.4 with no avail. I have also tried other addresses as
 well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, I am able to connect at startup after the device recognized sound goes off, however, within x hours of it working, it will go back to losing connectivity again (with no sound indication). It's different when it goes off like this. There is still
 no errors found by troubleshooter but if I go to websites like YouTube, most of the page loads but the videos will have a black screen and won't load, along with thumbnails of other videos on the right hand side. Also, the format is kept (I'm not just seeing
 a text version of the website).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers (and my routers firmware) is up to date, I am using ethernet (switching to wifi doesn't change the problem), and oddly enough every other device on my network is able to get Internet just fine at perfect speeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else think of what could be causing this?</p>

            <p>Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the things listed on that page besides uninstalling all of my network drivers to no avail. A few things I found interesting is that in my report from running "<span>netsh wlan show wlanreport"</span>&nbsp;in
 the CMD showed multiple connection attempts immediately followed by a "Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within configured time" error 6 seconds after. Pinging 192.168.1.1 gave me replies with no packet loss. I have Charter&nbsp;(my ISP) coming out tomorrow
 to take a look at my modem, however, they claim there are no issues on their end. As of right now, I'm uninstalling my all of my network drivers and rebooting, but it's going to take some time as this issue happens at random. Any other solutions in the meantime?</p>

            <p>Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So sorry for this late reply! I've had a lot of stuff happening recently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, I had this working for a while. I put my computer in airplane mode with my ethernet it and it seemed to be working.... For a little bit. I have done everything I can that doesn't have to do with my computer as well&nbsp;(my Powerline adaptor, my
 router, modem, etc). I do not want to factory reset and lose everything either. I have completely uninstalled all my network drivers and let them redownload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps any, when I restart, it takes forever to shutdown. If I were to just click shutdown, it will shut down fast ( which is normal). It seems as when I restart and I actually wait the 5 mins it takes to restart, it will boot up and MOST of the time
 I will hear the device recognized sound and my internet will work, whereas if I just shut down I will not get the device recognized sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting my ICP/IP manually from that link you provided and it came back as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Windows\system32&gt;netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt</p>
<p>Resetting Global, OK!<br />
Resetting Interface, OK!<br />
Resetting Unicast Address, OK!<br />
Resetting Neighbor, OK!<br />
Resetting Path, OK!<br />
Resetting , failed.<br />
Access is denied.<br />
<br />
Restart the computer to complete this action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I ran it as administrator as well, and even after restarting the PC I tried again just to make sure and got the&nbsp;same result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked in event viewer in case I can get information from there but found nothing important. I do have a VPN installed on my computer but I do not think that is the issue, as I have uninstalled it and still had the weird internet outage randomly.
 I do not always use the VPN either, I only have it on maybe once a month when I do work related things at home, as my work requires I use one when I do work at home. The VPN I have is TrackOFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other things I can try in windows or maybe even third party programs to generate logs for you to see more of what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Clipboard won&#39;t copy image data properly if it&#39;s too small. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luxidoptera  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clipboard won&#39;t copy image data properly if it&#39;s too small.</h2>
                    <p>So I've been periodically encountering a problem recently where if I'm copying images directly into the clipboard, like out of screen-capture programs or art programs, it will occasionally fail to copy the image data properly, and will instead copy it as
 a single left parenthese, ( . It'll paste as said left parenthese if I'm trying to paste it into a text field, and it won't work at all if I'm trying to paste it into an art program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs mostly whenever it feels like it, but I've noticed something of a correlation between this issue and the
<em>size</em> of the image I'm attempting to copy. It seems that if the size of the image is smaller than a certain pixel size (not sure precisely what), it will trigger the parenthese issue. Selecting a larger area and copying that works around the issue;
 however, should I want to copy the image at the original intended size, cropping it back down and then copying it causes the issue to happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes restarts fix this, sometimes they don't. It crops up again at random, anywhere from minutes to several hours after I started the computer up. Sometimes it doesn't happen again until a few sessions later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what's going on?</p>

            <p>Here, you can see a test of this issue, run on an image of a Black Garfir from Neopets:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/EsmQzBw.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/EsmQzBw.png</a> (Had to post this as a link because it wouldn't accept the raw image.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the issue loosely correlates to the image's size- when the image's size is doubled by waifu2x, it will copy and paste properly. However, at its original size of 100x100 px, it does not. Copying a blank white space at 100x100 px
<em>does</em> work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I've just tried<em> saving</em> an image that's too small for the clipboard, both directly and through Lightshot- that works fine as well. It's only copying and pasting that causes this problem. At least now I have another workaround, haha.</p>

<h2>            Halo 5 stuck Installing&#47;Updating at 100&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased Halo 5 as a digital download and the game took several hours to get all the data downloaded (I had to let it run overnight, despite an unimpeded 50mbps download rate at my house). &nbsp;However, now the game is showing that it is alternately "installing"
 (in Xbox Store) or "Updating" (Games and Apps) with the progress bar at 100%, where it has apparently become stuck. &nbsp;It has been roughly an hour with the 100% indicator lodged in place, even after a soft and hard reset.</p>

<p>Hi Keyan Reid,</p>
<p>Are you still experiencing this issue? </p>
<p>If you still are experiencing this issue, I would like for you to attempt some of the troubleshooting steps that I'm going to provide. Before anything else, go to settings, power &amp; startup, restart now. If the game still does not finish downloading (since
 it is stuck at 100%), we may need to do the following steps: highlight Halo 5: Guardians, press the menu button, press manage game, you're going to select uninstall all. We will uninstall Halo 5. Afterwards, you're going to settings, account, remove accounts,
 then select your profile. Lastly, you're going to repeat the earlier step by going to settings, power &amp; startup and selecting restart now. Once your console is completely turned on, sign in to your Microsoft Account to your Xbox One and download Halo 5 by
 going into games &amp; apps, games, go to the right until you see ready to install. </p>
<p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I did not perform the steps you mentioned, as the game started the download process all over again without my intervention. &nbsp;This occurred roughly an hour after my initial posting - as of this time, it is at 63% after several hours of activity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've run several bandwidth tests that have averaged around 40-50mpbs download/60mpbs upload, yet the download for Halo 5 is taking way longer than the download speed chart provided on this site indicates should be the case. &nbsp;Are there any recommendations
 for this, or is this a known issue with Microsoft?</p>

<h2>            Vista does not recognize the network adapter</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite.&nbsp; When I attempt to connect to my wireless network in the house, it says "this computer does not have a wireless network adapter installed and configured."&nbsp; However, when I go to the device manager&nbsp;and click on the network adapter
 (it is called Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller), it says that the device is working properly.&nbsp; I tried rolling back the driver and that didn't work.&nbsp; I have reset the computer twice and it hasn't worked.&nbsp; When I connect via an ethernet cable, I can access

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1st turn the switch to your WiFi OFF and back ON. Then do this :<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

<br />
<strong>Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.</strong><br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
System maker is Toshiba : <br />
<br />
Toshiba Support and Drivers - click Product Support on Upper Left and navigate to your model - get the lastest<br />
drivers even if the same as you have now.<br />
<a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp</a><br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Device maker is probably RealTek or Intel though it could be others.<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

<p>Does your modem have a router in it too, if so your router and modem may be conflicting because you will need DHCP in most cases to use the network.</p>
<p>I suggest that you reset your router and setup your network essentials (Wi-fi and password only) then follow the steps below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off your console. </li><li>Wireless connection only: Unplug the Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter from the USB port.
</li><li>Turn on your console. </li><li>Remove the old saved network and add the new one. </li><li>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and select System Settings.
</li><li>Select Network Settings. </li><li>Select Wired Network or the name of your wireless network, if you are prompted to do so.
</li><li>Select Configure Network. </li><li>On the Additional Settings tab, select Restore to Factory Defaults. </li><li>Then go through the steps to run the connection test. </li></ul>

<h2>            Cant play Black Ops, Fifa 11 or use netflix. </h2>
                    
<p>My xbox live connection works and all the ports are forwarded correctly and my NAT type is open. However I keep getting server errors when I try to play Black Ops multiplayer even when their servers are up and running. I have done all the basic stuff including
 resetting the router. Can anyone else help me out with this?</p>

<p>Could you post what "server errors" you are getting...cause it sounds like someone has activated the Parental/Family controls to prevent you from playing rated "M games. &nbsp;And FIFA 11 requires that you be of a certain age also before you can play online.
 &nbsp;Don't know about the Netflix problem.</p>

            Hi shwethamv,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />I suggest you to check if your time-zone and date/hour are correct, and also to set both of them to automatic, then retry using Media Creation Tool:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + I
<br />2. Click on "Date/hour and language"
<br />3. Enable "Set date/hour automatically"
<br />4. Enable "Set timezone automatically"
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, remove the CMOS battery for 30 seconds, then insert it again and once booted, repeat the timezone operation.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that works.

<p>I am running Windows XP Pro I try to boot my DELL PC and get the following message</p>
<p>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:</p>
<p>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</p>
<p>You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.</p>
<p>Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair.</p>
<p>I have loaded the original Windows XP disk and hit F8. This gives me several different options and I choose Repair by pressing r.</p>
<p>The problem is that my keyboard no longer works. r does not work nor do the arrows. It behaves as if the keyboard is not plugged in (and yes the keyboard is plugged in).</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Was
 your keyboard working fine without any issues earlier?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 it a wired keyboard or a wireless keyboard?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 the other keys working fine without any issues?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At this point of time, the only best option you have is to use a different keyboard to repair the Operating system. Once you are done with this
 test the problematic keyboard with a different keyboard and see if it is making any difference.</span></p>

<p>What is your system make and model? &nbsp;I think Dell makes more than one kind of PC.</p>
<p>If the keyboard attached with a cable or built in?</p>
<p>Is the keyboard wireless?</p>
<p>If the keyboard is wired, is it a USB or PS/2 keyboard?</p>
<p>Why are you pressing F8?</p>
<p>What are the several different options you see?</p>
<p>It is unlikely (but not impossible) you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD since Dell does not supply them as a rule. &nbsp;It is more likely that you have some kind of system recovery CD that comes with Dells (they are not the same).</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Repair&nbsp;Install, KB307545 or a complete reinstall of XP are not options for me when it comes to XP problems. &nbsp;I have never done a repair install, used a Restore Point reinstalled XP or&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;KB307545 in my life for this or any other XP problem in
 my life and have fixed or helped fix this error many, many, many, many times. &nbsp;It helps to recreate these kinds of problems and then actually fix them without an XP installation CD to understand what is wrong and not just start trying things.</p>
<p>If your keyboard is not working you need to figure out why and fix that problem. &nbsp;If you have no KB you will not be able to "try" any of the other ideas anyway.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what you have, make your own bootable XP Recovery Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>Then, let's start with this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp;(this includes plug pulling, power buttons and battery removal).</p>
<p>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to start trying to start trying to edit or copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and running chkdsk on your&nbsp;drives may resolve your issue entirely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>
<p>First verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to
 be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>

<p>Hi Divya, thank you for your help. In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>- yes my keyboard was working fine without any issues</p>
<p>- it is a wired keyboard</p>
<p>- no keys work when I hit this issue</p>
<p>I have verified that the keyboard works until I have pressed any key to boot from CD. (Note: I had selected F2 setup to change the boot preference to make sure CD/DVD was the first option) I then get the message</p>
<p>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:</p>
<p>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</p>
<p>You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.</p>
<p>Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair.</p>
<p>No keys work at this point and the only option I have is to switch off the PC.</p>
<p>I'm stuck at this point and will need to take it in to the company I use for tech support. Hopefully they can fix it otherwise I'll be saving up to replace it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi JoseIbarra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; thanks for your help. I have been busy following the steps you provided.</p>
<p>The Keyboard and mouse are wired. The PC is not a Dell as I first thought but was built by a friend and given to me several years ago. It's been working great so far.</p>
<p>I had installed Windows XP and it is the disk that came in the Microsoft Windows XP box that I have used to try and boot from CD. I took your suggestions and downloaded the iso file and burnt them to a CD.</p>
<p>I made to changes to have boot from CD/DVD as the first option.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I got the same result as before. On turning on the PC the keyboard and mouse light up and work. The PC shows it's</p>
<p>autodetecting Pri Master IDE Hard disk</p>
<p>autodetecting Pri Slave Not detected</p>
<p>autodetecting Sec Master ATAPI CDROM</p>
<p>autodetecting Sec Slave Not detected</p>
<p>Then the light on the mouse and keyboard go out. The next screen displays with the message to press any key to boot from CD....</p>
<p>It automatically proceeds and then I get the original message</p>
<p>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:</p>
<p>\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM</p>
<p>You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.</p>
<p>Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair.</p>
<p>So I'm stuck and as I've said to Divya I think I am going to have to&nbsp;take it in to the company I use for tech support. Hopefully they can fix it otherwise I'll be saving up to replace it.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help and pointing me to the sites for the iso and imgburn.</p>

<p>That sounds like the system sees the CD, offers you to boot on it (and you press the any key) and then the system looks at the CD and decides the CD is not a bootable CD and tries to boot on the next dvices which would be your afflicted hard disk.</p>
<p>If you are not sure of what you have in the way of bootable media, you need to make the CD as indicated before and be sure what you have.</p>
<p>Test the new CD in a working system to be sure the rest of the Recovery Console starting process works and you understand how to get to the C:\WINDOWS prompt.</p>
<p>It is good to see the Recovery Console working on a working system and then you will know with certainly your CD it good.&nbsp; You don't have to "do" anything on the test system - just boot on the CD, get to the C:\WINDOWS prompt successfully, type 'exit' and
 remove the CD.&nbsp; Then you will know the CD is good.</p>
<p>There is some rumor or urban legend that when booting into the XP Recovery Console, you can't use a or certain USB keyboards on some certain systems of unspecified manufacturer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the keyboard to work in Recovery Console you must use a PS/2 keyboard.</p>
<p>Some think there is some "legacy" setting to be made in the BIOS to try that "might" work sometimes maybe (I am not a try sometimes maybe person).</p>
<p>If you are using a USB keyboard and have a PS/2 keyboard you can borrow, I would see if it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is what they will do at the computer shop (and then they may tell you you need to reformat your drive and reinstall XP and charge you for that any maybe toss in a new hard drive while they are at it).</p>
<p>Well, good luck whatever you decide to do.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Media Center Pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m. powell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Media Center Pack</h2>
                    <p>On Friday I wiped&nbsp;my current Media Center (12TB system) to build a new Windows 8.1 version.</p>
<p>I finished getting Windows 8.1 Pro and all of its updates installed on Friday and everything was all set to go this morning&nbsp;when I went to add the Media Center Pack and&nbsp;I received the following message:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of October 30, 2015, the Windows 8 and 8.1 Pro Pack (which upgraded Windows 8 Home or 8.1 Home to Windows 8 Pro or 8.1 Pro, with Media Center) and Media Pack (which added Media Center to Windows 8 Pro or 8.1 Pro) are no longer available for purchase from
 Microsoft. Previously purchased feature pack licenses will still work, and valid feature packs may still be available for purchase from third-party retailers. Support for these products is still available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I purchased Windows 8.1 Media Center Pack from Microsoft last year I figured I would just get a replacement key but found out that that is not as easy as you might think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The payment for the online (windows Store) purchase&nbsp;was made to a company named Arvato Digital Services, llc in Valencia, CA. (A Microsoft Contractor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted them and they said that they no longer had a contract with Microsoft and could not help me and for me to contact Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 5 Hours and 15 Minutes with what seemed like every different department at Microsoft to finally get told that the system that they need to use to verify my purchase of the $9.95 Update Pack has been down since Friday and that I would have to call
 back tomorrow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a way to still purchase a Windows 8 Pro Media Pack key or know of another product other than Microsoft to replace Media Center that would be compatible with a&nbsp;Centon Cable Card and using Xbox's for the end client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>HDMI Signal lost on JVC X30 projector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bloodpill  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI Signal lost on JVC X30 projector</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>my Xbox One is connected via HDMI over an Marantz AV8801,</p>
<p>to a Sony X9 KD-65X9005 and JVC X30 projector.</p>
<p>After playing serveral days on the Sony X9 without picture problems,</p>
<p>I tried yesterday to use the JVC X30 for a gaming session.</p>
<p>First everything worked fine....but after about 30min. of gaming (Forza 5),</p>
<p>I suddenly lost signal to the projector. Blackscreen for about 10 sec.</p>
<p>with Forza sound still playing over my speaker setup.</p>
<p>After 10 sec. the picture returns...and I was able to play another 45 min.</p>
<p>Forza. Then...a second signal lost. Blackscreen....now for about 20 sec.</p>
<p>The pictures returned without any actions from me.</p>
<p>Seems like a signal lost over HDMI.</p>

<p>I use a 10 Mtr. HDMI cable to connect the JVC X30 to the Marantz AV8801</p>
<p>and the Xbox One. I didn´t have any issue with signal lost over this connecting</p>
<p>any time. BluRay, Xbox 360, PS3, PC ... everything works over this connecting.</p>

<p>Is there a problem with Xbox One and a long HDMI cable setup?</p>
<p>Or is it maybe another problem regarding the Xbox One?</p>

<p>Thank you...</p>

<p>P.S.</p>
<p>I checked all HDMI cable twice. They are extremly expensive highperformance, high speed</p>
<p>cables. Everything is correct with the cable setup!!</p>

<p>I hooked up my TV Sat Box over HDMI IN passthrough...befor I started to play.</p>
<p>HDMI passthrough work fine, with my TV Sat Box.</p>
<p>I also played Ryse Son of Rome over the JVC. Also....a ingame signal lost</p>
<p>after about 20-30min. For about 10sec. Blackscreen !?!</p>

<p>It's an odd one - I've had something similar when trying to watch a Netflix film, I got audio via the amplifier but a flickering blue and black screen as if it kept losing signal, however, there was no way to bring mine back and unfortunately I had to restart
 the xbox.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, I have a similar setup and do game on it, my total cable length is about 1 metre to the amplifier and 10 metres to the projector (Onkyo and then to a Panasonic projector) - I can tell you that the cost of a HDMI cable is irrelevant
 as long as it's 1.3a or 1.4 specification certified then it'll work like any other HDMI cable as it's just data passing through it, and bits of data can only be "on" or "off".</p>
<p>I would recommend trying a different HDMI cable or try it direct to the projector to see if it's an issue with your amplifier, perhaps try updating the firmware of the amplifier also to see if that solves the problem.</p>

<p>Well...first thank you &nbsp;for your informations.</p>
<p>Everything in my system got the latest firmware.</p>
<p>I just changed the TV and amplifier and updated everything.</p>
<p>I also feel...it cannot be a cable problem, because everything else</p>
<p>works fine without any connection problems in 2D and 3D.</p>
<p>I more thinking about, not connecting the HDMI IN TV setup from</p>
<p>my Sat Box any more. To setup the TV Sat, a have to use a HDMI splitter</p>
<p>between Sat Box, Xbox One and TV. The Xbox One got still a direct</p>
<p>HDMI Line to the amplifier. I tested the TV setup yesterday...and well..</p>
<p>it works...but is no so necessary here in Germany. There are just</p>
<p>no stations that work together with the Xbox or OneGuide. So it´s just</p>
<p>a passthrough signal...and the Xbox One system...feel´s kind of strange</p>
<p>when dealing with a TV Signal. I don ´t need this....and maybe there´s</p>
<p>a HDCP handshake problem, now in this HDMI cable setup.</p>
<p>I will try this and forward the information...if blackscreen doesn´t</p>
<p>happen again.</p>
<p>Overall...there shouldn´t be a problem...but that´s the only way to test</p>
<p>something. If I still got those strange blackscreen...then there must be</p>
<p>something wrong with the HDMI Port on the Xbox...</p>
<p>I also told the Xbox One to handle the Sony TV (mute etc.) Maybe there´s</p>
<p>a kind of ARC channel setup to do this...and when I switch over to the</p>
<p>JVC X30...maybe then something doesn´t work!? Hmmmm....</p>
<p>Btw. Forza 5 is a great game...but omg there is no Nürnburg Ring !?! grrrr...</p>
<p>Ryse Son of Rome...is "the most scripted game" is ever played...but I love it :)</p>

    <title>Following Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Stuck On Lock Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diane e. nelson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Following Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Stuck On Lock Screen &#40;Initial Photo &#34;Spotlight&#34;&#41;&#59; Will Not Go to Login Screen</h2>
                    <p>All the computers in the household received the "pushed" Windows 10 Anniversary update on 8/2/16. &nbsp;My husband's HP computer, which is about four years old, ended up stuck on the Lock Screen or Spotlight Screen (where a photo appears that you have to tap
 your mouse or press a key in order to get to the login screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, it appeared that the keyboard and mouse were not working (their lights were not even on). &nbsp;However, upon interrupting the bootup and accessing the System and Diagnostic screens, I found that there was nothing wrong with the mouse or keyboard;
 they worked fine. &nbsp;I searched the internet to see if anyone else was having this problem with the update. &nbsp;Evidently, a similar problem had occurred on some systems with earlier updates, but none of those solutions worked for this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not wanting to spend the rest of my day or week (or life) on this problem (because I had "real" work to do), I took it to the local computer repair which will remain unnamed, but who is charging about $170 to try to fix the problem caused by Microsoft's
 middle-of-the-night Anniversary Update. &nbsp;They have had the computer since that day and they cannot figure out how to resolve this problem. &nbsp;They called tonight wanting permission to take the computer back to factory defaults and factory installed Windows (which
 would be a really old version of Windows). &nbsp;I said absolutely not.</p>

</p><p>I am furious that the Windows 10 Anniversary Update can render some computers worthless. &nbsp;This is my husband's computer that is having the problem (I have newer computers that are fine with the update). &nbsp;He says he WILL BUY APPLE COMPUTERS from now on. &nbsp;His
 computer was working fine with Windows 10. &nbsp;Now with the Anniversary Update, it is useless unless Microsoft can provide a "fix". &nbsp;I have a computer degree. &nbsp;I understand there may be problems with different computers, but it is unconscionable that a "pushed"
 update can render a computer so useless that even the computer tech shops are unable to bring it back to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, you caused this problem; I expect a resolution.</p>

            Hello, I had the anniversary download on my laptop now when I start my laptop it goes to the blue page with the rolling balls and stays there till I click on ctrl alt del then if I am lucky I get to the page where I am able to sign in with my Microsoft
 password, I put my password in the box press enter and I get the rolling balls again and now since the update version 1607 my password box reappears to have me put my password in again, it did this three times till I ended up turning off my laptop and starting
 all over again, finally after turning on my laptop for the 7'th time and having to do what I told you I got passed the Microsoft sign in page and was able to use my HP laptop, now I am afraid to turn off my laptop thinking I might not get passed the Microsoft
 sign in page... HELP...

            <p>The technicians where I took my husband's computer (which details are described in the begininng post of this thread) tried everything that Jayant Gupta suggested and many, many more diagnostics, et cetera. &nbsp;They had the computer about five days and could
 not fix it except to take it back to the original settings and original old Windows of four-five years ago, which they weren't sure would work either and which I wouldn't let them do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line: &nbsp;my husband had to buy a new computer due to the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. &nbsp;His computer worked fine until the update. &nbsp;Good luck to everyone else who experiences this problem!</p>

            <p>Okay so I had the same exact symptoms. I went from Windows 10 Pro/64 to the Anniversary Edition via Windows Update.</p>
<p>Typing my password after clicking the lock screen went right back to lock screen. Entering the wrong password confirmed that I was using the wrong password.</p>
<p>When I rebooted into safe mode I was greeted by the "Hello - Windows is setting things up. Do not turn off your computer" screens. After 2-3 minutes I was greeted with the Safe Mode desktop.</p>
<p>A little light went off - when I tried logging in before I never saw the "Hello" and such, this tells me that the final setup process was not executing. WHY is beyond my scope of knowledge except that clearly it is a bug. Anyway, I chose to do nothing at
 this point except reboot again. At that point I was able to successfully log in and Windows ran like it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I would suggest MS engineers revisit the process that completes the installation after the updater says it has reached 100% and Windows itself boots for the first time.
</strong></p>
<p>Had this been my only PC or had my systems all been told to auto-update I would have been SOL. My other option would have been to restore my system made from an image last weekend.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Laptop?<br />
<br />
Check with System maker's support, on-line documentation,&nbsp;and/or forums as there probably<br />
are Hotkeys that enable and disable&nbsp;the touchpad functions. <br />
<br />
<p>Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with TouchPad entries)<br />
and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
This utility also helps to control the TouchPad :<br />
<br />
TouchFreeze<br />

<h3> seeker336  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 suddenly stopped playing mp3s from my hard drive&#47;library. __C00D1199</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, I purchased two albums from Amazon Mp3 site. when I tried to play them after they installed, I recieve the following error message: "Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the
 codec that was used to compress the file."</p>
<p>Trying to troubleshoot, I find I can no longer play streaming media from the internet that uses m3u files. I get the same error message.</p>
<p>Further troubleshooting, i tried to play known good mp3 songs stored on my hard drive and filed as a part of the WMP12 library. Get same error message.</p>
<p>There is apparently no problem with the file itself, as I am able to play the same files in the HP media player.</p>
<p>I have tried to run the WMP troubleshooter and it reports it could not find any faults.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I need to uninstall Windows Media Player 12 and reinstall? To reinstall, can I download from a Microsoft site?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can provide.</p>
<p>Seeker</p>

<p><span>Hi Seeker,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since troubleshooter does not detect any issue with Windows Media Player (WMP), I’d recommend you to follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Clear the WMP database and rebuild the same</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Exit Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click<strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong>, and then click<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select all the files in the folder, right-click and select<strong>Delete</strong> to delete all the files.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> You do not have to delete the folders
 that are in this folder.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Restart Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> Windows Media Player automatically
 rebuilds the database.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Exit
 Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong>,
 type <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong>, and then click<strong>OK</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 the<strong>Media Player</strong> folder, right-click and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> Windows Media Player automatically
 rebuilds the database. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, refer:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Disable and enable WMP</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To disable and enable WMP using the<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong>, refer the following Microsoft article:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Turn Windows features on or off</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Windows Media Player would be listed under<strong>Media Features.
</strong>Uncheck the same and restart the computer to disable WMP. Rechecking and restarting the computer would enable WMP.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As the game worked fine in WindowsXP, you can try to install Windows XP Mode in Windows 7 and install the game in XP Mode.
<br />
<b><br />
Note:</b> It will only run on Windows 7 Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate editions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows Virtual PC</strong> provides the capability to run multiple Windows environments such as Windows XP Mode from your Windows 7 desktop.<br />
<br />
Windows Virtual PC requires a CPU with the Intel® Virtualization Technology or AMD-V™ feature turned on. This feature must be enabled in the system BIOS. For more details on the same visit the below link:

<h2>            High CPU and Memory&#47;Unistack SvcGroup and Outlook Mail App Not Synching</h2>
                    <p>Was having the issue of my laptop running hard after last update. Checked Task Manager and saw this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d66f4a45-bfcc-41bc-a65f-450efebcf720" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So did a bit of digging and found a regedit fix:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Use regedit and disable the service from regedit,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">for
 this go to:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\OneSyncSvc]</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">change the value for "Start" to 4 (original is 2)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This will disable the service and no more errors</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This worked to stop the service from running but also made it so my Mail App wouldn't sync, send or receive emails.
 Did not make the connection until after I was on the phone with second level help and did a Win10 install, no luck. Tech said my Windows 10 was extremely corrupted and wanted to do factory reset of my machine........ I have too many programs and files to have
 to take care of to do that, plus, it's just the email app so no real big deal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I'd rather use web mail or a competitor app than have my computer running extremely hard, so I did the fix.</span></p>
<p>Hopefully MS will look into this and have a fix soon. I hope this info helps!</p>

            <p>I, too, have concluded that the Unistack Service Group results in high continuous CPU usage on my laptop (around 30%). I have also found that the&nbsp;Service is started&nbsp;with Windows 10&nbsp;Mail or Windows 10 Calendar and will continue until the&nbsp;Mail&nbsp;and/or Calendar
 App is closed. This&nbsp;continuous high load causes my laptop to run hot. </p>
<p>There are several threads on this forum relating to this issue, but I've not seen a fix that will allow the Apps to function as intended without resulting in the Unistack Service causing an &nbsp;overheating problem. Additionally, I have seen no indication that
 Microsoft has acknowledged the problem and is working on it.</p>
<p>My solution is to not use the Mail and Calendar Apps, using Windows Live Mail instead which is a more robust application and syncs with all my calendars and mailboxes without creating a high continuous load on the CPU.</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially did the regedit fix (see above) and just used a third party mail app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after the November update, my mail started working and the regedit went back to it's default '2' and all is now normal. Using MS Mail app and calendar.</p>

            <p>Interesting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The November update did&nbsp;not fix my problem. In fact, the November update along with KB 3093594 seemed to break my Windows Live Mail 2012, which I have since fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that now, when the Windows 10 Mail App or Calendar is started, the Unistack Service Group starts in an effort to sync various accounts, but it unable to complete the action and it just keeps running. Perhaps looking for an account or app I don't
 have or is corrupted.&nbsp;Anyway, this is my guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Rolling, my questions&nbsp;for you are,&nbsp;do you have Office 365 and/or Outlook.com(<strong>Preview</strong>)? I have neither. How about Skype? Again, no for me. Can you think of another app that the service may be trying to sync when Mail is started? Did you
 apply KB3093594?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the fault lies within the Mail or Calendar Apps. Both sync in the background and their live tiles display appropriately. It is only when either of these Apps&nbsp;is actually started that the Unistack Service Group starts, creating a high&nbsp;continuous
 load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done the regedit fix since simply not using&nbsp;either app works and I am happy with Windows Live Mail, though I am afraid MS will discontinue support for it soon and therefore would like to get this&nbsp;fixed before WLM is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I welcome any suggestions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As an after thought, perhaps it is my WLM installation that is causing the problem. Maybe the OneSync Service is trying to sync it and can't?

            <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have office/outlook/preview or Skype. Can't think of anything else that would've done it, I just assumed it was mail because mail wasn't synching. I did the regedit, forgot about it, then noticed that I was getting mail after Nov update, checked
 my regedit and it was back to normal...... I googled KB3093594 and found people are having a bunch of issues......</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I really don't know what to suggest because my use was at 98% no matter what I was doing. I just googled it and found that fix. I'm no computer expert so I'll chalk it up to just getting lucky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I can't be of any more help.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info, Rolling.</p>
<p>I'll just keep plugging away till I find it.</p>
<p>Yeah, that KB309354 was/is a real mess. Took me several days to get my&nbsp;Live Mail straightened out after mistakenly applying that update. It still could be part of the problem, I suppose.</p>
