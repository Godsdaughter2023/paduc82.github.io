<h2>            We can not play Gears of War 2 Online over Xbox LIVE</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have Xbox One. I purchased Gears of War 2 and Xbox Live Gold membership. My friend has Xbox One S and did also purchase Gears of War 2 and Xbox Live Gold.</p>
<p>We both have the same problem when we try to play together or online. Whenever we're trying to switch from "System Link" to "Public Xbox Live" or "Custom Xbox Live" we get this error:</p>
<p>"Your current gamer profile settings do not allow playing online games. To continue, All signed in gamer profiles must be allowed to play online"</p>
<p>We tried everything without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other Xbox One games including Forza Horizon and they work fine online.</p>
<p>Any solution?</p>

<p>It might be, that the emulated Xbox 360 doesn't properly recognize your Xbox Gold membership.</p>
<p>Go to the Xbox One Settings, and under the storage settings, clear the Xbox 360 storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Gears of War 2, and press both the View and Menu buttons (the small buttons left and right of the Xbox button) to bring up the Xbox 360 guide.&nbsp;</p>

            Could be that whenever you load this particular title you have to be sure the 360 emulator connects to LIVE. Sometimes you have to do this manually.

<p>Thank you all for your support.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we got it to work.</p>
<p>We tried all the combinations of console's "Location" and "Region" until we got it to work. Weird fix, but it worked. For both of us.</p>
<p>I think the game was somehow region locked.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I understand the situation. If you have mistakenly entered the wrong name for your child's account,&nbsp;you can change it by accesing&nbsp;his/her account&nbsp;via
<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>.
<br />
<br />
Once logged in using the child account, look for <strong>Name</strong> under <strong>
Account information</strong> and then click <strong>Change</strong> on the right side.<br />
Enter the name and then click <strong>Save.</strong><br />
<br />
If you need further assistance, feel free to reply on this post.<br />
<br />
<span>Best regards,<br />
<br />
Eugene R.<br />

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi, I'm trying to install windows seven on a fresh PC (NoOperatingSystem) and the installer keeps on hanging at extracting windows files (0%)</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I've been looking online for help and I've come across some 'Fixes' I've turned off all floppy devices because I've got no floppy drives. I've disabled USB legacy support, After disabling this the installer's startup
 has been mega fast but it still hangs on&nbsp;extracting&nbsp;windows files. I've heard about removing RAM sticks to fix this. Is this true? It's just I'm very nervous about removing a RAM stick. Also I've heard that I should disable SpeedStep or HyperTransport. Speedstep
 I know is for intel and I'm running AMD. I've looked in my BIOS but I cant find how to disable it.</span></strong></p>
<p>My PC:<br />
System Manufacturer: BIOSTAR Group<br />
System Model: TA770E<br />
BIOS: Default System BIOS<br />
Processor: AMD Athlon™ II X4 630 Processor (4 CPUs), ~2.8GHz<br />

<p>Sorry, a poor choice of words on my part. What I'm saying is that wherever you downloaded the file from gave you a bad file.</p>
<p>You can prove this for certain as follows:</p>
<p>Eash .ISO file has a "CRC" and "HASH" which is used as a means of validating the file was not corrupted during the download process. There is a utility you can use to calculate the CRC and HASH value of your Windows 7.iso file. The 64-Bit and 32-bit version
 each have their own unique value which I've included below. Also I'ver provided a link to a utility name&nbsp;"HashCalc" and the instructions on how to use it.&nbsp;If the values returned by HashCalc do not match what I've posted then you know for sure what you have
 is either a corrupted or Hacked&nbsp;file.</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;there should be one&nbsp;.ISO file for the 32-bit version and another for the 64-bit version.</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate (x86) - DVD (English) <br />
File Name: en_windows_7_ultimate_x86_dvd_x15-65921.iso&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.32 GB (2,501,894,144 bytes)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SHA1: 5395DC4B38F7BDB1E005FF414DEEDFDB16DBF610&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ISO/CRC: C1C20F76<br />

<p>---------------------------</p>
<p>Download and install SlavaSoft's HashCalc<br />
HASH, CRC, AND HMAC CALCULATOR<br />
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</a></p>
<p>For Windows .ISO file just place check marks in the SHA1 and&nbsp; CRC32 boxes.</p>
<p>In the main HashCalc Window the 'Data format' box located in the upper left should be set to "File"</p>
<p>In the 'Data' field click on the&nbsp; ... box located in the upper right and then click 'Cancel' if you get an 'Insert Disk' window pop up.</p>
<p>After you click cancle you should see a 'Find' window. Use this to navigate to the folder where your .ISO file is stored and click on the file.</p>
<p>You should now see the .ISO file you clicked on listed in the 'File name' box located near the bottom of the 'Find' window.</p>
<p>Now click the 'Open' button. The Data field should now show the directory/folder path and the name of the .ISO file you selected.</p>
<p>With only the SHA1 and CRC32 boxes checked (Do not place check marks in any other boxes as this can slow down the time it take to calculate the values) click the 'Calculate' button located at the bottom of the main HashCalc window.</p>
<p>It will take anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds for the calculation to complete and the SHA1 and CRC32 data values to be displayed.</p>
<p>These values are not case sensitive, so a lower case 'a' is the same as an upper case 'A' as far as the results are concerned.</p>

            <p>Windows is seeing it as a program to run rather than open Publisher and then load the file. What do you mean by "Windows gave me"? To the best of my knowledge there are no Publisher files as a part of Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings, System, Default Apps, Choose default applications by file type. Make sure .pub (the default extension for Publisher files) is set for the Publisher executable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening unknown files is one of the fastest ways to load Malware.</p>

</span><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss.
 A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error.</span></p>
<p><span>This error often occurs when the driver of any device is not installed properly. If you have recently installed any new
 software, check to see if it is properly installed. Check for updated drivers on the manufacturer's website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Let try these steps and check:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Log on to the computer manufacturer website and update the latest chipset drivers, BIOS (Basic Input\Output System).
 Also, check for other device driver updates.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>Updating BIOS can be a complicated process, and if an error occurs, your computer could be rendered inoperable. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions exactly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run check disk</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to go through the section ‘Repair a drive’ of the article to perform check disk. Here is the link for your reference.</span></p>
<p><span>One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the hard drive. Windows includes features to help optimize the different types of drives that PCs use
 today. No matter which type of drive your PC uses, Windows automatically chooses the optimization that's right for your drive.</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to the section "<strong>To repair a drive to perform check disk</strong>".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Improve performance by optimizing your hard drive</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/improve-performance-optimizing-hard-drive</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Important Note</span></strong><span>: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive
 when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For any help related to this issue or any Windows issue you may always post on the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>

    <title>Update from Window 8 to Windows 8.1 put a virus on my computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g tmethe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update from Window 8 to Windows 8.1 put a virus on my computer completely messsed up my computer HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>* Virus Alert!*</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(I have moved my thread since so many have told me I probably have a virus and everything my computer is doing it's acting like a virus. )</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I have a&nbsp; <span>HP Pavilion G4 Notebook PC (64 bit) and it originally came with&nbsp;</span><span>Windows 8 which ran perfectly up until I began getting all of the Windows 8.1 updates message that came up constantly and were so annoying.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I"m not exactly sure what happened at the time, but everytime I go through my exact problem, everyone's first response&nbsp;is
<strong>"it sounds like you have some new sort of virus disguised as the new 8.1 update".
</strong>Is it possible to get a virus from a Microsoft or Windows update that didn't give me the choice to update in the first place? I was also told many people not just people who had that Window8.1 update but anyone who has a Windows 7 through current Windows
 computer has or has the potential to get this virus. I have had this post up for a while. I have tried so many methods to contact Microsoft and Windows for help and never have heard back.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now there are a few key points here that I want to point out:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>#1</strong>. We had software running at the time to protect us from getting a virus.
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>#2.&nbsp;</strong>These constant messages were popping&nbsp;</span>up so frequently it was annoying.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;neither of us changed the settings but our computer was changed to allow and download this update all by itself.&nbsp; However this happened has&nbsp;turned
 out to be the Biggest mistake EVER. We want to make it perfectly clear that our laptop ran perfectly prior to this 8.1 update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>#3.</strong>We have never EVER done an update which reeked havoc on our computers that baiscally paralyzed our system making it virtually useless ( btw our laptop is just a few days from being a year old and&nbsp;has not hasn't accumulated many of hours
 of use). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>#4.&nbsp;</strong> I didn't know companies you purchase your notebooks/ laptops from no longer send the back discs!
</p>
<p><strong>#5.</strong> We cannot believe we weren't WARNED prior to downloading the Windows 8.1 update&nbsp; that if it reeked havoc that you would need to make backup cd's or back up your system or your'd be completely SOL because it would be the only way to fix
 the computely Due to it&nbsp;no longer to function properly. Which IS exactly what happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Now my computer basically isn't allowing me to do much of anything aside from turning it on, and a few programs but&nbsp;it's a hit or miss as to&nbsp;how long it allows them to run for or if they will even run or force close.</li><li>The only way I'm able to gain access to the&nbsp;"Control Panel" is by&nbsp;by pointing the cursor to the upper right corner and&nbsp;dragging it down opening that panel and typing&nbsp;"Control Panel"&nbsp; into the "search" tab. Even when doing this, If and when the control panel
 screen actually pops up, it shuts down almost as quickly as it opens up. When it does this the computer acts as though it is going to restart but it doesn't, the screen goes blue, then black. Sometimes it just freezes. Either way anything and everything I
 had that was opened up is now gone and shut down as if it was never opened up. Sometimes I have to sit and wait for long periods of time before it allows me use the restart&nbsp;tab or it stays frozen and I have to do a hard reboot. Other times I get a blue screen
 that says updates are in progress and it tells me Not to shut down the computer as it updates. However, nothing ever changes or fixes any of these issues which all began happening with this Windows 8.1 update.</li><li>In that upper right corner tab when you pull that down in the "Settings" tab the "Control Panel" tab should be under that settings tab as listed in order: ""Desktop", "Control Panel", "Personalization", "Pc Info", "Help". Unfortunately, now after update,
 the Control Panel tab is missing more than 80% of the time.</li><li>I've tried "Search" and "File" to&nbsp;open other features in my computer to check security, do updates, try to fix or find what problems I may be having. However, it shuts everything down. I even had "Fix It" downloaded for my other laptop and ran that and
 IT was even shut down. I came to Windows.com and Microsoft.com on the laptop that I'm talking about but it kept shutting Internet explorer down. I've attempted to send this message and&nbsp;scan my laptop and find updates to fix the 8.1 update, but it merely shuts
 down. </li><li>While I was typing this message on the laptop I'm speaking of, it suddenly began having keyboard and typing issues. It would not allow me to move the cursor w mouse&nbsp;without highlighting everything (not even eith directional keys). It wasn't on caps lock
 and suddenly began typing as if I was holding down the shift key no matter what we tried!</li><li>I've attempted to open up the "Task bar" to shut down programs when they begin to lag but it's also doing much of the same thing that the control panel is doing. The computer screen goes blue, then black then everything that was open is now gone as if it
 was never open. OR the "Task Bar"&nbsp;doesn't open up at all or it freezes up the compter or it opens and closes just as quickly or the Windows Update Blue screen pops up like I explained before above re: control panel.&nbsp; All of this began happening immediately
 after the Windows 8.1 update and NONE of this happened prior.</li><li>My Desktop icons also have seemed to moved on their own. They keep moving to the right-side of the screen, although countless times I have reset this back the the left side.
</li><li>There is One game I play that is installed on my computer and I can't even play that game. It is so laggy or freezes it is ridiculous. (Wizard101) or flat out won't play or shuts down constantly.
</li><li>There are many programs we need to use and open for insurance and private reasons that we aren't able to get to at this time. We need help please.
</li><li>We did a <em>System restore and THAT didn't fix it either</em>! </li><li>After system restore didn't fix issues or set up and It continually shut down the notebook, I recently attempted to see if Microsoft Essentials would work or if I could get into it. It shows that all the lights are green but it won't allow me in to change
 any of my setting to change what software I want running. I t looks like someone else has access to my computer but I can't be sure! I need help plz!!
</li></ul>
<p><strong>#6. </strong>I did contact HP Support and sit here hoping they contact me. I still hope to hear from Microsoft support. it shows Windows Defender is trying to update but when scanning it doesn't get more than a few hundred files done and it stops!
 UGH! </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>#7.</strong> I called Best Buy and it will cost over $200 to have them fix this and IT is ridiculous to have to pay them for something we are hoping you are willing to fix considering this never should have happened with a simple update. Besides,
 our laptop isn't touch screen and I don't see the benefits anyways. Aside from the fact that there is no way this ever should have wiped out our computer so please please help!
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">One huge reason we use this computer is to Video Chat via Skype and FB with our only two children both of which are serving in the military. Now since we don't see them except once a year this is extremely important to me. Now I
 can't even do this! Please, please help me and fix my laptop! Nothing was wrong with it before this darn update!
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Clearly I'm not a techy person I just need help in getting this fixed please.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>#8.</strong> One more thing, after Windows 8.1 installed, it forced me to sign in to Microsoft account. Well it didn't explain that it was now the only way to get into my computer! I now understand I can set a 4 digit code to get in but I do not
 want one on my computer at all at this point. Especially considering that it isn't typing properly! Everytime I get on it after the update, I discover something else aggravating that this update has caused.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically we are now having so many issues after the&nbsp; Windows 8.1 update / <strong>
VIRUS </strong>&nbsp;that we aren't able to use our newest laptop (and considering the few&nbsp;hours that it's been used is like new). We loved the Windows 8 version and IF we had known or had been warned that it would require us to&nbsp;backup Windows 8 and all other software
 we have on our computer or backup cd's or software to remove this update we never EVER would have done it. We didn't even know these newer computers didn't come with the software because&nbsp;Windows 8 and other software didnt send a cd or backup usb or anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I would have been warned to check and backup and NOT allowed to go further for WINDOWS 8.1 update due to this problem we now face and auto updates wasn't allowed either due to this problem&nbsp; then we would have checked and had the chance to&nbsp;back up the
 files and Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest question now is..... Now what do we do? </p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point with so many issues, I would think the easiest\cheapest, and possibly fastest &nbsp;thing, would be to just order the Disk Set or USB Flash drive to restore your machine to factory condition from HP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a CD\DVD drive, the Disks may be around $20...</p>
<p>If you don't, you will need a bootable Flash Drive, and I don't have a clue how much they are...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can assure you that it would be less than $200, and probably less than $50...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to the support page for your model you should see a link to place the order, or a phone number to call...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... If you ever get around to the Win 8.1 Update again.... When you get to the page where you are supposed to login with your Microsoft Account... Click on "Create New Account" near the bottom, and on the screen that comes up, select "Continue Using Existing"</p>

            <p>Hi G TMethe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really love Windows 8, you can do a factory reset of your whole laptop to revert back to the way it was when you first bought it. Beware though, if Windows 7 was installed when the PC was brand new, then you will be reverted back to Windows 7, not
 Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot provide you with specific instructions on how to restore your PC until you give me the PC manufacturer and model. So for example:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP ProBook 371 series</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, be aware that you will need to reinstall the programs that <em>you </em>
installed after you bought the PC. Also, Windows 8.1 does let you use a standard, local account, just like the one Windows 8 let you use. The option to do so is hidden, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what happens, and don't forget to mark this reply as helpful if it helped.</p>

<p>It has recently come to my attention that WHEN Microsoft&nbsp; allowed that Windows 8.1 update to go out all over, the reason my computer is still messed up is because SOMEHOW my computer along with anyone else runs Windows 7 through the current operating systems
 has a virus!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This virus will take over your entire computer, no longer allowing YOU access to your own files and IT shuts down your firewalls and all security software YOU may have had.

<h2>            Random pop through speakers, headphones, even when I&#39;m connected via VPN.</h2>
                    I'm getting a random popping sound from my computer. &nbsp;I've timed it and it can be as few as seconds to even minutes, completely random. &nbsp;I know it's not hardware because I put in a new sound card, changed speakers, got new headphones, I even connected
 to the computer from work via VPN, no matter what the computer pops (I hear the pop on the remote computer when connected via VPN). &nbsp;The drivers for the sound card are good for windows 8, and there is no pop when using the same drivers on a different windows
 8 computer.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm at my wits end, anyone encountered this before? &nbsp;I can't stand hearing this popping any longer, it's ruining my games, movies, and just about anything that requires sound.</div>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Download
 and install the latest flash player<span>&nbsp;</span>and Java from the links below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Install Java in Internet Explorer:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Java-in-Internet-Explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Install-Java-in-Internet-Explorer</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Restart the browser and check if you’re able to play the game fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 installing flash player doesn’t fix the issue, follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A: Clear cached data in Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p><span>To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet files or in other cached information
 that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Internet Explorer 8.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Safety, and then click Delete Browsing History.</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In Delete Browsing History area, click Delete.
</span></p>
<p><span>A progress bar is displayed to indicate that the browsing history is being cleared. After this process is complete, test Internet Explorer to verify
 that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>B: Reset security settings for Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p><span>If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying certain Web sites. To determine whether
 an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default security settings. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Tools, and then click Internet Options.
</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click the Security tab.
</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>After you do this, restart the browser and check if you’re able to play the game fine.</span></p>

<p>I'm fairly antisocial, so wouldn't have a need for it; though might try it out just for giggles to see who it would match me up with. Who knows...Akame and I might turn out to be besties. With that being said, I can see a lot of people loving such an app.

<p>I doubt I use this app, because I have enough friends on my list that I dont game with. I should give them a shot first before other strangers. I can also see this being turned into a pseudo dating service.</p>

<h2>            Purchases Disappearing from Billing&#47;Purchase History. Effecting Rewards Stats.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I need some help. Over the past couple of months I have noticed that my number of total "Paid Marketplace Downloads" has been shrinking something that SHOULDN'T be possible. Over the Past couple of months i have seen it Shrink from 62 (March),&nbsp; to 48
 (April), now as of today its they are just 47. I waited couple months to see if they updated &amp; added the purchases I made &amp; they did not.</p>
<p>In that space of time (March to now) I have made no fewer than 30 purchases off the Xbox Live Marketplace. However none of them showed up in my stats even though i was Awarded the Triple Play Bonus Points Last month FOR spending 800msp, last month. Meaning
 not only were my purchases disappearing but my new purchases were not registering. I checked my purchase history on billing.microsoft.com only to make the alarming discovery that purchases previously in my billing history have ALSO Disappeared. And I don't
 mean a few i mean the&nbsp; MAJORITY of them. However ALL of said purchases are are still in my Purchase History in my account on Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Eventually they are removed from billing.microsoft.com after a long period of time. There should be nothing to worry about as all access to your content is available through the Download History.</p>

<p>Losing access is not my worry... its the fact that they are *** up my stats on XBL Rewards. Also I don't think its that. My oldest purchases are only a year old roughly &amp; that doesn't explain why that almost none of my recent purchases from the past 3 months
 are showing same, nor why most of the ones between the newest listed transaction and the oldest listed one are missing either .</p>

<p>Ken, you can only see purchase history for a year back on billing.microsoft.com . That's not important to the rewards however. Go to rewards.xbox.com and you will see the total rewards points earned there and what transactions counted towards the rewards
 program. </p>

<p>That is what I am telling you. It is my rewards.xbox.com accounts screwed up purchase stats that tipped me off to the fact that almost all of my purchase history from the past year is missing in my billing.microsoft.com account. My rewards account's stats
 are not reflecting/recording my purchases from the past 3 at months (at least) even though I received credit and points for them in the offers. Not only that but it is losing purchases that it ALREADY credited. First it was at 62 purchases. The next month
 it was at 48. NOW it is at 47. I am Also aware that billing.microsoft.com only keeps record of the past year. However THAT is the problem... my purchase history there for the past year is missing almost ALL of my purchases from the past year. However oddly
 enough my Xbox.com Purchase History is complete and intact unlike rewards.xbox,com &amp; billing.microsoft.com. So some error on both rewards.xbox.com &amp; billing.microsoft.com has CLEARLY fouled up in your Database on both of those sites. My guess is due to the
 fact that one receives its data &amp; stats from the other.</p>

already did</a>. They were the ones that directed me here. That's why i edited my OP and posted here. This is a billing issue not a rewards issue. the rewards issue is symptomatic &amp; resultant of the billing issue.</p>
<p>I said that it was my Rewards account that tipped me off to my screwed up purchase history.&nbsp; I'm saying my purchase history on billing.microsoft.com is Screwed up... almost all my purchases from the past year are GONE... however some of them are still there
 but in between those purchases is are HUGE chunks of missing transactions. I'm saying that error's in my stats on my rewards account are because of the huge chunks of missing transactions in my billing account which the STATS are based off of.<br />
<br />
I know that transactions are deleted after a year. The problem is the missing transactions are not a year old and there are OLDER transactions that are still in there. Meaning there are HUGE chunks of missing data from the purchase history of my billing account.
 And i believe THAT is what is effecting my rewards account stats. I am receiving credit for my purchases on my rewards account just fine. However however those purchases are not showing up in stats DUE to this missing data OF those purchases in the purchase
 history of my billing account. I believe that once THAT is sorted my. I had a similar problem a month or two back caused by a similar issue CAUSED by errors in my purchase history located in my billing account.</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/29/p/205852/1068010.aspx#1068010</p>
<p>That happened back in february but didnt get sorted until a month or so later due to the related waiting period. Essentially after the waiting period I had to call in to report that I still hadn't recieved the promotion and I received a replacement token
 as a result in the following email:</p>
<p>Dear Kenneth Eaton:</p>
<p>We have received your service request regarding your Promotional Microsoft Points which were not delivered as a part of your Xbox Live Subscription.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We do apologize for any inconvenience in the<span>&nbsp; </span>delay of receiving your Promotional points.</p>

<p>ok got the billing. microsoft.com issue resolved via phone technician. I was looking in the wrong section of that page was looking under billing when i should have been looking under points. As for the purchase history under my gamertag. I ALREADY noted
 here in this forum that it was fine &amp; everything in order.</p>
<p>However that still leaves my Rewards.com screwed up, only now I have no idea of what could be causing error. Last month my rewards stats showed that I had made 48 "paid marketplace downloads:. &nbsp;Since then i have made no less than 20 paid marketplace downloads...
 however none of them have shown in my stats... in fact my stats for paid market place downloads have decreased are less than they were the month before. They are now at 47. In April they were 48. Prior to that they totaled 62. Since the time they read 62 until
 now, i have made around 30 Paid Marketplace Downloads... however they are not showing in my stats for "paid marketplace downloads" have actually gone down.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t install Dell DataSafe Local Backup under Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chestergraves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install Dell DataSafe Local Backup under Vista</h2>
                    <p>I have acquired a used Dell Inspiron 530 desktop computer.<br />
I did not receive any installation DVDs with the computer. <br />
The computer has Vista SP1 installed.&nbsp; I would like to do a complete restore back to factory.<br />
There is restore partition on the disk drive.&nbsp; The restore partition appears to be intact, including a Factory.wim file.<br />
I have not been able to launch the restore feature.&nbsp; I have tried both the “outside of window” and the “inside of windows” methods described on various pages.
<br />
<br />
I have booted the computer with F8 to get to “Advanced Boot Options”.&nbsp; I select “Repair Your Computer” from the list.
<br />
The “System Recovery Options” screen appears. Options include &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Startup Repair <br />
System Restore<br />
System Image Recovery<br />
Windows Memory Diagnostic<br />
Command Prompt<br />
<br />
There is no listing for<br />
‘Windows Complete PC Restore’ or ‘Dell Factory Image Restore” <br />
In other word, no way to do a factory restore.<br />
<br />
Within Vista, DataSafe Local Backup does not appear in programs list.&nbsp; It does not appears to be installed on the computer.
<br />
<br />
Dell makes DataSafeLocalBackup_Basic.exe available for download, at this site: <br />
http://dslbdownload.datasafelocalbackup.com/dsldownload-en.html<br />
When I try to install it, it stops with an error which says “Dell DataSafe Local Backup can only be installed on systems running Windows 7".
</p>
<p><br />
Is there a previous version of “DataSafe Local Backup” that runs under Vista?&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Is it available for download?<br />
Is there some other way to access the restore partition and set Vista back to factory?<br />
</p>

            <p>One more time Bill:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this more, and I have discovered that there is a Microsoft Utility that can access a restore partition and do a factory reset.<br />
</p>
<p>The utility is imagex.exe.</p>
<p>It is contained in Windows6.1-KB2525084-v2-x86.cab and it is available for download at http://thehotfixshare.net/board/index.php?showtopic=15932</p>
<br />
<p>It does not erase the original partition and data.&nbsp; Instead, it reinstalls Windows but keeps what ever else is already on the partition.&nbsp; It creates a new Windows directory and stores the previous Windows directory in a file called Windows.old.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my first attempt, I created a functioning, but cluttered and confusing Vista partition with bits of the old and new installations.</p>
<p>My goal was to create a factory reset with none of the old files or data.&nbsp; So deleted the primary windows partition and replaced it with a empty primary partition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I started the computer with a windows 7 installation DVD.&nbsp; I do not have any Vista installations DVDs.&nbsp; The Win7 DVD worked. &nbsp; From there I went to "Repair your computer" and then to "System Recovery Options" and selected "command prompt".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The syntax is like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>e:\imagex /apply d:\dell\image\factory.wim 1 c:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where c:\ is the target partition, d:\ is the location of the restore partition, e:\ is the location of imagex.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a small "e" partition on the disc drive to keep imagex separate from the restore and installation partitions.&nbsp; Probably not necessary.&nbsp; Afterwords, I erased it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore took about 15 minutes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>At first the restored partition would not boot.&nbsp; I got a NTLDR missing error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again started the computer with the Windows 7 installation DVD and back to "System Recovery Options" and selected "Startup Repair".&nbsp; It found the problem and fixed it.&nbsp; After that I was able to boot normally.&nbsp; I now had a factory Vista partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here a page that describes it in more detail.</p>
<p>http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/software-os/f/3524/t/19494817</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked with a Dell restore partition.&nbsp; I do not know if it works with restore partitions on different brands of computer</p>
<p>

<h2>            My Fourth Monitor Disables My Other Monitors</h2>
                    So sometimes I plug in a fourth monitor into my PC, and it used to configure automatically without much problem. However since I have upgraded to windows 10 whenever I plug in my fourth monitor my 2 non-main monitor's are completely disabled and cannot
 be detected by both windows and AMD Control Catalyst. If I unplug this monitor everything reverts back to normal. Any idea how I can have all 4 working like they used to?

<p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you plugged in the device, did you get prompted to install a driver? If so, there must be a need for you to install a corresponding driver for your HKS racing controller that is compatible with Windows 7. For this, you may need to contact HKS racing
 controller manufacturer and ask for the compatible drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If upon plug-in, there was no response at all, then you can try a different USB port. If you're still unable to install it, you may have to check whether that USb controller supports Windows 7 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're here if you have more queries.</p>
<p>

    <title>Bug&#58; Microphone doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work after disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coolarj10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Microphone doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work after disconnecting Windows 10 streaming</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I noticed a bug and would like to see if anyone else has been able to reproduce this issue.</p>

<p>Problem/Issue: If I play a game with a headset adapter while streaming to my Windows PC and then disconnect streaming to continue playing on the TV, the Xbox does not recognize my microphone when I reconnect my controller.</p>
<p>Steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I turned on my Xbox One console from within my Surface Pro 2's Windows 10 Xbox app.</p>
<p>2) I connext my Xbox One controller to my PC via a USB cable. I've also already attached the Headset Adapter and Xbox One Gaming Headphones w/ built in mic.</p>
<p>3) I play Rainbow Six Siege via Windows 10 streaming, and the audio and microphone functionality is delivered straight to my headphones via the Headaet adapter.</p>
<p>4) I disconnect streaming and disconnect my controller from my PC. My controller's light keeps flags if, yet it hasn't reconnected to the Xbox One (I'm within 10 feet of the Xbox One), so I remove the controller's batteries and reinsert them. I them re-sync
 my controller to my Xbox One.</p>
<p>5) Now, my Xbox One doesn't notice when I speak into my mic. It's as if the microphone is disabled, even though the in-game audio is coming through my gaming headphones/headset just fine. Only the microphone part doesn't work. If I disconnect and reconnect
 the Xbox One adapter, the problem is not fixed. I closed my Rainbow Six Siege application/game, turned off the console, and turned it back on. Then, the microphone resumed normal functionality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hopefully I described the situation properly. I'll double check to see how reproducible this is. The reason this is a problem is because if I try to continue playing on a TV after I was initially streaming, the microphone doesn't work. This makes it difficult
 to continue playing in the same game, since you'd have to quit in order to get the microphone to work again.</p>

<p>Thank you Bestlano!</p>
<p>Another issue I'm running into with the headset adapter + windows 10 streaming:</p>
<p>I docked my surface pro 2 into the docking station, which has a wired PC microphone plugged in. When I start playing (Rainbow Six Siege), the game audio is coming through my headset adapter (via the Xbos Stereo Headset), but the Windows 10 Xbox app is utilizing
 my wired PC microphone instead of the Stereo Headset/Headset Adapter. I can't figure out a way to force the streaming app to use the microphone plugged into my controller...</p>
<p>(not sure if I should document this issue in another thread)</p>
<p>It seems there may be some minor issues between the Windows 10 Xbox streaming application when used with the Xbox Headset Adapter.</p>

<p>Update: Regarding issue #2 (Headaet adapter issues while connecting Xbox One controller to Windows 10 PC for streaming)</p>
<p>I discovered that:</p>
<p>1) The headset adapter is just treated like an additional headphone and microphone under the Windows audio settings.</p>
<p>2) To select which microphone to use (e.g. PC mic or microphone attached to Headset Adapter), set the desired microphone as your default device by right clicking volume/speaker icon at the bottom right of the taskbar and click "Recording devices."
</p>
<p>3) Odd behavior or malfunctions (e.g. headet microphone not working when streaming to Wkndows 10) may occur when there are too many USB plugged into the computer, causing insufficient USB controller resources.</p>
<p>When I plugged the Xbox One controller directly into my Surface Pro 2, the microphone automatically worked fine. When I docked my Surface Pro 2 into its docking station and plugged the Xbox One controller into the docking station's USB port, my headset adapter/Stereo
 Headset's microphone was recognized, but the decibel meter would not detect any sound when spoken into. Occasionally, I would receive a "insufficient USB controller resources" error. This could also be an issue related to connecting the Xbox One controller
 to a USB hub.</p>
<p>Regarding issue #1 (headset adapter/stereo headset's microphone not working on Xbox One after disconnecting from streaming), I will see if I experience it again to isolate the issue.</p>

<p>Okay, I just discovered an issue:</p>
<p>The Xbox Stereo Headset's microphone does NOT work when connected via a USB hub, even if it's the only device attached to the USB hub. The microphone is detected, but it does not detect any sound in the volume meter.</p>
<p>As soon as I plug my Xbox One controller directly into the Surface Pro 2, the microphone immediately detects sound.</p>

<p>To minimize this from happening (to reduce the number of locked files that aren't scanned), boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 button during bootup until the menu appears and then select one of the safe mode options - I generally select safe mode
 with networking which may be necessary in this situation if you first want to update your definitions before starting) to run the scan and have nothing else open and don't use the computer while the scan is running.&nbsp; This will elimate many programs that run
 in the background in normal mode and free up those program and related files to be scanned.</p>
<p>Knowing the full path to the files and the filenames (including their extensions) would help so we can see if any of them seem suspicious.&nbsp; What security software are you using (name and version)?</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>They're files that are in use by another program.&nbsp; Windows keeps some files open, and it doesn't matter that your antivirus program can't scan them.</p>
<p>What are the names of the files, and what folders are they in?</p>

<p>
</p><p>None of my function keys are responding properly. I tried using the function key, but it doesn't do anything. f11 goes to full screen instead of fast forward. f6 moves between tool bar icons instead of muting. f3 opens find instead of increasing brightness.
 It's been doing this all day and it's driving me crazy because I use the volume keys(f6, f7, f8) quite frequently. There isn't anything in my setting that addresses key functions. I restarted and shut down many times and the problem still persists. I think
 the only key that seems to working is f1 which is help.</p>

<h2>            playing a DVD on PC with Windows 10</h2>
                    My PC was hacked yesterday, so I spend about an hour with Microsoft to resolve any potential issues.&nbsp; Today my Cyberlink Power Media Player 14 isn't working and I uninstalled it.&nbsp; Can't play any DVDs now and Media Player only plays music, no option to
 play DVDs.&nbsp; What can I do now to watch discs?&nbsp; Appreciate any help I can get.

            Thanks for your response, however, it took uninstalling and reinstalling a new media player. &nbsp;Must have been a serious issue 'cause it took Microsoft an entire afternoon to fix it.

            If you entered a User gernerated name when setting up your account then you have already used the free gamertag change. You only get one for free when you take the random gamertag that is gernerated automaticly from Xbox. Hope that helps.

<h2>            Surface Pro &#47; Docking Station Not Working With External Monitor</h2>
                    <p>When I attach my Surface Pro (not 2 - with Win 8.0 Pro) to my new docking station, my external monitor (Samsung - HDMI connection) does not receive any signal. I am using the special HDMI/MiniDisplay port adapter from Microsoft. When not attached to the
 docking station, this same configuration works, i.e. &nbsp;the "duplicate" and "extend" settings work on the second screen.</p>
<p>Is anyone using this same configuration that works? What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; Do I need to upgrade to Win 8.1? Do I need special drivers? Do I have a lemon?</p>

<p>East coast release is midnight and I thought it would release 9 PM for us pacific time people, but Zenimax posted something on their official forums about it being released Midnight local time. &nbsp; What confused me is that their local time is Eastern so were
 they being provincial when they said local or did they mean local for each player? &nbsp;Are you confused yet? &nbsp;I know I am!</p>
<p>If it's possible for Microsoft to stagger access depending on your own timezone it would be midnight for Pacific time people too.</p>
<p>If my download is finished by 9 PM PDT, I'll definitely be trying to see if I can log in then.</p>

<p>Xbox store says 4:01am UTC, which is 9pm PST/12 EST. &nbsp;Last time I noticed the store say that was for Witcher 3, and sure enough, game unlocked at 5 PST. But, it all depends on Zeni/Msft. Just checked it now to be safe and the store says it will unlock at

    <title>My system restore in Windows XP Home Edition is disabled by Group - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My system restore in Windows XP Home Edition is disabled by Group Policy. The system doesn&#39;t allow me to enalbe this function,  despite I have a partition in my Hard Drive to just store backup</h2>
                    When I open the system properties dialog box, System Restore is checked off, saying it is disabled by Group Policy, and the system doesn't allow you to enable this option. I got a dedicated partition in my Hard Disk justo to store Backups and create Restore
 Points with 10 GB capacity. How can I fix this problem?

            If you are seeing things like this:<br />
<br />
You do not have sufficient security privileges to restore your system.<br />
The System Restore tab is missing from My Computer Properties.<br />
System Restore has been turned off by group policy.&nbsp; To turn on System Restore, contact your domain Administrator.<br />
The System Restore tab is available, but the Turn off System Restore (disabled by Group Policy) box is greyed out.<br />
Task Manager has been disabled by your System Administrator.<br />
Registry Editor has been disabled by your System Administrator.<br />
Task Manager has been disabled by Group Policy.<br />
Registry Editor has been disabled by Group Policy.<br />
The command prompt has been disabled by your administrator.&nbsp; Press any key to continue...<br />
The operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer.&nbsp; Please contact your system administrator.<br />
The "Run" option is missing from the Start menu.<br />
The "Log Off..." option is missing from the Start Menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
The usual advice is something along the lines of "something has been disabled in Group Policy...", and that is probably true that something has been disabled, but you need to know what that something is and what to do about it.<br />
<br />
If you are using XP Home, you will not get far with advice to use the Group Policy Editor since there is no Group Policy Editor in XP Home and that really doesn't tell you where to look in the Group Policies even if you could run Group Policy Editor.<br />
<br />
You need a comprehensive solution that will work for all versions of XP and do not require hunting around in the Group Policy Editor or the registry to find where things are that might have been disabled.<br />
<br />
Unless you disabled these things on purpose, the chances are good that your system has a malicious software infection.&nbsp; The malware knows what tools you are going to use to try and find and remove it, so the malware disables the things you are most likely to
 use and keeps them from running so you can't find the malicious software and remove it.<br />
<br />
If your system has this kind of affliction, whatever malicious software tools you are currently using or have been using have failed to protect your system so you may want to expand your malicious software prevention and detection horizons to prevent these
 kinds of afflictions in the first place.<br />
<br />
The malicious software will be happiest to fool you into thinking you need to so something drastic to fix your system - like a Repair Install, System Restore point, or a total reinstallation of XP.&nbsp; That is what it would like you to do, but such measures are
 not required.<br />
<br />
You need to fix the immediate problem of the tools not working, then scan your system for malicious software when you are done.
<br />
<br />
No matter what kind of malicious software scanning tools you have already used, they are unlikely to fix this problem because they cannot tell if the changes to your system were on purpose (you or an Administrator made them) or some malicious software changed
 them, so the scanning tools will leave these things alone (this is usually a good thing).<br />
<br />
If your system is afflicted in this manner, there are probably other things that also don't work - like Task Manager, Registry Editor, System Restore and Command Prompt, so fix them all at once even if you haven't found out they are broken yet.<br />
<br />
These registry commands will remove the registry entries that are stopping the programs from opening.&nbsp; Even if the registry entries are not there, these commands are safe to run and will work for all versions of XP.<br />
<br />
Before making any changes to your registry, back up the registry with this popular free tool:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a><br />
<br />
Open notepad to create a new text file:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
notepad<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a new notepad file.<br />
<br />
Copy and paste the following lines of text into the new notepad file.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Save the new text file with a .reg extension to your desktop or someplace you can remember with a name you can remember, something like:
<br />
<br />
enableit.reg<br />
<br />
After saving the file, close notepad.<br />
<br />
Locate the enableit.reg file on your desktop and double click it.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can right click the enableit.reg file, choose Open With... and select the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative to the question... Are you sure you want to add the information to the registry?<br />
<br />
You should then see a message that the information was successfully entered into the registry.<br />
<br />
Reboot your system and test.<br />
<br />
You can remove the enableit.reg file when you are done.<br />
<br />
If the Registry Editor has also been disabled, we will have to fix that first (not a problem).<br />
<br />
<div>Since your system has or has had an infection, follow up with this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<br />
For the benefit of Microsoft Support Engineers, here are some of your ideas offered in the past that will NOT help with this issue:<br />
<br />
Booting in Safe Mode<br />
Booting into Last Known Good Configuration<br />
A Clean Boot<br />
Running sfc /scannow (or trying to run it)<br />
