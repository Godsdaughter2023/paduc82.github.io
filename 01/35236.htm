<h2>            Map favorites being deleted, but not by me, on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>OK, here's a very weird one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>Office PC Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Person PC Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my job disabled the sync for OneDrive. I noticed this about a month ago, because I could no longer sync OneNote across devices. However, I could still see my map favorites but could not sync them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to this thread (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-win_maps/maps-sync-on-adds-but-not-on-edits/29e57183-987b-42cc-8c9e-cb122d13af64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>No biggie, just will not enter any more maps favorites into Office PC. Well, today I went to enter some map favorite into my Personal computer, and I started noticing some of my favorites where missing. But I didn't delete them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew of two that where on my Office PC, so I fired it up, only to find out that my Office PC map favorites have all been deleted, it says I have (0) favorites saved. Wow. So now my employer has disabled the OneDrive folder all together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how I can get these map favorites back? Are they stored somewhere locally, or is there a recycle bin on OneDrive I could check (actually now that I'm thinking about it, let me check, recycle bin seems to only have deleted photos)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent a lot of time creating these favorites, I had about 100 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ray</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. Just to add to this...I started thinking about the chain of events, and I don't think it has anything to do with my company PC. Because the events went&nbsp;like this: (plus if my company did this on Friday, today I should have seen nothing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Started adding new favorites</p>
<p>2. Decided to rename a favorite ( I found the favorite, so I renamed it - wondering if rename caused the issue)</p>
<p>3. Added more favorites</p>
<p>4. Went looking for the favorite I just rename in step 2...cannot find.</p>
<p>5. Started scrolling through my list of favorites and I started seeing items missing.</p>
<p>6. I stopped adding favorites and released something is wrong because I'm missing a lot of favorites, but I know for sure one was there because I renamed it. But cannot find it now...not under the old name or new name</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm sure this had nothing to do with it, but just wanted to make sure I revealed everything. Basically I'm transferring my google map favorites to my windows maps favorites. So I had both google map open in chrome and Maps app open on my PC. Just an
 FYI...</p>

<p>Thanks Anup Karkal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But not quite sure you are following the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First let us take the office PC out of the equation. From the p.s. above I noted that the issue started after I did a rename.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, OneDrive and signon is not available any more on the Office PC...so that computer is unlinked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows phone 8.1 and a windows tablet running 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The are all linked to the same account, so now when I look at Map app on any of the three devices they are all showing me the same data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Map App favorites are saved to the cloud somewhere...and someone deleted my favorites in the cloud, but it was not me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what the troubleshooter would do for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question and problem is how did&nbsp;my map app favorite get deleted from the cloud?? And how can I get them back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, not I have sense changed my password, just to be safe and that someone hasn't hacked into my account, but honestly why deleted my map app favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another bit of info, my favorites are all over the world not just in a single country. I have favorites in 5 different countries...and two of my countries all the favorites are completely gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ray&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Some of these favorites I've had since November 2015...so I was using Windows 8.1 and you dragged a point and click the star. Using Windows 10 hold left mouse and then click star.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Made no changes to map settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Have not tried it yet, but I will try this evening. Not sure what they will tell me since some of my favorites are missing and not all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok you stated it is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>not possible
</strong></span>to retrieve my favorites <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>IF </strong></span>I tried the trouble shooting steps...so why would I try them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how can I retrieve them? Are they stored in a database?</p>
<p>Also, don't Microsoft use concurrency to validate records...I'm thinking that somehow my ID got crossed with someone else's. Is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I do not know the architect of map favorites I can only guess. However, if I was the architect then it would go something like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You login with live account, we retrieve your guid</p>
<p>2. We use your guid to retrieve all your map favorites. Map favorites table would look something like this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Unquie ID </li><li>lat,long info </li><li>nickname </li><li>date created </li><li>created by id </li><li>date modified </li><li>modified id </li><li>version</li></ul>
<p>3. Before deleting or editing concurrency would be verified using ID, and version.</p>
<p>4. History records stored for edits and deletes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This schema would of course allow trouble shooting for problems just like this. Unless you're using XML then it would be impossible to retrieve my favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if we are able to retrieve my favorites that have mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ray</p>

<p>Analy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're thinking it's a sync issue, meaning my favorites are still their somewhere vs. they have been deleted by someone or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be nice, I'm a little gun shy now about entering new favorites. I know of a couple of favorties I can re-enter but I would rather wait and see if you guys can recover/fix sync issue before I try to re-enter the ones I can remember.</p>

                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've got a server with a bit of a problem. &nbsp;The RAID 5 config degraded and corrupted the OS. &nbsp;- &nbsp;I'm trying to piece back the install and have got the server to load the OS now (needed use BCDEDIT and a host of other built in windows tools.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm stuck with the blue screen error mentioned above. &nbsp;Which, from all of the reading I've done points to a driver issue. &nbsp;As does the startup repair results I get when using the recovery console:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE</div>
<div>PROBLEM EVENT NAME: STARTUP REPAIR OFFLINE</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 01: 6.1.7600.16385</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 02: 6.1.7600.16385</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 03: UNKNOWN</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 04: 21200823</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 05: ExternalMedia</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 06: 12</div>
<div>PROBLEM SIGNATURE 07: CorruptFile</div>
<div>OS VERSION: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initially, I was getting an error from a Broadcom GBe driver (which is ISCSi aware) saying that the&nbsp;bxois.sys driver was missing or corrupt. &nbsp;So I replaced this by extracting it from Dell' s driver install file (downloaded from Dell).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The question is, how do I tell which file is giving me the dodgy pointer?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot boot to windows, so I'm thinking the file is a OS driver file which windows needs to boot. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At present I'm searching for files with the&nbsp;6.1.7600.16385 in the found.000 directory and trying to figure out where these should go. &nbsp;Foolishly, I decided to not backup the server until I had finished installing all of the applications I needed to. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I won't be making that mistake again!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any pointers (excuse the pun), would be appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW this is a Server 2008 R2 problem.</div>
                </div>

            Hi,<br />

You need to check with the Experts at TechNet where Server 2008 R2 is supported.<br />

<h2>            Cannot connect to XBOX LIVE &#40;by ethernet in secondary location&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Console connects wirelessly in lounge no problem. However we've never been able to connect wirelessly in the cellar&nbsp;(even though laptops have no problem in there).
</p>
<p>So I have just fitted a powerline to connect the console (in the cellar) by ethernet over the domestic mains. The powerline chattering away ok between "in" and "out" adapters&nbsp;and the network router (seemingly). This powerline also works fine on a friends
 network and XBOX.</p>
<p>Gone through all the usual troubleshooters on xbox.com/networkhelp........ DHCP, manual IP add etc - all to no avail.</p>
<p>System is - ROUTER - Netgear ADSL DG834GT, POWERLINE - Phillips SYK3600</p>
<p>Any ideas out there, or do we finally surrender the lounge to our kids?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for advice. Though pc did work in location via ethernet, the console could only connect intermittently - even with static IP and DNS settings. Finally solved problem with upgraded spec on powerline, followed by what seemed to an automatic download
 to the console. Not had a problem since</p>

<p>It's a worldwide service so unless your in game settings are set to only pit you against Americans or the game itself only allows you to play against people in your locale you'll play against people from outside the States.

<p>I suggest putting it on a dresser or better yet an inclosed box, with the wires feeding through a tiny hole. If you do put it on your dresser don't pack anything near it, the fan is designed to push the hot air out and if anything is in front of it you are
 keeping it from doing its job.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to completely disable Cortana&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use a 3rd party search app for files. I have no interest in a voice-activated, cheesy search program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to search for something on the internet, I open a browser. If I want to find something on my pc, I can find what I'm looking for without incorrect suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the potential utility of Cortana; but it is inferior to how I do things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it integrated into a bunch of other processes or is there a way to excise this tumor of an app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello Sellin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tutorial below can show you how disable Cortana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/25118-enable-disable-cortana-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/25118-enable-disable-cortana-windows-10-a.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, like NotMS, posted above, it will not disable Search. You can remove the Search icon/box from the taskbar though.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you wanted to disabled Search Indexing, then you could use the method in the tutorial below to do so. Be sure to read the warning though to see if that is a concern for the side effects.</p>

            <p>For the best results, crop your photos in Photo Gallery to be horizontal and in the exact same aspect ratio as your project in Movie Maker.&nbsp; So for example, if you plan to make a widescreen (16 x 9) project, crop your photos in Photo Gallery to 16 x 9.&nbsp;
 And if you plan to make a standard (4 x 3) project, crop to that ratio in Photo Gallery.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To set the aspect ratio in Movie Maker, go to the Project tab.&nbsp; To crop photos in Photo Gallery, double-click on the photo to bring up the photo editor (big view of the photo).&nbsp; Under Adjustments, find Crop.&nbsp; But click under the icon (where the word Crop
 and a black triangle are) and then choose Proportion.&nbsp; Choose widescreen (16 x 9) or 4 x 3.&nbsp; And crop the photos so they are horizontal (landscape view) not vertical (portrait view).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems like what is happening is that you are cropping some photos to close to a 3 x 2 aspect ratio.&nbsp; Many DSLRs use this ratio by default.&nbsp; In that aspect ratio, Movie Maker tries to be helpful and will crop automatically to make the photo fit the full
 width or height, but that means you might lose part of the photo.&nbsp; To avoid this, do the cropping yourself to the exact aspect ratio, as I noted above.</p>

====================================================<br />
I'm not sure I can explain in a way that makes any sense but will give it a try.<br />
<br />
Basically, you are asking about aspect ratio...Width in relation to Height.<br />
<br />
Most digital cameras use the 4:3 aspect ratio. For example, a best quality<br />
unedited photo from a 16 megapixel camera is 4608x3456 pixel dimensions<br />
or an aspect ratio of 4:3.<br />
<br />
So...if you crop a photo and do not maintain the aspect ratio...the overall<br />
shape of the photo (Height in relation to Width) will be altered. In many<br />
editing programs you can choose 4:3 or 16:9 crop frames.&nbsp; These can <br />
insure that your cropped photo is the correct aspect ratio.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when the top and bottom of a photo is cut off...it is because <br />
most of your files are in Landscape Orientation (Horizontal) and the affected <br />
photo is in Portrait Orientation (Vertical). If you pre-crop the photo yourself...<br />
you can include the most important content instead allow auto-crop to cut<br />
off the top of someone's head.<br />
<br />
In the following examples...the first photo is the original Portrait Orientation <br />
and I wanted Landscape. The second photo is when it was auto-cropped.<br />
The third photo is when I cropped it myself.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you bear in mind that your video slideshow will probably be 4:3 or 16:9...<br />
if you prep your photos and crop them to that aspect ratio they will all be <br />
the same in the video. Even if the pixel dimensions are not the same...the <br />
aspect ratio should be the same.<br />
<br />
The following older article offers info about preparing photos for Movie <br />
Maker and the info still holds up today. It rambles a bit but still offers <br />
some useful ideas.<br />

This message just barely scratches the surface of digital image prep <br />
for slideshows but should help you get started.<br />

</span></div>
<div><span><span>I just bought a second hand PC which has a Microsoft COA Licence sticker attached to it for "Windows Vista Business OEMAct".
 It came without a HDD so I've installed my own and want to make sure the key on the PC is still valid? If I can get hold of a Vista disc,&nbsp;presumably&nbsp;I can install windows with that key, and all will be fine?</span></span></div>

</span></span></div>

 why not?</span></span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You have to use the Key to see if it is still valid. There is no public list kept.</p>
<p>Thereis no reason why it would not be valid as you can not transfer OEM Licenses from the original machine that they were installed on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

<p>I am having huge issues with my spooler.&nbsp; I have tried every fix I have found on this website, and they work.&nbsp; Up until my laptop is restarted, then Windows 7 seems to be obsessed with restoring the corrupted files.&nbsp; It seems like it has it programmed for
 the back up files to be the ones running the joint.&nbsp; We have renamed the files, we have ran all the scans on here, we have done the whole dependencies stuff (which never worked to begin with.)&nbsp; When I do the scans, it says it has found and repaired the corrupted
 files.&nbsp; Then I turn my laptop off.&nbsp; Turn it on, VOILA!&nbsp; Corrupted once more.&nbsp; I really don't want, nor do I think I should have to, go through this garbage every time I want to print.&nbsp; I would like a permanent solution, please.</p>

            <p>Hello VxShady,</p>
<p>I was experiencing the same problem and your last post gave me some ideas, leading to the following fix that worked for me.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt with right-click and use the "Run as Administrator" option.</li><li>Use sfc to restore the correct version of spoolsv.exe, "sfc /scannow".</li><li>Start the Spooler service to confirm it works and set it to start automatically.</li><li>Open a Windows Explorer with right-click and use the "Run as Administrator" option.</li><li>Navigate to the Windows\System32 folder, right-click on spoolsv.exe and choose the properties option.</li><li>Tick the Read Only checkbox and click OK.</li><li>Copy the spoolsv.exe file to the desktop for good measure.</li><li>Reboot.</li></ol>
<p>The program or service that was replacing your spoolsv.exe file with a corrupt version should now be unable to overwrite it. This solved the problem for me and spooler service started automatically after the reboot.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you too!</p>
<p>Regards, Dave</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This error is quite critical because it happens when user-mode subsystem <span>
has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode.<span> Let's try to troubleshoot the issue by temporarily uninstalling your antivirus software. From the Windows Recovery Screen,
 select <strong>Startup Settings </strong>then boot to <strong>Safe </strong><strong>Mode</strong>. From there, uninstall the antivirus and restart your device.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Hi Yon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about adding a printer to your device. We will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to corrupted or outdated printer drivers after upgrade to Windows 10. We will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if the drivers are compatible to Windows 10 Operating System?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try few of the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps you to add the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Step 1: </strong>If the device is not detected on your computer try to&nbsp;<strong>run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</strong>.</span>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key from the keyboard, type

Hardware and Device </strong>Troubleshooter.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>I suggest you to check the status&nbsp;of
<strong>Print Spooler service </strong>and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Print Spooler service</span></strong><span>, spools print service and handles interactions with the printer.
</span></span></span><span><span>If you turn off this&nbsp;service you won’t be able to print or see your printer.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps: </span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>to open <strong>Run </strong>command, type
<strong>Services.msc </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Search for <strong>Printer Spooler</strong><strong> service</strong>, right click on it and
<strong>Start </strong>the service.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Also, set the <strong>Startup type </strong>to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Now check if you are able to install the driver.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>I suggest you to refer to the below thread, check if your issue matches with the same.</p>
<p>If so, try the troubleshooting steps suggested by <strong>Greg Carmack - MS MVP
</strong>on January 10, 2016 and check if it helps.</p>

<p>I'm a&nbsp;lvl 6 Nord leaning in the Battlemage direction. Right now I am concentrating on perks like restoration, destruction, block and one hand. I think it's one hand. What suggestions do you guys have?</p>

<p>be a little more generous with the close combat attributes at first, it can be tough being a battlemage early in the game. Once you establish a solid sword guy, then tackle the spells.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Restoration would be good because most likely you will be dropping you sword for the spell hand and that will leave you open for a hefty amount of damage taken.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, looking at the destruction tree, you will start specializing in elemental damage (ice, fire, etc.) so start playing with the basic element spells and find you favorites so when you get to the point of specialization you wont waste you perk points.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<p><strong>If you're going to be leveling One-Hand, I'd suggest leveling Block as well and using a shield at least part of the time. I'm actually doing a similar build to you, I'm going the path of a One-Hand Breton Battlemage with a focus on Conjuration, and
 I've found using a shield for at least some of the combat helps out a lot. And if you aren't leveling Conjuration, I'd strongly recommend that. Atronachs kick so much a** now.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My "Battlemage" is kind of a WTF AM I DOING character. Right now I'm putting points into Conjuration, Destruction, Restoration, Heavy Armor, and One-Handed Swords (damage and crit only). I don't even use actual weapons... I just conjure up a bound sword
 and use flames in the other hand. I sucked at first, but as I keep leveling, I'm becoming more and more beastly. Once I level Heavy Armor up a bit, I should be tough to take down.</p>

<p>Battlemages perk trees can get thin.</p>
<p>You need damage mitigation. Get this through Alteration OR Conjuring. Alteration beefs your armor, Conjuration gives the enemy alternate targets. I tend to think Conjuration is better since the summons will also cause damage and you are wearing armor, not
 relying on robes.</p>
<p>Destruction is an obvious tree to drop points in. Pick 2 elements to pump or you'll find yourself in trouble facing enemies resistant to your primary, and these 2 perks are the ONLY way to buff destruction damage. You can skimp on the finishers to save points
 (near dead enemies are near dead... just finish them). I recommend Fire and Lightning, or Ice and Lightning. Lightning drains Magicka which makes it primo for fighting dragons and magi... I like fire better then ice because of the increased damage and # of
 frost resistant enemies... </p>
<p>One Hand is your main combat tree. You can go for 2 hand (or dual wield) if you plan to swap back and forth between dual dest and dual combat.
</p>
<p>Block... can be ignored IMO but others say it's a must. You probably want to skill it up, but I don't think it's worth points since mostly you'll be using spells and weapons.</p>
<p>Restoration has a few must haves. Regeneration, Recovery, and Respite. Regen improves HP recovered for all spells, Respite makes it so you heal HP and stamina (meaning you can convert Magicka to Stamina) and Recovery improves your mana regen (a must sicne
 you won't have +100% regen robes). You should also pick up Avoid death... amazing 1 pt perk that you'll have the prereqs for already. You will want to go down to at least Apprentice level perk, maybe adept, so you can get faster mid-combat heals. Fast Healing
 with Regen heals 75 though, at half cost (35mp) so that is probably sufficient and only an apprentice level spell</p>
<p>I think Enchanting benefits Battlemages quite nicely, but your crafting perks are up to what you want. It is thematic with the build however and ties in nicely to pump your weapons and armor. This way you can also Frost enchant weapons to get the stamina/slow
 effect going (If you Fire/Lightning your destro). Alternately you can go with Smithing to craft and improve your weapons and armor.</p>
<p>You'll need to choose between heavy or light armor. Both have benefits. If you take smithing, even if you go with light armor, you might want to go down the heavy armor side of smithing. Daedric weapons are the best, and chances are you'll want Dragon Scale
 for your light armor anyways (more accessible/available and better looking, IMO, than Glass which is only moderately better)</p>
<p>Don't even think about archery perks... you're a Battlemage, use spells for ranged. Archery is for warriors and thieves.</p>
<p>Personally I'm going even a bit more hybrid and it may bite me in the @@@.... I'm adding stealth for 6x sword crits and disappearing in combat (for more crits) relying on my summons to help keep mobs busy while I work my way. I'm also planning on taking
 the dual weapon perks instead of going down for the paralyze strike and +10% sword crit. The idea is that I'll sneak in, instagib (or seriously injure) an enemy, call forth summons, and then enter a melee frenzy of swinging dbl enchanted swords as fast as
 I can (+35% swing speed on dual wield &amp; +10% crit chance should pair nicely) and using dual cast destro magic for range.</p>

<p>Im a 22 battlemage myself and I have focused on one handed and block as well as different magicka things. Get a ward asap as it is basically a shield against spells. I have that for magic users and a dwarven shield for weapon users.

<p>I'm an imperial battlemage and I personally put a lot of points into destruction and restoration. I got the Augmented Fire perks, and the Impact perk from destruction. I got restoration duel casting, and level perks and am going for the recovery perk as
 soon as my skill hits 50. I also perked my enchanting and smithing, but that's just me. I put a couple of points into Juggernaut, but none into weapon skills. I only pull out my orcish mace if there's a mage with an irritating ward, or a dragon.</p>

<p>My Mage has no weapons, no armour, no robes, just undies and he's living it hard on Master.</p>
<p>If you're all magic you want Destruction (dual wield for the win), Alteration (it's your only defence) and Conjuration focussed on heavily. Illusion doesn't do much for me but maybe that's just me.</p>
<p>And you want to learn to sneak pretty well too. Wether you put points into it is up to you, personally I put my points in the three arms of magic as described above and just level up Sneak as much as I can.</p>
<p>Late game I may put some effort into Enchanting for some defensive effects on rings and bracelets and hopefully my undies but early game I just dis-enchant everything for the xp.</p>

<h2>            Video Capture Drivers</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my computer. I kept the XP operating system. Have SP3 installed.<br />
I bought a 1394 firewire capture card to capture DV.<br />
Using Ulead Video studio.<br />
It does NOT recognize my camera and keeps saying there are no 'VIDEO CAPTURE DRIVERS" installed.<br />
I've tried a different 1394 card, a different cable...even a different camera. Nothing...nada...<br />
Back to that same thing about video capture drivers.<br />
What do I need to download/install in order for it to recognize my cameras?<br />

The name - microsoft is getting worse,  I am having problems with video cap and with error messages, I thought drivers should be updated and there seems to be so called partners who pop uip and give a song and dance to download their **** which is to just sell a scheme to clean your pc or other.  Perhaps someday we can clean up this, these crooks stop wasting peoples time.  one way is maybe to hire bounty hunters to pay them a visit!! just to talk.  Also, there are those out there who would like to see fewer people using computers to get their news etc.

<h2>            After Shrink Volume and format new free space, all drive become &#39;Simple Volume&#39; and Windows 7 can&#39;t Load</h2>
                    
<p>My windows 7 was installed in Drive C: in Primary partition.</p>
<p>I only have another drive D:, which is also a Primary partition and 200GB in size.</p>
<p>I need to create another drive. So, I use 'Shrink Volume' on Drive D: and free 30GB.</p>
<p>Then 30GB become free space and when I right click on that, I choose to 'Simple Volume' and then format it as NTFS and assign the drive letter E:. All of a sudden after I did that, all the partitions(C: and D:) now no longer say "Primary Partition". The
 blue color on top of the partitions also changed to a yellow/brownish color. My guess is that they have been converted to a Simple Volume too.</p>
<p>Well, then I just restart my PC and astonished that my windows 7 can't load. Only a blank screen come ahead to me. No error message given.</p>
<p>I use my Windows 7 DVD and in repair windows section, I use command line and by 'diskpart', i found, my all partition (C: and D: and E:) present their and there file system is: 'NTFS' and Type is "Simple". No drive there marked as a 'System' or 'boot'.</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>What should I do now, to recover my Windows 7?</p>
<p>Any kind of help will be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Abdullah,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp; You need to use a boot partition manager to assign
 Windows drive to be the primary boot drive. However, we do not support using 3rd party applications to do this.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp; Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers
 can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></span><span><span>&nbsp; You can also try using the startup repair utility.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/startup-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/startup-repair</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are unsuccessful with these methods then you will need to refer TechNet forum where they can give you in-depth steps on how to repair your
 system. Please refer to the below mentioned link for further assistance.</span></span></span></p>

            just simple, after shrinking a volume just run you windows setup again hit install button &amp; when you get the the drives window see there is an "unallocated" drive click it &amp; click below given button "new" then create a drive &amp; format it, it will formatting
 your unallocated drive automatically to "NTFS" then just close/exit windows setup, restart you computer, NOTE: it will never harm your previously existing windows installation &amp; you will be able to boot again on windows .... after that do whatever you want,
 if you want the "new created ntfs" as FAT32 just go on &amp; format again if no then it is ok ... loooolllz<br />

<h2>            ALL my documents became &#34;read only&#34; TODAY, and I can&#39;t edit them to make changes.</h2>
                    I upgraded to Win 10 a few months ago, but today, ALL my documents are "read only" and I can't edit them to make changes. &nbsp;I went through and tried changing folder properties to remove the "read only" checked box (not sure why it suddenly got checked)
 from every folder under Users that had documents in it, but when I open the doc again, it still says it is "read only". &nbsp;The file properties even say it isn't read only, yet it opens that way today for some reason. &nbsp;I've rebooted the machine, and the problem
 persists. &nbsp;Rather than starting a rant at MS for an upgrade I felt pushed into when my Win 7 worked just fine, I am hoping a real tech expert can help me through this glitch that has come out of nowhere for no reason. &nbsp;BTW, I am the owner, who should thus
 have admin privileges (so why it keeps telling me I don't, or tells me I need such privileges to continue, I have no idea). &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hello Luke Alexis,</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10, that when the display is going to off (for example I set the display turn off after 1 minute. and sleep after 20minutes. or I set one key to turn off Laptop display by hand.) the screen also locked.&nbsp;<br />

I do not have this problem on win7. <br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could have happened due to several reasons like outdated driver. We would like to know more about the issue by answering the following questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried updating your drivers?</li><li>Have you tried to try it with another user profile on your Windows 10?</li><li>What is the last action taken before this issue happens?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response. </p>

            I found the problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>for solve this problem you must change lock screen background from "slide show" to&nbsp; "windows Spotlight" or "picture".</strong><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c86b4ebc-e260-47fb-a325-005ddc22cd32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c86b4ebc-e260-47fb-a325-005ddc22cd32" height="327" width="505" /></strong></a><br />
the problem was occur when changing windows lock screen from "windows Spotlight" or "picture" to slide show. in this time all the times that display turns off it also being locked.<br />
<br />
<strong>but is there any solution to have both of them?</strong><strong> (slide show and do not occur screen locked when display turns off)?</strong><br />
