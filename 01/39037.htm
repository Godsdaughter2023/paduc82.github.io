            <p>Good evening and many thanks for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Undertook attempts to load the program both via the advised Program Compatibility Troubleshooter and compatibility settings manually.&nbsp; Have included detail further herein.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point we must reiterate our previous advice that The Dragon speaking program
<strong>has loaded correctly</strong> to two other PC's running Win 10 64 bit and utilising the same installer.&nbsp; The Windows 10 upgrades were loaded within days to all three computers and with all running flawlessly since loaded.&nbsp; One of the PC's referred is
 the exact hardware specification/build and software loaded as per the problem PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relative to your advice re Compatibility, these are steps and outcomes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempted to load the program via Program Compatibility Troubleshooter and which utilised Windows 8. Same negative error 1402 outcome as previously reported at approx 90% of the load phase.</li><li>Attempted to load the program via compatibility settings manually with only change to defaults being to Windows 7.&nbsp; Same negative error 1402 outcome as previously reported at approx 90% of the load phase.</li><li>Attempted to load the program via compatibility settings manually with <strong>
ALL </strong>defaults changed and being: Window 8, Reduced colour mode, Run in 640 x 480, Disable display scaling and Run as an Administrator. Same negative error 1402 outcome as previously reported at approx 90% of the load phase.</li></ol>
<p>Can only say, back to the Community and hopefully further suggestions will be forthcoming.</p>

            <p>Good evening Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based upon the singular response to our thread we would believe the problem posed may not be of a common nature with simple fix and perhaps only able to be rectified with either a clean load or repair of Windows 10 O/S.&nbsp; Initially would appreciate any feedback
 from the Community relative to this opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly and if deemed necessary, would request the Community advise thoughts/opinions as to best (or only) methodology applicable in undertaking either&nbsp;clean load or repair of Windows 10 O/S.&nbsp; Hopefully there is available on the web a document (hopefully
 with pictures!) detailing same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not have a copy of Windows 10 program (upgraded from Win 7) therefore would appreciate any advice forthcoming as to how this program can be obtained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have copies of all software/licenses loaded to the referred PC together with a documented load methodology for same, therefore it really is only a time consuming exercise to re-load and configure software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward further advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

    <title>File History Full Restore Fails Due To Shortened User Folder Name - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wusty  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History Full Restore Fails Due To Shortened User Folder Name</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in a desperate situation here trying to restore files from File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was running Windows 10 on my Lenovo X1 Carbon.&nbsp; I was using File History for backup.&nbsp; The Lenovo X1 failed completely (motherboard).&nbsp; The laptop has been replaced with a high-end Dell machine.&nbsp; I now want to restore my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help facilitate this, I setup the new machine with the same computer name.&nbsp; I used the same MSFT account credentials to set up the machine as the previous laptop.&nbsp; I have followed the steps outlined in various posts and I was confident that I carefully
 followed the correct process.&nbsp; However, my files have not been restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue seems to be that my user folder name was shortened by 'setup' on the new machine.&nbsp; For example, if the user folder name on the old machine was 'Richard', on the new machine it is now 'richa'.&nbsp; As a consequence:</p>
<p><span>1</span><span>) None of the files in 'Richard' have been restored.</span></p>
<p>2) The File History drive now has a folder called 'richa' under&nbsp;<span>&lt;computer_name&gt;\Data\C\Users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3) 'Richard' is still present on the File History drive under &lt;computer_name&gt;\Data\C\Users, but in looking at the 'Configuration' folder, both the 'Config1' and 'Config2' files have been updated to reflect 'richa', with no reference to the original 'Richard'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off File History until I sort this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THE BIG QUESTION IS how can I restore the files in 'Richard' to my laptop either by using a) my current 'richa' user folder on the new laptop, or b) to a new user with the correct user folder name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question might be, if it is possible to restore the files in 'Richard' back to 'richa', will I experience any config or user issues because my user folder name is different ('richa' versus 'Richard').</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am dead in the water so any help appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) There no error messages on my original machine prior to failure - it just refused to boot one morning - everything was fine until then. &nbsp;There were no error messages on my new machine as it began &amp; executed its process when I started File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I made no changes re configuration, or anything to do with File History. &nbsp;There was no need. &nbsp;Everything was going ok until the machine failed to boot one morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From investigations to date (forums etc) I am thinking my current situation is highly likely due to the difference in the user folder name (original user folder on failed machine = ‘Richard’, user folder on new machine defaults to ‘richa’. &nbsp;The difference
 seems to have prevented the restore - instead File History has added the ‘richa’ folder (as I mentioned) on my file history drive. I did not get an option to set the user folder name when I set up the new machine and added the initial user. &nbsp;Also, I could
 not locate how to change it anywhere. Windows setup seems to decide the folder name when you enter your windows account email. &nbsp;The original folder being named ‘Richard’ is legacy going back numerous versions of Windows - it simply migrated forward from one
 release to the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short answer - no errors - no config changes &nbsp;I think the issue is with the new (default) user folder name. &nbsp;Question is, how can I now retrieve my file history - I can see it is all sitting there, albeit with time stamps in the file names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this help you help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            window 10 trying to restiore previoius version boot loop</h2>
                    <p>HI</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's laptop is running windows 10. It recently tried to update, and seemed to fail. It now is stuck in loop saying 'windows 10 is trying to restore previous version' and is going round and round. I never get to the login screen. I have let this run
 for some 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile I have created a 'windows 10 media utility' and booted the broken machine via the usb. I have then run through various options like:</p>
<ul>
<li>system restore - it says there are no restore points available</li><li>go back to previous version - 'we ran into a problem'</li><li>startup repair - 'we ran into a problem' - gives a path to a log file 'E\$WINDOWS...'</li><li>command prompt - when I poen this it reads 'Not enough memory resources are available to poress this command' and the prompt reads X: \Sources - I can follow instructions for suing the cmd prompt</li></ul>
<p>I don't know what else to try</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            Hi Edward.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>There are a number of really useful things that might run at startup that will cause this....</p>
<p>Are you having some kind of issue with your startup ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my machines run that way... mostly because of things I have installed, but it may have already been that way before I noticed...</p>

<p>
</p><p>Same thing with the SERVICES in msconfig...</p>

<h2>            Keyboard doesn&#39;t work in Win 10</h2>
                    Purchased a Dell Inspiron 13 laptop and after going thru all the setup screens, the keyboard doesn't work in Windows 10. I can use the keyboard to log into windows but after that the keyboard doesn't work when typing in the browser, file manager, etc.
 I've updated the drivers and done windows update but nothing seems to help. Thought it might be bad hardware so i returned it and bought another computer but I've run into same issue with the second computer. Any ideas would be appreciated.

            <p>O.K. please first update your installation from 10586.4 to 10586.122.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then open a command prompt window with administrator privileges and run the command</p>

            I still have no start button, Edge browser, any of my xbox live games, search bar, and notifications button on task bar will not work.&nbsp; All SFC checks come back okay, windows update attempts to download update, but will not install.&nbsp; Just says updates
 not installed.&nbsp; No error messages.&nbsp; I even tried stand alone installer for KB3140768 it also attempts downloading , but says update did not install. It's like I am running windows 7 again.

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail - Not syncing for move and delete operations</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else notice that Mail doesn't sync the move and delete operations? When I delete messages or move then to a folder for sage keeping, these operations do not happen until you do into the 'deleted' / 'bin' folder or into the folder where you have
 moved the mail to and synced manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different settings for each mail account I have set up, settling to leave the sync setting as 'based on my usage'. It looks like the messages have moved or been deleted but if I check my mail even days later on my phone they are either still
 in my in-box or in fact nowhere to be seen until I do the process of syncing the specific folder manually in Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 and all my apps fully updated to the latest versions on my Microsoft Surface and my desktop. As both machines are working the same the issue must be an issue in the Mail app as other mail programs seem to do the move/delete etc operation
 immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and suggestions gratefully received.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save time and space, the <strong>Mail App</strong> doesn't automatically sync every folder. You must select a folder to sync it. Once you've selected it, that folder syncs on the same schedule as your inbox for that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you think your messages are automatically being moved to the <strong>Deleted Items</strong> folder, check the status of the
<strong>Ignore</strong> control setting. </p>
<p>If it is highlighted as shown below, the conversation thread on that message is currently being ignored by Outlook. Hence, will automatically go to your Deleted Items folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2a16e7a-dc7c-4a59-aa89-166c565897ff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2a16e7a-dc7c-4a59-aa89-166c565897ff" height="182" width="270" /></a></p>

            <p>Thanks Joanna for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messages are not automatically being moved or deleted The problem is that messages are not being synced. What you say about folders not automatically being synced to save time and space sound exactly the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is indeed the behaviour of the Mail app, then there should be an option for users to turn on a full sync every time. In this mobile world which&nbsp;Microsoft has helped to create this behaviour makes the app unfriendly and not useable, causing the user
 to repeat actions in other apps on other platforms. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft give us control and give us a full sync. Stop ruining a great app!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users, please comment and 'me too' this need.</p>

            <p>Hi Rasoul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Mail &amp; Calendar app was updated on the 19th October and is version 17.7369.40791.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sync on/off toggle in each of my email accounts is on. That would seem to be the only setting to control synchronisation. So being a global setting I assume the choice to process folders or not in buried in the code out of reach.</p>

            <p>Checked the security setting and these are as per my ISP/email host requirements. Mail app can read and send mail from all email account. The issue is you have to go into the folder or deleted items folder once you have moved or deleted a message from inbox
 to get the mail app to actually move the message. If you don't do this manual sync the message is left in limbo and not visible anywhere when you check for it in the ISP hosts web mail client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail app needs to fully sync all folders, like other email clients such as em-client, MailBird, Thunderbird etc, even Outlook 2016. I would use Outlook but that program will not sync with Google calendar and contacts.</p>

<h2>            Dark Souls III Game Problems</h2>
                    <p>I recently started playing Dark Souls III (Digital Deluxe Edition). Everything was fine until I arrived a zone (Farron Keep) and then the game start with some problems. First, the game stopped loading the game textures and enemies so I thought it was a mistake and exit the game to start it again but the game stopped loading my savedata and just kept loading the game (Loading Screen). I made a second character to keep playing but it stop loading my savedata on the same zone.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>So I read in Xbox Support that uninstalling the game should be fix the problem. I did that and the game started to works again perfectly until I arrived the boss of the Catacombs of Carthus (I had the same problem: no loading game textures and enemies) and then I exit the game and again it stopped loading my savedata.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I uninstalled the game again and the storage saved data (I read that it could fix the problem) and then it works again until I defeat the boss Yhorm The

            I've tried these suggestions but it doesn't stay on long enough before going into restart for it to work. My laptop is now at a repairers to see if they can sort it . Although it is still under warranty as its a software problem its not covered. I'm really
 upset about this as I'm a pensioner on limited income and it took a lot of saving to buy the laptop. Microsoft should have warned its customers that this could happen as its happened to a lot of people. Why with all there knowledge have they not come up with
 a fix. Wish I'd never upgraded.

            I've got the same problem.&nbsp; Updated my computer and it worked great for a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; Went to log on and "CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED".&nbsp; I'm a school teacher so I have lots of applications and data on my hard drive.&nbsp; I called Microsoft and they wanted to charge
 me to fix it.&nbsp; They recommended I call Dell who will also want to charge me money to fix it.&nbsp; Evidently a driver is not working with an update Microsoft performed.&nbsp; It looks like someone at Microsoft would offer a tool that would identify and allow you to
 fix the issue instead of leaving us to find a solution.&nbsp; It sure makes Microsoft look bad.&nbsp; Their program just runs through a loop not fixing anything or IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM.&nbsp; You can't even boot to safe mode.&nbsp; Horrible problem!

            I took my laptop to two different repairer. The first one said it was my hard drive that had died and wouldn't touch it as it was still under warranty. Charged me £30. Knew it wasn't the hard drive so took it to another one. They fixed it, it was my antivirus
 install that had caused the problem, they removed it and installed a free one. Charged me £30. So cost me £60 in all. So much for a free update to windows 10. Would not do it again and would not recommend anyone else to. I'm leaving my desk top on 8.1

            <p>I was using AVG with Windows 10, had the Windows 10 specific upgrade, and apparently that was causing this crash. I'll stick with 7 for my personal PC, work won't even upgrade past 8.1 these days.</p>

            &nbsp;This happens every time I install a Microsoft/Windows update.&nbsp; It should be a legal requirement that technology must not be released to the public before ALL problems are corrected. I too am off to MAC.

            Well this error means that your c drive is completely corrupted and the only way to fix it is. by reinstall windows there are two ways to do it ill tell how I did it. I have a copy of windows 10 download from Microsoft plug it in and wait for your computer
 so show a window with options restart and advance option go to advance option open command prompt and run the setup.exe file from there. It works.

            Wow, 2 years to get a reply!&nbsp; I was able to get it working again without losing my files and programs.&nbsp; It turns out that Kaspersky was causing the problem.&nbsp; After removing it I was able to reboot cleanly.&nbsp; In the future I would hope that Microsoft would
 do a better job of researching upgrades with their computer resellers before rolling an upgrade of this proportion out.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the replies.</p>
<p>My&nbsp;fault was resolved in August 2015</p>
<p>I took my computer into a repair shop and they sorted it for me. Didn't take long as they'd had quite a few in with the same problem. Mine was caused by my Bitdefender&nbsp;anti virus software not being compatible with windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Graphics drivers &#40;maybe&#41; and updates ruin everything</h2>
                    <p>So to make a long story short, (I already posted the everything else before, but got no help) This is Windows 10, Alienware, AMD graphics card</p>
<p>My PC froze, afterwards I could only get either, an apparent successful boot but with a black screen, or the recovery menu from a failed boot.&nbsp;<br />
From the recovery menu, if I tried to do anything to possibly recover or fix it, that required a password to my main account, my password was rejected, (incl in safe mode)<br />
<br />
But in safe mode with my back up account, I deleted the graphics drivers, which seemed to temporarily fix the problem. But only for about 5-10minutes. After a couple of attempts I gave up and did a reset.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Everything seemed to be working for a few hours (during the first half hour it downloaded the graphics drivers again). I was getting everything back, programs etc watching Netflix, played a game. However it froze 3 times in the midst of all this. After the
 first two it acted good again for a while. After the 3rd freeze, I was back in almost the exact same state from a few days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Black screens or recovery menus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spoken to Microsoft support to no avail.&nbsp;<br />
Can anyone please provide me with some actual help?<br />
<br />
Update<br />
I went into safe mode and disabled both the graphics drivers (Intel and AMD) and it seems to be stable for the time being. What am I supposed to do in the long run??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have narrowed it down to specifically the AMD graphics driver. As soon as this is enabled, the PC freezes, and I'm unable to boot normally.&nbsp;<br />
I've tried with the latest Windows updates, the latest AMD drivers, and they just won't get along.&nbsp;<br />
So even if I clean install I'll still be stuck with this problem.&nbsp;<br />
What am I supposed to do now? 😭</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be corrupted system files existing on your computer after you did an update. If you can do a system restore on your computer, we recommend that you do so. We have an article in our support site that can help you with this issue. Other options
 will be available as well on this article just in case doing a system restore didn't help resolve the issue. Kindly visit the link provided here:

<p>Is your PC still under warranty/guarantee and is it OEM?</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>(OEM is where a PC comes software (mainly Microsoft) already installed.) </p>
<p>To check if yours is OEM go to Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; Product ID. If there's OEM at the end of that, you have an OEM PC.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>This is very important because under the terms of their OEM licence with Microsoft, if your PC is still under guarantee the company that made your PC is responsible for sorting out your current problem. (I know from experience because my last laptop was
 an HP Win 7 OEM and when it died, HP were brilliant and sorted it out.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my view, these steps are the first things to check.</p>

            <p>I have had the same problem. I thought it was fixed but then the same error code showed up again. I logged on to "support. Microsoft.com" and searched for info about this error code and the first suggestion on that page was to click on "Update Troubleshooter".
 I did that and the PC began checking for problems, after a few minutes, the response stated that there was a problem with some kind of server ??? and automatically began fixing the problem. A few more minutes and the message window read that the problem was
 fixed, with a little "check mark in a green round icon" next to the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a restart just for safety, then went to "settings", clicked on "updates" and checked for updates, they took a little while to download and install, but it seems that everything is working properly now. I hope so, this has been driving me nuts for the
 last week or so. Hope this info helps everyone experiencing the same issue. Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Account suspended for false accusation of &#34;cheating&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have been reported by someone because I was simply "being good at the game" and I racked up alot of kills so someone got angry I guess and accused me of cheating. Xbox should fix this glaring issue and should require proof of cheating before suspending accounts under false accusations. I&nbsp;never used any cheating or hacking device, I simply played the game the way it was meant to be played by all fairness.&nbsp;This is aggraivating me,&nbsp;I just&nbsp;want to play the game I paid money for.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi James
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Just to clarify, are you getting this error from Windows 10 or Office 365 products such as Word, Excel?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the prompt, type: slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Take a screenshot of the resulting dialog then post in a reply here.
<br />
<br />Learn how:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />For Microsoft Office, launch an application such as Word
<br />Click File &gt; Account
<br />
<br />Take a screenshot then post in a reply here. 
<br />
<br />Its possible your subscription was upgraded to Office 365 Pro Plus if you were part of an organization.
<br />
<br />If you leave the organization, sometimes the license can be revoked. 
<br />
<br />You can always remove Office and reinstall your own valid license. 
<br />
<br />Use the fix it tool to completely uninstall Office:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 1 - Sign in to download Office
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. This account can be a Microsoft account, or work or school account.

    <title>Can I move Program Files folder &#40;and x86 folder&#41; from C&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markdmt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I move Program Files folder &#40;and x86 folder&#41; from C&#58; &#40;SDD&#41; to D&#58; &#40;HDD&#41; drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased a HP laptop with Windows 10 (build 1809). The machine came with a 1Tb HDD.&nbsp; I purchased and installed a 250Gb Solid State Drive and reinstalled Windows on this drive. I now have the SSD as drive C: and the HDD as D:.
</p>
<p>My goal is to improve Boot speeds (currently at 17 seconds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea would be to have all media stored on the 1Tb HDD, like photos, music, videos, downloads, games etc, and have just have the Windows operating system on SDD.&nbsp; Is this recommended?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already changed the location of Users folders to the HDD (Music, Desktop, Downloads, Videos, Documents, Saved Games). I wonder if it would be possible to also migrate the Programs Files folders to the HDD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EaseUS software advises that: "t<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">he ideal way to make use of an SSD is not to put many large personal data files or install programs
 on it except for the critical system&nbsp;files because the massive data will affect its read/write speed".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">AOMEI software instructs on how to change the Program Files folder path (From C: to D:) by editing the Registry.</span></p>
<p>I have read from other sources, however, that the Programs Files folders are linked to the operating system and changing
 their location could mess things up. I would greatly appreciate any advice on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MarkD</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I was also playing around the the Boot options when I installed the SDD and I am not sure what the original configuration was, or the best, for boot speeds. I currently have USB Boot, Legacy and Secure Boot all disabled.</p>

            Hey MarkDMT,
<br />
<br />I'm an Independent Advisor here to help.
<br />
<br />I don't really recommend moving the Program Files folder, it would mess up things indeed.
<br />
<br />Any future programs you install should have an option to set it up in a different directory and the drive in it. Essential programs like your web browser, so on and so forth should go in the SSD, and any other programs or games that are massive in size should be on the other drive.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps a bit.       
        </p>

            Hi MarkDMT 
<br />
<br />This would be the best storage configuration for that system:
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Move all your User Library folders to D:
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, right click your Documents folder and choose Properties
<br />
<br />Select the Location tab
<br />
<br />In the Location box, type D:\Documents then click Apply and Ok
<br />
<br />When that move completes, do the same for Pictures, Videos and Music
<br />
<br />Each time, provide a new folder location, for example, Pictures will go to D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Move the location of all future content downloaded from the Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage - Change where new content is saved:
<br />
<br />Change all options you find there to D
<br />
<br />3.
<br />If you are a Steam Gamer
<br />
<br />Stop all processes associated with Steam
<br />
<br />Move the Steam folder to your D drive manually
<br />
<br />Then open the Steam Control Panel and point that to the new location
<br />
<br />
<br />4.
<br />Please Note: this should ideally be done before you begin installing any software
<br />
<br />For 3rd party applications, some will allow you to choose an installation location, for those, create a new Program files folder on your D drive, then for each application, create a new sub-folder of that folder
<br />
<br />Other 3rd party applications will not allow you to change the installation location, and there is no safe way to move those to your D drive . . .

            Hi Mark,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The first and foremost disadvantage of using the Registry trick to direct program files is, you would not be able to install the latest updates, notably Feature updates. Here is an example of a related Article:
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-might-installed-unsupported-directory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-might-in...</a>
<br />
<br />Opinions might vary, but as an MVP I do not recommend this. It partially defeats the purpose, as well as programs moved, would be slower to load.
<br />

<p>See your other replies telling you not to try to do this (I also recommend against it) and let me add the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span>My personal view is that the attention many people pay to how long it takes to boot is usually unwarranted. Assuming that the computer's speed is otherwise satisfactory, it is not generally worth worrying about. Most people
 start their computers once a day or even less frequently. In the overall scheme of things, even a few minutes to start up isn't very important. Personally I power on my computer when I get up in the morning, then go get my coffee. When I come back, it's done
 booting. I don't know how long it took to boot and I don't care.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>However if you do want to address it, it may be because of what programs start automatically, and you may want to stop some of them from starting that way. On each program you don't want to start automatically, check its Options
 to see if it has the choice not to start (make sure you actually choose the option not to run it, not just a "don't show icon" option). Many can easily and best be stopped that way. If that doesn't work, run MSCONFIG from the Start | Run line, and on the Startup
 tab, uncheck the programs you don't want to start automatically.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell you, you should be concerned, not with how *many* of these programs you run, but *which*.
 Some of them can hurt performance severely, but others have no effect on performance.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Don't just stop programs from running willy-nilly. What you should do is determine what each program is, what its value is to you, and what the cost in performance is of its running all the time. You can get more information
 about these with internet searches and asking about specifics here.</span></div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div><span>One more point: 17 seconds is an *extremely* fast boot time. It is highly unlikely that you can make any significant improvement to that.</span></div>

            Hi akaMucho
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. On the face value, the culprit is Realtek audio driver. But there may be other causes present also in minidumps.
<br />
<br />HOW TO GET INTO YOUR COMPUTER IN SAFE MODE
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />GET MINI DUMPS
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi akaMucho 
<br />
<br />Are you actually able to get into your laptop?
<br />
<br />Your BSOD lists  RTKVHD64.sys as the cause fo your system crashes . . 
<br />
<br />That is your Realtek High Definition Audio device driver
<br />
<br />You should go to the Support Page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the Realtek Audio driver they recommend . . .
<br />
<br />If you have any trouble locating that page, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your Laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the underneath bottom casing . .

            Hi akaMucho 
<br />
<br />If you are unable to get into your PC, please follow these steps, all steps are non-destructive to your data . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your audio Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps
<br />Then start the Reset

            Hi,
<br />
<br />As the error appears to reference the Realtek audio driver you could try entering the computer BIOS and disable the onboard audio.
<br />
<br />Then see if you can start Windows and if so provide the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder.       
        </p>

            Will you be posting the minidumps or will you like to do restore/repair/clean install etc?

<h2>            Windows 10 Backup using File History Incomplete</h2>
                    <p>My use of Windows 10 Backup using File History to an external drive results in ~95% of files and folders successfully backed up but omits hundreds&nbsp;of files and folders in my Documents folder. There doesn't appear to be a pattern of which are backed up or
 not.&nbsp; I turned off Backup, restarted and started a new complete backup with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I manually "Add a folder" I get the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Home, ver 1709, OS build 16299.214, on an Inspiron 5488, with a Seagate Backup Plus drive (1.74TB free).</p>

<p>I finally resolved the issue by taking 2 steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Reduce the file path name length to fit within the ~250 character max. I hadn't fully realized that about 100 characters were added to the front of my path name, as well as about 24 characters for the time stamp. I renamed about 2300 files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Clean up the temporary Office files</p>
<p>
</p><p>With these two changes, I have a clean backup in File History, with no $OF folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful if the File History documentation explained that IF you want your File History file to match what is being backed up, to strictly adhere to the pathname limitation.</p>
