<h2>            Bad Image Error</h2>
                    <p>Any Help would be appreciated! Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a routine system update yesterday evening, it restarted as normal but I had a popup that said: C:\Users\Beth\AppData\Local\Smartbar\Application\Resources\crdlil.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the
 program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After browsing online I have found many different combinations where mine says "crdlil.dll"</p>
<p>I can not for the life of me find how to get this irriating popups to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP</p>
<p>(Moved from programs)</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here at the Microsoft Community forum.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may face this issue due to corrupted files form some third party applications. To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if
 problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to check if you have installed SmartBar Toolbar</span>. If so try uninstalling it and check if issue persist.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Open Internet Explorer and go to ‘Tools‘ → ”Manage Add-ons’.</span></li><li>
<span>Choose ‘Toolbars and Extensions’ and uninstall everything related to SmartBar from the list.</span></li><li>
<span>Choose ‘Search Providers’ → choose the search engine you used before and make it your default search provider. Additionally, select ‘Web Search’, click ‘Disable suggestions’ to disable it.</span></li><li>
<span>Go ‘Tools’ → ‘Internet Options’ and select ‘General’ tab. Click ‘Use default’ or enter your own website name, bing.com or other. Finally, click ‘OK’ to save the changes.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>
Follow these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if you face the similar issue in Safe Mode with networking, if not you can try putting your computer in a Clean Boot state in normal mode and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Follow the Microsoft KB article to perform clean boot on the computer:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section<strong> “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong>
 to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Mouse and keyboard doesn&#39;t work after reset to factory settings</h2>
                    I recently got a computer from my sister and being nice i reset it back to factory settings this way none of her personal info was available. After the system wipe when I'm asked to put in my timezone and everything, my mouse and keyboard don't work, they
 are both connected via usb port and the keyboard lights up but other than that i get nothing.

            <p>I think I figured out the problem, i just need the drivers for my mouse and keyboard since I completly wiped the memory, i think if i get the computer connected to the internet it will automatically install the drivers even on the setup screen</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />First I would suggest you to follow these steps to try repair start menu: 
<br />
<br />1.Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator
<br />	Method 1:
<br />	1. Press Windows Key + R on your keyboard
<br />	2. Key in PowerShell and hit Enter.
<br />	3. Right click on the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select Run as Administrator.
<br />	
<br />	Method 2:
<br />	1. Right click Start button
<br />	2. Choose Command prompt (Admin)
<br />	3. Key in Powershell in the black window and hit Enter.
<br />	
<br />2. Paste the following command in the Administrator: Windows PowerShell window and press Enter key:
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Wait for PowerShell to execute and complete the command. Ignore the few errors (in red color) that may pop up.
<br />4. When it finishes, try hitting Start and hopefully it’ll start working. If not, this solution won’t apply to you, unfortunately.
<br />
<br />Are you able to solve it for you by following the procedure mentioned above or it fails? If it it fails, do make sure that you ran Powershell as Administrator (window will be called Administrator: Windows PowerShell ) and gave the command enough time to execute.
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />If your issue persist I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 2:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />If still persist I suggest that you try performing a repair upgrade by following Andre Da Costa's instructions in his article to resolve the issue.

<p>Hey dude,</p>
<p>You sure can, and you do it like this:</p>
<p><strong>What should I do if I want to stop participating in the program?</strong></p>
<p>If you decide that you don't want to get Preview updates anymore you can opt out in the Xbox Preview Dashboard app. You won't be removed from the programme straight away; it won't happen until the current update is released to the general public. If you
 change your mind, you can always re-register your console later using the Xbox Preview Dashboard app.</p>
<p>Here's how to remove your console from the Xbox Preview programme:</p>
<p>1.Open the Xbox Preview Dashboard app.</p>
<p>2.Select Registration.</p>
<p>3.Under Manage flights, select Change.</p>
<p><em>Note If you have more than one console in the programme, you can change their statuses by using Manage other consoles.</em></p>
<p>4.Under Manage programmes, select Remove, and then select Submit. You'll be prompted to select a reason for leaving.</p>
<p>If you run into any issues, post in the private Xbox Early Access forums for help.</p>
<p><em>Note: Your console won't be removed from the programme until the current Preview update is released to the general public, so it won't happen right away. Until then, your console's status will show as Pending.</em></p>

<p>If you are on the new dashboard and want to revert back to the old one you can do so from the Preview App on the console. &nbsp;From there it will take 72 hours for it to kick in at which time your console will start a Factory Reset and any games that you have on the internal hard drive would be deleted and need to be redownloaded. &nbsp;If you have an external hard drive then you should move the content to that drive.</p>

    <title>USB 3.0 NIC triggers BitLocker recovery prompt - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericbrugnone  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB 3.0 NIC triggers BitLocker recovery prompt</h2>
                    <p>The issue is that whenever I turn on Bitlocker when my USB 3.0 to Ethernet adapter is connected, I get prompted for bitlocker recovery if I boot without it.&nbsp; I have turned it off in the Boot order, but no luck.&nbsp; The system is running windows 7 enterprise
 in Legacy boot mode with TPM 1.2 turned on and activated.&nbsp; Inversely, I have suspended Bitlocker and rebooted with the adapter disconnected, then resumed Bitlocker.&nbsp; When I do that it stops prompting for recovery when I boot without the adapter, but starts
 prompting for it if I boot with it.&nbsp; I would like to not have either happen and I don't want to disable any PRCs and weaken the protection of Bitlocker.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            So I guess that the answer is that it isn't possible without disabling the PCRs as the system sees it as a boot device (it is PXE enabled) and since it changes the boot order (though it is listed after the HDD), it will always trigger BitLocker.

    <title>Suspended PC starts up by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airpilot1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suspended PC starts up by itself</h2>
                    Greetings:<br />
<br />
I have two HP Pavilion HPE h8-1360t PC's running Win7 Pro on Core i7-3770 64 bit CPU's, with 16 gig of memory, in a LAN.&nbsp; When I standby/suspend the first one, it stays suspended until I re-awaken it, as it should.&nbsp; But the second PC will not stay suspended&nbsp;
 if the first PC is running.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If the first PC is suspended when I suspend the second one, then the second one stays suspended, but sometimes comes back up all by itself late at night.&nbsp; Since both machines come on for scheduled backups at 3am, then suspend again after the backups are complete,
 I suspect that the second machine is waking up when the first machine starts its backup, is suspending as required by the backup software, then re-awaking because the first machine is still running.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
More:<br />
<br />
If I disconnect the Cat 5 cable to the second PC, then it will not come back up after being suspended, even if the first machine is running.<br />
<br />
After re-connecting the second PC to the LAN, if I then disconnect the Cat 5 from the first machine while it is running, and then suspend the second machine, it stays suspended.&nbsp; If I then plug the Cat 5 back into the first machine, pretty soon the second machine
 comes back up!<br />
<br />
Obviously, something in the first machine is interacting with the second machine, causing it to come up out of suspend when both machines are connected to the LAN and the first machine is running.<br />
<br />
Is there some way I can disable LAN induced wake-ups in the second machine?&nbsp; I still need the machins to awaken on timed events, but how can I make it impervious to LAN events when suspended?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Bottom line - what I think I need is a way to software disconnect or power down my PC's NIC card when the system goes into Standby/Sleep.&nbsp; Isn't there a Registry setting that would do this?&nbsp; I can't find any settings in the Windows 7 UI that would let me do
 this.<br />
<br />
Please Help!&nbsp; Thanks in advice....<br />

<br />
I have fixed this problem.&nbsp; It turns out that all I had to do was open Control Panel &gt;&nbsp; System &gt; Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, then right click on Ethernet Controller, click on&nbsp; Properties &gt; Power Management, and untick the box "Allow this device to wake
 the computer".<br />
<br />

<p>Your card reader is obviously for standard SD cards (up to 4GB). It<br />

<p>Buy a standalone SDHC reader someplace like Amazon.com. They are very<br />

    <title>something keeps stealing focus in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikewhoocares  say:</h3>
<h2>            something keeps stealing focus in windows 7</h2>
                    I was reading <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/53278-63-window-working-randomly-unselect#17993549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread</a> and decided to just post my own, and now I'm posting here because nobody has an answer apparently. I've had the same issue for years, and now that I finally know the term -- focus stealing -- I can articulate it to somebody.<br />
<br />
This has been going on for several years with my Windows 7 comp, and it's gone from annoying to almost infuriating. I'll be playing a game, or working on a document, or watching a video, or reading something online, or whatever, when Windows clicks and the
 active window loses focus for about a second, then gives it back. If I'm watching a video with VLC fullscreen, the taskbar comes to the front when it happens, and I have to click the video to go back to fullscreen. If I'm playing a game, it screws the controls
 up and gets me killed (or minimizes the game and goes back to the desktop, and I have to click the taskbar icon to get back in, where again my controls are often screwed up). If I'm writing online or in a word processor, it interrupts my writing mid-sentence,
 and I have to wait (or worse, click again) for focus to return to the document so I can finish what I was trying to say, which totally disrupts my concentration. This would happen every other day and so rarely and randomly that it was impossible to test for.<br />
<br />
For the past few days it has been occurring more frequently, mainly when I'm writing or watching videos, but I'm not sure the applications I'm trying to use really make a difference. It's still impossible to test for because I don't know what's causing it.<br />
<br />
Other threads, including the one I linked, suggested processes and services that are stealing focus, or that it's a keyboard problem. I have never seen any of those processes, and I've used multiple keyboards with this same machine with no difference in the
 focus stealing frequency. I first noticed it after installing Battlefield Heroes and Punkbuster, but both of those have been uninstalled from my hard drive for some time, and still the issue persists.<br />
<br />
There are no visible applications stealing focus when this occurs: nothing I can identify in task manager or taskbar. I can't check the task manager when it happens because it's impossible to determine when it will occur, so I would have to sit and stare at
 the thing for days while waiting for something suspicious to pop up. All the virus scans in the world haven't found the problem, and I've already used Avast and AVG and a few other things I can't recall.<br />
<br />
This appears to be a widespread problem with no real consistent solution, if it has a solution at all. At my wit's end and would like suggestions please.&nbsp; I'm not going to sit and watch my task manager for god knows how many days trying to spot whatever is
 causing the problem. I'm going to take a stab at what <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/windows-lose-focus-seemingly-at-random/43482cc3-cad3-499f-882c-a436b3ec4798">
this thread</a> says, but I have my doubts that it will make a difference, and would appreciate further suggestions. Thanks in advance.

            The first method didn't help at all, unfortunately. I haven't tried safe mode yet, but I'm not sure I see the benefit unless it's just supposed to determine if the problem persists in safe mode. I tried a clean boot and the problem persisted, so I don't
 have much faith that it will work either. I'll try later today, but in the meantime there has to be
<em>some</em> alternative that can weed out the issue.

            <p>UPDATE: Tried using the comp in safe mode for a few hours. I didn't notice the focus-stealing, but I wasn't always there while it was running. If there's no focus-stealing in safe mode, I'm not sure what the significance is.</p>

    <title>Where can I find English UK version of Money Plus Sunset - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where can I find English UK version of Money Plus Sunset</h2>
                    The Microsoft Download area seems only to have a US English version of Microsoft Money Plus Sunset and my data was created on a UK English version which will not load into the US version. Is a UK English version available? The download instructions make
 this problem clear but does not indicate where the UK version can be found and the work around (via a .qif export) is very longwinded for the amount of data I have in my file.

    <title>WIndows 10 Frequent BSOD while running a video game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antonio cumba  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 Frequent BSOD while running a video game</h2>
                    <p>To put it simply, for the past month my PC has been BSOD-ing while gaming once every couple days. It has always happened while playing a video game. I have one dmp file from the last time that it crashed the only information I was able to really obtain and
 understand is that ntoskrnl.exe is named as the cause, however from what I have been reading on here it seems that something else is at fault. I have ran a memtest on both of my ram sticks and stopped after 8 passes with 0 errors. I even reset my PC (but opted
 to keep personal files) and a day later the problem came back like normal. Any help would be appreciated in understanding the dmp files contents as I just don't know what to look for in it.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Probably caused by : ntkrnlmp.exe ( nt!_xmm+dd0 )
<br />
<br />And you are correct that a Windows component is not likely to be the cause of a BSOD.
<br />
<br />Further analysis indicates:

<br />And even those drivers could be forced into fault by the games or other causes such as hardware or heat.
<br />
<br />1. Check with the game maker's support and forums about any known issues.
<br />
<br />2. Check with Nvidia Support, their online docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. If there are no newer drivers you might try reverting back to an older stable version.

<br />
<br />3. Check with MSI Support, their online docs and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major onboard and separate device drivers (see driver update methods below).
<br />

<br />
<br />4. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
<br />
<br />5. After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />Probably a hardware issue, be sure to check the memory very carefully (see methods below).
<br />

<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />Do these again if you did not run them for 4+ hours.
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.

            Thank you so much for the very swift reply! I am currently going through and updating my drivers to a more stable release from a few months back. One driver version I downloaded in December did cause some people BSOD issues. I will update you if any more
 issues arise or if I find anything noteworthy to add for others who may have any issues like mine.&nbsp;

            Alright new update: I ran driver verifier after everything and this time it crashed again, but specifiec the driver as being rzudd.sys, which is for Razer which is my brand of keyboard. So i swapped out my keyboard with a spare generic brand and was able
 to boot back to my PC with verifier still running. As I am trying to upload the new dmp file to either google drive or onedrive it seems to not be letting me at the moment even though a previous dmp file works just fine...I will update on my work to remove
 the razer software and if I can somehow get the dmp file uploaded I will update as well.&nbsp;

            Computer is successfully running with driver verifier on and looking at ALL third party drivers, including Nvidia, and with Razer's drivers deleted. I will be using this keyboard for the next few days to conclude if this was the underlying issue. Thank

            You should not run driver verifier all the time as it can cause instability when there would otherwise be none.
<br />
<br />The razer devices have been known to cause this issue. That is one of the drivers I knew you would need to check since those were 2016 versions. 
<br />
<br />It does seem to be a hardware issue, maybe even heat related. However when it is intermittent it can be very tough to find.
<br />
<br />Please keep me up to date,

<p>Finally had another crash today, this time with a different error in the BSOD. This was a "POOL_CORRUPTION_IN_FILE_AREA" error this time. I am including the dmp file for you to look at. All drivers were wiped out and put back in, I've even been using a different
 keyboard as my Razer drivers caused the BSOD during the verifier test. Again, as per my last memtest that ran for 11 hours, none of my RAM sticks seemed to have any issues. Could it possibly be due to a failing hard drive or SSD? My games are on one hard drive
 while windows is on my SSD.&nbsp;</p>

            I don't see anything indicating it is a drive problem. Have you been having trouble with either? Be sure the SSD has the latest firmware from its maker's site.

 are also on the to do list. Thank you again for all of the help thus far I will be updating come sunday.

            So I ran driver verifier once I got home today and sure enough the steam streaming mic driver caused a BSOD. At this point I feel like im running in circles, first the razer drivers caused a crash during verifier and now this does? I just dont understand
 why. My brother has a computer identical to mine and has no issues. We are thinking of swapping out our video cards to see if it is a hardware issue with my card but other than that being a possibility I dont know what else could be wrong. I used a driver
 uninstaller program to completely wipe all old drivers from my graphics card and I am not installing the newest ones available.&nbsp;

<h2>            avrt.dll error corrupting audio programs</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just yesterday afternoon I was using my computer normally, but when I booted it again a few hours later, programs on my computer like spotify and discord became unusable; discord said the installation was corrupt, spotify said there was an bad image error
 with avrt.dll and nether will work even after reinstalling. Any attempts to repair using sfc/ scannow and DISM repair always fails before being able to complete. I'm frankly clueless as to what else I can do, save sending my computer to a repair shop, as I
 have a lot of work due this week :( Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that a software conflict caused the corruption of some your system files, preventing your audio programs from working properly. We'd like to learn more about your concern so that we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions
 for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which build version of Windows 10 is on your computer? To check, click <strong>
Start</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. For example, 14393.1066.</li><li>Are you using a third-party antivirus program?</li><li>Did you make any changes to your computer before this started happening?</li><li>Just to confirm, are you able to stream audio from the Internet without any problems?</li><li>Have you checked if Groove and Windows Media Player were affected as well?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided. As initial troubleshooting, w<span>e suggest performing a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> to find out if this behavior&nbsp;is&nbsp;</span><span>due to a third-party software conflict</span><span>. Once you're in a clean boot environment, the chances of software conflicts are
 minimized because Windows will only use the essential drivers and programs to run. Check if you still receive the same error.&nbsp;</span><span>If you're able to use your audio programs properly in a clean boot environment, check
 the section&nbsp;</span><span><strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong></span><span>&nbsp;for what to do next.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note</strong></span>: To return your computer back to normal, check the section&nbsp;<span><strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, w<span>e'd also recommend creating a new user profile to check if this is caused by a corrupted user profile. You may find the steps for doing that through this&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Hi Yolvi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I haven't replied recently but I just tried your recommendation and whenever my computer restarted after switching it to clean boot, I kept getting a blue screen with the error code that was something like "MSRPC_state_violation". Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message MSRPC_state_violation implies a driver-related issue. If you can get into the Device Manager, you can simply update the driver automatically. However, since you're getting a blue screen when trying to start your computer, we suggest that
 you download or create an installation media that can be used to get to your PC's Advanced options. Here's the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, what's the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro license vs Windows 10 Pro N - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinn28  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro license vs Windows 10 Pro N</h2>
                    <p>Have recently built a couple of servers with Windows 10 pro and wanted to try Windows 10 pro N to see how it differs. I have however discovered that a normal Windows 10 pro license doesn't work with Windows 10 Pro N.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway I can make this work? Or anywhere I can get just the Activation code for Pro N?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Martin! Unfortunately they are for different regions of the world and are not compatible. That being said, Windows 10 pro N is just windows 10 Pro without Windows Media Player and related technologies pre-installed including Music, Video, Voice Recorder and Skype.
<br />
<br />Hope I could be of assistance.

            Windows 10 Pro N is for customers in Europe and lacks media related technologies. The product key for Windows 10 Pro vs Windows 10 Pro N are different.

            You should make use of periods in your posts instead of running everything on, which makes it difficult to read and understand.&nbsp;&nbsp; The product key for 8.1 may be embedded in the BIOS if 8.1 was an OEM installation you can download and use
<a href="https://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the free tool here</a> to extract the product key.&nbsp; If that doesn't work,&nbsp; and you have no 8.1 or 8.1 Pro product key, you will have to buy one.&nbsp;

            I'll try that method of using the free tool and how would i find the product key. and sorry for the ongoing of sentence's i am just clearly upset that i can't use my laptop. ive been told i don't know how many time's to cal microsoft and asus they couldn't
 help. and like i said im not going to buy a product key im not spending 200$ on a product key i got more important thing's to spend my money on than buy a product key
