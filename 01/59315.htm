                    <p>I had to get a new computer and it came with Windows 10. &nbsp;I use Chrome. &nbsp;Whenever I used to print it would print it right out. &nbsp;Now, I have to save whatever I want to print, go to my download folder and open what I want with Adobe, then print it. &nbsp;Why do
 I have to save it? &nbsp;I'm not a computer person, so be gentle with me when explaining. &nbsp;Thanks for all help.</p>

<h2>            Ethernet Cable Not Responding&#47;Reading Internet Connection</h2>
                    <p>I Have a problem with my Ethernet. I run a windows 8 Laptop, and when I decide to run a decent round of Gaming, I go to my Net Gear Wifi distributor (Ethernet Port Device, to which distributes my WiFi) And plug my newest Ethernet cable into its ports. Well,
 when I began to use this specific cable, after my other one had broken its hinges, I began to have troubles trying to get the Laptop to read the connection between the cables, some time passed, with me removing the cables and reinserting them, not roughly
 but as proper as possible, and now the cable continues to read a an Unidentified network Limited with no internet access. I'm personally thinking of Buying another ethernet cable, and I don't know what to do please help.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I run an expired McAfee<br />
</li><li>The Cable I'm currently using Has the following information Printed On it:<br />

<h2>            Compatibility Issues</h2>
                    My Toshiba Satellite laptop won't pick up my new mp3 player (Grtdhx) when it's plugged in. It's not under 'unknown device' or anything, I've looked everywhere. I've tried Youtube searches and googling, but nothing direction-wise I've found applies to the
 way my laptop is set up. Am I missing some sort of download or is there a way I can make the mp3 player or its USB compatible?<br />

<br />Is the only USB device not recognized, or are there others? (Do you have another to test with?)
<br />
<br />What's the exact model of your Satellite. I'll try to find some driver updates that may help us out. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

<p>black ops clan is a must. looking for people who have experience with using a microphone and playing black ops. must be a fun clan--not full of whiners and newbs or clan hoppers who just joined. hopefully not a new clan but if you are a new clan lets play
 some games together. i am a friendly guy--but i play to win--so i expect the same from you. must be active--at least play games as a party together a couple times a week minimum. hopefully you are an established clan who plays together every day. gamebattles
 or not i do not care--i am experienced with game battles as I used to run a clan called Nothing But Killers on R6V2. i am a 5 star general with a positive k/d ratio and i never camp unless it's for the team. if camping is necessary i will play tactically.
 i play 5-10 hours daily some days. i have been in too many games where people are not playing seriously/people are cheating/people are not communicating which is why i decided to join YOUR clan. i hope you send me a message soon.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <u><b>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</i><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.<br />
<br />

<br />
We have four ataport.sys (ATAPI Driver Extension) calls before a pagefault and then the bug check itself.
<br />
<br />
In addition to the SCSI Port Driver and the Storport Driver, Windows Vista and later versions of the Windows operating system provide the ATA port driver (ataport.sys), a storage port driver that is especially suitable for use with IDE controllers.<br />
<br />
The most significant difference between the ATA port driver and other system-supplied storage port drivers is the protocol that the ATA port driver uses to communicate with other drivers. All other system-supplied storage port drivers use SCSI request blocks
 (SRBs) to communicate both with higher-level drivers, such as storage class drivers, and with miniport drivers. The ATA port driver uses SRBs to communicate with higher-level drivers only. To communicate with its miniport drivers, ATA port uses a packet called
 an IDE request block (IRB), which is defined by the IDE_REQUEST_BLOCK structure. IRBs are better designed than SRBs to the characteristics of ATA devices.<br />
<br />
<u><b>---------------------------------------------------</b></u><br />
<br />
As of right now, it doesn't appear that we're dealing with a hardware issue, likely just a device driver causing corruption.<br />
<br />
Let's go ahead and remove and replace BitDefender with Microsoft Security Essentials for troubleshooting purposes as it may be causing conflicts:<br />
<br />

<br />
<u><b>---------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
</b></u><b><i>If you're still crashing after removing and replacing BD, let's go ahead and enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
</i></b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><u><b>Driver Verifier:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />

<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<h2>            &#91;XBOX X&#93; Fan RPM goes up and down permanently &#40;4K&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i'm a new XBOX (X) Player. Yesterday i bought the box and after a big software update i tested the Box with the "Insect" 4K Demo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case (4k Content) the fan RPM goes up and down <strong>permanently</strong>. Fan Noise is ok. The Problem is really annoying because the fluctuating fan sound&nbsp;pushes itself into the foreground. imho a more stable fan noise would be&nbsp;significantly
 better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyone else has this problem? perhaps a hardware issue...power savings setting...?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hello albernerHelge,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'm very sorry to hear that you have come across this issue and I completely&nbsp;understand why this may be&nbsp;frustrating.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Firstly;</strong> Sometimes, even when new, the fans may have dust in them or the screw holding the fan down may be to tight causing that the fan motor needs to work harder. I have previously had this issue before and I took it to a Games Console
 repair store and they fix it completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Secondly;&nbsp;</strong>Even when running 4K on The Xbox One X, it does cause the loudness of the fan and RPM to increase because the Xbox One X is using lots of RAM, CPU and GPU due to lots of pixels being to displayed, but not that long ago this design-floor
 was resolved and no one should be suffering from this anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have helped you today and leaving some feedback would be really appreciated.</p>
<p>Kindest Regards,</p>
<p>Kieran David</p>

<p>If it's of any help: My Xbox One X also turns the fan on and off periodically when rendering 4K games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware designers probably were of the opinion, that a constantly faster spinning fan is more annoying than a temporarily faster spinning fan every now and then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this behaviour is by design and not an error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is, that 4K content requires more processing power, generating more heat. Heat which has to be dissipated by more airflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the noise of the fan is that disturbing, your only solutions are to turn up the volume of your TV or surround sound system, or to use headphones that you plug into your controller's headset plug, which has the advantage, that you can turn on Windows Sonic
 for Headphones, which will then give you spatial 3D audio, just like Dolby Atmos, without the need for a high end surround system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt GOTY is another I've noticed make the fans spin up, but not as much as RDR2 which seemed to constantly spin when there was lots going on.</p>

<p>I think you got me wrong. Its not happening "every now and then". The fan(s) spinning up and down PERMANENTLY... every one or two seconds...the whole time i play 4k content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i know that 4k rendering produces a lot of heat and fans are spinning up...thats not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In approximately 20 years of PC Gaming i never see/hear such a behavior.</p>

</p><p>I think i will contact the repair center...like user "Kieran David".</p>

<p>Well, in 20 years of PC gaming, you probably also didn't have a vapor chamber as a cooling assembly. Also, you probably didn't use an office laptop for gaming. The laptops we have at work do the same when taxing applications run on them. Instead of the fan
 constantly running, they let the CPU getting warm until a certain threshold, and then spin the fans until the temperature drops under that threshold, then stop, wait until temperature is up again, then stop and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the noise that you hear, as my two Xbox One X (Scorpio Edition) consoles do the same, depending on the game running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it's 10 to 20 seconds until the fan spins up, or as you say every one or two seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no hardware engineer, but maybe the vapor chamber reqires the temperature to rise and fall in intervals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way: The fan turning on and off is normal behaviour. Unless you hear the fan rattling, you'd just probably waste time sending it in for repairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>The fans doesnt stop &amp; go...they change their speed like a sine wave. every 1 or 2 seconds. for example 3000 rpm....5000 rpm...3000...5000...and so on. That sounds awful. I'd rather if the fans are working the whole time @ 5000. That would protect my nerves.

<p><br />
I've never heard such a behavior (never ending sinus wave) before.&nbsp;It sounds more like a software/firmware problem.&nbsp;</p>

            I also have a xbox one x, my fan only gets loud when i play a xbox one x enhanced game, i will say ever since i got it in a more aired out space it seems to be fine now, also make sure to clean the dust off and out of it.

<p>Is your xbox in a well ventilated space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, if I'd just purchased it I'd consider returning it for exchange and not risk it burning out on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a One X and never notice that much of a difference in fan noise, even if I'm running 4k, Enhanced, or UHD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without hearing it I would not consider the described behavior "normal".</p>

 still exists.. I think the problem is with my graphics card.. Is there any solution to this problem except for buying a new graphics card??

    <title>LOCKED - Issues with gamerscore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            LOCKED - Issues with gamerscore</h2>
                    
<p>I have posted in several different places, unsure of which is correct.</p>
<p>I called xbox support about this, and I was given a reference number to use. Since the website has been changed so much, I am unsure as to how to use it. But its 115 697 2281.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, to the point. My gamerscore has been reset. It didn't really bother me at first, as I thought I could just get the achievments back, as I like a challenge. But I soon found out I could get them back, however they didn't count or show up on my profile.</p>
<p>As to the exact reason why it was reset, I am unsure. But my guess is that they suspected me of modding my gamerscore. I'm not even smart enough to know how to do that. I lack the skill and cause to do such. I like earning achievments, which can be a challenge,
 but nevertheless is fun. As a loyal xbox player and a big spender when it comes to microsoft products, I feel cheated by this. The issue of it being reset isn't the deal, its just the fact that I cannot get the achievments back (and have them count) that I
 had at the time of the reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I request is not to be given my gamerscore back, but rather be able to get my achievments back. I don't like playing a game and an achievment(s) pop up every single time I play it. Such as Lost Odyssey, as where everytime I play it, it pops
 up with something like "27 for 750G". I worked hard for those few achievments I had, it being a 4 disc long game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my appeal is this; please just allow me to get back my achievments I had before, and nothing more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time</p>
<p>-DeathByDespair</p>

<p><span>Gamer score resets are not given without overwhelming proof of foul play. It doesn't matter if you modded one achievement or many achievements. There is no appeal process for gamer score resets. Your only
 recourse, if you want to be able to earn achievements on games played prior to the reset, is to create a new account and start over.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So long as you don't change consoles your new account will be able to share the old accounts DLC, avatar items excluded. And no, nothing is transferable from one account to another including; gamer score,
 ms points, Live time, download content and certain game saves. The latter can only be done if the Game Developer allows for this in their game and the ability to earn achievements from that game save is automatically disabled.

<p>Microsoft doesn't have to have a reason. They have billions more than everybody else does. If you may think so or not, money corrupts people. If they do have this proof, I want to see it. You can't just say you have evidence when you arent going to put it
 foward.</p>
<p>I can go to court and say I have a video of a crime and not put forth the evidence, it wont hold up. So why can MS say "Oh yeah well we have evidence, but you will never ever see proof of its existance"? I will tell you why. They have so much money that
 they can do it.</p>
<p>And as for another one of your comments, I didn't even mod ONE achievment. I DIDNT mod ANY of it. Please read before you post, as I stated I neither have the knowledge of how to do it, nor have I a reason to learn how to do so, or even have it done.</p>

<p><span>If your account was compromised you should contact support for your region and have them start an UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS INVESTIGATION, at which time they will lock the account until it is complete, usually
 within 7-30 business days. If it is found that your account was indeed out of your control during the gamer score modification then the CHEATER watermark will be removed. However the reset would stand as issued since unauthorized methods were used to alter
 the gamer score. <br />

<p><span>In the end we are responsible for our accounts at all times. That is why it is so important to keep your account information PRIVATE. Don't give any of it out to friends, family and most certainly not strangers.&nbsp;

<p>Well the way I look at it, Microsoft owns your soul the second you accept any kind of agreement with them. Since they own your soul, they will make you believe whatever they want you to believe.</p>
<p>and Roach...</p>
<p>Thats the thing the Coc that you agreed to when you signed up explained that they do not have to show you proof of anything. &nbsp;Weather you or your "brother" or "you were hacked and they did it" modded the score doesen't matter, they had proof, they reset,
 the end</p>
<p>They do that because they own your soul. They are basically saying, you are signing your soul away and we dont have to show you proof just in case we dont have any. We can say we do because we have billions more then you will ever dream of having. Also,
 PLEASE READ. Did I say I was hacked? Nein. Did I say my brother did it? NEIN. READ THE POST BEFORE YOU REPLY</p>

<p>I put those in quotations because they are the most common excuses, not saying it pertained to you directly. &nbsp;I was simply pointing out that no matter the cause for the reset it is permanent. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason MS puts it in their Code of Conduct is so they have a way around it if they don't have proof. I know MS gets off at reseting/banning people. I would if I worked for them</p>

    <title>Skype online meeting &#40;Screen Sharing Option&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype online meeting &#40;Screen Sharing Option&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our company we are continuously using microsoft teams online meeting, however when we try to have a meeting with someone that is outside the organization (a guest) when we are in the video conferencing the other person can not share their screen. We can
 speak and see each other but the other person that is having the meeting in a web browser does not have the screen share option activated. I mean the option is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for business is not an option because the attendees have to download a plugin in order to have the video conferencing in a web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen sharing option is a must have option for our organization, so that is why we tried using our skype personal accounts since there is an option to invite guests without them to have to download skype desktop client by using a link so they can join
 using a web browser, the video and voice meeting works, however they can not share their screen. Only me the person that is creating the link from a desktop client. I can share my screen from my desktop client, but the purpose is for them to be able to share
 their screen as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a deal breaker for our organization, we want to keep using microsoft applications, because we know there are other apps in the market that have online video meetings with the screen sharing option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward for you to provide me a solution here.</p>

<p>Hi Yader Chavarria,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to be a <strong>presenter</strong> in a Skype Meeting to share your screen. If the option is grayed out or you see a message that says "Sharing controls are disabled by policy," ask one of the presenters to give you
<strong>presenter access</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this is not the correct place to post this, please direct me to the correct ventures...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I was having extreme troubles with XBL last night (1/09/2011) so after hours of frustration trying to fix the issue, I stopped my automatic payments. After a short while everything was back to normal so I renewed my account. My original expiry date was
 2/09/2011 and after adding a new renew my expiry date was 2/10/2011. Last night I was charged 10.34 CAD, and tonight was I charged another 10.34 CAD and to me this makes no sense. Because if I was to just leave the account alone last night, my expiry date
 would have been the same yet I still should have only been charged once. To me, I was obviously double charged and I want this fixed. If anyone can point me a direction in getting this fixed, preferably not involving phone calls, I would appreciate it. Thanks.</p>

<p>What probably happened is the automatic payment was going though at the same time you were making your purchase. You can stack up to three years of LIVE time at once. If you want to dispute this, call up phone support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>).
 Otherwise, the time will stay on your account and you won't be charged next year. So really it's up to you, but my feeling here is you will get two year's worth of time here.

<p><strong><span><span>Hi danielevillatoro,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
I would suggest you to check the following settings.<br />
</span></span></strong><strong><span><span>No Power
<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>1. Check the connection to the wall outlet. Most speakers and subwoofers have a light showing there is power when they are turned on.
</span><strong><br />
</strong><span><span>2. Check to see if your subwoofer has a fuse, and if it does check the fuse to make sure it is ok.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>One or two of the speakers do not work
<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>1. Check to make sure they are getting power
</span><strong><br />
</strong><span><span>2. Check the connections from the back of the computer to the speakers. The speakers should connect to the line-out jack on the back of the computer.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Crackling Sound
<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span>1. Check the cables and make sure they are firmly connected between line-out plug on the back of the computer and the speakers. If you have powered speakers
 and connect them to the "speaker out" connector you can get Crackling. </span><strong><br />
</strong><span><span>2. Also, check the volume control in Windows and make sure that it is not set more than half-way
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Radio Feedback
<br />
</span></span></strong><span><span><span>1. Move the speakers in a different location or rotate them to see if it helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><br />
</strong><span><span>2. Buy cables that have better shielding.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Static Noise
<br />
</span></strong><span>1. Make sure you are using the Line-out plug on the back of the computer.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Popping Sounds
<br />
</span></strong><span>1. Check All speaker cables for proper connections.
<strong><br />
</strong>2. Move the speaker wires away from other cables. <strong><br />
</strong>3. Plug the speaker AC adapter into a different outlet <strong>
<br />
</strong>4. Buy a pack of ferrite beads that attach to your speaker wires which filter out noise<br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to run hardware troubleshooter.<br />
</span><span><span><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>troubleshooter</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></span></span><span><span>. Under
</span></span><span><span><strong>Hardware and Sound</strong></span></span><span><span>, click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Configure a device</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span>‌</span><span><span>&nbsp;If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
</span></span></span><span><br />

    <title>Windows Vista - cannot refresh thumbnail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awgie dawgie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista - cannot refresh thumbnail</h2>
                    I am running Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; I have a file that was originally saved with an html extension that I changed to a gif.&nbsp; Trouble is, html files do not show a thumbnail image in Explorer, so now that I have changed the extension, it still only shows me
 just&nbsp;an icon, not a thumbnail.<br />
<br />
In XP, there was a right-click option to 'refresh thumbnail,' but in Vista there is no such option.&nbsp; I know I can delete the entire thumbnail cache, but I don't want to have to do that when only one file's thumb is messed up.&nbsp; Is there a way to refresh thumbnails
 on a per-file basis?

<p>Don't feel too bad.&nbsp; I've searched for a lot more than 3 hours and didn't come up with any more than you did.&nbsp; The fact that you searched for 3 hours is a great credit to your character.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The &nbsp;Disk Cleanup tool in Windows Vista has the same effect as deleting the thumbnail cache files manually, which believe it or not, I knew how to do<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before</span> I ever ran the Cleanup tool.&nbsp; It takes you right back
 to square one, and you have to rebuild the entire cache from scratch.&nbsp; Your suggestion to "open each folder once and let it run overnight to rebuild the cache while you are sleepting" is quasi-humorous, but not feasible.&nbsp; The thumbnails are only generated
 once the files become visible, so you'd have to not only open each folder (I have probably a few hundred), but you would also have to scroll all the way through each of them.&nbsp; If that were all there was to it, it would still be a daunting task.&nbsp; However, as
 soon as you browse away from the folder, the thumbnails stop loading for that folder, so you would have to have an open Explorer window for each folder, and you'd have to have scrolled through every one of them.&nbsp; Even if I thought my system could handle a
 hundred active windows at once, I'm not entirely certain my brain could, so I think that option is out.&nbsp; My thumbnail cache is 1.76GB.&nbsp; Imagine how small a thumbnail's footprint is, and then divide that tiny little number into 1.9 TRILLION bytes, and you see
 why I don't want to delete my cache.&nbsp; I am presently in the process of reorganizing my photo library, that extends back nearly 20 years.&nbsp; Perhaps when I finish that, I will rebuild my cache, as I'm sure there are dead entries in it due to my moving and deleting
 files.&nbsp; Of course, had I realized 20 years ago how big my library could get (I'm a bit of a shutterbug), I would have organized it better from the start.</p>
<p>I had thought of a rationale, albeit a faulty one, for Vista's not having the Refresh Thumbnail option.&nbsp; In XP, every folder's thumbnail cache was contained in a separate system file called thumbs.db, and stored in that folder.&nbsp; Vista stores all the thumbnails
 in one central location.&nbsp; Now anyone who didn't think about it too much could accept that because the cache is stored in one location, Windows can't simply go in and delete the old entry and generate a new one.&nbsp; That is the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span>
 excuse I can imagine them having for their removing a feature, when progress typically dictates adding features.&nbsp; The trouble with that argument is that Windows<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">could</span> do exactly that.&nbsp; If each thumbnail were alotted
 a set number of bytes, the old thumbnail could simply be overwritten by the new one, so Windows would not have to re-save 1.76GB, but could simply rewrite a few KB.&nbsp; We were doing direct access reads and writes to disks 30 years ago - you know they can do
 them now.&nbsp; Obviously, Windows can access the thumbnails in a very short amount of time when it loads a folder, so it doesn't have to be a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet somehow&nbsp;it is.</p>
<p>Your third suggestion is a free plug-in from a line of software called Real World - that's what the "rw" in the URL stands for - which I find ironic, since for anyone running even Windows XP, most of the image types the plug-in can extract thumbnails for
 are already handled as standard thumbnails.&nbsp; There are only a few specialized types for which I could see it being useful.&nbsp; Of course, it's the whole range of software programs that is named "Real World", so it's not really a misnomer.&nbsp; It's mention of there
 being no Refresh option in Vista, and of the Cleanup tool, is just letting you know that deleting the cache is the only provision Windows Vista makes for rebuilding thumbnails.</p>
<p>You may have noticed I skipped over the second option.&nbsp; I did that to save the best for last.&nbsp; I marked your post helpful (you're welcome) for the second option.&nbsp; No, my question was not answered by any means, but it did help me solve another problem that
 hadn't irritated me enough to ask about.&nbsp; All of my video files show thumbnails<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">except</span> MP4's, which I found strangely annoying.&nbsp; More than just strangely annoying in fact, if I browsed to an MP4 on an external
 drive, and then tried to safely remove that drive two hours later, Windows would tell me it could not stop my volume, or some such bilge-water.&nbsp; Upon examining Process Explorer, I discovered that Explorer still had a handle on every single MP4 I had browsed
 to, even if I never opened them or even clicked on them.&nbsp; To eject the drive, I had to kill Explorer and then remove the drive, and then restart Explorer.&nbsp; Turned out that somehow an improper value had been assigned to the thumbnail handler in the Registry.&nbsp;
 I put the correct value in, and everything was beautiful again with all my MP4's -something for which I am quite happy, since my camera stores video in MP4 format.&nbsp; So again, thank you.</p>
<p>And if that weren't enough, I also marked it helpful for a second reason.&nbsp; The&nbsp;article you referenced is a wealth of useful information.&nbsp; It shows you how to turn thumbnails on and off manually for images or video (you have to do it manually if you want
 thumbnails for one&nbsp;but not the other).&nbsp; It shows you how to enable thumbnail views on a per-filetype basis.&nbsp; Lots more if you are still running a machine on XP, but would like your thumbnails to look more like Vista.&nbsp; He even includes a link to the
<em>K-lite MegaCodec Pack, </em>which is essential to seeing thumbnails for many video formats, such as Flash video, DivX, etc., not to mention being equally important to being able to watch all those videos in Windows Media Player, instead of needing three
 or four different players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But besides thumbnail issues, he includes links to other useful software, like the best free image viewing/manipulating program I have ever used, and have been using for many years - IrfanView.&nbsp; There is a file property and attribute editor called Properties
 Plus.&nbsp; According to the readme file, the program is 12 years old, but it still works beautifully for modifying file date/time.&nbsp; He also includes both of the only two free utilities I have found so far that allow the user to change the time of day a photo was
 taken.&nbsp; Windows Vista has a built-in EXIF editor that allows you to change the date taken, but will not let you change the time.&nbsp; Oh, I could keep going - I'm only halfway through his post - but if I keep going on his post, I won't get to my surprising discovery.&nbsp;
 Which is...</p>
<p>Back to the original issue...</p>
<p>I did&nbsp;come up with&nbsp;two different work-arounds that&nbsp;would help with the problem, even though I have not found the solution I am really&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;yet.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;thought of them both in the middle of typing this message.&nbsp; Which method to use depends on whether
 you've viewed the folder containing the file(s)</p>
<ul>
<li>If you <strong>have</strong> already viewed the folder and suddenly realized too late that the extensions are wrong:&nbsp;First, fix the extensions.&nbsp; If you have a lot of files to fix, like I did,&nbsp;you can use a utility to speed things up.&nbsp; I use Bulk Renaming
 Utility.&nbsp; Once the extensions are corrected, select the file(s) and using the<strong>right</strong>(secondary) mouse button, drag the files back onto themselves, and select Copy Here from the pop-up menu.&nbsp; What you'll get are exact copies of the files in the
 same folder, except the copies will generate a new thumbnail because they are new files.&nbsp; The problem is, once Vista has assigned a thumbnail to a file, it will not assign a new one.&nbsp; That's where the Refresh Thumbnail option in XP was so useful.&nbsp; So from
 my own example, if the extension is .html, then Vista says "there is no thumbnail, so just&nbsp;use the default icon for that file type."&nbsp; If I simply change the extension, Vista notes that change in the thumbnail cache, so it still gets just the default icon.&nbsp;
 By copying the files, I create new files, which Vista will then correctly create thumbnails for.&nbsp; Then, I can delete the original files, and use Bulk Renaming Utility to remove the " - Copy" suffix from the corrected files.&nbsp; The downside to this, apart from
 the fact that it's cumbersome, is that the new files will all have the date and time you created the copies, not the original file date and time.&nbsp; The copies should retain all of the EXIF data from the originals.</li><li>If you have <strong>not</strong> viewed the folder yet in Explorer or in any file dialog such as a Save or Open dialog, it is much easier.&nbsp; Open a command prompt (for those joining the broadcast already in progress, click on the Start button, then in the
 search box, type "cmd" (without the quotes) and press enter).&nbsp; If you started it in Administrator mode, the prompt will say "C:\Windows\System32&gt;"&nbsp; If you started it in standard mode, it will read "C:\Users\<em>your_name</em>&gt;"&nbsp; Where
<em>your_name </em>actually would show your user name for Windows. &nbsp;Navigate in the command prompt window to the folder containing the files with the incorrect extensions.&nbsp; For example, if the files are in a subfolder called "Blizzard of 2010" under your Pictures
 folder, and you are in your user folder, type "CD Pictures\Blizzard of 2010" and hit enter.&nbsp; If you are in the System32 folder, type "CD\Users\<em>your_name</em>\Pictures\Blizzard of 2010" instead.&nbsp; From my own example again, the incorrect extension of all
 the files is .html, and it should be .gif, so at the command prompt, type "RENAME *.HTML *.GIF" and press enter.&nbsp; If there was only one folder to fix, you're done with the command window and can type "exit" and press enter to close it.&nbsp; Because you had not
 yet viewed the folder in Explorer, Vista had not yet handled the thumbnails for the files, and so it can generate them correctly the first time.&nbsp; No files to erase, and no files that need to be renamed a second time.&nbsp; And the files retain their original created
 and modified dates. </li><li>Alternate to option 1 - don't change the file extensions first.&nbsp; Instead do option 2, but in place&nbsp;of "RENAME *.HTML *.GIF" type "COPY *.HTML *.GIF" - by copying from one extension to the other, and without specifying a different destination, you will create
 copies already having the correct extension.&nbsp; Then you can use Explorer and delete the files with the wrong extension, and you won't have to rename them a second time to remove " - Copy" from the end, because it's not there.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>No, it's not a perfect substitute for the Refresh Thumbnail shell extension that was there in XP, but it still beats a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.&nbsp; And for my own purposes of having downloaded ten years' worth of daily comics - all 3,699 files being
 perfectly good GIF files with the wrong extension - and considering I am equally comfortable operating in DOS as in Windows, the second option I just proposed would have been just as easy as highliting all the files in Explorer and hitting Refresh Thumbnail.&nbsp;
 But that's just me.&nbsp; Now ask me why I didn't think of it three months ago when I really needed it.</p>
<p>You ever have one of those days when you're driving across town, and you suddenly remember where in the garage you put the flashlight that you searched for all night when the power was out last Christmas?&nbsp; Well, that's how I feel right now.&nbsp; I've been racking
 my brain for three months and coming up empty, and now poor Lorien has gotten in on the act, and suddenly in less than an hour I came up with the first two options, and as soon as I posted it, I opened it right back up and added the alternate.&nbsp; I could just
 kick myself - but my foot won't reach my head, so why bother?</p>
