<h2>            Recent issue with Share System Sound when on a call</h2>
                    Please help.&nbsp; This is a very recent issue.&nbsp; It started a couple of days ago as over the weekend we were able to hear each other's system sounds when streaming things and sharing screen with each other.&nbsp; Yesterday while sharing screen and sharing system
 sound, the volume was lost.&nbsp; It took going through various obstacles to get it working again. Sometimes refreshing Skype refreshed the sound. But our issue is this:&nbsp; Once Skype got it working properly to where the sound stopped cutting out, it was great.&nbsp;
 Now it's back to the sound cutting out after 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes tops.&nbsp; This hasn't happened since share system sound was first introduced.&nbsp; Skype went backward in the sound department.&nbsp; It's quite annoying to be streaming something only to lose
 the sound and have to refresh so often. It's tiresome and really aggravating.&nbsp;Please fix this issue!!! I don't care if you fix share system sound or allow us to hear each others spea

<p>I can't use a different internet connection as I only have the one.&nbsp; But I will try the rest of the suggestions. It may not be until after the Christmas, but I will let you know if that helped.&nbsp; Apparently, he is now able to play something on his system
 and I can hear it without the share sound again but he still can't hear mine without the share sound and the volume still cuts out. I'll let you know how your suggestion works.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks. Happy Christmas.</p>

<p>Hi!&nbsp; I've finally had the chance to do the above steps.&nbsp; I am having a problem locating the shared file as I have a few shared files under the App/Roaming/Skype.&nbsp; See image below.&nbsp; Which do I delete?&nbsp; I am able to hear his sounds that he plays over his computer
 without having to even share system sound now. But he still cannot hear my sounds.&nbsp; This makes zero sense at all since we are both using the same version of Skype and our settings are the exact same settings.&nbsp;<br />

<p>As for losing time due to a suspension, there is nothing that can be done for that. &nbsp;Upon a suspension, whether it be for an enforcement or billing action, you lose the amount of time on a Gold membership that the suspension existed. &nbsp;The is stated in the ToU and CoC that you agreed to upon signing up for Live.</p>

            Could you describe exactly what you are trying to do? Do you want to insert a picture of a rose in in WordPad?
<br />
<br />You won't be able to make it a background, but you can right click a picture in Photos app, click Paste, then open WordPad (Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; WordPad), then click Paste. 
<br />
<br />If you want to use a picture as a background you need to use a word processor such as Microsoft Word which includes that capability.

<h2>            New message alert, but no new messages</h2>
                    For the past few days, every time I check my Outlook email on a laptop or desktop, I get a notification in the Skype widget informing me that I have one new message. But when I go to Skype, I see no new messages at all. The last message I received is from
 September 2017, and that's the last time I used Skype! Why is this happening?

            Yes, I'm getting the notification from the Skype icon in Outlook, and only there. When I click on the icon, all I see are old, previously read messages from last year - nothing new. I can't see a message or anything else that appears to be triggering the
 notification. This is the case when I look at the notifications within Outlook and directly on Skype.

            I resolved this. It looked like the "new" message was from a Skype bot (even though the message was dated November of 2017). I wasn't able to delete the message, so I blocked that particular bot instead. That made the message disappear, and now I'm not
 receiving the "new message" notification. I still don't understand why I received a new message notification 6 months after the message was sent (and not before). Or why I couldn't delete that message. But as long as I'm not seeing the notification anymore,
 I'm satisfied.

<p>You may have not opened that old message before, giving you a new message notification.

            Well, I tried deleting the folder again, and everything with Origin... and it suddenly worked. I downloaded Origin again, and it installed successfully, and I can now access my games again.

<h3> johncalligan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade and activation problems Windows 10</h2>
                    Reserved a copy on a Dell E6510 laptop, got the notice my device was compatible and that the upgrade was ready.&nbsp; Started the process and my laptop was rendered non useable.&nbsp; It said I needed to restore from my original recovery disks.&nbsp; This was my laptop
 from my job and it had Windows 7 Enterprise on it, I didn't realize that at the time.&nbsp; Anyway I burned a clean copy of Windows 10 and started to install.&nbsp; All seems to have gone fine.&nbsp; Now I can't get it to activate.&nbsp; Computer is functional except for the
 activation process.&nbsp; How do I activate this copy of Windows 10?&nbsp; I have the 1 laptop and 3 PCs that have the same version of Windows 7 Ultimate, is this going to happen to the remaining 3 PCs?

            <p>I don't think Windows 7 Enterprise edition was eligible for the free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>from this link (near the bottom, in the Upgrade Editions section):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Some editions are excluded: Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8/8.1 Enterprise, and Windows RT/RT 8.1. Active Software Assurance customers in volume licensing have the benefit to upgrade to Windows 10 Enterprise offerings outside of this offer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you did a clean Windows 10 install, you need a purchased product key unless you complete the upgrade process from your old OS.&nbsp; Since your old OS was ineligible and the upgrade didn't complete, the fresh install is not going to activate without purchasing
 a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you are hosed because you had Win 7 Enterprise.&nbsp; My suggestion would be to take it back to Win 7 Enterprise or buy a Win 10 key.&nbsp; Unless as the above states you have an active software assurance plan there might be something you can check into there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 Ultimate machines should be fine, they will get Windows 10 Pro (there is no more ultimate).&nbsp; But make sure you run setup.exe from the Win 7 OS using the install media you create with the media creation tool, select Win 10 Pro x32 or x64 as
 appropriate.&nbsp; Do not boot the install media otherwise you get an unactivated clean install.&nbsp; Once the upgrade completes and those devices are activated, then you are free to do clean installs on them if you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suggest doing an image backup on them first if you can, just in case!</p>

 HDD partitioned into two sections. I backed up my personal files to the second partition (the one without Windows) and then tried to do a repair of the Windows installation. That didn't help, so I just wiped that first partition and did a fresh install of
 Windows. Everything seemed to be working great, no errors, no BSOD, nothing. So I moved back my personal files to the partition with windows on it (my second partition is where I hold all my games) and called it a night after I had gotten everything back to
 normal.</span><br />

            <b>We really need the DMP files as they contain the events leading up to the crash<br />
<br />
The NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM bug check has a value of 0x00000024. This indicates a problem occurred in ntfs.sys, the driver file that allows the system to read and write to NTFS drives.<br />
<br />
Cause</b><br />
<br />
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is disk corruption. Corruption in the NTFS file system or bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk can induce this error. Corrupted SCSI and IDE drivers can also adversely affect the system's ability to read and write to
 disk, thus causing the error.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low, another kernel-mode
 driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.</b>

<p>I'm seriously annoyed because I can't send party invites to my friends but THEY CAN! I have no idea what's going on! Please Help! I have been through this before when it was both me and my friends but now its just me.</p>

<p>And Yes it does say Xbox LIVE Status Service Alert, "Some people may be having troubles receiving Beacon notifications.</p>
<p>But I am having problems sending Party Invites. PLEASE HELP</p>

<p>I can't access Mottos, usually the Mottos appear right on my friends list but they aren't appearing and that's what happened last time I had this issue. I also can't access profiles because all it shows is no gamer pic no rep and no Gamerscore.</p>

<p>it did let me send an invite, but I can't see mottos, or anything, via the friends list or clicking on individual profiles. I can get gamerpics and stuff, but it loads slower than normally. This is definitely an Xbox Live issue.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you still have the RECOVERY partition to restore it to AS NEW...there should be a program on the computer to launch the process, or a key to hit when powering on the computer...No disks required if the partition is still there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process is provided by the computer manufacturer, and varies by company and\or model, so I can't be more specific</p>

<h2>            Does the Outlook Mail app on windows 10 mobile support new outlook.com&#39;s Exchange protocol&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Four of my five main outlook.com emails have already been migrated to the new Exchange protocol (EAS 16.0 ?), which comes with calendar syncing improvements and most importantly, Draft folder syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the outlook mail app on windows 10 mobile support the outlook.com's new Exchange protocol?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm asking because when I tried to add one of my migrated emails on my phone, I got an error that it's not supported. I chose the "Exchange" option in the "add an account" menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choosing the "outlook.com" option seems to connect through the old EAS protocol, which doesn't support Draft syncing.</p>

</p><p>Yes, Windows 10 Mail App supports EAS (Exchange Active Sync Protocol). Please be informed, there are a number of different symptoms for synchronization issues. The steps to fix the problem will change based on what you're seeing in the Mail and Calendar
 apps. The first step you should take to resolve any issue is to check for updates to Windows 10 and the Mail app. After this,&nbsp;I suggest you to try the steps provided in the link below and check if you are configure your upgraded Outlook.com accounts in Windows
 10 Mail App.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but&nbsp;you misunderstood my post, which seems to be happening a lot lately in different places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the Outlook mail app supports EAS, but does it support the latest EAS 16.0
<em>(maybe it's not EAS 16.0, but what ever it is, it's not the old EAS 14.0 or 14.1)</em>, or to be specific, does it support the new Exchange platform that the NEW outlook.com (which is rolling out right now) is using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can set it up on my phone IF I choose the "outlook.com" option, but that connects through the old EAS protocol that doesn't do Drafts syncing.&nbsp;When&nbsp;I choose the
<strong>"Exchange"</strong> option, which should&nbsp;do Drafts syncing, it doesn't set up and shows an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the error: <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/220367f0-a889-4f0c-90c3-171291fa40c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Jeff, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What happens when you add the back-ground? </p>
<p>2. Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>4. Is your Windows activated? You may check the status <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2806745/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;(This article also applies to Windows 8.1). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue. Perform the steps provided here and check.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the copy of Windows is activated, you may try updating the graphics card drivers and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Follow the steps to update the graphics card driver:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
a. Press Windows <strong><span>key + X</span></strong> key and click on <font><b>Device manager</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Search for <strong><span>Display Adapters.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Right-click on the <font><b>graphics card</b> and click on
<b>Update driver software</b>.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would also&nbsp;suggest you to manually download and install the driver by visiting computer Manufacturer website.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

<p><br />
Go to the Lexmark site and download both the drivers...32 and 64 bit,&nbsp; since you don't specify what bit win you're using I'm not going to assume either.&nbsp; Find your model under&nbsp;Lexmark's "Support" options.&nbsp; Had to do that myself, I'm using their x2690 model.&nbsp;

                    Each time I restart my computer it defaults back to 256 colors.&nbsp; Each time I go into the screen resolution controls and set the monitor color to "True Color 32-bit" even though it's a 64-bit system--I set it here because it is the best and there is not
 a 64-bit option.&nbsp; How can I get it to stay there?&nbsp; Adjust something in the start-up menu?<br />

    <title>Open windows shift to primary monitor after monitors have been off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a_scribe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Open windows shift to primary monitor after monitors have been off</h2>
                    <p>I am reposting this after not getting a reply on an earlier thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 connected to two monitors via Display Ports (using NVIDIA graphics card GeForceGTX970). My PC is an HP Envy 750-250na. I have set the monitors to sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity, but not the PC (for the moment). Every
 time I return to the displays and switch them back on, all the active windows have moved to the primary (first) monitor. I suspect this is a Windows problem - there are several threads about similar things happening for both Windows 7 and Windows 10 (e.g.
 http://superuser.com/questions/956103/windows-10-windows-all-return-to-main-monitor-on-sleep).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a fix for this - please explain it in layperson's terms as far as possible, as I'm not a techie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help, Anup Karkal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just solved the problem by using the power options of the PC only and disabling those of the monitors so that the computer and monitors go to sleep in the right sequenceand then wake up in the correct reverse sequence. The problem, I think, is to
 do with which monitor goes off first, after which all the windows move automatically to the other monitor and/or the reverse for when the monitors wake up. Disabling the sleep option on the monitors has done the trick for me. Hopefully it will help others
 with a similar problem.</p>
