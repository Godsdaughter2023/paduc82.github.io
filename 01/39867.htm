<h2>            Xbox One Account Wiped of Points And Gamertag</h2>
                    <p>So I haven't been on the Xbox in a long time (since my brother hogs it) and i have noticed that all of the families accounts have been wiped off except for a new account made by my brother. Normally it would have me, my brother and my dads accounts but there was only one left. When i tried to sign in to my account it started out as if i was a new profile with my gamer tag being changed and so as my points.Keeping in mind that all my games were still installed on to the xbox.&nbsp;I tried all these other accounts but none of them seemed to work. My brother said his mic was broken so he searched a video and it said to reset the Xbox. I don't know if it has to do something with this or maybe something else. PLS HELP I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIX THIS FOR A FEW DAYS NOW. any feedback would help.</p>

                    I made the mistake a while ago when making an account putting it under my old one as a child. I have the Xbox One and it was the first time I ever used one before in my life. Is there a way to merge the parent account with the child, or make the child
 independent? I just recently turned 18, and saw something close to this, but if I do that method I need documentation to prove my age. Why kind of documents are needed for it, and how do I submit them as proof?

<p>Hi BerryCute,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some factors that we need to consider before managing parent and child accounts. If you need to remove someone from your Microsoft family (Using the parent account), it's important that you first&nbsp;turn off all&nbsp;family settings for anyone labeled
 as a <strong>child</strong>, or some settings&nbsp;may still apply. You may refer to this

<h2>            Vista Home Premium 64 bit update to SP2</h2>
                    Asking this in behalf of my son, whose new laptop is being told this is an 'important' update.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Are there any issues about this update that a person needs to be aware of before taking the plunge?&nbsp; This is on a Dell Alienware laptop with a wireless connection to the internet.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
And can this service pack be removed so he could go back to SP1 if there are any problems?<br />
<br />
AND if a person chooses not to install this service pack, will critical updates for SP1 still be offered?
<br />
<br />
This is KB948465<br />
<br />
Edited to add:<br />
<br />
Just reading the most ominous threads here on this forum, not too inclined to give this a try at all!<br />
<br />
So...SP1 will still be provided with critical updates?&nbsp;

<h2>            My computer wont let me have administrative control.</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new computer with Windows 10 Pro installed.&nbsp; I am attempting to access files on a server and the computer will not allow me access to files and folders on the network without administrative control.&nbsp; I never set a password for the hidden administrative
 account on my system, but the system will not accept anything, including nothing typed in, for a password to give me administrative control.&nbsp; This has been going on for days and my boss is ready to shoot the computer, me, and the whole office.&nbsp; How do I bypass,
 or get control of that access?&nbsp; I have been able to do so with other computers in the office, but not this newest one.</p>

<h2>            File History verses Backup and Restore verses Settings</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has 3 ways to backup and restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go to SETTINGS. Then define the drives to backup. Now according instructions, you must Stop a Drive to set a drive. Unfortunately nothing happens with Stop a Drive except it clears the defined drives to backup. And, why isn't this called Define a
 Backup Drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can setup<strong> Backup and Restore</strong> (<strong>Version 7</strong>). Why is it called&nbsp;<strong>Version&nbsp;</strong><strong>7</strong>? Is it not to be used on Windows 10? It seems to allow restoring individual files. But it does not seem to backup
 except from the C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can setup <strong>File History</strong>. This keeps images, but seemingly only of the C drive. And it seems to have no way of restoring individual files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why won't the restore methods list all the files it has backed up? Guessing the file name is terrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Steve.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />They kept WIndows 7 Backup so it was backward compatible to Windows 7 which doesn't have File History  
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in Settings &gt; Autosave.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller so they stay current if you need to reimage C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, no. Windows 10 has only one way to backup and restore, and that's File History.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History was designed to backup earlier versions of individual files - and does that well - but it was not designed to backup all your files at the same time. You&nbsp;<em>can</em> use File History to backup all your folders and files at the same time, but
 its awkward and doesn't always work well. If you want to backup all your personal files at once, you need a real backup program from a third-party.</p>

</p><p>Looking at Windows 10's other offerings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore is not a backup, and it never was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup and Restore (Windows 7) was included in Windows 10 so that people who used it to create a backup in Windows 7 can restore that backup in Windows 10. It's not supported for making new backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Image Builder was deprecated with the Fall Creators Update (v.1709) in the fall of 2017. Microsoft recommends third-party software for making image backups.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick reply. I have three further questions:</p>
<p><br />
<span>Actually, no. Windows 10 has only one way to backup and restore, and that's File History.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><em>File History was designed to backup earlier versions of individual files - and does that well - but it was not designed to backup all your files at the same time.</em></span></p>
<p>1) Not clear what you mean. Using
<strong>Settings </strong>I have requested backups of C, D, and F to G. Wouldn't that require File history to make a copy&nbsp;<em>all your files at the same time</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) <em>Microsoft recommends third-party software for making</em>
</span>image backups<span>.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>By image back-ups I think you mean an image of the system at a certain time.</span></p>
<p><span>I want an <strong>
incremental </strong>back-up that has a graphical interface like Time Machine where one can go back visually to see when a folder/file was available and then pick it to restore the data. So far what I see is very old software</span><span>.</span><span>Can
 you recommend one?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) Back in XP and with the Mac, there's software that made bit-by-bit clones of your drive(s) so one could get back on the air quickly.&nbsp;</span><span>Can
 you recommend one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4) Windows is "supposed" to make a copy of system software each time you add new software--a Restore Point. I don't find that function on the CP. In fact, I don't find many of the tools I
 expect to find on the CP--even find the current version number. I can do all this easily on a Mac, but it seems MS, starting with Vista, has hidden so much.</span></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p><span>I want software that makes&nbsp;</span><span>incremental</span><span>&nbsp;(e.g, what's changed)&nbsp;</span><span>backups across

<p>
</p><p><span>I just noticed that the log from File History has events only of drive C despite in Settings I asked for D and F to be backed up. When Settings lets you define
<strong>folders </strong>and then accepts additional <strong>drives</strong>, shouldn't&nbsp; it give an error message that a drive is not a folder?</span></p>
<p><span>Macrium looks so old. Isn't there anything like Time Machine that lets you visually roam back in time&nbsp;<strong>seeing&nbsp;</strong>folders and files?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And, looking at their videos it seems, like File History, it only seems to backup the C drive.</span></p>

<p>1. File History can't make a backup of your C: drive. For that you need image backup software. File History is for backing up individual files. You might be able to finagle it to do three entire partitions, but that's not what it was designed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the choice between a kludge and real backup software, I'll take real backup software every day. Even if you can somehow make it work with File History, why bend over backwards when it's so much easier and convenient to backup with a real backup program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No Microsoft backup utility has ever made incremental backups. Only third-party software does that. Almost any backup program can do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that I'm a defender of Microsoft, but backup isn't their main business. There's a whole backup industry composed of developers who excel in that field. Why should Microsoft re-invent the wheel? On the other hand, there are plenty of people who don't
 know the first thing about installing software and aren't inclined to try it, so Microsoft adds something to Windows - at no extra charge - to give them a basic amount of backup capability for their personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Don't go comparing Windows 10 to Windows XP. Windows - and technology as a whole - has changed enormously during that time. Don't ask me about Macs. I get mine at McDonalds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People often confuse an image with a clone. Perhaps it's just semantics. Both are exact copies of a partition, but image software is smart enough to not copy empty sectors, bad sectors, the page file and the hibernation file (I think.) A clone copies&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.
 If you're in law enforcement and you just got your hands on a perp's computer, you want to make a clone. The rest of us want an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Macrium Reflect is very popular (and my choice) but there's lots of other good image backup software, like Acronis True Image and EaseUS ToDo Backup, among others. Just search the web for professional reviews of image backup software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. A restore point is&nbsp;<em>not</em> a copy of system software and it's not made every time you install software. It's a copy of a set of key system files, drivers and registry keys that if restored&nbsp;<em>might</em> bring back enough functionality to a messed
 up computer for a user to attempt to fix it with Windows' built in tools. It doesn't hold a candle to an image, but when System Restore made its debut in Windows ME, imaging was real esoteric. Today there's so much consumer image backup software it's no surprise
 that System Restore is turned off by default.</p>

<p>Image backup software backs up any partition and multiple partitions at the same time, if you want. Macrium Reflect backs up my software partition (C) and my data partition (D) equally well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the great features of third-party image backup software is that you can define any number of backup jobs, schedule them, and set a retention schedule for the backups. Then sit back and let the software do its job. If you like to make incrementals,
 the software will collapse them to fulls automatically, any time you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring images is just as easy and takes only minutes.</p>

<p>I don't disagree with Greg. He makes a valid point. It is my&nbsp;<em>preference</em> to backup locally most of the time, but I certainly backup to the cloud selectively. One of the hallmarks of a good backup plan is to store backups in different places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As computing moves increasingly to the cloud, the whole nature of backing up will take on new meaning. We'll be backing up our cloud content.</p>

 here who helps a lot of people and sure did mine so far for I am still doing some suggestions he gave me and others. So I started a User account for a family member with no problem at first. I went back after setting up IE for her for she wanted a Facebook
 account. But when during a Norton 360 scan in the section that runs a diagnostic report a warning appeared reading I have a slow CPU running or something of that sort and to check with my HP people for suggestions. &nbsp;Well I logged out the account and opened
 my admin. account ran the same scans but no report came up that I had a slow CPU usage. Now my computer has an Intel core i3 inside running on a Pavilion dv6-2155dx Notebook that has always been super fast. But my ISP provider w

            Good day,
<div>I apologize for not getting back with you sooner for yesterday I was in touch with Norton for I paid extra for their assurance which is their plan to come into my computer to take out or remove any virus etc that may be in here. So I went through the hoops
 and allowed a Tech to enter my computer. I told her before we started that I am getting a great deal of pop up errors reading that Norton is using a large amount of CPU, memory and Written usage at the same time. Then it crashes on the hour almost. My computer
 shows several Norton programs some in the svchostexe norton type readings. Also 2 read n360exe the other reads Norton 360. &nbsp;Strange to me ..I tried to explain this to the tech but she seemed uninterested. &nbsp;I also asked her to go to the events and see how many
 errors and warning I am getting from Norton. &nbsp;I get an amazing amount of Cloud 9.0 and Cloud 7.1 exonerated warnings sent into Symantec for them to check to see if they are true viruses but I just received 1 patch back yesterday but it did not take. I told
 her that and again uninterested.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft Security Essentials is not in here any longer for some time now. But there is a program named &nbsp;Windows Live Essentials.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes this is the same computer that the other post were about sir.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Norton 360 has been installed since it came available to the public. I have used Norton without issue except when I used Norton Internet Protection I did get a Keylogger, a virus of some type and a worm I was told from Best Buy from which I bought this
 Laptop. The computer which is infected I still have and is a great desl top that I just added a good deal of memory to it. I would love to get it cleaned but do not have the disk. I imagine it has a partition. I am going to try to get Norton to clean it out,
 if they can when I hook it back up very soon for a back up in case I lose this wonderful lap top very soon which I feel I will.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am in limbo on what to do next. I am so upset with Norton with over 200 days left on my current subscription I hope when I boot them after I have gotten all the use from them to get some sort of a rebate. &nbsp; I shall run what links you have provided but
 am trying to figure out if I should do it now or get back with Norton to try to make them do a cleaning. If they can.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I so much appreciate all your kind advice and everyones help you could not imagine. I am just so perplexed I do not know what to do now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,&nbsp;</div>

            <p><em>Assuming Win7 (64-bit) SP1...</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did you purchase the computer at Best Buy and if so, did their Geek Squad sell you anything &amp; install it for you (e.g., Norton 360)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Has any other&nbsp;Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it </em>(i.e., before the Geek Squad got their hands on it)<em>?</em>&nbsp; (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did the Norton tech uninstall/reinstall Norton 360 while (s)he had remote access to your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Can you tell me what Norton 360 <em>version</em> is currently installed (e.g., Norton 360 2012; Norton 360 v4.x; Norton 360 v21.x)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading or uninstalling cleanly. The "leftovers" may be causing your problem.</p>

            OK here goes...I looked for receipts but not to be found so... Ahh I found the actual box it came in. Wow my wife is right. I am a pack rat and through nothing away! So best answers I can give starting in order.
<div><br />
<div>1. &nbsp;Purchase Date Approx. 6/6/2009</div>
<div><br />
<div>1b. Computer came pre-loaded with a trial &nbsp;Norton 360 but I already had a subscription to Norton 360 so just switched it to that computer the techs did it for me and was purchased at Best Buy.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2.Yes. I cancelled Norton one time and has Kaspersky Installed per Best Buy. They were pushing that product at that time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Again yes Norton was preloaded as a trial version for 3 months.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Norton Techs did an uninstall ... Re-install several times during the first few years. Stated it needed that.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Norton 360 Version 21.1.0.18. Reads up to date for I try to update regularly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This may be relevant. &nbsp; On my older Desk Top I caught a couple viruses. A keylogger, a worm and some sort of virus Best Buy said. I could not get on hardly and the computer sent out well over 2,000 friend request and talked a lot of very obscene things
 to many of my female friends. Most knew me and also knew I was not like that but some turned me in of course. I lost my Facebook account but luckily I knew a good friend that did &nbsp;charity work with higher ups within Facebook at the time. She vouched for me
 but still I had to fax reports from Best Buy that I did have a Key-logger and viruses in my computer that most likely did this. &nbsp;I kept changing my passwords threw a friends computer so the Key-logger had trouble in taking my computer over completely. &nbsp;I imagine
 that was how it didn't get possession of it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>One final issue that may help is I keep getting this attacking modem blocked by Norton by their auto Block signatures but the IP addy is that of which my ISP Provider swears is part of my modem by the ISP number even though the modem that is trying to
 enter keeps changing IP addresses and Ports to gain entry. I will not allow this to enter. &nbsp;The modem I have is a Provider combination modem-Router anyways so why did this modern appear suddenly a few months ago and keeps being blocked by Norton Security?
 &nbsp;I have a suspicion this is a rogue modem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok again hope I did not give you too much info that you did not need. I truly appreciate your assistance in this manner.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Much Respect,&nbsp;</div>

            A1. &nbsp; After I bought the new Laptop I have not ever hooked up the infected desktop again. I plan on doing this soon to clean it. To have a backup. It was never hooked up to the new laptop. Even though it was a phone line hookup it was still extremely fast.
 What I did not know is that the desktop did have broadband capabilities. As far as being hooked up to a home network I don't think so for I had no other computers.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>A2. &nbsp;I would guess the last time a Norton Tech did a uninstall/reinstall was well over a year ago. Almost 2 I would guess.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>A3. If your asking about the desktop it ran Windows XP and if I remember right which is not a certainty it ran IE7 or 8 if that was possible. &nbsp; A3a. &nbsp;If your asking about the laptop I upgraded to IE10 when it became available. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>A3b. Update Version 10.0.10 &nbsp; &nbsp;Above that reads. 10.0.9200.16721 &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>A3c. Again On Old Desktop just XP. &nbsp;Laptop I did install Firefox a few days ago to try to run a new Browser for something but uninstalled almost immediately. &nbsp;I run Google Chrome strictly on laptop. I never even go to Internet Explorer except when a Norton
 Tech wants to enter my computer they want to come through IE. actually there is several places I see in downloads where they used to come in. Named Support LogmeIn Rescue.exe .... I found 3 at least still there. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I noticed when running a Norton scan in the startup Manager everything is gone except &nbsp;SSD MONIT APPLICATION....What I believe this is Norton Utilities 16 that she downloaded and ran during the so called virus check. What I do not like is when I go to
 run a Windows Defender scan the Utilities scan runs also and deletes several registry issues. After it does this and I shut Down for the night. hen I log back in the next day. The Norton Password Vault has changed the passwords.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>One last tidbit is again Norton related. I scan in the tuneup area and when it rund file cleanup. Almost 99% of the time no matter how many files it reads it cleans. 1 to 40 or whatever it reads it has cleaned out 5MB of space. Questioning Norton on this.
 They had no clue. Blamed it on my operating system as being to full of junk. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again I appreciate you taking an interest in this complex problem and hopefully it will help others that have put their hard earned money and confidence into Norton. &nbsp;I must say that one time a few years ago I was so disgusted with Norton I switched on
 referral of course from Best Buy to Kaspersky. It seemed to be a good one at first and cleaned out things Norton did not but after a while it also started acting strange and not doing a good job. So I in vain tried to stop the Kaspersky service and I have
 never ever had so much trouble in deleting all the junk they had put into my computer. Even after many contacts with them personally my machine was still full of Kaspersky stuff. It took months to completely get it out after a complete uninstall/reinstall
 from a computer tech, not Best Buy, that after i instructed him to use my disk he did not and used my partition. I was not happy with this but it seemed to do the job. &nbsp;This was about 1 year ago. The guy doing the work called me to ask me if I wanted to sell
 him my laptop for he said it was the fastest he had ever seen. He mentioned it did such a fast re-install of all programs he could not believe it. Made me leary of his expertise.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok Thanks again and Kudos to your knowledge... With High Respect, &nbsp;</div>

            <p><strong>Note: Unless I state otherwise, all of my questions, suggestions, recommendations, etc., pertain to the Win7 computer
<em>only</em>. </strong>[And to avoid confusion, please do not refer to a "Desktop," a "Notebook" or a "laptop" computer - just the Win7 or the WinXP computer.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling or upgrading cleanly. The Norton "leftovers" may be causing your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em>] </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<font color="#0072c6">ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall
<strong>Norton 360</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>LiveUpdate</strong> (if listed)&nbsp;<em>and</em> any
<strong>Norton Add-ons</strong> via <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>; reboot at the prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall <em>immediately</em> after rebooting! [Should happen automatically but I want you to check.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em><u>else</u></em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step #7 below!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the utility. Don't<em> TOUCH</em> your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Do a clean install of <strong>Norton 360 v21.x</strong>&nbsp;(using your Product ID, if need be) &amp; reboot. See
<a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/kb20090708112600EN_EndUserProfile_en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/kb20090708112600EN_EndUserProfile_en_us</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: <em>Do NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons or toolbars (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Manually and repeatedly run (Norton) <strong>LiveUpdate</strong> until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Download/run the appropriate scripts from the following Trusted Source (my colleague IE MVP Kai Schätzl):
<a href="http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note =&gt; The scripts are good for IE9, IE10 &amp; IE11 Preview, too,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tip: The file named <strong>ie8-rereg.all.zip</strong> contains both of the scripts below (plus a third that you will NOT use).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9a. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.32on64.cmd</strong> to run the script.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9b. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar) then double-click on the file named
<strong>ie8-rereg.64on64.cmd</strong> to run that script <em>then reboot.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><font color="#0072c6">Set Program Access and Computer Defaults</font></span></a>. [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11a. Right-click on the following link and SAVE the download to your desktop: <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/doit/chromehtml.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://www.slipstick.com/doit/chromehtml.reg</font></a> [2]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11b. Double-click on the file you saved in #11a above &amp; accept the prompt to MERGE the data with the Registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</font></a> &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note=&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings</strong> option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13a. Open Internet Explorer (<em>only!</em>) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336</font></a> [ignore the title &amp; Symptoms].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13b. <em><strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Dismiss/close the Windows Update troubleshooter pop-up!</strong></em> - then...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13c. Ignoring any "Not recommended" or similar warnings, run Fix It 50202 in DEFAULT
<em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>. [3]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. <em>Reboot one last time</em> then test. You should find significant improvement after the second, third &amp; even fourth reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;15. Reply to this post with a status report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<br />
My apologies for UN-needed information and confusion given.&nbsp; For your information I did not receive this reply from the November 1st 2013 Post. I did receive a different reply not having any relevancy to this subject. I found this by coming back to the Slow
 CPU Title Reply and going forward.&nbsp; Thus the reason for the late reply from myself.
<br />
<br />
As I just opened this today I will start preparing and doing all instructed asap. Hopefully replying with a status report very soon.&nbsp; Until that time i very much wish to thanks you for your attention you have given to my computer issues.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This forum and Microsoft Community is indeed fortunate you take interest in helping not only very computer illiterate folk as myself but also all other levels of knowledge some possess.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Until next we speak,<br />
<br />
Regards&nbsp; <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Task Manager only showing half my cores.</h2>
                    Why does windows 10 only show one of my dual cores in the task manager, yet both cores in device manager?

            Hi Jim, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Try these steps, which may make Task Manager show the correct amount of cores:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and search for msconfig.
<br />- Select System Configuration.
<br />- In the Boot tab, click on Advanced Options.
<br />- You should see an option to set the number of cores. Change this to the correct amount, click OK then reboot.
<br />
<br />Hopefully Task Manager should show the correct number now. Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!       
        </p>

<p>You probably do have only one core - but two logical processors. My own Device Manager seems to show 4 cores...</p>

<br />Open Task Manager
<br />
<br />Choose the performance Tab, click CPU, please provide a screenshot of that window
<br />
<br />If you right click the graph on that page and choose 'Change graph to 'Logical processors - do you have that option?

            No, it's an AMD A6-5400K dual core Apu.&nbsp; It has two cores, I don't understand why win10's task manager can't see them.

<p>See dragonate's lament here...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://community.amd.com/thread/212857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.amd.com/thread/212857</a></p>
<p>AMD A6-5400K APU - High CPU usage. Quad core? Dual core? Single core?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be a case of muddy advertising. Likely, that is really a single core CPU but with two logical processors. Because it splits into two logical processors, the manufacturer claims it has two cores. The MSConfg "cure" fails because that setting applies
 (I read somewhere) only during a boot. After the boot, the computer reverts to using its maximum cores &amp; logical processors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe look into BIOS settings which also was suggested to dragonate - but it was little help to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, &amp; keep us informed (if you find a better answer).</p>

            <p>USB works for small amts, but I have a LOT of files &amp; apps (282Gb) so that wasn't feasible. Windows so-called 'free' partnership with Laplink suddenly turned into<em> $169</em> (No surprise) when I wanted to move applications, not just files. &nbsp; I figured
 the easiest way was to use my 1.5Tb backup &amp; simply copy everything that way. &nbsp;I was able to move all my apps AND files without a lot of fuss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If you don't have a stand-alone back-up, you should. I've had computers suddenly fail &amp; have to be wiped. &nbsp;Using my HD I could reformat the unit &amp; reload &amp; be up 'n running in a short time. &nbsp; ANY Cloud file CAN be hacked, but a secure HD that's only connected
 when needed can't be beaten. &nbsp;</p>

<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow

<p>Hi Mourad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, please make sure that the delegate and your VP must use the same version of Outlook. To check it, please go to
<strong>File &gt; Office Account &gt; Product Information</strong>. Meanwhile, their Office 365 accounts should be set up via Exchange mode in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the error, the permission level which the secretary has may be not high. There are 4 delegate permission levels, you can refer to the link below for more detailed information.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/allow-someone-else-to-manage-your-mail-and-calendar-41c40c04-3bd1-4d22-963a-28eafec25926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Allow someone else to manage your mail and calendar</a></strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After confirming all above, please follow the instructions below to start a meeting or call as a delegate.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get my Acer X223W &#40;DVI&#43;HDMI with Apple adapter&#41; widescreen monitor to show anything.</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I have a 3.5 years old Acer Aspire AM3800 desktop PC with 4 GB of RAM, an onboard Intel G45/G43 Express chipset, and new 64-bit W8 Pro. clean installation. I have two big 20"+ LCD monitors connected to this PC: Philip Brilliance 200P's VGA and widescreen Acer
 X223W's Apple HDMI+DVI) connected. I cannot seem to get the widescreen Acer X223W's Apple HDMI+DVI) monitor to show anything (no video signal). I even disconnected its VGA cable, and still nothing!
<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? W8's Device Manager and display settings doesn't seem to detect the widescreen monitor. I tried this widescreen monitor on Mac Mini (same adapter and cables) and it was fine. Although I can't seem to do dual display setup due to lack
 of another video port.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. :)<br />

<p>Interesting. I tried my original Acer OEM Vista HPE SP2 (IE7) image backup and it had the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something else I noticed. I can see text modes and Windows' graphical loader, but nothing for Window' login screen and desktops. Also, Windows PE do show up fine. Safe mode's login and desktop do not show anything as well.</p>

Thanks. It looks like it is not just Windows 8. In the original Vista OEM image, I can see the Display Settings' for the second display. However, it is is greyed out when I try to activate and use it. :(<br />
<br />
I also tried a bootable KNOPPIX v6.0.4 CD and it had no problems in its desktop.<br />

            OK, I got it to work finally in 64-bit W7 SP1.&nbsp; I needed to use Acer's updated video drivers. Not Intel's. However, Acer doesn't have any drivers for W8. :(<br />

It was the answer I was looking for well below what the competitors asking price of an equivalently equipped controller.&nbsp;About a month ago my left joy stick started to become wobbly, I have the longer sticks and they do affect it some so I ignored it. The play got worse and worse until 3 days ago it simply broke,&nbsp;even&nbsp;sticking in a certain spot.&nbsp;I know I could have purchased a warranty but Gamestop did not offer one.</p><p>Naturally I did&nbsp;what most would do,&nbsp;look up my factory&nbsp;warranty, 90 days terrible warranty but I knew that before I bought it.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Logon Scripts Not Applying - DFS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> truequazl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Logon Scripts Not Applying - DFS</h2>
                    <p>All of our Surface Pro 3's are not getting logon scripts. These login scripts add network shares</p>
<ol>
<li>This happens on both Wireless and on the dock with a wired connection</li><li>I have confirmed that&nbsp;"Fast Logon Optimization" is disabled (Wait for&nbsp;Network...) in Group Policy</li><li>All other polices are working.</li></ol>
<p>We have the most up to date updates for surface and dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a Windows 8.1 problem as it works on our other Laptops, this is relegated to just the Surface 3 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have also tried to use the "built-in" method of adding drive shares and this works much more consistently, but when&nbsp;using wireless the drive is in a disconnected state and we have to wait about 1 minutes for it to connect after logon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>This has something to do with DFS. We changed the mappings from DFS share links to hardcoded server links and it map drives worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excample</p>
<p>
</p><p>\\domain\shares</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>\\server\shares</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, the scripts were running just fine, but we were&nbsp;using the DFS share links in the script which are not available for about 45 seconds to 1 minute after logon. Again, this only affects the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The plot thickens.</p>

            Hi,<br />

Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those reboots.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Also do this so you can see the likely bluescreens.<br />
<br />
Windows Vista automatically restarts if your PC encounters an error that causes it to crash.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your
<br />
system has that installed by the maker.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party keyboard and<br />
mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />

Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>First off read the stickies/other forum posts/contact Xbox live support to see if its a common issue. However im going to assume that you've done that already and their was no "easy" fix.</p>
<p>I had a problem similar to this at the begining of the year, of which XBL Support could not handle, as they didn't know the error code. I'm going to assume that you can clear your System Cash (SP?) &nbsp;so as to redo the update.</p>
<p>With a windows PC you can use a local area connection to install the update. This lets your computer "share" it's internet connection to your xbox, allowing it to miss any security settings that may be hampering the download/install (As i think was happening
 to me).</p>
<p>First off you need to hard wire your xbox to your PC. Unplug the ethernet cable from the wall jack and into the PC. (The side of a laptop or back of a desktop tower). From here on teh computer</p>
<p>1) Open up your Network and Sharing Center from the control panel. </p>
<p>2)Than select the advanced options</p>
<p>3) You should see icons, highlight them both and right click</p>
<p>4) Select the Enable bridge connection or something similar to that.</p>
<p>5) Wait until it says that the bridge is connceted/active</p>
<p>You should now be good to go. Re-download the update and install. Once the install is complete your good to go back to wifi or the wall jack for your xbox.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, as it took over a month to figure out for me. Xbox live support never gave me this as a diaognostic option/fix after repeated attempts with them, however there is no faults or risks by doing it this way</p>
<p>If this does work, dont be afraid to share this to help others! &nbsp;This works for any updates, game or system, that you may need to install</p>
