Microsoft Office has been one of the company's biggest successes. For more than 20 years, the company has released new revisions with unique features that make it an enticing upgrade. At the same time, there are users who fall in love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough.

<p><span>There are 2 options with that program. One allows you to keep the library on the cd (which sound like the option you are using). The
 other allows you to load the data on the hard drive - this is the better and faster option. It should also eliminate your problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I have a dell 1647 and have been running this since we got it without a problem. Note: I use the load library to hard drive option.
 Let us know how this works out.</span></p>

    <title>Frequently losing WiFi Connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> schmittyrexus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frequently losing WiFi Connection</h2>
                    <p>Several times per day, the wireless connection on my Windows 10 laptop will suddenly stop working. If I check my WiFi, it tells me that no wireless networks are found, despite the fact that there should be multiple strong signals. Running the troubleshooter
 fixes the problem after giving me these errors:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f1ac464-9616-4ad4-9c53-be2e23340f22?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f1ac464-9616-4ad4-9c53-be2e23340f22?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The "Network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken" error makes no sense, because I am on WiFi and thus do not have a network cable plugged in at all. The second "Problem with wireless adapter or access point" error is very vague.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the troubleshooter, I can immediately reconnect to the network. However, it is very frustrating to have to do this at least once per day, usually multiple times. The error occurs on both my home and office wifi as well as other networks. I
 have already tried updating the drivers for both my wireless card and my network adapter. How can I permanently stop this error from occurring?</p>

            Hi Schmitty.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>

<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have re-enabled IPV6 (even though it was already enabled), updated all of my drivers, and performed a Network Reset. I also disabled the setting to allow the computer to turn of my wireless and ethernet devices to save power. I also tried resetting my
 router and modem at home, even though this issue occurs regardless of where I am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far this error has not occurred again, but since it is very irregular, I will continue to monitor it.</p>

            Disabling Bluetooth did not help. The clean boot seemed to help for a few days, but the issue recurred again. Curiously, the error occurred right after I enabled Steam Service - I don't know if that is the cause of the issue or if it's just a coincidence.

                    <p>Not sure if I can post this here, but it seems I am not alone being frustrated with the drag and drop print feature making a disappearance.&nbsp; However, I found a free download called Print Conductor that works with Windows 10 that allows you to drag and drop
 multiple files into a print queue and away it goes.&nbsp; Anywhooo... hope this helps some of y'all.&nbsp; It sure seemed to help me.</p>

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us on the Forums. Now the items you are seeing as "content not available" are more than likely going to the purchases you have made for Xbox One titles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are showing this way because Xbox One content is not available on the Xbox 360.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. :) </p>

            <p>Just for my benefit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that all mail accounts can be deleted if you are not using the default account (i.e. the only account available after Windows setup before you start adding alternate login accounts)?
</p>
<p>That the restriction is only valid if you are using the Windows registration account?

<p>IOW, Mail setup starts fresh w/o any accounts pre set up, zero.</p>

            <p>OK, I mentioned this as the behaviour you were describing is that of the 'Outlook' account which is the Microsoft account, the one that Microsoft uses to get in touch with you as well as to keep track of what you bought from the Store as well as used to
 log you in to Windows (password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That account is an 'on behalf of' account, the mail address is the address that it shows is the address that it sends mail on behalf from, the Reply-To address.</p>

 an issue with connecting the keyboard....after long wait they agreed to replace the keyboard, new keyboard also didn't work...rebooting, new drivers,expert remote help, nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so eventually service center agreed to replace the surface. A week after I recieved the surface pro back, it was broken, not only they didn't fix it they actually damage it. now it doesn't even turn on and they claim I did it so no warranty&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i prove that it was working?&nbsp;</p>
<p>And who can i speak with to take responsibility and replace this laptop.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had an ongoing communication with them about the keyboard from September.</p>

    <title>Windows boot manager screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmw850  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows boot manager screen</h2>
                    
<p>in attempting to diagnose a problem with my computer, I used the diagnostic tool of windows and also used safe mode. My problem now is that when I start up my computer initially, instead&nbsp;of going directly to the Dell start up screen and then Windows start
 up screen my&nbsp;&nbsp;computer goes Dell start up and then Windows boot manager (emitting a series of beeps) whereby I have to the enter "Windows 7"&nbsp; whereupon the computer then proceeds to Windows start up. To remedy, when the Dell start up screen appears I have
 attempted to depress "F8"&nbsp; where it then directs me to a start menu menu suggesting different ways to start the computer. At the bottom of this menu is a startup&nbsp;indicating&nbsp;"start windows in regular manner" however when selecting this option it does not appear
 to save whereupon the next startup I have to go through this extra step. Can anybody provide a suggestion(s) or directions to remedy this problem.</p>
<p>Thanking you in advance for your assistance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Let's start simple.</p>
<p>Run msconfig and to the startup tab.</p>
<p>Do you see a single entry or several entries?</p>
<p>Can you select "Windows 7" as the default?</p>

    <title>How can I stop Windows 10 forced security update breaking my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donnacheltenham  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I stop Windows 10 forced security update breaking my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A couple of weeks ago my laptop auto installed security update&nbsp;KB4054517, since then my laptops face recognition doesn't work, the pin doesn't work, I get error code 0x80070032 when I try to re-add either it says it couldn't log&nbsp;me in. Not only this but
 if my laptop goes into sleep mode it will not wake up, the keys are lit up and the power light is on, but the screen remains black, the only way to turn it back on is to hold down the power button to switch on and then off again. Then when it does turn back
 on it fails to find wifi and says there is no internet card installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstall the update and restart, and everything is magically working again, but on next switch on it updates again and the problems return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is only a couple of months old and there were no issues before this update. Is there any way that I can block this update? I am a student and I am spending more time struggling to log in, wake it up,&nbsp; deleting the update, and restarting it, than
 I am doing my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I have just tried to uninstall the update for the millionth time, now there is actually no uninstall button. If I check for updates I get this error:</p>
<p>There were some problems installing updates, but we’ll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80070422)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd Edit: I tried uninstalling using the&nbsp;Command Prompt (Admin) method but all I get is this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33ebdf6b-632d-4c56-839d-0fc8f989f360?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33ebdf6b-632d-4c56-839d-0fc8f989f360?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It does not uninstall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Donna</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing an update for Windows is essential to ensure that you’ll get the upgraded and enhanced features of Windows. These updates also consist of security updates that will help a computer to be more protected. Usually, most of computers have
<strong>Windows Updates</strong> that are set to “<strong>Install Updates Automatically</strong>”, which is the recommended setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An option to delay or postpone the updates is available, if you’re using Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise or Education. However, Windows 10 Home users may not have this option. To do this, go to
<strong>Settings</strong>&gt; <strong>Update and Security</strong> &gt;<strong> Windows Update</strong>. Click on
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, then check the <strong>Defer upgrades</strong> check-box to select the option and you can also click
<strong>Learn more</strong> for additional details about this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we suggest that you check the article on <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">how to temporarily
 prevent a Windows Update from reinstalling in Windows 10</a></strong> which you can also try to follow.</p>

<p>Based on the screenshot that you've provided, it seems like we need to reset the update by manually removing or deleting the update components. Here are the steps that you can follow:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart the device multiple times or use a <strong>bootable USB media</strong> to access the
<strong>Windows</strong><strong>recovery environment</strong>. To create a USB boot media, you can follow the steps by

Windows Startup Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>Wait until the device will restart, and then press <strong>F4 </strong>to reboot in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.</li><li>Once you're in the safe mode environment, navigate to the folder path below:<br />
<br />
<strong>This PC &gt; Local Disk C:\ &gt; Windows &gt; WinSxS<br />
<br />
Note: </strong>Before we proceed, set the folder permission to <strong>Everyone</strong> on WinSxS folder. Here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1. Right-click on the <strong>WinSxS</strong> folder and select <strong>Properties</strong><br />
2. Under the <strong>Security</strong> tab, select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>
Add</strong>.<br />
3. In the <strong>Enter the object names to select</strong> box, type <strong>Everyone</strong> and click
<strong>OK </strong>to add it on the list .<br />
4. Once added, click <strong>Everyone</strong> and ensure all the check boxes are ticked under
<strong>Permission</strong><strong>for </strong><strong>Everyone</strong>.<br />
5. Select <strong>Advanced</strong>, and click on the <strong>Change</strong> link under
<strong>Permission </strong>tab to grant permission to the folder.<br />
6. In the <strong>Enter the object names to select</strong> box, type <strong>Everyone</strong> and click
<strong>OK.<br />
</strong>7. The <strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> box will appear. Ensure to tick the box.<br />
8. Click <strong>Apply</strong>.<br />
9. On the same window, click on the <strong>Auditing</strong> tab.<br />
10. Click on the <strong>Select a principal</strong> link. Type <strong>Everyone</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
11. Under <strong>Basic permission</strong>, check the <strong>Full Control</strong> box and click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
12. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
13. Restart the device if prompted, and then boot again in <strong>Safe</strong><strong> Mode</strong> and access
<strong>WinSXS</strong> by repeating steps <strong>1</strong> to <strong>5</strong>.<br />
</li><li>As soon as you've gained access to the folder, locate the pending.xml file and delete it.</li><li>Restart the device and check if it now boots properly. If yes, download and run the update troubleshooter found on the<em>

<h2>            it is impossible to cancel auto-renewal for live</h2>
                    
<p>the website methods do not work. everytime you try to cancel you "find a glitch" or get spun in circles. tech support also leads to a so called glitch. sure you can call and sit on hold for an hour yes an hour then they tell you the department that handles
 this issue is closed or shut down as my agent said it. the biggest tech giant in the world cannot fix a few "glitches" or have real customer support? all I wanted to do was cancel autorenwal. a button on the home screen of xbox should have easily been able
 to do that if it existed. had xbox for years now switching to sony. maybe they'll be less annoying. if you read all the threads similar to this one the moderators will copy and paste responses that don't work. there will be one that says the website should
 work, another will say call this number, and the last one will kindly remind me to use kind language or something of the like. lets watch and see.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You're right, the website should have worked. Have you tried a different browser (Chrome, Firefox) or even a different computer?
</p>
<p>I have find some site functions work better with certain browsers (that goes for non-Microsoft sites also).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After trying a different browser/computer, do you get the same glitch? &nbsp;Does the site give you an error code?</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Since Auto Renew is a billing related issue, if you're unable to get past the website glitch, you will have to speak with phone support to get it cleared up. Phone Support is the only group who can access the necessary account information.
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I can feel the frustration in your post, I've been there. I wouldn't say the language was harsh. Give support a call in the morning, and see if there is the option for a call back so you don't have to sit on hold.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Wish I had more.</p>

<p>only 10 mins on hold this time. the agent could not cancel auto renewal. I repeat they could not cancel auto renewal. they had to cancel my service altogether so if I would have gad some time left on my gold I would have lost it. this website is a disgrace
 and the customer support agents seem to have their hands tied for the most part. my problem was resolved after many headaches. my advice is to use only prepaid cards or buy gold membership cards from a store to save you time and hassle. the number for customer
 support is 1-800-469-9269. that was nearly impossible to find on this website. </p>

<p>That's...very unusual. &nbsp;I've never heard of an agent being unable to turn off the renewal but able to cancel. &nbsp;I've heard of them being unable to do EITHER, but that usually meant a broken account. &nbsp;I expect the agent you spoke to wasn't the best.</p>
<p>The reason the number is hard to find is because they want you to use the callback feature so you don't sit on hold for a long time.</p>

<p>Hey William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. We understand your friends are not showing up in your Xbox App and your invites are not being sent out or received. If you haven't already done so, try reinstalling the app on your phone. Afterwards, simply try logging back in.
 Let us know if the issue persists or if you are now able to see your friend list. Cheers :D</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Service Pack 1 Update Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Service Pack 1 Update Issue</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit Lenovo Laptop. Some time back I got Windows 7
<b>Service Pack 1 (KB976932)</b> update notification. I started the installation process but once it completed downloading the update which was around 50-60 MB, it showed some error. I do not remember the exact error code however when I checked online, I found
 out that this issue appears only if your laptop is not connected to power and instead using battery while installing Service Pack 1.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Later I plugged the laptop with power cord and tried to again install it. But now it won't install. The update starts to download again but nothing happens.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It says Downloading 1 Update 0 KB and 0%. It does not download at all. I have tried it so many times. I waited for several minutes but not it remained 0 KB downloaded and 0%. How should I fix it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used the Fixit tool but it could not detect any error.</div>
                </div>

            I think it is because of Asus Smart Gestures. I found in Error reporting that that app has numerous crashes since I'm with windows 10. I downloaded the last version through Asus' driver support web page, installed it, and nothing has changed. After I completely
 uninstalled&nbsp;Asus Smart Gestures, the BSOD stopped to appear, and everything looks that functions normally. It is a pity, cause I really like that app, especially the remote controlling feature :(

    <title>Repairing Windows System files when a repair disc or installation disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebell1952  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repairing Windows System files when a repair disc or installation disc won&#39;t or can&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>I have a viral infection situation (Trojan.Maljava!gen16 and 21 and possibly a Trojan.Zeroaccess) and after Norton Bootable Recovery Tool had removed the gen16 and 21 trojans (can't get online to see if the Zeroaccess trojan is there, but symptoms suggest
 its presence) running sfc /scannow I am told that corrupt files were found but that sfc couldn't fix some of them and Startup Repair
<em>said</em> it found no problems and so of course wouldn't run. I haven't tried doing a repair from an installation disc, which may or may not work, but I was wondering, can the system files from my desktop computer be copied to the errant laptop in whole
 rather than from a disc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am unable to access the internet, either wirelessly or through an ethernet connection (they both reach the router, but there is no connection to the web) and when I tried to install an USB wireless adapter, during the installation process I am asked to
 connect the dongle, I insert it, Windows does it's tonal thing to tell me its there, and the power light on the dongle lights up&nbsp;(the dongle also works perfectly on my other machines, presently), but the installation program says it can't detect the adapter,
 no matter which of the 3 ports I use. I seriously doubt this is an USB port problem as any other USB device works perfectly in any USB&nbsp;port, not to mention that Windows had no trouble detecting the adapter, hence the sound effect whenever it is inserted or
 removed. Because these three web accessing devices work in the system in slightly different ways, it is most unlikely that all three are just broken, so to me this suggests that something is actively blocking my attempts to access the web, which kinda fits
 with a Zeroaccess trojan's protection routines. In any case, reinstalling the OS is an absolute last resort as this machine is used for business and has a truck load of programs that would need to be reinstalled costing me a fortune in lost time
<em>and</em> money (some of the programs would have to be repurchased). I have found some web articles that give lists of files, folders and registry&nbsp;entries that may be corrupted, changed and/or created by these trojans, so I am going to attempt to manually
 work on the registry (I know, back it up first) and then, since I don't know which system files are corrupt or whatever, and neither sfc nor repair options seem to be able to fix at least some of them, it would be extremely helpful if these files can simply
 be copied from a good install on a diferent machine.</p>

            As a competent computer technician you are probably aware that your system is compromised and that the only reliable fix is a Factory Restore. Everything else is a waste of time and is likely to keep on causing problems.<br />
<br />
If it costs you a fortune to re-install everything, have you given consideration to creating an image and to updating it at regular intervals? The cost would be trivial compared to what you are facing now. Furthermore it is standard practice to keep all installation
 media and files and to keep printed records of all product keys.

            <p>Now see, that's the dribble I was talking about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) This is not my computer, it is my roommates. Were it mine, we wouldn't be having this conversation, as in the 28 years that I have been using personal computers, I have never had a serious virual infection, good sence, luck, a little of both, I don't
 know, so, yes, as a competent computer technician I know how important good security and a whole lot of common sense is. But alas, most users don't know, don't understand or don't care, that for me is a good thing as that's how I make my living.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) As a competent computer technician another job is to restore my client's computer to working order as inexpensively as possible (my personal ethics, not everyone's).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) As a competent computer technician I do not accept that the "only reliable fix is a Factory Restore." As a competent computer technician, it is my job to find reliable fixes other than the most drastic one. It is a lazy, incompetent computer technician
 whose first thought would be to use a sledgehammer to fix a priceless antique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) "Furthermore it is standard practice to keep all installation media and files and to keep printed records of all product keys." Standard practice for whom? This is obviously not standard practice for most consumers, or else, again, we competent computer
 technicians would be out of business. So, while this obviously is "standard practice" for me, most people don't think about this stuff and so it is my job to dig them out of the hole they've gotten themselves into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My final statement in my original post was put there for this very reason, as almost every time I have come looking for information on this site, I'm treated with extreme disrespect and talked down to like I'm some 20 something novice. THAT'S INSULTING!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to have a knack for being presented with unusual and/or extremely complex problems. I have more than 25 years experience doing this stuff and I am very good at doing research online, therefore it is only after I have exhausted my considerable knowledge
 and my efforts to find a solution from a similar problem that I post on any forum. But this is the only forum I've ever been to where the people who attempt to answer questions are rude, condoscending and more often than not, don't have a clue as to what they
 are talking about. Clearly, you are one of those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be assured, I will fix this problem, with or without yours, or anyone else's help if it comes to that. But, it is my understanding that these forums are where people share knowledge and resources, not a place to ridicule, belittle and generally try to make
 the answer seeker feel like and/or look like a fool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question was a simple one, but since I am not a software engineer and because Microsoft is so terribly stingy with information, frequently I need to ask about how Windows works and how it might be manipulated to solve my problem with the least amount
 of effort and at the lowest possible cost to my client! If it was not your intent to answer the question I asked, why did you feel it necessary to be an&nbsp;idiot and say anything at all?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have one other question that I seriously doubt you can answer, but someone may be able to. WHY are there formatting tools, when they don't show up when the post is submitted???</p>

            <p><span>Sorry I wasn’t able to respond sooner, but I had many <em>important</em>&nbsp; things to do that took precedence. But I feel your last sarcastic response needs addressing so that people here don’t get the wrong impression.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>While the system <i>was </i>seriously compromised by a number of viral infections, only an inexperienced layperson would think that a “Factory Restore” would be the
<i>only</i> reliable fix. So, like so many others on these forums, you’re passing yourself off as something you’re not, so can the fake being offended. BTW, the system in question has been fully restored to its pre-virus infected state
<b><i>without</i></b> resorting to a full “Factory Restore”. It took some work to restore the corrupted system files, but I was able to replace them through a procedure I found on another website’s forum.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As for your parting shot: “P.S. I had a quick look at your track record. It looks a little lopsided: Lots of posts asking for free help, none for giving back something to the community.” If what you and the others that I have interacted with on these
 forums is “giving something back to the community,” then you don’t know what that phrase means, since the so-called ‘answers’ provided are
<b><i>usually</i></b> incorrect and/or have nothing to do with fixing the problem as stated (as were yours), this certainly
<b><i>does not</i></b> do anything good for the community. However, for the record, I have asked 26 questions in 3½ years, two of which had to do with Windows 7 BETAs I was testing, so I think
<i>that</i> qualifies as “giving something back to the community.” Eight of those questions
<b><i><u>still</u></i></b> remain <i>unanswered!</i> (One of which shows <u>19</u> other people with the same problem, but no answer to date.) Thirteen more are marked “Answered” but are not, as none of the suggested solutions worked in those situations. Of
 the remaining seven, five were merely informational and had nothing to do with getting “free help” and three of
<i>those</i> questions were in regard to bogus product keys, stolen product keys and counterfeit Microsoft software and were preliminary to helping Microsoft track these thieves, so I’d say
<b><i>that</i></b> also qualifies for “giving something back to the community” what do you think?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unlike you, I have a life apart from my computer repair work, and therefore don’t have the time to scan through these forums trying to find problems I can answer. Also, my
<i>job</i> is to repair computers for which I get <i>paid</i>. What is my incentive to spend my leisure time giving “free help” to others? And as for you, neither you nor any of the others that provide worthless information should be offended because the person
 you are trying to deceive calls your bluff.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Finally, it was my understanding that these forums are provided so that <b>
<i>anyone</i></b> can get <b><i>“free help”</i></b> with Microsoft problems. If it is not, then please advise me, so that I don’t abuse these forums, also it would be helpful if you could tell me how I might pay for the help, if it isn’t
<i>meant</i> to be <i>free</i>.</span></p>

This is an intriguing thread. You appear to spend a lot of time in attacking Oberwald and more in defending yourself but none in explaining how you solved your problem (which would really be useful to other readers who have an infected machine).

<p><br />
First, because I am a&nbsp;system builder Microsoft <em><strong>forces</strong></em> me to troubleshoot and repair problems with any of&nbsp;the Microsoft software that I install on the computers I build and sell, even though I have had zero formal training in Microsoft
 software workings and troubleshooting. Therefore, I consider it my <strong><em>professional right</em></strong> to use these forums whenever and for whatever situations I find that I am not equipped to handle by myself. I maybe build 5 to 10 machines a year,
 so it's not like I am making lots of money doing that and so it is both impractical and financially imposible for me to afford Microsoft certification (though I'm not convinced that such certification is even worth the money as most of the MCSEs that have
 responded to some of my questions seemed to know less about the problem than I, yet these guys are a very&nbsp;concieted lot and don't take it well when they are shown up by someone they consider a novice and possibly and idiot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, the above quote comes from the end of my first post. This was added because "dribble" is
<strong><em>usually</em></strong> all I get in response to the questions I ask, if you don't think so, then try reading the 27 posts I put up&nbsp;and the&nbsp;1 I joined because I thought it&nbsp;was similar to my problem. Almost
<strong><em>none</em></strong> of those questions were answered with <strong><em>useful</em></strong> information, but rather I was asked to repeatedly perform the same unhelpful procedures over and over again, as if I&nbsp;were either too stupid to follow simple
 instructions and/or by repeating these procedures over and over and over again, it&nbsp;would somehow magically fix the problem. I have tried over and over again to get the people on here to understand that I know enough to at least to&nbsp;have tried the most obvious
 and usual fixes. I'm sorry if you think I should waste hours upon hours repeating the same procedures, that didn't work any of the other&nbsp;times I tried, over and over again just so the answerers ego doesn't get bruised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, as you say, in <strong><em>this</em></strong> post I have spent some time "defending myself," because it is I that has been attacked, not Oberwald. Oberwald's first reply was, "<em>As a competent computer technician you are probably aware that your
 system is compromised and that <strong>the only reliable fix is a Factory Restore</strong></em>.
<em>Everything else is a waste of time and is likely to keep on causing problems.</em>" So, I ask you, Outback Joe, is the above statement dribble or true? Factory Restore should be
<strong><em>the absolute <u>last</u>&nbsp;resort!</em></strong> <em><strong>Anyone</strong>
</em>who does a Factory Restore simply because it is <strong><em>easier</em></strong> than actually fixing the problem
<strong><em>cannot</em></strong> be called a <strong><em>competent</em></strong> anything! Here's another example, "<em>Not every Issue has the same resolution,
<strong>However Clean Boot is not a Troubleshooting step its a diagnosis</strong> to find what is causing the issue which will help us to help you in a better way.</em>" (sic)&nbsp;A "clean boot is
<em>not</em> a troubleshooting step it's a diagnosis"? Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't "troubleshooting" and "diagnosing" mean
<strong><em>exactly</em></strong> the same thing? I know what a "clean boot" is and how to do it and use it and in
<strong><em>point of fact</em></strong> usually do that first thing, but even when I have told the answerer that I already tried doing a clean boot and it was unhelpful, I am asked to do it again and then I am given a link to a Microsoft KB article on how to
 do a clean boot. Would you simply obey this guy and do a clean boot all over again, or would you be offended because this guy
<strong><em>obviously</em></strong> thinks you are an idiot and so have to be walked through the procedure because you were obviously too stupid to do it right the first time? If you wouldn't be offended, then apparently you have no self respect or else you
<strong><em>are</em> </strong>are an idiot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe me, this forum is the absolute last place I go to look for answers because there are
<strong><em>rarely</em></strong> any to be found here. But the people who seem to have nothing better to do than hang around this forum so they can answer questions to show everyone how smart they are
<strong><em>always</em></strong> start out by assuming you're an idiot. Read Oberwald's post again and pretent it was you that had asked the question, would
<strong><em>you&nbsp;</em></strong>accept his answer as <strong><em>useful</em></strong> information? If so, then you're simply another of the a-holes here trying to make me look bad to cover up the rampant ineptitude here. But, be assured, I will not be wasting
 my time here any more as it is painfully clear that the <strong><em>only</em></strong>&nbsp;thing I am going to find here is sarcasm, condescension and ridicule.</p>

You will automatically gain recognition and appreciation when you start helping other posters instead of spending a lot of time attacking respondents and&nbsp;calling them names. We still wait for the recipe you used to fix your machine, something other than the
 factory restore recommended by Oberwald. Note also that referring to respondents' replies as "dribble" is not the best way to maintain a discussion. I would use phrases such as "This is not quite what I had in mind - do you have any non-destructive suggestions
 to fix my problem?".

<p>For more than 3 years and 20+ questions I did <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> as you suggest and tried to be patient, equitable and soft speaking, but those are the very times I received the most sarcasm and&nbsp;condescension. I have never once
<strong><em>attacked</em></strong> anyone in these forums, everything I have written outside the original question has been in response to an attack upon me. I have no desire nor intention of "helping other posters" except as however much the answers to my
 questions might be of assisstance (though since I've never received a helpful answer, I doubt there would be much assisstance). I'm not looking for recognition, nor appreciation, simply the common courtesy I had extended in the first place. But, maybe you
 could give me an estimate of how much abuse I should put up with, before I start getting any of that recognition and appreciation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your, "We still wait for the recipe you used to fix your machine, something other than the factory restore recommended by Oberwald." Please begin holding your breath and I might get it on here before you pass out,
<strong><em>not!</em></strong> What is my incentive to help people who have been <strong>
<em>nothing</em></strong> but rude, condescending and outright abusive to me? After all, Oberwald, the magnificent, has already told you and everyone else that "<em>the only
<strong><u>reliable</u></strong> fix is a Factory Restore. <strong>Everything</strong> else is a waste of time and is likely to keep on causing problems</em>." So, how could I possibly add to that sage wisdom?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On no other forum have I received the kind of offensive treatment that I do on this site (except Windows Seven Forums, where I was banned for life because I had the adacity to explain why an answer given by a moderator to someone else was incorrect and would
 cause more harm than good, not attacking anyone, no name calling, nothing, just a simple explanation). Never, has anyone on any of those sites expected me to work for my answer by
<strong><em>first</em></strong> helping others, they always seem to be&nbsp;genuinely trying to help and not just letting everyone know how smart and special they are. Never, on any of those sites have I ever been ridiculed, condescended to, or treated like I was
 an idiot's idiot simply because I had a problem that no one had run into before and seemed to be enthusiastic about trying to help me solve the unusual problem. But not here on this forum. Here, if one has a problem that no one seems to have run into before,
 they don't rally around and try to solve the mystery, but rather they just spoon feed you stuff that you've already tried and found not to work and if you dare tell them that you have done those thing and they didn't work, even if this was
<strong><em>after</em></strong> retrying those things, you're treated as though you're an idiot that just doesn't understand plain English or else&nbsp;you're lieing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I had known in 1978 that I could have stolen everything I needed to become a monopolistic mega-corp with a strangle hold on the market as did Bill Gates, but I didn't and so Bill stole, lied,&nbsp; cheated and bullied&nbsp;his way to become a multi-billionare
 and so now&nbsp;I have no choice but to grovel at the feet of a fraud in order to be a part of the PC community. Do you think that bothers me, or even should bother me, I'd be willing to bet a bunch that you don't even believe that Bill Gates is a corporate criminal,
 do you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned 60 on the 19th of this month, how old were you in 1986? Well, I had already been working with computers for several years by then, and at the time did a lot of programming in Basic, GW Basic, C and other early PC programming languages. But after
 the first few releases of Windows it became almost impossible to really do any programming under Windows, because by then Microsoft was keeping the Windows kernel secret and unaccessable to anyone Microsoft didn't want competing with them and
<strong><em>vigorously</em></strong> prosecuting anyone who attempted to reverse engineer their software the way&nbsp;Bill Gates had done with the MAC OS when he developed Windows in the first place. Therefore, I pretty much despise everything Microsoft, but am
 never-the-less forced to use Microsoft products (or Apple's ridiculously over priced and over rated tech, which I think is about as unethical as one can get) if I want to be a part of the personal computer community and it's almost impossible<em>
<strong>not </strong></em>to use a computer today and expect to get anything done. So, I will bid you adieu and not darken Microsoft Community forums doorstep&nbsp;ever again. Besides, since I have never found an answer here, but always from some other site or sites,
 coming here is an exercise in futility and more frustration and more trouble&nbsp;than it's worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless you feel the need to tell anyone who might view this posting in the future what a terrible person I am, you needn't bother to respond as I won't be notified of that response.</p>

    <title>Two Installer problems..not enought storage and unable to access. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulpepe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Installer problems..not enought storage and unable to access.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I originally tried to install Safarai 4 and Itunes and received the error message saying that Windows Installer service could not be accessed. I then tried everything I could find in this forum PLUS more! Nothing worked so I decided to reinstall Installer
 4.5 from a download.&nbsp; While trying to install, I received the error message that there wasn't sufficient storage etc.&nbsp; I tried increasing the IRP Stack Size&nbsp; in increments of 5 until I reached 50 (rebooting after each increase) but that didn't thelp. So that
 eliminated the reinstalling and also&nbsp; running the&nbsp; Installer Check since I got the same message when I tried to insatall it. At this point, I cannot install anything primarily because of the msiserver problem.There seem to be other issue at stake as well but
 I am not sure they are all related.<br />
<br />
1. I cannot open my Security Center from either the control panel or from Programs.It doesn't do anything when I click on it. Have a similar, but &nbsp;sporadic, problem with opening Advanced System Optimizer (which I am starting to suspect may have something to
 do with this problem).<br />
2. I ran a System File CheckerScan.&nbsp; It did a 100% verification but the gave me "Windows resources could not perform the requested operation." Tried twice...same results.<br />
3. Tried to Start msiServer but it stops and says thata some programs turn off if not in use, so I don't know if it is running on not.<br />
4. I studied my events log and learned that the first occurrence of the msiserve problem happened on August 26. But it was evidently only sporadic because I did do some installationssince then.&nbsp; But, I noticed that the Warning messages became more frequent.
 The event data give error 0x80080005 followed by 4 "(null)."<br />
<br />
5. When I checked the entries for&nbsp; the "No storage space"problem, The following&nbsp; was stated: "The description for Event ID 4373 from source
<strong>NtServicePack </strong>cannot be found...." It says it is either not installed or is corrupted.&nbsp; My question here is:Why NT ServicePack be referencedor installed&nbsp;on a Vista system or is there something I am not privvy&nbsp; to??<br />
<br />
Are there any ideas and/or answers? I am sure I have probably missed some important points since I have been working on this for the past 4 days and have probably forgotten some things.&nbsp; I would appreciate any assistance or advise. I am really not looking forward
 to reinstalling my entire system.&nbsp; Is there anyway to&nbsp; do spot installs, like just the Installer Program???

    <title>Family Safety in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickmeeks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 8.1 desktop with local accounts only . &nbsp;I would like to add all local accounts to Family Safety with out changing them to microsoft accounts. &nbsp; I also do not want to make the primary administrative account on the machine tied to my microsoft
 account. &nbsp;The only time I want to use the microsoft account is when changing family safety settings. I would like to enable the Family Safety on the local accounts including the primary administrator's account and use the single microsoft account (Not an account
 on the machine) to secure changes to Family Safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;(Basically how it worked very well in Windows 7)Is this possible or did MS change the way it works in 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately you don't have an option to setup family safety with a Microsoft account. It is mandatory to have Microsoft account, because when you add a child to your family, you'll get regular activity report emails to your Microsoft account, summarizing
 how much time the child spent on the PC, the websites they visited, the games and apps they used, and the terms they've looked up in search engines like Bing, Google, or Yahoo! Search.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once your child has been added to your family with a Microsoft account, you’ll be able to set up appropriate website and app and game restrictions for their age, set PC time limits, and review their recent activity. Their settings will apply to any
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> device that they sign in to.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you're getting an error upon opening your photos via Photo Gallery. Let me help you with this concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate this issue first, please provide the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the error message appear to all photos or videos that you try to open?</li><li>What is the exact location of the photo where you encountered the error? (Right-click then select
<strong>Open file location</strong>)</li><li>What is the file type of the affected photo/s?</li><li>What is the version of your Photo Gallery? (Press <strong>Alt + F</strong> then
<strong>About Photo Gallery</strong>)</li><li>What is your operating system?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, please try to repair Windows Essentials in your PC to isolate that there are no corrupted files in the system. To do this, kindly refer below:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> button + <strong>R</strong>, input <strong>
AppWiz.cpl</strong>, then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Search for <strong>Windows Essentials 2012</strong> (or Windows Live Essentials 2011) on the list and then select it.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Uninstall/Change.</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Repair all Windows Essentials programs</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Is there something that will <strong>Repair the photos Windows Essentials programs has altered?"</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Good news: I had all my photos backed up.</span></p>
<p>Bad news: the back up had just completed on my G: drive, and Photo Gallery went ahead and 'defaulted' them (without asking btw), and now all the exif data is gone on my g drive.
</p>
<p>We are talking ....thousands of photos.</p>
<p>Good news: I have an older back up </p>
<p>Bad News, if you don't know how to get my exif data back, this means I just lost all my summer holiday photos, since the back up is set run tonight (weekly).</p>
<p>More Bad News: Even if I do have this older back up, I am still the owner of Windows 7: and I still have this scary Essentials/Photo Gallery program still running on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: If I open this back up and restore, won't Photo Gallery re-create the same problem, and delete all my exif again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to put any pressure on you guys, but I am freaking out. This is some major scarey stuff. I don't even understand why Windows 7 asked to open my files, and then deleted all my exif data... it doesn't even make sense.</p>

            <p>Hello: Please accept my apologies for the delay. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanted to give you an update and let you know that I appreciate your efforts to help me, and to let you know why the exif data didn't exist (even though I could still view the pictures), in case this happens to someone else. I am also asking that
 you forward this to a department in "windows activation" so someone in help me resolve the remaining issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not view the exif data on the pictures due to a Trojan, which had turned my machine into a virtual computer. I had discovered this when following your steps, because I discovered I did not have administrator rights to my stand alone computer. I also
 discovered at that time several distressing things, not in the least my computer hadn't updated in months (although according to my virtual machine, it had) and as for Microsoft Security running, well it had only 'appeared to run', but was in fact disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to wipe everything clean, but when I started it up again, I soon found the problem had returned: Part of the reason was the trojan was located in my X drive, as part of the start up partition, and formatting my hard-drive did not 'reach' it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reload the BIOS, and I had hoped this had eliminated the nasty Trojan, but once again, after I reloaded my back ups, it was back. Yes, I had ran scans on the back up drive, and again after reinstalling the files, but for some reason neither
 Kapersky, nor Microsoft Security detected the source of the Trojan code, and it nested once again in my X drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to cripple the offending code using Karpersky's troubleshooting feature, and I reloaded the BIOS from Lenovo's site using a hard reboot, and forcing the BIOS to not read the hard drive, only the USB code. For all I know, that code is still there...
 , as I cannot access the partition (I still don't have 'permission'), but when I read the property's, it is at 100% capacity of the , which is MB in it than is necessary for a BIOS startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From July to August, I was without a computer. I purchased a refurbished Lenovo laptop, so I could find a way to fix the Lenovo tower, as the trojan code was located in the Boot sector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short: I have since been able to get the original Lenovo up and running, but it won't let me re-activate it, despite using the original Windows activation code they gave me when I bought the refurbished machine in December of 2013.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I had to wipe everything out, I believe during the re-installing of the BIOS, I possibly erased the the COA, or possibly reset it to the original FPO number it had before it was refurbished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the paperwork and the receipts, but I could use a little help getting this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help from a loyal and paying customer, Mau</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happens when you insert SD card in your card reader?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>B.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you set a password on the memory card?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>C.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to read other memory cards from your card reader?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>D.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the SD card getting recognized on other computers?</span></p>
<p><span>If the card reader is not working you may update the drivers for the same from the manufacturer’s website and try to copy music files.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
<strong>Star</strong><span>t</span>, type <strong>device manager</strong> in the start search box and press
<strong>OK</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Right-click on the driver and click on
<strong>update</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Close
<span>Device Manager</span>, and then click <span>OK</span>. </span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Another option is to connect the device to your computer using a cable and download music to your computer. Sometimes micro SD card will require an adapter or converter to be
 used with the card reader. </span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

    <title>Will a windows.old folder be made if I reinstall Windows 8.1&#63; How - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Will a windows.old folder be made if I reinstall Windows 8.1&#63; How close to &#34;factory fresh&#34; is a reset&#47;refresh&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I do not have access to a hard drive and windows will not allow me to shrink my partition enough to create a backup partition to suit my needs.&nbsp; In general when I reinstall windows, I use my secondary hard drive.&nbsp; However, I have a large directory (~500gb)
 of files that my secondary hard drive can't contain.&nbsp; I remember the windows.old folder being created sometimes, and I just wanted to know some things.&nbsp; When is this folder created? If I choose to do a fresh install of windows 8 (not a cleanup of an existing
 one), will it be created, and if so, from what directories are files collected to go into windows.old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, for some reason, the windows.old folder isn't create when doing a fresh installation of windows 8.1, how near to "factory settings" is a refresh or a reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put simply, here are my goals:</p>
<p>1. Completely reinstall my operating system such that I have a completely clean copy (no trace of anything in windows/ program files/ user directories that wouldn't be there on a newly built system)</p>
<p>2. Keep a particular directory full of files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intuitively I some reason think that if the directory is in the root of my hard drive, there's no reason for Windows to delete it when installing, since it's not in Windows, Users, Program Files, or ProgramData directories, but I'm sure it can't be that
 simple.</p>

            <p>Windows.old is only created when you do a custom install by booting from install media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is NOT created by doing a Refresh or Reset. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have retail install media for Windows 8:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot from the Windows&nbsp;8 DVD<br />
<br />
Click Install Now<br />
<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows&nbsp;8 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>
