    <title>Windows Updates require administrator, but I am the administrator - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Updates require administrator, but I am the administrator</h2>
                    <p>At some point in the past I was able to run Windows Updates, but for the last little while I haven't seen any update notifications, and I noticed today when I tried to do it manually that Update requires administrator privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My user account is set to Administrator type, and it's the only account on the computer. I am actually able to run other programs as administrator, by right-clicking and choosing "Run as administrator". It doesn't prompt me for a password or anything, it
 just runs as instructed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a prebuilt machine, I built it myself. So there's no reason I should be locked out, and indeed I was not locked out before. I don't remember changing anything manually to put Updates behind an admin wall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how do I update my operating system? I understand the need for security features but operating system updates are a pretty basic thing, and should not be locked out this way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Windows 7 have a hidden administrator account that I can activate, not to use on a regular basis, but just to run Windows Update once in a while since I can't do it from my own account anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I was able to activate the hidden administrator account. To do this, run the command prompt by right-clicking and choosing Run As Administrator, and then enter the following command: net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reboot the computer you should see an Administrator account that you can use, in addition to your regular user accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However -- this still doesn't solve the problem! When I log in under that Administrator account I still do not have the option to manually check for Windows updates. I was able to check a box that says "allow all users to run updates", but that didn't change
 what I could do through either the Administrator account or my regular user account (which is Administrator type).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: solved. From your administrator account go look at your registry keys. If there's anything in there called DisableAutoUpdates or similar, delete it. Apparently this can be stuck in there by malware and prevent you from updating Windows.

<h2>            How to reconnect my LCD Connector&#63;</h2>
                    My problem is that I have this white screen at startup and it won't change, it'll remain white always. I've figured out from some searching that it may be due to a loose LCD Connector thing. I think I've found a guide on how to dissemble my laptop front,
 although I'm not sure if the LCD Cable they name it as is the same as the LCD connector that I need to re-attach. Here's the guide I read. http://www.insidemylaptop.com/remove-replace-lcd-screen-inverter-hp-pavilion-dv6000-laptop/&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I really want
 to fix my laptop, since I have no cash to send it in to my manufacturer, so I have to fix it myself.<br />

I do not see anything at all when I start my laptop up. So I don't see any options or anything so I can't go into the BIOS.<br />
I could try using an external monitor, I'll see how that goes when I try setting it up later, but I don't think it's my screen as far as I know. I digged into my computer a few days ago and I think, not for sure, but found a somewhat broken wire which I think
 might have been the lcd cable I was talking about earlier.<br />

</p><p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After several month I tried to run the update to Internet Explorer 10 again (I had excluded the update during the last months from the list of updates because it permanently failed, also the update to IE11)&nbsp;and now - what surprise&nbsp; - it worked, Microsoft
 apparently fixed the issue with some miscellaneous update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am using Microsoft Windows 7 Professional for 64bit.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Then I tried to upgrade to IE 11 and failed again with error code80246007. (the same error I had with the update to IE10)</span></p>
<p><span>Then I realized the existence of optional updates for Windows 7 (KB2830477(for 64bit only)&nbsp;&amp; KB2858725) and installed them.</span></p>
<p><span>After that I tried again the upgrade to IE11 and it worked. After restart the system get stuck, so I had to force shutdown, but after that the system started without a problem and also the IE11 works fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am happy now, but it was a long journey...</span></p>

<h2>            changing desktop icons in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have just purchased a new pc with Windows 10. I would like to change the icons for some of my desktop short cuts. I always used to do I through properties in previous versions but that option is no longer there. I have read other posts in this forum
 which suggest I go to properties and customise but that option is not showing.Thanks. Trish</p>

            Many thanks I can see that this works on programs, for example. However, I keep a pretty busy desktop for quick access and I am trying to change icons on some of my documents, pdf etc. On my old pc I could change them via the method you have suggested,
 but if I do this on a pdf it does not give me the same options. All I get are the tabs of General, Security, Details and Previous versions.&nbsp; Any other suggestions?&nbsp; Many thanks again.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing desktop icons is only applicable to applications. As of the moment, doing this to files (such as PDF) is beyond system limitations. To improve our services, we highly suggest that you

<p>And one more thing... Don't think that my above post is supposed to be mean, because it's not. I'm simply saying that there are always going to be those extremely good players. I've been in multiple matches where some 15th prestige goes in and gets dogs

<h2>            Searches only return results that have a space before search string</h2>
                    For example, if I simply enter the letter 'h' when searching a&nbsp; folder every one of whose files contains an 'h', I get back only those in which the 'h' is preceded by a space, e.g. I get
<u>-A1<b>h</b>29 last part, ] <b>h</b>igh-school</u>, but not <u>-A2<b>h</b>153b.2 three other boys, ] remember</u>.
<br />
<br />
And no, I did not inadvertently enter a space before the 'h'.<br />

            <p>There are a couple of somewhat incomplete descriptions of the syntax out there somewhere that I have found some time ago by Googling.&nbsp; I also found that some&nbsp;described syntax just doesn't work, perhaps because they only work with specific properties being
 searched (such as name versus content), or because the descriptions may have been valid for Vista when they were written but not Windows 7.&nbsp; I took it upon myself to read around, try testing ideas, and make my own notes, which are now around 20 pages.&nbsp; I'll
 put some of those notes here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>( ) parentheses:<span>&nbsp; </span>
search operators and text that is placed within parentheses is taken to belong to the search property immediately preceding the opening parenthesis.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, name:(cat man) gives results whose name contains words (or other text strings) that are or begin with both cat and man (but not merely either).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Parentheses can also be used to affect priority of special words AND, OR, and NOT as described later in these notes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is ineffective to place special search syntax symbols (=, ~=, and others described in the next few paragraphs) immediately before search text that is within parentheses, as the search results given are the same as would be there if the symbols were
 not used.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, instead of entering name:=(buns), enter name:(=buns), or since with a single word of search text the parentheses are optional, enter name:=buns.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>" " quotation marks:&nbsp; By default, the “Find partial matches” setting is active (in the Folder Options dialog box, Search tab), which means that results include items with words that begin with the characters
 of the search text.&nbsp; If quotation marks are placed around the search text, then the effect is the same as deactivating that setting, and the results only include items with words that are the same as the search text.&nbsp; (Some special syntax described later can
 override the effect:&nbsp; ~, ~=, ~!, ~&lt;, ~&gt;, and $&lt;.)&nbsp; When quotation marks are placed around two or more strings of text (words) separated by spaces, by default Windows 7 Search treats the strings as a list.&nbsp; So, for example, name:"one two three" finds items
 whose names contain every string in the list, in any order.&nbsp; </span></span></span>[Update:&nbsp; bizarrely, the mostly equivalent property called "filename" does enforce order, actually, while "file" and "name" do not.]<span>&nbsp;
</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The quotation marks are not sufficient to treat the list as a single string (or phrase).&nbsp; Treating the list as a single string requires special syntax symbols (=, ~, ~=, ~!, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ~&lt;, and ~&gt;
 work, but $&lt; and $= do not) to precede the first quotation mark.&nbsp; Unfortunately, none of the working syntax symbols allow searching for a phrase that appears anywhere in the property text except for ~=, and ~= includes items that have other text immediately
 before or after the search text.&nbsp; For example, content:~="goose pimple" would include items whose content text had “bgoose pimpleq”.&nbsp; If only content with “goose pimple” as a distinct phrase was desired, then to get results closer to that desire (but not completely
 successfully), enter content:(~="goose pimple" "goose pimple").&nbsp; That search would, however, include items that did not have the distinct phrase but instead “bgoose pimpleq” if the content text also had separate instances of “goose” and “pimple”.&nbsp; If instances
 such as "bgoose pimpleq" are not considered to be a problem, then it is sufficient to enter content:~="goose pimple".&nbsp; [update:&nbsp; apparently ~= only works for the content property for&nbsp;files&nbsp;in non-indexed folders, so we have a very weird deficiency of Windows
 7 Search]</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>With the use of special syntax symbols, quotation marks also allow searching for non-alphanumeric symbols that otherwise would not be searchable, as described in the section titled “How to search for symbols
 or text containing symbols (non-alphanumeric):” later in these notes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>= equals sign:<span>&nbsp; </span>
only gives results for items whose searched property exactly equals the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Usage of = with properties whose possibilities are limited in some way by Windows is redundant because those properties are searched that way by default.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, kind:=picture give results no different from kind:picture.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>~ tilde:<span>&nbsp; </span>works as =, except it permits the use of wildcard characters (* and ?), described later in these notes.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>~= tilde and equals sign:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items that have the search text anywhere in the property, regardless of appearing at the start, within, or at the end of other text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Two tildes ~~ works same as the tilde and equals sign.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>~! tilde and exclamation point:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items that do not have the search text anywhere in the property.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&lt;</span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&gt; less-than and greater-than signs:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items whose searched property does not exactly equal the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The character ≠ (not equal to) works the same as the less-than and greater-than signs, although it is not as convenient to use because it is not available on computer keyboards.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&gt; greater-than sign:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
gives results for items whose searched property is greater than the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>“Greater than” can mean numerically more<span>&nbsp; </span>or alphabetically later than, and can also apply to file sizes, dates, and times.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>.. two periods:<span>&nbsp; </span>
when placed between two strings of search text, searching will give results for items whose searched property is greater than or equal to the earlier string of search text while also less than or equal to the later string of search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The text can be numerical or alphabetical, and can apply to file sizes, dates, and times.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>~</span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&lt; tilde and less-than sign:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items whose searched property begins with the search text.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>~&gt; tilde and greater-than sign:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items whose searched property ends with the search text.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>$&lt; dollar sign and less-than sign:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items whose searched property contains any words (or other text strings) that match or begins with the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>By default, Windows 7 Search already searches that way without $&lt;.<span>&nbsp; </span>
For example, name:$&lt;rat gives results no different from name:rat.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the “Find partial matches” setting (in the Folder Options dialog box, Search tab) has been deactivated, then $&lt; would be necessary to search that way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With $&lt;, the use of quotation marks put around the search text has their default effect of treating separate text strings (words) as a list, and not as a single string (or phrase).</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>$=<span>&nbsp; </span>dollar sign and equals sign:<span>&nbsp;
</span>gives results for items whose searched property contains any words (or other text strings) that exactly match the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With $=, the use of quotation marks put around the search text has their default effect of treating separate text strings (words) as a list, and not as a single string (or phrase).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Two dollar signs $$ works the same as the dollar sign and equals sign.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>- hyphen-minus:<span>&nbsp; </span>
The minus sign has the effect of searching for the opposite of what the search otherwise specifies.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is effective when placed immediately before the search property, immediately before search text that does not use most of the special syntax symbols (=, ~=, ~!, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ~&lt;, ~&gt;, $&lt;, and $=, but works with ..), or immediately before any search
 text regardless of syntax symbols if the symbols and text are enclosed within parentheses.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, -name:cow and name:-cow perform the same search, giving all items whose name does not have the word “cow” or a word that starts with “cow”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For another example, -name:~&lt;fig and name:-(~&lt;fig) perform the same search, giving all items whose name does not start with “fig”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The minus sign works inconsistently with search terms containing any wildcards (* and ?) depending on the search property.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Read later in these notes about restrictions affecting the search properties.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>AND:<span>&nbsp; </span>The word AND is a redundant feature, because simply entering search terms together is effectively performing the function of AND.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, name:(we AND bu) gives the same results as name:(we bu).<span>&nbsp;
</span>For another example, name:bit AND ext:.doc gives the same results as name:bit ext:.doc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word AND is only interpreted as search syntax when the letters are all uppercase (capitals).<span>&nbsp;
</span>A space needs to follow AND for it to work, unless it immediately precedes text in parentheses or quotation marks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>OR:<span>&nbsp; </span>The word OR allows for searching for alternative search terms with the same search property, and also allows for searching with alternative search properties.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, tag:(beach OR pool) gives results whose tag properties have either (or both) the words (or starts of words) “beach” and “pool”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For another example, foldername:=gong OR path:clang gives results that are immediately within a folder named “gong” or have a path that has the word (or start of a word) “clang” somewhere.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word OR is only interpreted as search syntax when the letters are all uppercase (capitals).<span>&nbsp;
</span>A space needs to follow OR for it to work, unless it immediately precedes text in parentheses or quotation marks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>NOT:<span>&nbsp; </span>The word NOT has the same effect as the minus sign described earlier.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word NOT is only effective as search syntax when the letters are all uppercase (capitals).<span>&nbsp;
</span>A space needs to follow NOT for it to work, unless it immediately precedes text in parentheses or quotation marks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the usage requirements of NOT match those of the minus sign, such as requiring parentheses around search text when used immediately before search text that uses special syntax symbols, as in name:NOT(~&lt;g).</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>AND, OR, and NOT:<span>&nbsp; </span>
When more than one of these words is used (or the same word is used more than once), Windows Search interprets the priority as though search terms were within parenthesis from left to right.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, filename:blue NOT ext:.txt OR content:blue AND size:&lt;100kB is interpreted as ((filename:blue NOT ext:.txt) OR content:blue) AND size:&lt;100kB.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To change the priority, the search properties can be reordered or parentheses can be placed elsewhere as required to have the desired search performed.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>* asterisk:<span>&nbsp; </span>The asterisk can serve as a “wildcard” and substitute for any number of characters within search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For instance, m*ns would match moons, mountains, and maidens.<span>&nbsp; </span>
For information on the usage limitations of the asterisk wildcard, read the paragraph later in these notes that begins “* asterisk and ? question mark”.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>? question mark:<span>&nbsp; </span>
The question mark can serve as a “wildcard” and substitute for a single character within search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For instance, pe?t would match pert and peat, d??p would match drip and drop, and t???an would match tartan and Taiwan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The usage limitations of the question mark wildcard are described in the next paragraph.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>* asterisk and ? question mark:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The two symbols can serve as wildcard characters with some properties such as filename: (some such as content: need the ~ symbol also).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The asterisk * can mean any number of unspecified characters, and the question mark ? means exactly one unspecified character.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When a wildcard * or ? is used, the search text is only compared to the start of the text of an item.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, filename:y?k could give results with items whose filename is or starts with yak or yuk, but not items that only have such words elsewhere than the start.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, filename:y*k could give results with items whose filename is or starts with yak, yuk, yeek, or yamok, but not items that only have such words elsewhere than the start.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To include results matching later words, also place * as the first character of the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, the search results might then give results that don’t begin with the desired character, requiring a more complicated search to limit the results closer to what is wanted (but still not completely successfully).<span>&nbsp;
</span>For instance, folder:*m*ns gives items contained in folders named “moons” and “big mountains”, but also “salmons”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To try to exclude “salmons” and others with no words that start with m, enter folder:(*m*ns m).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The exclusion is imperfect however, as items in folders with “salmons mix” would be included for instance, which does not match the desired form m*ns.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, folder:*pe?t gives items contained in folders named “pert” and “the peat”, but also “respect”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To try to exclude “respect” and all others whose folder name does not have a word beginning with pe, enter folder:(*pe?t pe).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The exclusion is imperfect however, as items in folders with “respect pepper” would be included for instance, which does not match the desired form pe?t.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When search text with a wildcard * or ? is within quotation marks, the results only include items whose entire property text matches the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, filename:"y?k" would give results with items whose filename is yak or yuk, but not yak.txt, yaka or “yuk ick”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Most of the search syntax symbols (=, ~=, ~!, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, .., ~&lt;, ~&gt;, $&lt;, and $=) do not permit the usage of * and ? as wildcard symbols within the desired searched text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, for example, path:~=th?ck would not work to find items whose path contains “thick” for instance, but instead would attempt to find items whose path contains the specific characters th?ck.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The search syntax symbol ~ does permit wildcard usage of * and ?.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>Ah, I see, that is because the default way that the search behaves is to only find matches at&nbsp;the starts of strings, rather than including matches within.&nbsp; You can use special syntax symbols.&nbsp; Enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>~=h</p>
<p><span><span>[Update:&nbsp; apparently special search symbols such as ~= don't work when no specific property such as name is entered when searching in indexed locations, but do work when searching in non-indexed locations.&nbsp; So, enter name:~=h and not just ~=h.]</span></span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft Bedrock not free with Xbox One Edition disc</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I need help getting the bedrock edition of Minecraft on the Xbox One. So I bought the Xbox one edition disc around Christmas (2017) and then I went to play it. I soon found it there was a newer copy, and it was supposed to be free but it wasn’t. So I decided to wait,and wait until this point. I’ve contacted Mojang about it and their response is to message Xbox Support. Did I miss the deadline to get it free and I have to buy it or do I have a chance to get it free?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Note: I haven’t bought a DLC or played it for at least 5 hours until about February</p>

            Hi JW56947 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Normally scanned documents will default to your pictures folder.
<br />So open file explorer and then go to your Pictures folder do you see random folders in there, chances are your scans are in there.
<br />Also what is the make and model of your scanner?       
        </p>

<p>Sarah thank you for your response.&nbsp; I filed the scanned documents to my document file.&nbsp; It will only show me page one of 10 pages.&nbsp; In the Windows 10 scanned window it shows all of the 10 documents.</p>
<p>My scanner is a HP Officejet 6958 Printer Scanner.&nbsp; I have been converting the pages to PDF files but it is slow and cumbersome.&nbsp; I have a couple of hundred more documents to scan to my computer.</p>

            You should scan a multi-page document as a PDF, which can have any number of pages. Image formats like .tiff and .jpeg are one image per file.

            My printer/scanner is a HP Officejet 6958.&nbsp; It does not show PDF as an option, only Tiff, Jpeg and a couple of others.&nbsp; Believe me I looked for PDF to no avail

                    <p>I haven't been able to sync my emails to the Windows 10 mail app on my laptop, but it works perfectly fine on my mobile device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the error code: 0x80072ee2 and "We can't connect to eas.outlook.com right now"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even open the Store app? My networks are all properly connected, I've tried disabling my firewall to see if it loads with no success, and I've opened CMD and run a scan to see if there were any issues, there weren't. I've even removed it as a device
 and no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've scoured the community forum and tried all the other answers/suggestions given, and nothing is fixing my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an ETA of when microsoft/windows is going to get this sorted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use an ASUS R556L laptop. Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I can obviously use the web outlook program and my phone, but for work purposes, it's easier to use the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: It's either fixed itself randomly or microsoft did something, cause I've just had all my emails load in the mail app on my laptop.</p>

            The problem is that following your methd the option to block sender or block senders domain is greyed out and cannot be selected.&nbsp; However I have found a somewhat long-winded way of getting round this by right clicking on the message selecting propertes/details/message
 source and looking for the sending domain @.......&nbsp;&nbsp; I then copy this.&nbsp; Opening the junk drop-down menu and selecting safety options and then the blocked senders tab i can then manually add the domain to block by selecting 'add' and pasting the copied domain
 name into the box.&nbsp;&nbsp; The greying out of the easy option to block sender only occurs with some messages. Perhaps the bad people have a way of preventing blocking!<br />

    <title>How do I add a &#34;Play device&#34; to my &#34;Playback - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I add a &#34;Play device&#34; to my &#34;Playback devices&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have a Sony SRS-X7 bluetooth speaker. I want the audio of my laptop to be played through the speaker. As you can see from the screenshot, I can see that my computer is recognizing it as an audio device in "Devices" and as a "Play Device" in "Connected
 devices". However, I can't seem to add it to my "Playback devices"; which I then want to have the option of designating as my default audio device. How would I do this? I can only seem to airplay from iTunes through the speaker, and the cast thing in chrome
 / Edge doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Question about Resetting or Reinstalling Windows 10 or registering new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Resetting or Reinstalling Windows 10 or registering new Copy of Windows 10 with existing account</h2>
                    <p>I created a new account every time that I either reset or reinstalled Windows 10 with the intention of starting fresh on the operating system.&nbsp; I have come to the realization that this approach may be inefficient.&nbsp; My desire when I either reset or reinstall
 an operating system or replace the operating system or computer with a newer operating system or computer is to start fresh. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is after I create a new account when I install a new copy of Windows 10 on my computer, such as an Outlook account, if I use that same account after I either reset or reinstall Windows 10 on the existing computer or install a fresh copy of Windows
 10 on a newer computer, will Windows 10 keep its default settings from the fresh reset or reinstallion or new installation, or will it automatically make the changes to the operating system's settings and functions that were made in either the previous operating
 system setup or older computer once I login with that account? &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, based on your past experience(s) transitioning from an older operating system to a newer operating system such as from Windows 7 to Windows 8 or from Windows 8 to Windows 10, if I used the same account on an operating system that is supposed to replace
 Windows 10, such as a possible Windows 11, would that operating system still keep its default settings after registering the account or would it automatically modify its functions and settings to those which are similar to the functions and settings of the
 older operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi jpolk1138 
<br />
<br />If you mean you create a new Microsoft Account each time you reset Windows, that is totally inefficient and would make it impossible to link into your old accounts like Skype, Outlook . . etc
<br />
<br />If you mean you totally wipe everything during the Reset and create a new user profile on the PC and then link that to your existing Microsoft Account, that is a good way to create a clean System
<br />
<br />If you have Account Sync set up on your Microsoft Account, then all your settings will be reloaded after you link back into that Microsoft Account, if you do not want that to happen, go to Settings - Accounts - Sync your Settings
<br />
<br />With regards to Windows 11, that will not be happening, Windows 10 is the last version of Windows it will in the future be renamed to just Windows and each year the upgrade process will continue . .  
<br />
<br />Upgrading from say Windows 8 to Windows 10 and logging in with the same Microsoft Account will not keep the same settings, since those settings will vary vastly between operating systems . . .

<br />Yes, if you register with the same account info, your email address, then the install will give you the option of using the same info as on the old install. Be sure your OneDrive info, such as Favorites, is up to date.

            Hi JP.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can choose what you want Sync'd across all of your devices signed in with the same MS account, in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync your Settings.  
<br />
<br />This way when you sign in on a fresh install, only the things you want sync'd will be, and you can set the others on your own.  
<br />
<br />If you have problems with Account sync which has never worked right for me (e.g. Edge Favorites, many settings) then you can run the MS Accounts Troubleshooter which specifically sorts out sync issues (when it works):  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-accounts-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/microsoft-account...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>My choices: clean installation or reset and save my user files........ I purchased a new Lenova Win10 system this week and during my setup/configuration sessions i somehow managed to deactivate my Admin. account.&nbsp; Consequently, most of my data files cannot
 be opened, and I cannot make changes to my system without Admin. authority.&nbsp; I'm ready to reset Windows and if I can avoid a total scrub of the system (requiring full reinstall of all my user data) i would be a happy camper.&nbsp; The way I interpret the "Reset
 while saving user data option" however, is that it does not reset the user accounts, thus I am left with the same problem I am trying to resolve.&nbsp; If there is a way to easily accomplish a reset while saving user data, and also reset my user accounts rather
 than to&nbsp; start from scratch with my user setup, then I am hoping someone can enlighten me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the full reset option which erases the user data rids the system of my user accounts and allows me to start from scratch with a new user account with Admin privileges, then i suppose it is better to do that now than later since i am but three days into
 this new system configuration and set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank you in advance for the best advice on how to overcome my present predicament.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
