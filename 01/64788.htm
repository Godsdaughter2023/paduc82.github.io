<h3> tojusmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Inspiron 15 ghost clicking</h2>
                    <p>my computer is really messed up now. occasionally it starts to click on its own and there are white circles popping up at random on the touchscreen. closing windows, clicking on this and I have no control of the PC anymore. the task pane also bounces left
 and right while this is happening. I noticed this started after a failed attempt to update my PC due to poor internet where I was at the time. Since then, I have done a clean reinstall of windows 10 on this computer and the same thing keeps happening. I don't
 know what to do now.&nbsp; I tried running the DISM and SFC checks but it didnt seem to help. please someone help me solve this problem.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
A faulty touchscreen driver is one of the possible reasons why you are having a ghost touch issue on your computer. May we know if you have tried to download and install the latest touchscreen driver from the manufacturer's website of your device? If yes, we
 suggest that you contact the manufacturer of your device for further assistance since this could be a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Should you have further queries, feel free to post it.

<p>Dell has replaced my screen twice and the daughterboard once (and reinstalled the OS) and this issue persists.&nbsp; Sorry to say, we may have a manufacturing issue here.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works to completely uninstall the touch screen in the device manager (which you can do even without a mouse if the ghost touch is so bad that the pointer is useless).&nbsp; But this obviously disables a feature you paid a lot for.&nbsp; It also re-installs itself
 periodically and you must keep doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They need to replace the whole system, and we may have a recall situation here.</p>

<h2>            What does &#34;ffffffff&#34; in the registry indicate&#47;do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I installed and began playing a new game on a machine with dual core Turion proc and 2GB ram.&nbsp; The game began giving me "paged pool memory low" messages, and performed very poorly.&nbsp; After digging around on the internet, I learned that disabling "terminal
 services," in addition to changing a regedit file could fix this issue.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions and changed "paged pool limit" in regedit from 0x10000000 to 0xffffffff.</p>
<p>after I restarted, process explorer showed that my paged pool limit had jumped from 160MB to 358MB.&nbsp; The game now runs perfectly, and the laptop seems to perform faster in general.</p>
<p>My question is...why did that work?&nbsp; What does "ffffffff" mean in a .reg file?</p>

<p>The 4GB (FFFFFFFF) is the maximum that can be stored in that field type in the registry. It is easier for someone to tell you to allocate the infinite maximum rather work out the physical maximum. I suspect it would work equally as well if you allocated
 a hex value of 15752A00, which is 360,000,000 in decimal.</p>

<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>I'm having problems with a game i got for christmas called ''Dishonored''. I tried the solutions proposed on xbox.ca.</p>
<p>I can sometimes manage to start the game but the bethesda logo appears and then the ''disk is unreadable'' screen appears and I can't play it. It's a brand new game and I can't make it work. However, Battlefield 3 works but I didn't try other games. Is there
 something I can do? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi ArtificialSound, </p>
<p>&nbsp;One big tip I have for you is the new game you bought "Dishonored" if it hasn't passed the 30-Day Trade Back new for full price thing, you can do that. Trade it back to wherever you bought it and you'll get your money you diserve. Also, If you bought it
 at GameStop or any other store you can call them and explain your issue and see what they can do. I'm not a expert so I don't know in deatile what they can do for you.Lastly, If you have your receipt you should be able to get your money back. In Conclusion,
 Best Luck to you, have fun in Dishonored I heard it's a good game and have a Happy New Year. &nbsp;
</p>

<p>Try to install your Dishonored game on you hard drive. Makes it easier on your Xbox to run it. Get a air spray can and blow it in your Xbox vents etc. I do this on occasion myself. Hope everything works out.</p>

<p>I cannot install my game because at some point when it's intalling it says that the disc is unreadable and I can't install it. I'll probably just go and replace my cd drive so my games can be read, sucks though I can't play my new games...</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

    <title>Why Is Boosting Not Considering Cheating&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why Is Boosting Not Considering Cheating&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;And therefore a bannable offense? It's ridiculous. Literally <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
every leaderboard</span> I care about is headed by someone who just cheated shamelessly to get there. I don't understand, you can File a Complaint against someone&nbsp;for Cheating, but if it involves boosting, then no action is taken. If 'boosting' doesn't fall
 under this category, then <strong>what</strong> exactly is considering cheating?<br />
<br />
I would expect that preventing manipulation of the leaderboards to one's own advantage would be
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">one of the highest priorities</span></strong> for the XBLPET and the developers, but this lack of action against such legitimate cheaters seems to speak otherwise. Again,<strong> why have leaderboards in the first
 place if you're just going to enable miserable people to cheat them?<br />
</strong><br />
These dishonest people truly ruin the experience for the rest of the community who&nbsp;are honest and play with dignity. Why enable them to perpetuate this childishness on and on? Some people really&nbsp;need to be taught a lesson in honest dealing and earning things
 the hard way.</p>

<p>Because technically it isn't cheating. They are doing nothing that isn't isn't available through normal play.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I hate boosters. They ruined the online in Resident Evil 5, where it became impossible to find a game where people wanted to play properly, but again technically they were doing nothing wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course the great problem is that online games do get ruined by boosters. They claim they boost because the online is dying, but quite often it is dying because people are boosting.</p>

<p>It's not actionable because MS knows that they make money off these kind of people. Boosters "play" games most other people wouldn't touch. Sure not all of the buy games new but plenty do, and MS notices. That's also why every new DLC comes with new achievements,
 it makes the boosters and completionists feel like the HAVE to go for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is cheating but most people around here will defend it because they either do it themselves or they're friends with people who do. There's no good excuse for why it's acceptable.</p>

<p>Interesting thoughts.<br />
<br />
I guess I just want to learn more about this 'technicality' mindset.<br />
<br />
I mean, I understand fully if they (as in Xbox) find it difficult to prove that people are boosting, but to write it off completely as some acceptable action when most people deem it unacceptable is odd. It's wrong if leaderboards are to actually mean something,
 otherwise, then just do whatever. Game On.<br />
<br />
But the legitimacy is lost.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the clear definition of 'cheating'? If you unknowingly report people for boosting, then your report rating goes down, and XBox in turn takes your&nbsp;outcries&nbsp;less seriously. I would imagine a lot of genuine complaints are made exactly in that fashion.</p>

<p>Can you give me some examples of the boosters that bug you? A lot of boosting sessions don't affect anyone, so making those bannable seems a bit harsh to me.

<p>To be honest, I had more problems with quitters. Nothing is as frustrating as playing a 10 minute game (even giving my opponent some kills so he thinks he still has a chance) and seeing the opponent quit out right at the end. Those are the ones who really
 ruined the multiplayer for me in that game and many others.</p>

<p>It's not about boosters bothering people directly, it's the principal of cheating that is wrong. Boosters are not earning the stuff they boost for. For example, getting the god like achievement in Shadowrun by joining a private game and having everyone just
 stand there while you kill them is cheating. But that's just achievements, boosting on leaderboards should be bannable and enforced harshly.</p>

<p>I don't have a problem with boosters. You'd probably call me a &nbsp;booster because I tell people up front. "Need x achievement? Sure! I won't make it easy for you, but I don't mind getting killed a few times." I specifically built a super short MC:LA track
 just so people could get through the required online races. The people that annoy me are the ones who hack in scores or extra equipment that gives them 'outside of game parameters' abilities and scoring.</p>

<p>Boosting is not tampering with the system or causing trouble with other players, its not cheating therefore you can't get banned for it.</p>

<p>Please, no game online dies because people are boosting it, it dies because it's multiplayer community is DEAD ON ARRIVAL. See Aliens vs. Predator, Dark Sector, Transformers War For Cybertron, FEAR 2.......many MPs simply aren't worth the time or the effort(FEAR
 2, looking in your direction), so it's literally a countdown to getting MP achievements before the community drops off completely. Transformers WFC being perfect example. At it's peak, 2 weeks after release, there was 5000 average players. The following week
 it was 4000, the week after 3000, the week after 2000. I popped in WFC last Friday night and it had 193 players.
</p>
<p>Boosting for achievements shouldn't hurt anyone's feelings, most achievement boosters simply want to be done with the game and they'll move on. If they boost for leaderboards, it's pathetic, and if the developer wants to step in a do something about it(or
 continually do nothing, as in all leaderboards), that's up to them. But they're leaderboards in an online videogame. Trivial nonsense. Not worth caring about.</p>

<p>Right, I guess I play different sorts of games then. Leaderboards I usually pay attention to often aren't boostable, just cheatable and hackable. But I can see how boosters would be annoying in that situation. But to ban someone for it...it's got to be clearly
 stated somewhere what is and isn't acceptable. What Bungie did was a good way to keep boosting to a minimum iirc.</p>

<p>True, or arcade games. A lot of arcade multiplayer modes die out mere weeks after their release.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 keeps restarting and sleeping as it pleases - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raidkhoury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps restarting and sleeping as it pleases</h2>
                    <p>so far this has been the worst thing for me about windows 10, and it keeps getting worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i frequently lose unbacked up work because i go to the washroom only to come back and find my windows has restarted on its own. other than that, there seems to be absolutely no way to prevent windows from sleeping after 55 seconds on the lock screen. i lock
 my computer everytime i leave my desk, and even if for a few mins to take a phone call, my computer is on sleep. it is absurdly annoying. i would greatly appreciate any solution for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>below are some points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Windows Home Version 1803 OS build 17134.165</p>
<p>- i tried the various remedies of adjusting some values in the registry under&nbsp;7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0</p>
<p>- i close the lid when i want to conserve energy, and i set my timers to match my habits.</p>
<p>- this occurs when my laptop is plugged in. (i would understand if it occurs when running on battery)</p>
<p>- Laptop is a Lenovo Legion Y520 if that makes any difference</p>

<h2>            &#34;Fade or slide menus into view&#34; unchecks itself</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Whenever I turn on my computer, the taskbar (which is set to auto-hide) ceases to slide down as it usually does. Instead, it's either shown or hidden.<br />
When I go to the Performance Options dialog (right click on Computer, Properties, Advanced System Settings, Performance Settings), I find that "Fade or slide menus into view" is
<strong>always unchecked</strong> after I reboot, regardless of whether I check it again and click Apply or not.<br />
It does this both on "Adjust for best appearance" and "Custom."</p>
<p>I read somewhere that I should re-enable User Account Control, reboot, check the box, reboot, turn off UAC, and reboot again in order for the setting to stick. It didn't work.</p>
<p>I'm running Vista Home Premium 64-bit, and this started happening within the last two weeks. To my knowledge, I haven't installed any software that may conflict with or otherwise change these settings.</p>

            Hi Schyfis<br />
<br />
Thank you for Posting on Microsoft Answers<br />

Since this is a recent issue (worked before and is now a problem), have you considerd doing a System Restore to a point before this issue started?<br />

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click
<strong>Accessories</strong>, click <strong>System Tools</strong>, and then click
<strong>System Restore</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Continue</strong> or provide Administrator credentials if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and then click <strong>
Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select a
<strong>Date and Time</strong> prior to first sign of the issue you’ve described.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the date you need is in excess of (5) days click the
<strong>Show restore points older than 5 days</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important Notice</span></strong><strong><span>:
</span></strong><em><span>That System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files
 on your computer. Thus, any recently installed programs, updates, or changes to configuration will be lost if you use System Restore. However, make note that System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot
 help you restore a deleted file.</span></em></p>
</td>

</table>
<br />
Before you try a System Restore, lets try a Selective Startup (Clean Boot) to make sure a Service or Startup Program is not causing this issue:<br />

<strong>System Configuration</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Continue</strong>, or provide Administrator credentials if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>General</strong> tab, and click <strong>Selective startup</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under
<strong>Selective startup</strong> uncheck <strong>Load startup items</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Services</strong> tab, check the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>, and then <strong>
Restart</strong>.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
If it works just fine in the Clean Boot procedure listed above, then a Service or Startup program is causing this issue.&nbsp; Start de-selecting the Services (one at a time) using the steps listed above until you find the Service that is causing the issue, the
 same goes for the Startup Programs.&nbsp; Once you are completed doing all of that, to put the computer back into Normal Startup, follow the steps listed above for the Clean Boot and this time Click on
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> click apply then click ok.<br />
<br />
Please Post back the results...

    <title>Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christiner1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zoo Tycoon 2 Ultimate Collection</h2>
                    So I bought a copy of Zoo Tycoon 2 The Ultimate Collection. I have been trying to play all the tutorials to learn all the new features. When I get to the Marine Mania tutorial, I cannot complete it, because there is no "tank" button in buildings for me
 to use. I also have the same issue with the Dino tutorial. It is weird that I see dinosaurs and marine animals when I start a sandbox game, but the tutorials seem to not have all the pieces for the other expansions. This version of the game I purchased is
 only ONE DISC, rather than 4 like other people are saying. Can anyone tell me a way to get this to work properly?

            The solution I was referring to was to check for updates from Windows store here<br /><br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/b5e4e2e4-cc9d-47ef-8782-7a1c81e735ef/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantansw...</a><br /><br />And if that doesn't help to uninstall and reinstall Zoo Tycoon 2

            <p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This issue may occur if touchpad drivers are not updated or corrupted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install latest touchpad drivers from the computer manufacturer website and check if it helps. If Windows 8 drivers are not available, I would suggest you to install the driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/in/support/download/supportDownloadMain.do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/in/support/download/supportDownloadMain.do</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font><font>To install the touchpad driver in compatibility mode, I would suggest you to follow these steps.</font></font></span></strong></p>
<p><font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. <strong>Download </strong>the latest <strong>
touchpad driver </strong>driver for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
<br />
b. <strong>Right click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.<br />
<br />
c. Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab.<br />
<br />
d. Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select Windows 7</strong> from the drop down list.<br />
<br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.<br />
</span></font></font></p>
<p><font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></font></font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with updated status of the issue to assist you further.</span></p>

<p>Hi Rajeev,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Looking at the description, this qualifies as a hardware issue and requires a fix to avoid damaging more of the internal part of the Surface. Since your Surface is still under warranty, we suggest that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023527/surface-how-to-get-service-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
send your device for repair</a> or you may drop by the nearest <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store</a> to have it assessed and be received should a repair be advised.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop. We'd like to make sure this concern is well attended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

            I don't know where you are travelling, but if you can find and borrow someone else's keyboard, you can test to see if another Keyboard works. If yes, your "immediate" options depend on where you bought your Surface and where you current are for a couple
 of months.

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;"ENTER" Key NOT Working</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile if you need a workaround, activate the On-Screen Keyboard for its Nav layout.&nbsp; There is an Enter key in it and you can resize it to be quite small.&nbsp; Alternatively you could leave it in its General layout and use the Fade button if necessary.&nbsp; Even
 better would be to reassign a function key for a second Enter but I'm not sure of your options on that tack.&nbsp; E.g. I don't think you have Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center as a means of customizing it which is what I am most familiar with.&nbsp; Otherwise, I
 am only aware that there are third-party customization tools which might do something useful in this area.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One S Power Cable &#40;generic&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm guessing that since the power supply is internal, that I can buy any generic AC cable for the Xbox One S. Is that correct? Having an extra cable would make moving it a lot easier. Seems to be the same as an old AppleTV power cable I have.</p>

<h2>            Samsung ativ keyboard, unknown device &#40;code 18&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: samsung ativ keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My keyboard attachment for my ativ 500t&nbsp;doesn't want to work. I tried Samsung sw and couldn't find any keyboard driver to reinstall. I don't get anything, no chime or lights. In the control panel it says under devices and printers it says driver error, unknown
 device (code 18). Not sure if that's the keyboard or what. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computer model: xe500t1c-a03us</p>
<p>Keyboard: AA RD7NMKD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
