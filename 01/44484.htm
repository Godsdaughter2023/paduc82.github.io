    <title>Issue - Cortana Search Shifting Focus &#38; Poor Indexing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issue - Cortana Search Shifting Focus &#38; Poor Indexing</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I want to search using Cortana, I click on Windows Start Key and start typing about which currently am facing the following issues<br />
01. sometimes, it doesn't open the search pane and I have to escape the Start Menu and press the Start Key again</p>
<p>02. and when the search pane finally does open, the search doesn't respond to the initial few keystrokes of the search term, i.e. say, I want to search for "microsoft", the search box at the bottom will have just "oft" in the box and search results for "oft"</p>
<p>03. so, I delete the "oft" and start typing again, now, what happens is, I type "microsoft", while typing it will keep alternating focus between search pane and best match, thereby what happens is, the search pane is missing the few keystrokes here &amp; there
 and the search panes looks like "mcrft" and showing search results of it</p>
<p>04. the longer the search term, the bigger the challenge to search<br />
05. unrelated to the above issue, Cortana many a times fail to provide accurate result for the installed program and instead shows a web search, say I have "OneNote" installed, but instead of showing the installed applications, it will show "OneNote - see web
 results", to rectify this have tried deleting and re-building the index many a times but doesn't seem to work<br />
05. additionally, same weird behaviour of focus shifting is noticed in Edge Browser too, say I type "microsoft support site" in the address bar of Edge, it will keep alternating focus between the address bar and best match result and there by gobbling up keystrokes,
 i.e. the address bar will look like "mist spt ste"<br />
</p>
<p>due to this weird behaviour of focus shifting between the search pane and search results, I have to do much more keystrokes than actually needed to accomplish a search as have to use backspace &amp; delete, retype etc. to actually have the exact search I want
 and I have tried searching in settings &amp; on web how to stop this behaviour but to no avail so far<br />

<p>Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />
Have run the <strong>Search and Indexing </strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Troubleshooter and it detected no issues.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This issue started cropping with the Anniversary Update (or perhaps with the November Update), don't exactly remember that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Besides the usual upkeep / updates and install (uninstall) of used (unused) programs, I haven't made any changes to the System.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
As far as the issue is concerned, I can see it, that the focus keeps shifting from Search Result Pane to Search Pane and thereby missing to register the typed letters, both in
<strong>Cortana </strong>and <strong>Edge</strong> and that's perhaps the reason for my troubles.<br />
<br />
If need be, I can send in a screen record, as well.</span></p>

            A screenshot will help us have a clearer view of the issue.<br />
<br />
For us to isolate if the issue is due to a corrupted user profile, we suggest that you create a new user account and check if the issue persists. To do this, kindly refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />

Should you have further questions, let us know.

<p>The issue still persists even after creating a new account.<br />
And, a Screenshot won't be of much help in having clearer view of the issue. A Screen Record will be better.<br />
But I will try to explain nevertheless using a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the attached Screenshot, I clicked on Start Button (Keyboard) and typed "microsoft edge" but the actual appearance is as shown.<br />
<br />
In the bottom pane, where the typed words go, the "blinking cursor" loses focus and shifts to the pane where search result is being shown / updated as I type and during that time, whatever keystrokes I have made aren't recorded and hence a mismatched search
 than as what actually desired.</p>

            Since creating a new user account did not resolve the issue, it's possible that the issue is due to a corrupted operating system. We suggest that you perform a repair upgrade of Windows 10. Kindly refer to the wiki article created by Andre Da Costa on
 this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop for the result of the process.

            Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
Even I realised, this might be some problem which can't be rectified as it is so decided to perform a clean install of Windows 10 (instead of a repair) and the problem has vanished for now.<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p>I am in the UK and I recently bought some points to buy&nbsp;&nbsp;Fahrenheit of the marketplace but when I went to buy it, it was gone, I remember last time I checked&nbsp; a couple of weeks ago it was still there but I didn't have any points and now there was just a
 theme and a gamer picture pack. Is it gone? and if so will it ever be back? If it is gone from the marketplace will I be able to buy it on disc and will it work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
As far as I can see Indigo Prophecy is not available on the UK marketplace to purchase. I have no idea if or when it will be back, but it is currently available for purchase on the US marketplace.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to purchase a disc copy of the game (since it's an original Xbox title) it should work, it's listed
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-games/play-original-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> as being backwards compatible. However, you should note that an original Xbox 360 hard drive is required to play any original Xbox title on the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>I bought it, played it and some day removed it from my harddrive knowing that I could reinstall it when I wanted to play it.</p>
<p>Now it's gone!</p>
<p>It really feels like it's been stolen from me. And it probably feels like that because it IS stolen from me..</p>
<p>There were some hard earned Euro's in that download that is now no longer available..</p>

<p>For some stupid reason, the game is listed as "Full Game - Indigo Prophecy". It's in the Most Popular section for sure, and it's probably in the 'f' section. I sorted the Most Popular section by title and I just happened to see the box cover as I zipped
 through to the games that start with 'i'.</p>
<p>I found this post looking for an answer so even though it's old, I thought I should post the answer just in case.</p>
<p>I'm in the US by the way. Hopefully this is a solution for UK players as well.</p>
<p>I can't believe I recognized the box cover as it flew by, wow. </p>

<div>1) HrOnline: 0x80072EE7 : this error code means "Address can not be resolved" This is referring to either the address of the Activation Servers or the Validation servers.&nbsp; In plain speak, this means your computer can not find the place it needs to go to
 Activate or Validate. Usually, this is caused by a misconfigured Proxy or Firewall.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Your Windows 7 is not currently Activated. Since it seems that your computer is having problems connecting to Microsoft servers, I recommend Activating by Phone. Normally, when Windows needs to be activated, there is an icon in the task bar that you can
 click to start the Activation wizard.&nbsp; But if there isn't, you can follow the below alternate steps to Activate by Phone.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Alternate Steps to Activate: Click the Start button, and type <br />
slui 4<br />
&nbsp;in the search field and then press the "Enter" key. This will bring up the Activate by Phone dialog window. Follow the steps provided by the window.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If after you have activated by Phone, windows is still showing as Non-genuine, go to<a href="http://microsoft.com/genuine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://microsoft.com/genuine</a> and click the Validate Windows button.</div>

<p>@Sparten12 - If you look that the tags then your answer is right there.. "games, Free games, COMPUTER, console."</p>
<p>@Lawless6567 - Like the title says, &nbsp;this is "My Top 10" not yours. </p>
<p>@YellowJacket LE - Assassin's Creed 2 is just downright wonderful! &nbsp;Love the combat in all of them :)</p>
<p>@SR50 Sailbot - It should be if it was your list, it's not my favorite game nor do I have interest in it. &nbsp; I play it rarely so I can't put it on the top.</p>
<p>@finnster7 - glad to be at service my friend, &nbsp;these in general are pretty fun and some are good if you can ignore some technical issues lol!</p>

<h2>            I have an issue with the shift key not working on Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Shift Key Not Working Properly </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello,&nbsp; </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Out of the blue, my shift key on my Lenovo laptop decided not to to get along with the letter c. I can write every letter lowercase and uppercase with the exception of the letter c. In addition, I sometimes hear what I believe are alert noises when typing
 several keys on my keyboard, for example the letter "r." I have tried using the onscreen keyboard and everything works well, but when typing on my regular Lenovo keyboard all I get are these fun noises and no capital c's. Please help. I would love to just
 restore my keyboard to defaults and reconcile the shift button with the letter c. Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            Restoring keyboard is not possible, because no software can control physical buttons on your laptop. Your keyboard is malfunctioning and it needs to be replaced. If your laptop is still within warranty period, send it to manafacturer and they will replace
 the keyboard for free. If your warranty has expired, you can still send it to the service, but I strongly recomend to buy a replacement keyboard and replace it on your own. Search Youtube (or Google etc.) for videos on how to replace a Lenovo keyboard.

<p>Hello moonersooner,</p>
<p>The Adobe Acrobat reader will be listed in add/remove programs in control panel.</p>
<p>Please check if you can find it there.</p>
<p>If not, you need to install one.</p>
<p>Refer the below link to install the latest version of Adobe Acrobat reader:</p>
<p><a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/</a></p>
<p>You can aslo try downloading the pdf and check if that works, if that doesnt work check the file association.</p>

</p><p>Sorry for the issue with adding money to the account. Have you tried just purchasing the currency on the child account? Usually when this happens the parent account will get a text/email to approve it. You may want to try a Xbox gift card also, you can purchase
 them anywhere gift cards are sold. These are certain amount of money, and then the child can redeem the code on their account.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>Hey, I keep receiving the error message Your DNS server can't resolve Xbox LIVE server names.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im direct connected from my Xbox to the modem and this problem only appeared a few days ago. I've tried manually entering network settings, using pc settings, using google dns, power cycling the modem and nothing has worked. Also been through the connection
 guide and no joy. Internet works fine when I tested it with my pc so Im out of ideas. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Yes direct to modem.</p>
<p>I tried the link you posted and still no luck.</p>
<p>The powering down before moving produced the same error.</p>
<p>The mac spoofing, my automatic settings disappear and when I enter them and run the connection test I get the error "Can't connect to your network hardware using a static ip"</p>
<p>In your opinion could there be something wrong with the Xbox itself or does the fact that it passes the network test and fails at dns mean it's an isp thing?</p>

<p>Your using a static ip address that will be an issue. Go into your Xbox network settings and choose factory defaults/reset and try power it all down again and try again. Also you should be able to enter an alternate mac address but keep your ip address on
 auto</p>

<p>Yeah I tried that. If I change the mac address the ip goes blank and I have to enter it but I then get the static ip error even though the settings I put in are the same as auto. Completely lost on this.</p>

<p>Don't put any details in for the ip address mate. Just enter the alternate mac address, save and test that's it... Using the alternate mac address doesn't force you to use a static ip address it can stay on auto</p>

<h3> fuddle-duddle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to upgrade to Windows 10 via Assistive Technology due to error code 0x8007007e</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to upgrade from Windows 7 Professional 64bit before a free download via assistive technology ends on Dec 31, 2017. I am using IE11 as my default browser. My PC is monitored by MSE. Third party software, such as Malwarebytes; CCleaner; Emsisoft
 Scanner. Secunia psi are installed but not active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Investigation reveals the error code refers to&nbsp;the following&nbsp;missing file on my computer.......api-ms-win-core-libraryloader-l1.1.1.dll which, according to&nbsp; information on the web, appears to relate to Windows Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the troubleshooting steps I have taken, included verifying that there are no Windows Updates outstanding; performing a Clean Boot; stopping and re-starting&nbsp;Windows Updates&nbsp;via Command Prompt&nbsp;and performing a Disk Check and System File Check, neither
 of which&nbsp;revealed any problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be most grateful for any help. Please keep in mind I am not computer savvy and any help offered will need to walk me through the process or I will be out of my depth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I am highly offended by your response. You made no attempt whatsoever to solve my problem and instead chose to make the unwarranted assumption that I am somehow trying to cheat the system. Besides, some of the information you provided is outdated, in which
 case you might want to do some research. I think you will find Microsoft has recently announced Assistive Technologies will no longer be available for free after December 31st.<br />
<br />
For your information, not that you are entitled to an explanation, I have 2 computers one of which is located in a public area in our&nbsp;Assisted Living&nbsp;building and is used by other seniors, some of whom have visual and other health related issues to contend
 with. Recent improvements to assistive technologies in Windows 10&nbsp;should make the computer easier to use for all of us. I feel fully justified in trying to use&nbsp;this application&nbsp;to upgrade prior to December 31st.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Error 0x8007007e is not an uncommon problem but I am not sufficiently versed in computer technology to&nbsp;try&nbsp;some of the more complicated solutions&nbsp;that might be available and&nbsp;risk screwing everything up. Besides, assisting users with their computer problems,
 is what I thought Microsoft Community is&nbsp;supposed to be about. I have&nbsp;received help from the Community in the past, for which I am truly grateful, but your insensitive approach to my problem in this instance has left me thoroughly bewildered. I trust someone
 else will understand my dilemma and offer to assist me. The computer in question passed the test for an upgrade to Windows 10 but at the last minute failed to install due to error 0x8007007e.</p>

<p><span>As I am sure you are aware, the link you provided connects to a virtual agent who directs the caller to go through a variety of troubleshooting steps.....none of which addressed error code 0x8007007e
 which is preventing me from upgrading to Windows 10 via Assistive Technologies.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Thereafter, an opportunity is provided to connect to a live agent (0 persons waiting) and after staring at the computer for over an hour waiting for a response, I finally tried to
 leave a message under the headings "<strong>call me back</strong>" and "<strong>schedule a call</strong>" which, infuriatingly, took me back to "<strong>waiting to speak to a live agent</strong>". After wasting another half hour, a message pops up stating
 "<strong>an</strong> <strong>error occurred, please try your request again later</strong>".<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I'm beginning to think this is some kind of sick joke.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I'll persevere over the next few days but am not overly optimistic that I will ever make contact with anyone at Microsoft. I will keep you informed as developments occur.</span></p>

<p>In my last post, I promised to keep you informed of developments as they occur. This is an attempt to fulfill that obligation.</p>
<p>After a great deal of effort, I was finally able to speak with several people at MS Support and Windows 10 was successfully installed on my computer. However, that was by no means the end of the matter. The program&nbsp;attempted to download updates for Windows
 10 but was unable to do so as the program could not access the internet via my WIFI connection. (An ethernet connection is not an option due to the location of the computer). Finally, after several more phone calls to MS,&nbsp;a senior level technician guided me
 through&nbsp;an investigative procedure to determine the reason for being denied access to the internet and&nbsp;showed me that Dell does not have an updated Windows 10 driver for the&nbsp;WIFI adapted that is installed on my Dell OptiPlex 790 computer. Thereafter, he unceremoniously
 informed me that Windows 10 will not work properly on my computer and that I should purchase a new one. Thanks, but no thanks!</p>
<p>Given that access to the internet is&nbsp;the primary reason why people&nbsp;purchase computersr in the first place, and given that 90% (my guess) of those users gain access via an ethernet cable or WIFI, would it not make sense for MS to inform users to check to
 make sure their WIFI adapter is capable of handling Windows 10<em><strong>&nbsp;prior</strong></em> to&nbsp;attempting the upgrade? Had they informed me of this inadequacy&nbsp;before I attempted to upgrade, it would have saved me, you and a whole lot of people at MS a whole
 lot of trouble.&nbsp;Just a thought.</p>
<p>Best wishes for New Year</p>

    <title>Windows 10 displays &#34;Windows can not save the theme&#34; popup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronald cummings-kralik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 displays &#34;Windows can not save the theme&#34; popup multiple times after logging in from a sleep state</h2>
                    When logging in to my machine in the evenings after it has been in a sleep state all day, Windows is giving multiple instances (typically 5) of a popup that states "Windows is unable to save the theme" with a continue YES/NO.&nbsp; This does not seem to be
 malware as neither Malwarebytes nor Windows Defender finds anything on the machine.&nbsp; What is going on and what can I do to stop it?

            Neither diagnostic returned any errors.&nbsp; This doesn't seem that surprising to me as I don't have any other issues with the machine.&nbsp; It also doesn't happen on a reboot only when logging back in after the computer went to sleep.

<h2>            USB Input Device could not be migrated.  Looking for help fixing this issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a newer gaming computer (Windows 10 Home; Version: 10.0.10586 Build 10586) that has 5 fully functional USB game controllers. &nbsp;These controllers work fine on either a USB 2.0 or USB 3.0 port. &nbsp;I added a 6th controller, and it is recognized as a USB
 device and a gaming controller, but isn't in the list of gaming controllers that Windows 10 maintains. &nbsp;That is, if I right click on the the new controller icon in the Devices and Printers I can select "Game controller settings" but the new device isn't in
 the list. &nbsp;When I dig into the properties for the new device, I see it is started (Hid Usb) and configured. However, there is an message that states "Device not migrated", with the following in the information window:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device USB\VID_16C0&amp;PID_05BA\B53469 could not be migrated.<br />
<br />
Last Device Instance Id: USB\VID_154B&amp;PID_0041\AAAA093200004170<br />
Class Guid: {36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}<br />
Location Path: PCIROOT(0)#PCI(1400)#USBROOT(0)#USB(10)<br />
Migration Rank: 0xF000FFFFFFFF0023<br />
Present: false<br />
Status: 0xC0000719</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to Troubleshoot the new device, a pop-up window tells me the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>USB Input Device is an older USB device and might not work with USB 3.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug the device into an available USB 2.0 port, and click Next. &nbsp;Otherwise, click Cancel</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why Windows thinks this as the device is clearly on a USB2.0 port, not a USB3.0 port.</p>
<p>I already have the latest and greatest MB drivers and latest BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clues how to proceed would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Photo app in Windows 10</h2>
                    I was able to use the photo app to download photos from my camera. However, I wanted to move them to a folder and now they seem to have disappeared. I previously took photos and used the photo app - the photos went to a folder and I was able to open them
 and edit the photos. But when I tried to do it today, the photos weren't in a folder - I tried to move them and now they're gone. I tried to connect the camera again but I get a message saying there's nothing on the camera. That's not true - I can scroll through
 the photos but the app doesn't recognize them. I don't know what happened but as I said, last week, it seemed fine - this week, not so much.

I agree that the photo app in w10 is a nightmare.&nbsp; I upgraded my laptop from 8.1 to 10 and was stunned to discover that it had completely reorganized my photo library.&nbsp; I had all my photos organized into libraries by subject matter and was stunned to see that
 the conversion process took those photos and reorganized them by date.&nbsp; The names of all my folders are gone and subfolders no longer exist&nbsp; &nbsp;Can you imagine Microsoft doing the same thing with your document library?&nbsp; I see that there are "albums" in the new
 library.&nbsp; Wouldn't you think Microsoft would take my library and use the names&nbsp;of all the folders as albums?&nbsp; No such thing.&nbsp; My wife will not let me install W10 on her computer until there is a way around this problem----and it is a very real problem.&nbsp;

            <p>The photo app in W10 is driving me crazy. It took hundreds of my pics from windows 8 that were carefully named and categorized and shuffled them all over the place.
</p>
<p>I can't figure out how to create my own folders anymore. It let's you select individual pics but then you don't have anywhere to paste them.
</p>
<p>Very frustrating.</p>
<p>Additionally, since I've downloaded W10 I'm getting constant crashes on my Outlook.
</p>
<p>I use Sage accounting (similar to QuickBooks) for all our accounting and when we generate a PDF of an invoice and try to email it to the client the entire program crashes - obsurd.</p>
<p>If not fixed soon we will definitely be uninstalling the W10 platform.</p>

<p>I too just upgraded to 10 and just had outlook sending problems- this article fixed the problem</p>
<p>http://www.msoutlook.info/question/cannot-send-after-windows-10-upgrade</p>
<p>I agree- new photo app is rubbish- does not work logically and does not recognise my previous folder names - only sorts some of them by date- I use this application instead- windows photo Gallery which I have used for years on previous versions vista, 7,
 8 and now 10- much easier and more logical to use-hope that helps people&nbsp;</p>

            Exactly what happened to me. Do any microsoft devs respond to these posts? Is there a photo app that is at least orderly with my files to download in place of microsoft's weird version of a photo app? Thanks!

<p>Well it's now 2018 and I've just bought a new lap top with the latest version of W10.&nbsp; Unfortunately that comes with "Photos", my carefully constructed filing system on "Picture Gallery" disappeared when I tried to transfer it.&nbsp; So all the pictures for my
 on-line selling are gone&nbsp; --&nbsp; five years of building that library lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead I'm trying to re-build with Photos, which is the most disorganised pile of rubbish I've ever come across.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First it repeatedly asks me to change how my pictures are organised - by date, month or year. None are relevant to MY needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intermitently it will give me the option to choose where I import to.&nbsp; Equally intermitantly it will actually put them where I choose, but more often than not it puts them somewhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reliable way I've found to get them where I want is to create endless sub-folders within the folder I choose.&nbsp; But as the option to choose where I put them is often not given they are just dumped in "Collection" by month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may surprise MS but I don't want to be creative (beyond a little cropping), I don't want a sound track or to add to a video and question why any of that has anything to do with a PHOTO library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I want is a FILING SYSTEM where I can RELIABLY import photos into under NAMED FOLDERS so that I can find them easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you can dust off Pictures Library or even Live Photo Gallery, at least they worked.&nbsp; If not, then at least be honest and re-name "Photos" accurately and call it "Photo Chaos".</p>

<h3> robby bruce  say:</h3>
<h2>            DXGKRNL ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Since my recent Windows 10 update, (about 1 month ago, April/May 2018) ,&nbsp; my laptop came up with the DXGKRNL error. My laptop became completely unusable.&nbsp; And NOTHING I do can repair it.&nbsp; I formatted that drive partition (C:/) and have re-installed
 Windows 10 FIVE&nbsp; times and every time as SOON AS I CONNECT to the Internet, it comes up with that error code.<br />
</p>
<p>At re-installation 4 I deliberately did not link up to the Internet and it worked fine for more than a week. Within minutes of connecting to either Wi Fi or Cable, the error came up making my laptop useless!&nbsp; What a pity,
 for I have gotten so use to using my Windows 10.</p>
<p>My Laptop may be old??&nbsp; But why did it work until the latest update? I updated my<span>&nbsp;<span>legal issue&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>of Windows 7 home to Windows 10 Home since it was released.</p>
<p>My laptop is&nbsp; an ACER TravelMate 5530.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft or anyone please assist.&nbsp; or if it's the Video Driver, how can I prevent that driver from updating.? or could it be a virus/malware etc..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help&nbsp; me Mr Microsoft!</p>

<p>Good day,</p>
<p>yes, the error code is. Video DXGKRNL fatal error..</p>
<p>And not even my rescue disc i made helps.. i just cannot get beyond the blue screen error! &nbsp; Interestingly as i mentioned, i did not go onto the Internet for more than a week. &nbsp;(Windows 10 re-install number 4). It worked as good as usual. I must add that
 the video disply was a tiny bit not so sharp. Then i, &nbsp;like a fool connected the router cable to the laptop and within moments the blue screen error came up. I,m pretty sure its to do with my video settings/driver. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your anticipated help..</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Input Panel&#47;writing tool quality&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> okracer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Input Panel&#47;writing tool quality&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">touchscreen Input Panel </span>
( with handwriting tool) , I had always enjoyed the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Windows 7 version </span>the best. It had a yellow background, the rectangle box was adjustable for sizing, and had one line of text. It was also easier to find the handwriting recognition tutorial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 8 version </span>was less user friendly, with a fixed box size, and the writing to text conversion speed seemed a little slower. The handwriting recognition tutorial is buried deep in the control panel,
 hard to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Does anyone know what the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Input Panel
</span>looks like or how well it works yet for handwriting recognition? Do we know if they have incorporated the good features of the 7 version back into it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any info!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure you answered my specific question however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is what will the stock Input Panel for Windows 10 be like? Specifically for writing to text conversion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below&nbsp;is a pic&nbsp;of the older Windows 7 Input Panel for writing, the one that I really liked. You would write in the yellow field, then click "enter" and it converted the writing to text into what you chose. You could adjust the size of the panel to fill the
 amount of your screen you chose. It also used up only one line for writing, so it took up less of your screen space:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5eb3eb93-c22c-4c95-9952-9f23ba61dab9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, below is the Windows 8 Input Panel for writing that I felt was not as adjustable as Windows 7 version, it is a fixed size on the screen, so could not be adjusted to take up less screen space. It was double lined for writing&nbsp;which also took up more
 screen space:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87be7e67-681e-4de7-93bf-8fada455e194" height="264" width="515" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is: do you know what the Windows 10 version of the panels pictured above will look like and how well will it function, specifically for the writing to text conversion feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any advice or info!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Billion Debbarma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested the Windows 10 Writing panel, and feel the tool is far inferior to the Windows 8 or Windows 7 versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you see this reply and the many other posts on this topic in this Microsoft Forum. I see that several users are unhappy with the new Windows 10 version of the Handwriting Input Panel functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please forward this to the R&amp;D team for consideration to revert the tool back to previous better versions or some remedy.

<p>
</p><p>The community forums seem to me like a dead letter box.</p>
<p>Our input here is not read by any MS representative.</p>
<p>And even so it may be read, the process MS has given itself to streamline Windows development based on user input is the Feedback App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if Microsoft uses the feedback app to gather the information about where to invest into Windows 10 we should all turn our attention and input into that direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already began to enter our comments and concerns about the useless new input panel there.

    <title>Windows 8.1 FAST, Windows 10 SLOW - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 FAST, Windows 10 SLOW</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all its faults Windows 8.1 was fast and stable, and I mean fast! It booted up my new machine very quickly and I could launch my browser within seconds. Fast forward to when I upgraded to Window 10 recently. I was lead to believe that it would be fast
 too, but it turns out that, even on my new PC, start up time is quite a bit slower and when I click on my browser it takes a few seconds to respond. And yes I am complaining about that, since it's an i7 PC with 24gbs of RAM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please will someone tell me if the start up time and responsiveness of Windows 10 is likely to get better, over time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fail to see why I should have to follow the advice of tech columnists to get my PC running quickly, such as this person:
<a href="http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/595918/Windows-10-How-To-Speed-Up-Slow-Boot-Up-Free-Upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/science-technology/595918/Windows-10-How-To-Speed-Up-Slow-Boot-Up-Free-Upgrade</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I may decide to go back to Windows 8.1 because I use my PC for work and it needs to be extremely good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>How do I associate my computer with a new microsoft account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tmaquilter  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I associate my computer with a new microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    I set up my new computer with Windows 8.1 with my gmail account as my microsoft user name.&nbsp;At some point I set up an outlook.com account.&nbsp; In the process my gmail account &nbsp;in microsoft was closed out.&nbsp; And now my computer has everything set up as the user
 with a gmail account, but I can't get to the sky drive and when I go to do various tasks when&nbsp; asked for my password on the gmail account which is no longer valid.&nbsp; Microsoft tells me that account is gone and cannot be accessed.&nbsp; So when I switch users on
 my computer to the outlook account there is nothing there because it hasn't been set up.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me how to take what I have set up and associate it with the outlook.com account that is set up in microsoft?&nbsp;Hopefully this will make sense to someone.&nbsp;
 Thanks for your help.

&nbsp;How to sync Google services with Windows<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to sign in with a Microsoft account to browse your SkyDrive and keep your files and settings in sync. If you sign in with a local account, you can only use the SkyDrive application to browse your PC. To browse your SkyDrive files, you'll need to
 go to SkyDrive.com. </p>
<p><br />
Unfortunately you cannot transfer/sync the files with in to different mail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps.</p>

            Thank you for your response. This does not answer my question however.&nbsp; I need to associate my computer with my new microsoft user account which is an outlook.com account.&nbsp; I cannot do anything on my computer that requires a password.&nbsp; When it asks for
 the administrator password it is associated with the old (now non existent account) and I cannot make changes to setting. Is there any way to change the account that my computer associates with?

<p>What is the low resolution ?</p>
<p>Most very old games don't have an option for resolutions that didn't exist yet. Are your game on line downloads or on disc ?</p>
<p>Many old games sold at on line game retailers such as Good Old Games have been updated to include wide screen</p>
<p>resolutions, but some are still limited to low resolutions. Original disc based games are limited out of the box.</p>
<p>- I believe most of the 'free' games on line are original low res versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, many old disc based games can be made to run at a higher resolution if you change the games configuration file, but
</p>
<p>if you use a wide screen resolution such as 1920x1080 the game may stretch sideways, so you may need to use a resolution with</p>
<p>a 4:3/5:4 aspect ratio like 1280x1024, 1600x1200 (if available on your monitor) or 1650x1080 (not full wide screen so stretching</p>
<p>is not so bad). </p>
<p>This results in black bars on the sides, but often looks better than wide screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"The Windows Taskbar Shows When I'm Playing Games In </em><span><em>Full Screen"</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>- </em>I have a couple of 4:3 aspect ratio games that do this semi-Window thing, and a couple more that did in early versions of</span></p>
<p><span>Win10, </span><span>but don't any more.</span></p>
<p><span>Don't know what causes it, but I believe the way Win10 does screen scaling, which has changed several times since 2015, may</span></p>
<p><span>be part of it.</span></p>
