    <title>Dualboot WinXP &#38; Win98 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dualboot WinXP &#38; Win98</h2>
                    
<p>I've been trying to do this for about 2 weeks off and on on trying to get Windows 98SE &amp; Windows XP to dualboot properly. I've had success but am still not satisfied. Here's what I have tried.</p>
<p>1ST Attempt:<br />
-Basically have a Basic disk with 2 primary partitions - one FAT32 (Win98) one NTFS (WinXP). I installed Windows 98 first on C: (FAT32) and then Installed Windows XP afterwards on D: (WinXP). It was all working great for a while and after some time I all of
 a sudden wasn't able to boot into Windows 98. Something had changed during installation of programs over a few days, so I restarted from scratch again.</p>
<p>2ND Attempt:<br />
-Basic disk I had about a 500MB primary partition set to active&nbsp;for just booting (C: FAT32), about 1/3 of a primary partition for Windows 98 (FAT32 E:), and about 2/3 of a primary partition for Windows XP (NTFS D:). Of course I installed on the proper drives
 using C for the boot system files for XP &amp; 98. Installed XP first on D: and Win98 2nd on E: - Afterwards I was only able to boot into XP again and Windows 98 wasn't able boot up as it wanted TO BE the D: drive because Win98 cannot see the NTFS partition and
 thinks that there is nothing there so my boot.ini file had conflicts with that.</p>
<p>3RD ATTEMPT (Successful):<br />
So after frustration, pulling out my hair and such things, I said screw it. I made one primary partition active&nbsp;(2/3 FAT32 C:) and a 2nd primary partition (1/3 FAT32 D:). So I installed WinXP on C: first and Win98 on D: - All is good and dandy except..... I
 want the security of my XP being NTFS!</p>
<p>AN IDEA: So right now I'm saying to myself, screw the partitions, put a 2nd hard drive in (primary slave / primary master). Master on XP NTFS, slave on 98 FAT32 - both primary partitions, and both can be active (or not??). But now I'm wondering if even this
 will work as the boot for WinXP/98 loads off of C: and Windows 98 is an atheist when it comes to NTFS partitions - they just don't exist.</p>
<p>ANOTHER IDEA: Find a decent bootloader. I've heard alot about GRUB but I'm wondering if this is the way to go as it seems GRUB is used primarily for Linux/Unix dualboots.</p>
<p>HERE'S WHAT I WANT: I want a working WinXP NTFS (for security reasons), and a working Win98 FAT32. Usually my Windows XP is about 2/3 the system space and Windows 98 is about 1/3 the system space.</p>
<p>For all the dualboot partitions I'm using a 60GB so you do the math. I have a spare 40GB that I was thinking of putting in for Windows 98 to separate the conflicts even further, but for some reason after my failures it doesn't seem like I'll avoid conflicts...</p>
<p>WHY THE TROUBLE?: You may ask - I just want to be able to play old games on Windows 98 with DX8.1 and have a working system of XP for all the newer games (that are still old....) - In other words to be<span>nostalgic.</span></p>
<p><span>Any other questions about the setup just let me know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. Wait till I post about trying to run BITLOCKER on Win7 partition with Bootcamp on my Macbook Pro. That one will be even more interesting...</span></p>

<p>Get Ranish Partition Manager and install its bootmanager MBR code.</p>
<p>Then, at the 'starting HD...' prompt, press 1 or 2 to select the boot partition.</p>
<p>No need to make special boot.ini entries, as the partitions boot entirely separately this way.</p>
<p>Also works for Linux, install LILO/Grub into the partition bootsector, NOT the MBR, and again you just press the partition-number to select it.</p>

            <p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings appear fine. I made a Vbscript that resets the taskbar configuration for your user account. Note that this clears Pinned taskbar items, taskbar toolbars and taskbar width settings etc. You can customize, re-Pin shortcuts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the script here.</p>

<h2>            MSI laptop monitor cuts out randomly</h2>
                    <p>System Info: MSI Gp60 Leopard, Windows 10 home, i5-4210H@2.9GHz, 8Gb RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4600, NVIDIA GeForce 840M</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having an ongoing issue where my monitor with randomly cut out, and does not come back on. It has become more and more frequent. I can use a HDMI connected monitor. But the laptop screen stays black. There is no backlight. I have tried looking
 at it with a bright light. There is no image. All my sleep and hibernate settings are off. I have done a clean install of windows Going from 8.1 to 10. Backing upon, but not loading anything from, an external HD. I have encountered the same issue on both versions.
 I have updated and rolled back video drivers. I have ran RAM and GPU tests with no negative results. I have went as far as to run a stress test, via aidia64, on my entire system. Results of which came back relatively decent, for the system. I have tried disabling
 each GPU individually, with the same results no matter which one was running. I have checked all wiring and connections. Everything appears fine. I have run multiple virus and malware programs. Again, no results. I am at a loss as to what it may be. Any ideas
 would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>You can reset the sign-in for websites that require this.</p>
<p>Example: Open Craigs List, when you access that website does it show you as being signed in? If it does, click the Sign Out button. You can then sign in again. If your friends Live ID is shown, click the "Sign in with a different Windows Live ID link".</p>
<p>You can then enter your live id credentials. Your sign in credetials should be remembered.</p>
<p>Another thing you can do is access your browser options and delete all of the Cookies. This will require you to sign in on every website that requires this, until a new cookie is created.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

I thought it would be fine, but after reinstalling Windows on my new solid&nbsp;state drive and loading the XBOX&nbsp;application for Windows 10 the game is nowhere to be found... which is weird, because&nbsp;I checked my messages and&nbsp;received messages from&nbsp;XBOX with codes for other Gears of War games, thanking me for my purchase.&nbsp;So it's like the system definitely acknowledges that&nbsp;I got the game, but it's nowhere in the "My games" library and when&nbsp;I go to the store it's trying to sell me Gears of War for $38.99, rather than showing&nbsp;I already own&nbsp;it like before. &nbsp;I also have the order #.&nbsp;Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            skype 7.36.0.101 video freezes from me to receiver, will stop responding and close and have not made change to pc other then update</h2>
                    <p>skype updated over the weekend. I called person in skype video last week. absolutely no issues. combos used include android phone to ipnone, her pc to my phone , my pc to her phone and pc to pc. both running windows 7 and latest version of skype, then the
 weekend update. now what happends is phone to phone works, my phone to her pc works but when i do pc to pc i freeze after a few seconds. i can reduce screen and goback to full screen and it might unfreeze. i can do the share screen start and stop and it might
 work or i just get skype not responding and it closes. This behavior has not happened before. Ive reinstalled. Ive looked on lineto see various symptoms... but im at a loss for this one. My pc works just fine except for this issue with skype. I dont notice
 anything else unusual. Just the video. we can chat in skype no problem by the way, Thanks for any and all assistance.</p>

<p>To any and all applicable parties;</p>
<p>I too have experienced this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been paying for Skype since 2014 and using it as a business line. Since around 2016, it seems as though Skype has been steadily descending from solid awesomeness to absolute garbage. As of today, 5/23/2017 (Skype Version 7.36.0.101), I have&nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lost
 clients&nbsp;</span></em></strong>after several dropped calls, and what seems to be Skype's failure to realize that a call has indeed connected (continuing to ring while the person on the other end just keeps saying "HELLO!?")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am inclined to stay with Skype only because of familiarity and phone setup. But that can only take me so far when I start to lose money because of your faulty program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear Skype / Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to affect many people including me. Downgrading to version 7.32 works a treat. So why roll out software which is not fully tested. Worse still, even when I turn off automatic updates and disable the Skype Updater service, skype auto upgrades
 itself even if I am signed in waiting for a call!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means I have to use 7.36 to get the call then ask the other party to wait whilst I uninstall Skype 7.36 and install 7.32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not going to fix the bug at least stop auto update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth going haywire -The existed ProductVersion is higher than your ProductVersion. Installation quit&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Bluetooth going haywire</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I have a Samsung ATIV Book 9, with a Qualcomm built in Bluetooth adapter. It worked like a charm when I had Windows 8, but recently Windows Store asked if I wouldn't like to update to 8.1, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my bluetooth doesn't work. Sometimes I can't even see the option for Bluetooth in settings. I checked Device Manager, and according to that the three bluetooth-related drivers I have are up to date and running. I've also tried to set the Bluetooth Support
 Service to automatic, but this doesn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the bluetooth-option does show up in Settings, but then it just searches and searches, without finding any devices, until it shuts down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to install the latest drivers from Samsungs program SW Update (Which claims to be compatible with Windows 8.1), but I'm not sure I've done it right, since it doesn't seem to work with Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>

            <p>Hi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks for the answer. This is the solution I have tried. When installing Bluetooth Suite for the Qualcomm-card, I get the errormessage "<span style="color: rgba(62, 69, 76, 1)">The existed ProductVersion is higher
 than your ProductVersion. Installation quit". </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This even though I only use the drivers downloaded from Samsungs SW Update that are marked for my specifik computer, and Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried installing the bluetoothdrives for Windows 8.0, and running them in compabilitymode, as this apparently worked for someone else. But this only gives me the same errormessage as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm working with Thunderbird for years and I love it - because one of its great features: run in multi-platform. But now I found that Windows Mail app are so great, not only on Windows-desktop, but also in mobile. So, How can I put all my old emails from
 Thunderbird to Windows Mail? I have about two GB of emails from my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much fro your consideration! </p>

            You can use the same email service in the Mail app that you're using in Thunderbird.&nbsp; This will give you access to the web email server.&nbsp; The problem is that any folders you've created in Thunderbird can't be recreated in the Mail app.&nbsp; Folders can't be
 created at all in Mail.&nbsp; <br />

<p>I found a solution from a story in the internet, they needed to get all emails from an iPhone out, and they added an IMAP account to the phone and move all emails to the new account :D Is it possible? :D</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 USB stolen - how to track and catch the thief&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Got a new Windows 10 in the summer and had to reinstall many times during that month;</p>
<p>then, to really get me, someone came in to my home and stole the Windows 10 USB</p>
<p>instead of the whole computer: then he left me, strangely with his old Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;</p>
<p>which I had no way to install it anyway but when I did try - it died anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I in danger of 'impersonation'? since I had already registered it&nbsp;</p>
<p>and used it during one month or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you track him by seeing who is using my Product Key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hacked by someone who lives so close to me and can hack me daily.</p>
<p>I am used to it but why must this be so when this windows 10 works so well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this pc is also hacked and all my computers were hacked so that I cannot&nbsp;</p>
<p>actually use them effectively and during the first day of any of them,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get killed so I end up turning it off anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really expect that you even get this as I saw on my other windows 10 (stolen one),&nbsp;</p>
<p>that no actual security texts from my pc ever went to Microsoft during the entire time!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fun huh? So, here's just another problem which cannot be adjusted eh? Have a great day.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://aka.ms/DownloadW10ISO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download</a> and make yourself a new usb thumb drive installer for windows 10 without any key - your original install key will be tied to your motherboard and your microsoft account from the time it was first installed and activated. Nobody else can use your
 activation/key on another computer without access to your microsoft email login/account even if they do have the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft wont track down theft items.&nbsp; Can you imagine how many crooks they'd likely have to appear in court as some type witness for/against and all those attorney depositions etc.&nbsp; They'd go out of business fast - attorneys help support each other with
 lots of billable hours and various fees.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try connecting the headset to a different computer to see if it’s working?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 your headphone plugged in to the line out jack of your sound card?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Who
 is your sound card manufacturer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you installed the latest drivers for your sound card after re-installing Windows Vista?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Check the status of Jack information under Speaker properties</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Speaker icon and choose Playback devices.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Speaker and click on Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Jack information, check if 3.5mm Jack is enabled or not.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 it is enabled, under Device Usage, choose “Use this device (enable)”</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Save
 changes by clicking on OK and check if you get sound from your headphone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Update your audio drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps in the order in which they are presented from the link given below.</span></p>

                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with a Surface Fingerprint Sensor Keyboard.&nbsp; In the past (probably before the Windows 10 Pro Creator's Update), I could wake my Surface Pro from sleep by using the fingerprint sensor.&nbsp; I can no longer do this.&nbsp; When I go to Surface
 Fingerprint Sensor Properties &gt; Power Management, the checkbox "Allow this device to wake the computer" is greyed out.&nbsp; I have toggled the box "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Fingerprint Sensor works fine during start-up and login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the Surface Fingerprint Sensor to once again wake the Surface Pro 3 from sleep?</p>

                    <p>I wanted to contact Skype to ask them about this but I keep getting sent to the community!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an account, after updating on my phone I tried to log in again....same email address, same password and yet Skype opened up another account for me??????? &nbsp;How is that possible? &nbsp;I tried again, now I have three accounts...one on my MacBook that is
 the original account, and another on my mobile that is the (new) account. &nbsp;Thinking maybe I used a different email address as I have two, I tried again with the other email address and password, and it opened yet another account. Just to be clear, I did not
 click on OPEN A NEW ACCOUNT, only on LOG IN! Why would Skype open a new account if I just wanted to log-in using my details of my original account? It didn't ask for any details when opening a new account, just showed up as a new account, linking to my contact
 who I now have to invite again, as it will not connect to my original Skype account. &nbsp;Very annoyed!</p>

    <title>My Xbox has been console banned for no reason. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Xbox has been console banned for no reason.</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing online last night on UNO, with a couple of friends, and got off around 12pm. Then i woke up this morning and tried getting on Xbox LIVE but i couldn't connect. So i tried connecting again and it came up with a notification stating that my Xbox
 had been banned. I looked up the reasons as to why I could've been banned, but again i found nothing that i have done, or could've done. Is there anyway I can contact someone about my problem? Also is there anyway that they can unban my console? Again my gamertag
 is St8Freezin.</p>

<p>console bans do not randomly occur it takes weeks before they ban any console</p>
<p>My console has been suspended. &nbsp;Does that mean my Xbox LIVE account will be suspended as well?</p>
<p>Suspensions for both consoles and accounts are determined by looking at a number of factors. &nbsp;While some Xbox LIVE account suspensions may be issued alongside console suspensions, they are not issued with every single suspension. To avoid having your account
 suspended from the service, please follow the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use and Code of Conduct.
</p>
<p>If a console is suspended, what happens to the warranty?</p>
<p>If a console has been modified or tampered with, the warranty is void and the console is ineligible for an authorized repair, even for a fee. Please refer to the Xbox 360 console Warranty on xbox.com
</p>
<p>Can I still be banned if I purchased a modified console second-hand?</p>
<p>Yes. The warranty on a second hand console is void, and the purchaser assumes the risk for any previous modifications. If you purchase a console that has been previously suspended you will not be able to connect to Xbox LIVE.</p>
I have not committed any fraud, I’ve never had action taken against me by the enforcement team, and I know for a fact I have not modified my console. Can you undo my suspension?
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">The investigations and subsequent actions taken by the Xbox LIVE enforcement team are conservative in nature. We work very hard to try to fully understand that a console has been modified
 by looking at a variety of information. Sometimes it’s possible that a previous owner or another user may have performed unauthorized modifications to the console. It is also possible that the purchaser of a used Xbox 360 was not aware the console was modified.
 In either case we cannot undo the console suspension. We recommend customers who believe they have not modified their Xbox themselves (or committed other actions on the service to warrant suspension) to contact previous owners or users of the console.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">this part should be important and not skiped</span></span></p>
<p>“<strong><em>This console has been banned for violations of the Terms of Use. To protect the Xbox LIVE service and its members, Microsoft does not provide details about console bans. There is no recourse for Terms of Use violations.</em></strong>”</p>
<p><strong><em>Consoles can be suspended from Xbox LIVE for a number of reasons including, but not limited to:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Console tampering: Physically opening the Xbox and modifying it to play illegitimate software. *this includes self repair*
</li><li>Online fraud: Attempting to social engineer users, take over Xbox LIVE accounts, or other fraudulent activities.
</li><li>Repeat egregious violations: Multiple actions taken on accounts on the console by the Enforcement team for disrupting the service or impacting users.
</li></ul>
<p>btw there is a proccess to get unbaned awhile back but its not worth the trouble because if they RECONFIRM something you didn't check</p>
<p>it would result in FORFEITURE of all dlc on any account connected to the console id</p>

<p>used consoles should always be delt with the previous owner</p>
<p>specially if it comes from gamestop (they do not check for system bans and it is not always instant)</p>
<p>btw it was a proccedure but i don't think shes around anymore whoever did the unbans</p>
<p>was very unpopular due to the clause that if they recheck and reconfirm you'll lose the dlc (usually because its 100% checked the first time)</p>

<p>If you bought your console used and you're not splitting hairs with the wording in the ToU, then the issue occurred while in the possession of the former owner.[quote]Also is there anyway that they can unban my console?[/quote]I'm sure it's technically possible.

<p>As steeledwand7664 mentioned this is an very old post. Please make your own post. This way you get the most help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no bans for no reason. Even if you where reported that night it is probably another action which was resulted in the ban. Every report is checked from the Enforcement Team. They will not ban you, if you dont do anything wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to enforcement.xbox.com. There you could see the ban and if its possible you can do an case review.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Paint -- where are program options&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.merrill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paint -- where are program options&#63;</h2>
                    I can't find any kind of "program options" within the Ribbon interface of Win7 Paint.&nbsp; I'm hoping to be able to change the default file type for saving files to something other than what seems to be the current default (PNG).<br />
<br />
Is there a generic way to get to something that will let you see all the options of a program with a Ribbon interface?&nbsp; (Before the Ribbon, you could open up the menus and look at all the available choices.)

<p>By default there is no ribbon interface option to change to default file type.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To save a picture in a different file type using Paint, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Paint by clicking the Start button, clicking All Programs, clicking Accessories, and then clicking Paint.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Paint button , click Open, click the picture you want to save as a different type of picture file, and then click Open.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Paint button , point to Save as, and then click the new picture file type for the picture or drawing.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type a file name in the File name box, and then click Save.<br />

<h3> atschultz2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Left Click Causes Action Center to Open</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10, every time I left-click with my touchpad the action center pops open, or if it is already open it closes. The click actually works and brings focus to the area that I clicked on, but I then have to click again to close the
 action center and continue what I was doing. This also makes the double-click unusable as the focus changes every time I click.</p>
<p>Fortunately I have a touch screen laptop, and tapping on the touchscreen does not cause the action center to popup, so I at least have that option. I've seen a couple of posts about updating/reinstalling the mousepad driver software, but that has not fixed
 the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone no what I can do to stop the action center from popping open? I have an HP Envy TouchSmart.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Have you tried connecting external&nbsp;mouse and checked the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, the there is some problem with the touchpad of the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check the issue in new user account and see if behaves the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Open <strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2)&nbsp;Select <strong>User Account </strong>and click on <strong>User Account.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3) Next select <strong>Manage another account. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>4) Click on <strong>Add a new user in PC settings</strong>. It will take you to
<strong>Family and other users.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>5) Now in the right side you will have an option to <strong>Add Someone else to this PC</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6) Now follow the <strong>on screen instructions </strong>to create new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>
<p>

 my password, once again, sent to log in screen. I redownloaded Skype, didn't do anything. I can get to Skype on web Skype but I can't call on it. I really need Skype for work! I have no idea what else to do, please help me.

<p>I'm having the same problem- but I'm already signed in (or so I thought) I clicked on the app to load it up (like I usually do) and it just said that there was a 'problem' signing me in. I restarted my laptop and uninstalled the app, now it won't even show
 the sign in screen, just 'Oops, we were unable to sign you in'. My WiFi and internet connection is fine, I've never had a problem loading it up in the past. If anyone's found a solution to this please let me know. I went on the app store and there were no
 updates, my laptop's up to date too.</p>

<p>I used Skype versions already starting with (pre-Microsoft) 3.x and going all the way to 7.38. Since I also wanted the option to record Skype calls (with the consent of the partners concerned, of course), I came across iFree Skype Recorder (now at version
 7.0.23) and MP3 Skype recorder (now at version 4.34) a while back and have been using both at intervals since. I did, however, notice that updating to Skype 7.38, IFree Skype Recorder 7.0.23 and MP3 Skype Recorder 4.34&nbsp; on my Windows 7 computer made all recordings
 practically inaudible (or full of metallic clicks and metallic echoes) and hence unusable. A short while ago, I downgraded Skype to 6.14.104 and iFree Skype Recorder to 6.0.18 (whilst keeping MP3 Skype recorder 4.34) and things were fine for a while until
 this morning (with no changes whatsoever to the Windows Firewall), when Skype informed me that it “can’t connect.” To make sure that I did not overlook something, I changed my password – to no avail. I gather that this may have something to do with the Skype/Desktop
 API, which IFree Skype Recorder reports as having “stopped working.” P.S.: For some reason, I can log in to Skype 7.33 on another computer without any problems. The other computer, however, has no Skype recording capabilities.</p>

    <title>Xbox One controller won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t turn on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gladiamcnamara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t turn on</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody, I purchased my xbox one around 1 month ago and they came with Duracell batteries which ran out of power after six days, ok, I updated the controller. After that I got 4 Rayovac batteries and 2 of em made the controller work for 2 minutes! the
 other 2 batteries didn't even work! I had to get a Play and Charge kit and as soon as I got home I got my controller to charge the rechargeable battery from the kit and it worked fine for some days and the day before yesterday I was playing and then I decided
 to watch Netflix, pushed the xbox button on the controller and clicked on Turn Off Controller and it did turn off, after that my controller just won't turn on and the cable don't even light up indicating that the battery is being recharged, 2nd charging cycle!
 I tried new batteries and they don't work and when I try to turn on my controller it just won't turn on! It ain't working anymore, I am thinking this happened after the update cos it was working fine, I have contacted Microsoft and they asked me to turn the
 controller in so they can exchange it for me but I have seen many people in this forum saying what might fix that is updating the controller when MS drops an update but how will I do that since my controller won't turn on. I did all the steps the support suggests
 and nothing, anybody with the same issue that maybe got it fixed? :(</p>

<p>SOLUTION:</p>
<p>1. Plug the controller in via USB</p>
<p>2. Hold down the controller's Xbox and menu buttons for 5-10 seconds</p>
<p>Controller should turn on. &nbsp;From here, check to make sure that the controller is updated following the steps at

<p>Here's another thought that might get you going as I had a similar problem resulting from a power failure during a controller update.</p>
<p>I haven't seen this functionality published anywhere, but try plugging the controller in via USB, then hold down the controller's Xbox and menu buttons for 5-10 seconds.</p>
<p>There's several directions this might go once you've accomplished the above. Let me know your result once you've completed those steps and I'll watch the thread to assist from there.</p>

    <title>mouse jumps to different screens - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosalietran  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse jumps to different screens</h2>
                    The touchpad mouse on my Windows 8 laptop, keeps changing the screen to the previous page that was onscreen, whenever I move it near the left side of the windows screen. It jumps back to the previous window. I've tried the functions in hardware. But it
 hasn't made a difference. It may have something to do with moving the mouse too quickly. It happens multiple times in a row. I will get back to the screen I want, then when I leave the side, it does it again, over and over.

            <p>Hi Rosalie,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing to post your question in the Microsoft community.</p>
<p>From the description I understand that the mouse on your Windows 8 computer does not work properly.
</p>

            <p>Rosalie,</p>
<p>I had the same issue and finally was able to resolve it.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp; put curser in upper right corner</p>
<p>b.&nbsp; select settings</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; click on change PC settings</p>
<p>d. click on corners and edges on left side of the screen.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp; turn off "When I swipe in from the left edge switch between my recent aps instead of showing a list of them"</p>
<p>You should be able to move your curser around without changing aps.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

I tried both of these options and neither of them worked for me. DanielKeeth's option works but that doesn't fix the problem and it takes away a convenient tool for the computer which is switching between screens WHEN I WANT TO. Personally this is becoming
 a serious issue for me as this is a tool that I use for work. There shouldn't need to be any compromise.

Easy, you have tried to backup/upload from a USB drive.&nbsp; Shut down Z (or other)&nbsp;USB drive from Start &gt; Computer, and the duplicates will disappear!

<p>This could happen if the same folder is monitored twice by WMP, for example, if both C:\Media and C:\Media\Music are in WMP's list of monitored folders.</p>
<p>To view the list of monitored folders, press F3 in WMP, and make sure that the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong> are visible. What folders are in that list?<br />
<br />
Another possibility is that WMP's media library got corrupted. To reset it, follow the instructions for WMP 11 on Vista at&nbsp;<a href="http://zachd.com/pss/pss.html#medialibrary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://zachd.com/pss/pss.html#medialibrary</a> . Note that resetting the library
 will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too.</p>
