<h2>            What hardware config does Windows 10 check when installing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I run Windows 10 in a VM on my Mac with Parallels. All is working fine but I want to change to VM Ware. When I migrated the VM with the VMWare migration tool Windows 10 runs terribly slow so I want to do a fresh installation. In order to do a fresh installation
 I need to make sure the hardware profile (things like MAC address) are the same or Windows 10 will assume this is new hardware and require a new license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: What serial numbers etc does Windows 10 check when determining if the hardware has changed? If I know these I can copy them over to VM Ware Fusion and do the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard that only the Motherboard is checked - but what is it looking for when checking the Motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bryon&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Windows 10 will use the same hardware profile as the Mac for the VM. You will just have to use chat support if you are prompted to reactivate after performing a clean install VMWare:</p>

            <p>That option is never available unfortunately. All I receive is a message saying that I don't have a valid license key.</p>
<p>I also think you are not quite right with regard to the hardware profile. I contacted Microsoft Support and they said that if I copied the VM and reinstalled it should work so long as the hardware looked the same. Mac address was one item but I cannot recall
 the rest.</p>
<p>I even took a working VM that I had copied and selected the option from within Windows to rebuild it. When it finished reinstalling it said I had no valid key.</p>
<p>I have been a huge Microsoft fan for over 30 years. As an engineer I rebuild my machine often which is why I love using macOS with a Windows VM. Basically I think that Microsoft's license scheme is a huge pain for people who use a Mac as their main platform.
 It creates a compelling motivation to simply abandon Windows and do all my dev work on macOS and Linux.</p>

<h2>            FABLE 2 </h2>
                    
<p><span>I have previously purchased and played Fable 2 on my old Xbox 360. Now with backwards compatibility it looks like I should be able to download and play Fable 2 on my Xbox One. My problem is that Fable 2 will not show up in the Ready for Install section.
 I even downloaded my gamertag over to a roommate's Xbox 360 and it allowed me to download Fable 2 onto it.</span></p>

            <p>Hey LesserWarrior,</p>
<p>That definitely sounds odd. Let's try changing your Xbox One console region to a different region temporarily to see if the results change. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to 'All settings' on your Xbox One console.</li>
<li>In the settings menu, scroll down to 'System' and select 'Language &amp; location'.</li>
<li>From here, change your console region to a different region (For example, if you live in the US, change your console region to a separate region such as UK or Canada).</li>
<li>While your console region has changed, navigate to your 'Ready to install' list to see if the results change.</li>
<li>Once you're done, switch your console region back to the region you're located in and let us know what the results were.</li>
</ul>
<p>Try those steps and let us know how it goes! :)</p>

<h2>            Unable to run IE11 in 32-bit Mode</h2>
                    <p>I've created a taskbar IE11 icon as shown below -</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/037a663e-9779-464a-a781-56eba759cc26?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/037a663e-9779-464a-a781-56eba759cc26?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>When I click on this icon, it's window remains blank and a <strong>SECOND</strong> IE11 icon is created on the taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9bd9717-827d-47d9-ada0-295089bf239e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b9bd9717-827d-47d9-ada0-295089bf239e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This <strong><em>appears </em></strong>to load the 64-bit version of IE; I know this as I need to run the 32-bit version of IE for access to a particular website, which is still not working when I use this extra icon entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've <strong>NOT</strong> 'Enabled 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode' -</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e8fbcd-9274-46ca-952c-8542c6845d7e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6e8fbcd-9274-46ca-952c-8542c6845d7e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get IE11 to run in 32-bite Mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently running Windows 10 v1903 Release Preview (Build 18362.145) x64, IE 11.0.126 (KB4505050).</p>

            If it works in Firefox and Edge, I would not use Internet Explorer anymore. 
<br />
<br />It simply be that many web pages are not officially supporting Internet Explorer anymore. Internet Explorer 11 is hardly being maintain and is still around as a legacy web browser for Intranet websites and LOB apps that require ActiveX controls.
<br />
<br />You really should switch to a modern web browser such as Firefox (preferred) or Google Chrome or even the built-in Edge.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing usually happens if the system or hardware of your computer encountered some corruption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're already using the installation media, and the Windows setup still did not appear, there is a possibility that you need to change the boot order of your computer in order to install Windows. We recommend contacting your computer's manufacturer
 in changing the boot order so we can further assist you in installing Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response about this matter.</p>

<h2>            Unable to boot into Windows 10, Unable to repair or reset</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 on my Dell Studio 15 Laptop, in June it became unable to boot. It comes up with a message saying "A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software
 from an unknown source"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It provides me with the ability to boot into Windows 10, but this immediately comes up with the black error screen again (windows/system32/winload.exe). There are no other options available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a recovery disk from another machine on a USB and tried to boot from this. When I do I do not have a "Reset" option, I do have options like reverting to a previous build and system restore. Every single option available fails. Automatic Repair
 also fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I perform a reset? I am happy to go back to an empty install of Windows 10 as I recently gave the laptop to my mom, she only had it for a week before it started doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a windows 10 installation disk, as I downloaded it while it was free as an upgrade from Windows 8.</p>

<h3> johnm333  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I find out the last time my computer completed a successful restore from a prior restore point&#63;</h2>
                    How do I find out the last time my computer (Windows 7) completed a successful restore from a prior restore point? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
My system files have been corrupted and I can not do a restore to a prior restore point (System restore failed).&nbsp; No remedy has been found.&nbsp; All suggestions have failed.&nbsp; I am told I have two choices. I'll have to either (1) do a factory reset/restore or (2)
 restore to a prior date from a Windows system image backup.&nbsp; If I do #1, I'll have to reinstall all programs and go though the nightmare of days of tinkering.&nbsp; If I do #2 the programs and settings will all be there and I guess all I have to do is restore the
 data (all backed up) and update all my Windows and other updates since them.&nbsp; Naturally #2 is the better choice BUT<em> Catch 22</em>,&nbsp; this latter process will be a waste of time unless I do a restore from a system image created
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before </span>this problem arose (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before
</span>the system files were damaged) and who knows then that was? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Obviously, if I could tell<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> when Windows 7 successfully completed the last restore from a restore point I</span> can use the second, easier, option.&nbsp; In Windows 7 pop up tells me when I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">have </span>completed a system restore from a certain restore point.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Is there any record of that event</span>?&nbsp; If I know
<strong>that </strong>date my work is much easier and I can select the right system image to restore from.&nbsp; IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN FIND OUT THE LAST TIME MY COMPUTER COMPLETED A SYSTEM RESTORE FROM A CERTAIN RESTORE POINT?
<br />
<br />
Some have said the last successful restore will be in the Event Log but no one knows what to look for.&nbsp; Where is the record of my last system restore to a restore point?&nbsp; Where is it?&nbsp; How do I find it?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This may assist you:</p>
<p>1. If you are using Norton, you will&nbsp;have to disable Norton's Tamperproof Protection before using System Restore.</p>

            Please this is not an answer to my question.&nbsp; Please read more carefully. We have there and done all that.&nbsp; Just answer the question:
<br />
<br />
All this is irrelevant and sends me right down the rabbit hole I just crawled out of.&nbsp; As I already noted,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> we have tried&nbsp; all these purported fixes</span>.&nbsp; Every one you have mentioned here and more and&nbsp; we have spent

            And P.S. The link for How to Do a Repair Install to Fix Windows 7 is incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; I would not dare!&nbsp; That kind of lost productivity can buy two new computers.
<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean by&nbsp; "Disabling AVG temporarily".&nbsp; For anti-virus I use McAfee. Contrary to your link there is no 'Tools menu', or 'Advanced settings'.&nbsp; But I have turned off firewall and realtime scanning.&nbsp; This made no difference.
<br />
<br />
We have also installed and used Malwarebytes AntiMalware and tried every suggestion you mentioned.&nbsp; No fix on this issue. As I wrote in my 1st paragraph:
<strong>“No remedy has been found.&nbsp; All suggestions have failed</strong> including every one you list here.&nbsp; I saw no need to provide the full litany.&nbsp; Just take it as given.&nbsp; I sat for two days on the phone with very knowledgeable people in management at Costco
 Concierge Services.&nbsp; We have tried <em>all </em>this.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that the easiest way is the answer to my question so please stay focused on that:<strong> How do I find out the last time my computer completed a successful restore from a prior restore point?
</strong><br />
<br />
Once I can find out when the last successful restore was done re: any restore point then I presume the problem is resolved.&nbsp; I can do a restore from that Windows Image backup and just redo my updates and copy over my data.
<br />
<br />
Windows seems to record everything. <strong>"How do I find out the last time my computer completed a successful restore from a prior restore point?"</strong> Where is it? For now please stay focused on that narrow question.

<p>
</p><p>Wrong. You clearly did not read the question presented but answered one not asked. That litany of attempts is only relevant to the question of how to fix system files where Widows fails to complete a system restore.&nbsp; If I asked how to do that it might be
 relevant but I did <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not </span>ask that.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Yours is an answer to a question <strong>not </strong>asked.&nbsp; It is <em>irrelevant

 it.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">That's all we need to know at this point.

 files"?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Show me the proof your theory for we are exhausted with 'maybe this' or 'perhaps that'.&nbsp;
<strong>Show&nbsp; me</strong>.&nbsp; In fact just google &lt;"windows 7" &amp; "Repair Install Option" &amp; "system restore did not complete" &gt; and you will not get even one hint of an association between the two.&nbsp; I see no reason to proceed<em> ad infinitum
</em>with every new theory somebody else tosses over.&nbsp; Why keep beating a dead horse?&nbsp; None of this worked.&nbsp; Moreover, the horrific litany of dire warnings<strong> against</strong> Repair Install Option raises far more questions than it answers which might
 be a good hint as to why you are the only one in cyberspace to suggest it. </p>

            <p>Hi re: "&nbsp;(2) restore to a prior date from a Windows system image backup.&nbsp; If I do"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do that, if I understand you correctly, without loosing any programs or whatever. This is if you have backed up using windows 7 and included a system image. If you let windows chose what to backup it will have included a system image. You can also
 check by looking at what is backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do the above go to 'backup and restore' (type it&nbsp;in the search box). At the bottom of the page click on "Recover system settings or your computer" then click on "Advanced Recovery&nbsp;Methods" Choose "Use a System Image you created earlier.." follow instructions.&nbsp;
 It takes forever, but it will restore your computer to the time when you created the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck</p>

<p>The 27 EUR is likely not genuine.</p>
<p>The 139 EUR is likely genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 27 EUR is likely a MSDN product key being resold at a too good to be true price.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN)
 or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided
 is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either
 giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The
 person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused
 and blocked the key from further use.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Buy from the Microsoft Store for guaranteed genuine licenses:</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's so confusing to me and I don't feel good about it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I google "Buy windows 10" the first 5 results are all under 50 EUR from, what it looks like, big genuine sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So they are selling illegal Microsoft products? Why is that allowed? Is it kinda tolerated by Microsoft then? There must be a lot of customers who bought that "illegal" license and using it everyday without consequences?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the store physically and bought win10 home for 139 EUR but kinda feel ripped knowing for me personally it would be just the same buying the license key for under 50 EUR since it's looks like it's no such big deal to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking at other software, for example Assassins creed origins or kaspersky security (also big companies) its everywhere about the same price.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            I have accidentally merged the SkyDrive and My Documents folders&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>When I first upgraded to Windows 8.1, I wanted to test out the integration of SkyDrive... So the only stuff I wanted to sync was in my documents folder, and I stupidly went into the properties of the Skydrive folder and set its default location to be the
 Documents folder...&nbsp;</div>
<div>I ended up not liking this configuration and decided to switch back.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I did switch back though, the SkyDrive folder went back to normal but I can not restore the Documents folder. New apps are saving data into the Skydrive folder by default.</div>
<div>I have tried to create a new folder called Documents, but it does not work as a library style folder.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbc92974-0020-4379-849f-8bceec92e184" /></div>
<div>Currently, I have two SkyDrive folders for some reason, with my documents in them, and one folder called 'Documents' which is not the default folder for documents anymore!<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated :)</div>

            <p>Hello Patrick Brown,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a really similar problem where I accidentally dragged the OneDrive folder over the Music folder (or the other way round) and they formed one:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c989f87-d503-494e-baf7-f9f0329bb9f2" /></p>
<p>I don't know what exactly what to do, I hope you have solved your problem but if not then we should ask a Microsoft Admin.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>with the Kodi not internet connected. I even connected my laptop running windows ten directly into the router and it still shows when clicking on System Info that the Link is connected but Internet is not connected. I am stumped. I have now idea what
 to do. In my case the computer firewall is controlled by Norton antivirus and is off because of that. Does anyone have an idea what to do about this internet connection?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So that there is no confusion I will repeat that this is a laptop Kodi is installed on the laptop. When I open Kodi to stream it does not work. The issue is when I click in Kodi on System info it shows that the Link is connected and on Kodi home page
 weather and time is indicated correctly. In system info it shows internet not connected.</span></p>

<h2>            Directx and problems with games</h2>
                    Recently I updated DirectX to DX12 and whenever I try playing a game (any game) it lags bad, but before the update games ran fine (I was on 10.1 before this) I also can't extend my screen because of the update but the big problem is the games so if you
 have a solution please help me.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. You may try to uninstall and reinstall your DX12 and check if the games would still lag. If it does, then the next troubleshooting step that may correct the issue is to roll back to version 10.1. There might be an issue regarding
 your system's capability not meeting the requirements of installing DX12, that is why any of your games were lagging.

            The support for DX12 will depend on your graphics and if you have the latest drivers installed. What graphics do you have and have you checked the manufacturers website.

            It says that directx can not be uninstalled or downgraded. I've tried this before, could you maybe tell me how to downgrade? I've tried installing files from DX 10 but THAT doesn't seem to work either.

            Well tou see...before the DX update I already knew my computer couldnt handle it well; but if that was the case, dxdiag would've detected a problem right?

<p>As far as I know DXdiag will check to see if the files required are installed correctly, it doesn't test how well the DX level will perform on the hardware.</p>
<p>So if you run dxdiag.exe it will tell you the dx level you have installed.</p>

<br />
<br />I am sorry this happened . .. 
<br />
<br />Windows 10 does not stored the serial number of your laptop to the cloud, I am sorry, there will be no way to get that . . .
<br />
<br />Unless you can trace the payment you made for that laptop, the retailer would most likely have the serial number of your laptop, that would be the only way to retrieve that . ..

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a shame. Microsoft must have some unique identifiable features though? Any possibility that it might contain some unique identifiers eg for the motherboard, CPU etc?</p>

<p>Haha yes, I am very aware of that... I have changed my bank details and cards. They may have my address too, but I'm not sure I can do much about that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how does the Windows 10 activation work? It must store some unique info about your computer, because when you reinstall Windows, even after changing some components, it is able to detect that Windows 10 has a license on the computer.<br />

            Hi Oscar
<br />
<br />When you activate Windows on your laptop, that did generate a unique identifier for your Windows licence form the hardware on your PC, though I doubt you can access that, but you could try asking Microsoft Support if they can . ..

<br />Also Windows 10 does have a 'Find My Device' feature, if that was switched on on your laptop, that may help you locate your laptop and even lock it . . .

</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Excellent point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole idea of activation is to ensure that your copy of Windows 10 is being used in accordance with the terms of your license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While different types of licenses have different terms, the type of license you and I use has one constant: A licensed copy of Windows 10 can only be used (legally) on one device at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your copy of Windows 10 is initially activated, Windows performs a calculation based on your computer's hardware which produces a hexadecimal number that uniquely identifies your computer. The hexadecimal number, which is known as a 'hash,' is stored
 in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any time, Windows can (and does) recalculate the hash, and compares the result to the hash stored in the cloud. If the hashes match, Windows knows that it's still installed on the same computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to answer you question, the 'unique info' about your computer that Microsoft stores is the hash used for activation.</p>

    <title>Stuttering in all games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kraftey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuttering in all games</h2>
                    I recently installed windows 7 64bit on my computer cause it had been 2 or so years since I installed vista and my computer was starting to get sluggish. Anyway, I have this same issue in Counter-strike, and left 4 dead 1 and 2 and it is that I get horrible
 stuttering in game. I've turned all my graphics settings as low as possible--in game and through the NVIDIA control panel. The audio stutters and everything locks up for a few milliseconds over and over again any time something intensive happens and it never
 goes away or resolves itself. It's extraordinarily annoying and makes it impossible to play any first person shooters.<br />
<br />
I have the latest audio, chipset, lan, video, and RAID drivers. I've tried changing every single video setting individually and nothing makes a difference. I've tried messing with my RAM timings, defragmenting the hard drive and the game files (which neither
 of them were fragmented--I JUST formatted and installed windows 7), and disabling the event logger and indexing services to see if they could be taxing the system enough for this to happen. This never happened in vista and I can't for the life of me figure
 out what the problem is.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
My setup is:<br />
e8400<br />
8800 GTS 512<br />
2gb ddr2 ram (of which only 1/2 is used when the games have been open for a while, so I don't think it's a memory issue)<br />
Gigabyte EP35C-DS3R mobo<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi Douglas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the issue description, it appears that you are getting an error IRQL_unexpected_value on the computer.
<br />
</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced upon upgrade to Windows 10 and I regrets the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Error <strong>Irql_unexpected_value </strong>errors are caused by missing system files or broken system registry structures. This is a critical sign of an unstable system that is typically caused by improper maintenance of the computer.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Perform Automatic Repair </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Follow the steps to perform Automatic Repair:<br />
a. Press <strong>Windows logo + Q</strong> to open the search box.<br />
b. Click settings and then type <strong>Advanced Startup </strong>options, hit enter.<br />
c. Then click <strong>Restart Now </strong>under Advanced Startup.<br />
d. Now click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.<br />
e. Then click <strong>Advanced options </strong>and then <strong>Automatic Repair</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run System File Checker (SFC)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as <strong>"System File Checker"</strong> or
<strong>"sfc".</strong> <br />
This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions.
<br />
a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
b. In the Command Prompt, type the following command,<strong> sfc /scannow </strong>
and then press&nbsp;Enter. <br />
c. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with&nbsp;a regular hard disk and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.
<br />
d. Restart your computer and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Update drivers</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you updating all the drivers from the computer manufacturer's website.<br />
Refer below articles for more information:</p>

            <p>Since updating to Windows 10 I've had this error message as well and tried the fixes suggested....None of them worked or found any issue that might be causing this....For a time disabling the OneDrive seemed to prevent this error from happening but now it
 has begun happening again with the OneDrive disabled.&nbsp;</p>

            Ok I have said before that I identified my problem caused by streaming and only then. I found&nbsp;a third party source for an update Lan wifi driver, downloaded it kept the original secure just in case. Since then now approx. 4-5 weeks no problems what so
 ever.

    <title>windows 8.1 randomly adjusts the application volume in the mixer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vlad nicolici  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8.1 randomly adjusts the application volume in the mixer</h2>
                    <p>For no apparent reason, Window 8.1 suddenly reduces the sound volume for&nbsp;some applications by around 90%.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I play for example World of Tanks, and suddenly the volume for World of Tanks is reduced, so I can't hear what happens in the game.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have to go to the Windows volume mixer and bring the volume for World of Tanks back&nbsp;from 10% to 100%.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is just one example, it happens in other applications too, for example I watch YouTube videos, and it reduces the volume for Internet Explorer. I have to use the volume mixer to bring it back up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This didn't happen before upgrading from 8.0 to 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, how I disable this annoying behavior?</p>
<p><br />

            This was happening to me as well, seemingly at random. Try the following:
<div>Right click the sound-button in the task bar and select playback devices</div>
<div>Go to the communications-tab</div>
<div>Select "Do nothing" for the option to reduce the volume during communications.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So far I have not experienced the random volume decreases after changing this setting, my guess is that there is a bug in Skype (as far as I know it's the only "Communications" program I have installed) that makes Windows 8.1 think I'm in a call or something.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please note that I'm a bit unsure of the actual names of the settings and such since my Windows is in Swedish, but hopefully you'll be able to find it :)</div>

            <p>Thank you! This setting must be what has been doing this to me.</p>
<p>I use Google's Hangouts and every so often the volume of the video chat would turn way down and for the longest time I couldn't figure out why. It makes sense now, since Hangouts isn't installed on the computer, why it would turn the volume down.</p>
<p>I was watching a YouTube video today and noticed that when I plugged my iPod in, Windows turned Chrome's volume down so I could hear the asinine "USB Connection" sound. I'm glad someone has found out how to shut this feature down.</p>

            It's worth pointing out that Steam can also cause this behavior if it's configured to "Automatically transmit my voice whenever I speak". Disabling the setting in Steam fixed it for me, but it's good to know it's actually a by-design feature in Windows
 that would be very helpful if I actually used it.

<p>Thanks I too was quick to automatically assume Microsoft had made (another) mistake. But come to think about it this trouble started after I installed Steam. Never put that together thanks for the tip. Shame on Steam it should not do that and when I stop
 speaking (or more likely it falsely detects background noise as speech)&nbsp;it should return the volume to normal anyway.</p>

<p>My trouble is that if I have itunes open and then I have anything else open, especially an internet window open, my itunes volume is decreased.</p>
<p>The only "solution" I've found is to close my internet window or to mute my internet window. These are ok as workarounds but are in no way acceptable as "solutions".</p>
<p>Anybody got any idea what comes next?</p>

            for me nothing changes in the mixer, my sound is at 30%, but sometimes that 30% is a lot louder, more like 60%, so i do not see the change i hear the change, a bit different issue, but ferry similar, i play games &amp; watch series online, &amp; it happens when
 i watch series, &amp; no its not just flash issue cause when i click on the vol button the sound is much louder then before so it means the hole vol is changed not just for flash, so win vol changed to, &amp; also same happened on youtube with HTML5, maybe the recreant
 sound drive update caused it, but i had small issues before to, like there were days where i felt that vol is bit down &amp; sometimes that its bit to high, but it was so little &amp; it was set for a day so i thought that i imagined it, but new i think i had issues
 even before, any time i watch video Vol gets up, but it still shows its at 30%, Vol bar shows that, also before update i had 3 ravbg64.exerunning, new i have 2, but i had that issue before only on smaller scale, when win started &amp; when i stared to watch video,
 even file on PC sound got bit louder &amp; it stayed like this, its similar but little different

    <title>w&#47;dows10 feature update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            w&#47;dows10 feature update</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried three times now to install w/dows10 feature update 1903 onto my pc. Having used the 10 update assistant has not helped at all either. When it comes to install the update it freezes at 48% and crashes each time. Has anyone else had
 same problem? I have given up to install it. My pc is a Lenovo all in one 3yrs old, does anyone have a solution to this, m/soft are no help. Your suggestions/ideas would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Cheers John</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Important - Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi John,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />In case if the Media Creation Tool fails as well, we would like to see the Installation log to check what caused the update to fail/stuck/rollback.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named files from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

    <title>Xbox Service Repair Cost &#38; Customer Support - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Service Repair Cost &#38; Customer Support</h2>
                    So I contacted Microsoft Support to try and get my issue resolved with my Xbox One X.&nbsp; It is having issues they do not know what is wrong with it.&nbsp; It randomly powers off with no error code then I have to manually turn it on and it loads the green reset
 screen then goes home and after about anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes it shuts off.&nbsp; So I spoke to a Microsoft Rep at 5pm and she told me the cost was going to be $169 to have it repaired going through them but if I did it online it would cost me $149 so I told
 her I would do it when I got home.&nbsp; I got home and went online to submit the service repair and it tells me it will cost me $229 so I called customer support back and talked to a new representative.&nbsp; I asked him to bring up the call from 5pm where I talked
 to customer support or any records he could and he could find nothing and then told me she told me the wrong price.&nbsp; I do not understand how she gave me one price which I could barely afford at the mo

</p><p>Hey there thanks for posting on the xbox communinty forums </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry too hear your having a issue with the console is powering off. I would make sure that the console is pluged right into a wall outlet no extensions or surge protactors and is in a well vented area.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has too the cost for the repair there isnt anything that anyone on the community forums can do about that all you can do is contact support back I do know that the cost for a X repair is quite high. I would also maybe try a other power cable has it could
 just be the cable and you can get them for around $15 or ask a friend</p>

<p>Hi IrishMoose169,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can recommend is going through a 3rd party.&nbsp; When one of Xbox was out I warrenty I got my fix via Gamestop.&nbsp; That Xbox would&nbsp; turn off due to poor ventalization.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, it shutting off and on&gt;&gt;&gt;is your Xbox making any sounds?&nbsp; If not I would try getting a new power cord, as mention by the other abassador, and see if that helps.&nbsp; If it does, it help you save alot of money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And note, we are all human and humans make mistakes.&nbsp; It seems like the 1st agent you spoke to you did give you the wrong price and sorry about that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was plugged directly into the wall.&nbsp; I went through everything with support to get it fixed and they were stumped because it is completely random.&nbsp; It will stay on the factory reset screen for hours but as soon as it is processed and booted back
 to the load screen then it randomly shuts down again. Microsoft Support told me that it was more then likely caused by a system update gone bad which if they admit that then they caused the issue and they should fix it at no additional charge.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I understand that and I appreciate you taking the time to respond.&nbsp; Microsoft told me after going through all the troubleshooting that they believe it was a update gone bad.&nbsp; An update that they provided and pushed so if that caused the error then
 they should fix it at no charge.&nbsp; Even if I were to go through Microsoft or a third party there is no saying it will not just happen again.&nbsp; I do not want to waist my money on a issue a company refuses to take responsibility for when they believe they caused
 the issue and admitted it to me.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have and was told that it was what they think a update gone bad after going through every trouble shooting they could come up with.&nbsp; However even after admitting that it was an update that they pushed that messed up my system they refuse to take
 responsibility for fixing it.
