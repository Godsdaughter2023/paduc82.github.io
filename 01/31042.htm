<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m scared to play this game because of the reputation issues because people still idle and quit - leaving me alone against 4 people.</h2>
                    
<p>I am basically scared to play this game because of the fact that if you quit games too often your global reputation on xbox live will lower.</p>

<p>There is an issue with this because if 3 people quit as soon as the game starts or they all are idlers, I can not win against 4 people. Its almost impossible to win against those odds and its almost a sure lose in team doubles.</p>

<p>I have to make sure I have time to play this game because if I quit I'm afraid that my reputation will lower. A problem with this is why should I waste ~10 minutes of my time playing me, alone, versus 4 players? I don't want to quit because of the reputation
 repercussions. This is not a good situation to be in. Nonetheless ~50% of the time.</p>

<p>And idlers: I'm playing a game and they stand still either the whole game or the majority of it (trying to get around the idling detection) and they are not only not playing - they are helping me lose by giving the enemy team free kills by playing poorly
 on purpose.</p>


<p>The only option I see to attempt to fix this issue is add an auto-kick feature to people that are abusing the game's idling feature/detection system and a way for more people to join while the game is still playing - which probably can't happen due to the
 nature that this game is not meant to have that happen. It would also be good to put a warning about these features in the menu before people play, so that they will know about this - which by what I've seen, not a lot of people read the patch notes.</p>


<p><br />
I just have to rant because I just played this game for the first time in a while and the first two games I got were all quitters or idlers on my team and I lost because of them.</p>

            <p>I've actually beaten 4 guys in a slayer game after all of my teammates left the game.&nbsp; adopted guerilla tactics and did hit and run stuff so that I got one kill for every one of theirs. my team was already close to the lead when they quit and I took care of the rest.&nbsp; I've also won a CTF game on blood gulch (the reach version) with only 4 people left against 8 other players on the other team.&nbsp; we had a tie and my team held our base until the end of the game to get a stalemate. took a lot of work but we did it.&nbsp; </p><p>that being said, I usually quit after half of my team bails as well because i'm not going to waste my time on a game I have no chance of winning at that point.</p>

<h2>            xbox one e blu-ray casalinghi</h2>
                    
<p>Salve a tutti, dato che possiedo un masterizzatore blu-ray, volevo sapere se posso masterizzare i vecchi filmini delle vacanze su un blu-ray BD-R 25GB e leggerlo sulla XBOX ONE, o se invece la console legge solo i dischi dei film e giochi originali. Il bluray
 non sarebbe manco per me ma per un'amica che ha anch'ella xbox one come lettore bluray.</p>
<p>In pratica il vantaggio sarebbe che su un disco solo mi starebbero oltre 10 ore di filmati (vista anche la bassa qualit√† delle vecchie telecamere).</p>
<p>Purtroppo le console microsoft sono sempre piuttosto chiuse dal punto di vista multimediale, a meno che non si vada di streaming da un pc windows.</p>

<p>Grazie, credo proprio che opter√≤ per codificare i video in mp4 h264 (con encoder x264), e poi li masterizzo sul blu-ray, o addirittura su DVD forse, dato che ho visto che scendendo un po' a compromessi sul bit-rate, gi√† con un dvd DL potrebbero starci una
 decina di filmati. Tanto la vecchia videocamera aveva una qualit√† penosa, di conseguenza facendo un po' di prove ho visto che non si perde granch√©. Ho anche testato per sicurezza con una pendrive usb, e ho visto che la mia 360 non ha problemi a leggere h264
 a patto che siano .mp4 e non .mkv</p>

<p>Tecnicamente .mkv √® solo il contenitore, non un codec, cos√¨ come anche .mp4 Alla fine della fiera sia ps3 che 360 non leggevano gli mkv pur supportando h264 in .mp4 . L'idea che mi sono fatto io al tempo era che fosse un tentativo di scoraggiare la pirateria,
 dato che la maggior parte dei film pirata di qualit√† si trova in .mkv</p>
<p>Come quasi tutti i tentativi di scoraggiare la pirateria per√≤, l'efficacia √® molto bassa e il prezzo da pagare per gli utenti paganti √® una insulsa limitazione. A livello di potenza hardware la 360 avrebbe potuto facilmente essere un media-server definitivo.
 Su Xbox One a quanto pare sono supportati anche gli mkv</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</b></u> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</i><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.
<br />
<br />
The culprit throughout all of the dumps is <i><b>NETIO.sys</b></i> which is the Network I/O Subsystem (Windows system driver). It's not the true cause of the crash and is likely being caused by another 3rd party device driver.<br />
<br />
Usually in network related crashes like this they are caused by a 3rd party antivirus or firewall causing corruption and or conflicts, or other forms of 3rd party device drivers.<br />
<br />
<i><b>I'd recommend enabling Driver Verifier to see what we can catch:</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
„Éª&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Any other questions can most likely be answered by this article:<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The Bug_Check were D1 CAUSE NETIO.sys which is a Windows component which means <br />
something else drove it into Fault. (The oldest one pointed to athw8x.sys which is the<br />
Atheros WiFi driver.)<br />
<br />
BugCheck D1, {0, 2, 0, 82490a32}</p>
<p>Probably caused by : NETIO.SYS ( NETIO!NetioDereferenceNetBufferListChain+e2 )<br />
<br />
<strong>NETIO.sys issues are most often the network driver being used, 3rd party antivirus
<br />
though I see you have uninstalled Kaspersky, the BIOS, chipset, or other major drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check with Gigabyte Support, their on-line documentation, and drivers. Update the<br />
BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file
<br />
sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps copy
<br />
them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there. (This is NOT<br />
likely to help a lot on a new build).<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp; (Only AFTER you have performed<br />
all the initial suggestions at the top of this reply and IF the BSOD issues persist).</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this.&nbsp;<br />

<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0xD1: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL <br />
<br />
</strong>The DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL bug check has a value of 0x000000D1. This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Contact Support</font></a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</font></a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL Parameters</strong> </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p><br />
This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p><br />
If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for the
 page fault include the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><br />
To begin debugging, use a kernel debugger to get a stack trace.</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is caused by the driver that you are developing, make sure that the function that was executing at the time of the bug check is not marked as pageable or does not call any other inline functions that could be paged out.
<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</font></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes your WiFi adapter, or any network adapter used, is very suspect. Can try another USB<br />
adapter? Be sure to check with the support for that one and ensure you have the latest<br />
driver.<br />
<br />
The Androidusb.sys could be involved.<br />
<br />
Run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see methods in my previous reply).<br />

    <title>OEM Vista Business &#58; invalid partition table error on bootup. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eemyoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            OEM Vista Business &#58; invalid partition table error on bootup.</h2>
                    Toshiba Satellite Pro P300 crashed during standard use i.e. browsing with Firefox. On reboot it stalls at error "invalid partition table".<br />
I can only access BIOS settings, NOT Safe Mode.<br />
This machine has dual HDD and I have tried swapping drives at bootup but it didn't make any difference.<br />
Besides reformatting, the only other option I can think of is removing both drives and accessing them from a different machine to run chkdsk or similar.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any other suggestions before I have to go to those extremes?

 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />

    <title>Logical Drive Partition Not Recognized in New Windows Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian_j_870  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logical Drive Partition Not Recognized in New Windows Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; I would appreciate any advice that anybody can give me.&nbsp; I am not sure if the problem I am encountering is an oversight on my part, but it was not something that I anticipated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give a little bit of background, until last week I was running a Windows 7 system on my computer that included three hard drives (4 TB, 2 TB, and a smaller drive).&nbsp; The 4TB drive included my boot drive with Windows on a 2TB partition and then the unallocated
 space was turned into a new partition through Disk Management, assigned drive letter G, and was used for long term backup of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I have built a new computer and installed a new version of Windows 7 on a small SSD.&nbsp; During this process, I did not have any other drives connected to the machine (except the DVD drive) so that there would be no possibility of Windows installation
 doing something to these drives I did not want (I got burned by this once long ago when re-installing Windows 95, which just makes me feel old).&nbsp; After the entire installation process was run and the new version of Windows was running fine, I opened the machine
 and plugged in the 4 TB and 2TB drive, assuming that Windows would recognize them when I booted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I booted into Windows, Windows did indeed recognize both drives and assign them drive letters.&nbsp; But in the case of the 4TB drive, it only recognizes the partition containing my old boot drive.&nbsp; No drive letter was assigned to the secondary partition.&nbsp;
 When I go into Disk Management, it shows all of the leftover space as unallocated space, but does not even quite seem to recognize this space completely in the way it would if I had created it directly.&nbsp; For example, if I right click in this box, I do not
 get the normal options to Create a New Simple Volume.&nbsp; Everything on this menu is greyed out except Properties and Help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I have two questions.&nbsp; One (leaving aside the possibility of a hardware problem), was I wrong in assuming that a hard drive split into two partitions could be transferred from one Windows machine to another?&nbsp; I honestly thought any Windows 7 machine
 anywhere would recognize the two drives, but maybe I am missing something fundamental.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two, and more importantly, does anybody have any advice for accessing the data on this drive?&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>An issue that may be happening is that the drive partition has a security setting so only the user profile that created it would be able to access it, and seeing as you are trying to access it from a new profile it may not allow you to have access</p>
<p>
</p><p>To access these files you can try to boot from the old hard drive and manually change the setting of the partition or simply manually move the files and remove the partition.</p>
<p>To boot from the old hard drive restart have the hard drive plugged in, restart the computer and while it's booting press the F12 key to select the boot device, after that select the old Hard drive and access it normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helped.</p>

                    <p>When I change the audio slider on my taskbar (for example from 1% to 100%) there is absolutely no change in volume. It is just permanently loud and I can only change volumes with the speakers themselves or in whatever program I am using.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I went to playback devices and disabled all sound effects under the enhancement tab, then restarted my computer after the troubleshooter ran and reinstalled the audio driver.</p>

                    I have a Lenova ideapad 120S which I got as a gift. I want to give it to my Nephew but I logged onto the laptop signed onto my Microsoft account just the test it. Now when I open the laptop I have to sign on to my microsoft account to access the desktop.
 Can anyone tell me how to remove me as a user so that my Nephew can have a clean laptop to sign onto with his account.

Press the Shift Key and click Restart <br />

Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC <br />
Choose to keep nothing <br />

    <title>Toshiba does not support my laptop for Windows 10 installations - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Toshiba does not support my laptop for Windows 10 installations</h2>
                    <p>Windows says my computer is ready to download. Toshiba say don't do it. We are not supporting those drivers. What happens when people don't see Toshiba warnings, and download anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted here before under "Why can't I install Windows 10". </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/why-cant-i-upgrade-to-windows-10/ae9a298f-dfb0-4026-bdd5-66edbe4dc28a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/why-cant-i-upgrade-to-windows-10/ae9a298f-dfb0-4026-bdd5-66edbe4dc28a</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that Toshiba does not support my computer model for a Windows 10 upgrade. I was suggested to look for the drivers offered from Toshiba. Toshiba is not going to offer any drivers updates for my computer version&nbsp;after the upgrade to 10. Bennor
 offered some suggestions that may be helpful, but they are really a bit complicated for me. Besides, I really don't think that I should have to&nbsp;for a technical degree, just because Microsoft decides to upgrade their stuff every few months. It is absolutely
 ridiculous</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the day is near. So how can that be that I will be left behind because&nbsp;Toshiba decides not to support my machine and deny me the needed drivers, and now &nbsp;I can't get the Microsoft Upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Toshiba Laptop Satalite P845t-S4305 Purchase Dec 2012 is not in this Toshiba list"</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now? I&nbsp; was hoping something had changed by now, and that I would be able to upgrade, even though by doing it , I&nbsp; would be loosing 1 or 2 software I use all the time. I would have to replace them to work with W10, which is another long story.
 AFGGHHHHH!</p>

            <p>When the mfg of a machine says don't do it believe them, and consider yourself lucky to have been warned.</p>
<p>Personally, I wouldn't consider 'upgrading' any machine that does not have Win10 specific motherboard and
</p>
<p>graphics drivers. </p>
<p>There are heaps of posts on these forums from people who insisted beyond reason to push Win10 onto a
</p>
<p>machine that is not suitable for Win10 ( admittedly generally older than yours, which if it were not a laptop</p>
<p>would probably have suitable drivers. My PC motherboard from '12 does. Laptops are king of the hill for e-waste).
</p>
<p>And for what ? The Store ? Cortana ? Because it's 'free' ?</p>
<p>They are willing to possibly loose performance and deal with on going issues for a couple of new 'features'
</p>
<p>and a lot of bloatware (any new feature you don't use ) ?</p>
<p>Then when things get unstuck they find themselves here wondering why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Nothing that changes with Win10 will change the fact that Toshiba do not intend producing drivers for Win10.</p>
<p>Regarding the next big change in Win10. There will be nothing in relation to making it more compatible with older</p>
<p>hardware. If anything Win10 will move further away from older hardware over time.</p>
<p>- When thinking of pushing Win10 on to any machine carefully consider Murphy's Law.</p>
<p>Further to that. You have software that you say will not be compatible. MS will be supporting Win8.1 for a long time</p>
<p>yet, so unless there is something on Win10 you really, really <em>need</em>, why change ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- On a more positive note ... <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf69af6f-49ba-4376-989f-28cafa0a4abc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bf69af6f-49ba-4376-989f-28cafa0a4abc" /></a></p>
<p>- If you make a clone of your current OS to an external HDD you will have a fail safe option for going
</p>
<p>back to your current OS if you find Win10 is going to have issues or you don't like it.</p>
Sure, you can 'roll back' but the danger of a borked OS rolling back is greater than doing the 'upgrade', and
<p>there is no guarantee of a smooth upgrade.</p>
<p>You will have to put in&nbsp; lot of hours over the next few weeks though, because you will have to decide before</p>
Win10 gets locked in permanently.
<p>
</p><p>Win10 will run on a machine that does not have updated drivers, but how well depends partly on
</p>
<p>what you do with the machine. And the Win8.1 drivers for you machine may work well with Win10 ?</p>
<p>If you use software or games that put a decent load on the cpu and graphics you are more likely to have issues than</p>
<p>if you only do documents or internet surfing, but yeah! Give it a go, if you have the time.</p>
<p>

            Hi Martin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Be sure you have disabled Bitlocker before getting rid of those keys or you may not be able to access your data if you reinstall.  
<br />
<br />See here to make sure it's disabled:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/37060-turn-off-bitlocker-operating-system-drive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/37060-turn-...</a>
<br />
<br />I would read and understand Bitlocker fully from this guide since you've apparently enabled it without knowing fully about it and this can lead to disaster:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Many thanks Greg ...I'll have a good look at the links! I didn't actually enable it or do anything about bitlocker. What happened was that Dell (under warranty) replaced the mother board and then disappeared!&nbsp; When I booted the laptop up comes the request
 to input that 48 digit code.&nbsp; It happens every time I boot!&nbsp; I see in my Windows accounts the bitlocker code and wonder if I delete the code will my problem with booting go away.&nbsp; Cheers&nbsp; David in Australia

            I would contact Dell and tell them that you did not ask for them to enable Bitlocker or whatever else might be using this code, and that from what you understand they have put your data at risk and you want it fixed.  
<br />
<br />Politely ask for a supervisor and get their name.  Let them know  you are airing this in the world's largest tech forums owned by Microsoft and a senior MVP is assisting you.   You want it put back the way it was without risky keys being imposed that you did not have before or ask for.

    <title>Brand new Acer Laptops Disk Running at 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robduffyjf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brand new Acer Laptops Disk Running at 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchase the laptops for my organisation and always go for Acer lower end models such as Acer E15 for &lt;¬£400. I have done this a dozen times without issue and then suddenly the last 3 have ALL had the disk running at 100% and I have spent days trying to
 improve them without success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all laptops I purchase I do the following for setup before I pass them to the user:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove free trials of office / McAfee</li><li>Download and install Chrome</li><li>Download and install Bullguard Internet Security</li><li>Install windows updates</li><li>Add malwarebytes - but only free version to run on demand as a secondary line of defence</li></ul>
<p>In order to try and deal with the issue, I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reset the PC completely, everything wiped</li><li>Re-installed windows 10 (happens automatically)</li><li>Performed an sfc /scannow check which comes back fine, as does DISM</li><li>Checked the MSI setting using an answer on microsoft from 1 to 0 and back again - no difference</li><li>Used Ccleaner to see if that will help</li></ol>
<p>The end result is the same, always running slow - startup to first app loading is a minimum of 3 minutes. I'm not expecting lightning fast but that's still surely way too much, and everything is lagging, nothing happens quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wondered if I'm missing something basic or doing something that is causing this as 3 in a row is absurd. Any and all advice gratefully received!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Thanks again Lawrence. I've started it in safe mode, but the task manager had no disk status in that mode, so couldn't see what it was at. The limited things I could do; file explorer and a couple of apps seemed more responsive but hard to be sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop was still slow in full working mode, but the disk reading was moving about more - not just stuck at 99/100%. Any further thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help</p>

<p>Thanks Lawrence, but I've sent it back to the manufacturer. I've spent way too much time on Acer laptops - will be buying a different make in future!</p>

            <p>Vinodh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The format of the letter is a voice recording on Windows 10 voice recorder.</p>
<p>I would like to transfer it onto a CD that can be played on a normal, "stand alone", CD player.</p>
<p>No, I have not yet tried to get the recording into the Windows Media Player.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to burn the recorded file <span>to a CD </span><span>through </span>
<span>Windows Media Player. Here's how:</span></p>
</span><span>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open the recorded file through Windows Media Player.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Select the <strong>recorded file </strong>onto the burn list.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Insert a blank CD into the disk drive of your computer.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Click on <strong>Burn</strong> tab at the top right of the window.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Click on <strong>Start burn</strong>.</p>
</span><span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
</span></span>

<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Right click that 260ci WIA USB device and choose 'Disable' - don't uninstall it as Windows will just re-install it. 
<br />
<br />That will stop the popups warnings you are getting !!

                    Hello, I am running windows xp home and recently found that I had the conficker virus. It was removed by sophos, which I have on my computer, but now the computer is using up too much RAM.&nbsp; Almost 1.2GB, which is twice as much as before.&nbsp; Now I cannot
 run multiple programs at the same time.&nbsp; I got the microsoft security essentials and it says my computer is clean, as does sophos.&nbsp; But the computer is still using too much RAM.&nbsp; How do I fix this??<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate you for providing us with all the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have run this online virus scanner-</p>

<span>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><span>Note:</span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</font></font></p>
<p>Additionally, I would have you use free third party antivirus software to scan the computer for virus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Note: Using third party antivirus is at your own risk.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I would have you place the computer in a Clean Boot state to check whether some application or program is using up the RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link-</p>

<p><em>Note : Make sure you get the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done with all the troubleshooting steps.</em></p>

            Conficker has been around for a while and Microsoft claims their Malicious Software Removal tool is a good counter measure so why don't you also run that:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Then follow up with these popular and respectable scanners:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time) and remove any threats:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
Be sure to select and choose to delete any threats, then scan again to be sure the threats have been removed.<br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
SAS may install a startup item and launch every time your system reboots so if it is your desire to disable that, from the SAS splash screen, choose Preferences and uncheck the box "Start SUPERAntiSpyware when Windows starts".<br />
<br />
Do a full scan once in a while when you have more time (perhaps hours).<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
When the scans run clean, reboot and then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
It is usually not a good idea to run more than one antivirus/antimalware program with real time protection on your system at the same time, so if you are using Sophos
<i>and </i>Microsoft Security Essentials, I would pick one or the other but never both at the same time.&nbsp; Running two products can cause poor performance and sometimes they can just conflict with each other.<br />
<br />
Then <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2372364,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I see on pcmag.com</a> where they rate AV products and protections that Sophos ranks #22 even below MSE so is that something you just installed lately?&nbsp; I would stick with MSE since it has a small footprint, but of course that choice is up to you.<br />
<br />
If you are running both at the same time, that could be your problem.<br />
<br />
Depending on what options you chose when you installed Sophos, you could have several conflicts with MSE and the built in XP firewall (running two firewalls is also not a good idea) so if you decide to uninstall Sophos and keep MSE, you need to be sure to follow
 their uninstall instructions that you can find here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/11019.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/11019.aspx</a><br />
<br />
If your system got infected with Confiker, then whatever you were using failed to protect your system anyway so you might want to consider something a little more potent - MSE coupled with the free versions of MBAM and SAS is usually a pretty good combination
 unless you surf dangerously.<br />
<br />
My crystal ball has a hangover this morning, so let's get some more information:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Tell us why you think your computer is using too much RAM and how you came up with this 1.2GB usage number - where and how did you look to determine that?&nbsp; If you get some kind of error message, tell us exactly what it says with no paraphrasing.<br />
<br />
Tell us why you think that is too much and what do you think it should be?<br />
<br />
You say you cannot run multiple programs at the same time, but do not tell us what happens when you try to run multiple programs at the same time.&nbsp; If you get some kind of error message, tell us exactly what it says with no paraphrasing.<br />
<br />
Then let's get a few more details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />

            I think the problem may have begun when I started using a USB I got from a conference.&nbsp;
<br />
When I go to system performance it says that my computer is using bw 1.2-1.5GB of RAM where before it would use less than half of that.&nbsp; The computer is running very slowly, and occasionally I get the "Blue screen of death" telling me that there is a memory
 problem.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I used Sophos and Microsoft antivirus.&nbsp; Both are claiming there is no virus on the computer.&nbsp; I went and did a system restore from before the time I got the USB and the computer was back to normal.&nbsp; When I put the USB back in, thats when I realized that it
 was infected.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
The computer is using up 79 processes.&nbsp; Way too many.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Unless anyone can give me an easy solution to fix this, I think i might have to reinstall windows.&nbsp; I'm using XP SP2, but it looks like the microsoft antivirus just upgraded it to SP3.&nbsp; Now many of my programs dont want to work and the computer will not allow
 me to do a reinstall by disk because the disk is now to old (?).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What a pain...<br />

            If you restore back to a time when the system was normal and things are fine until you put 'the USB back in' (whatever that means) then don't put the USB back in.&nbsp; It is possible that whatever this USB is that you picked up at a conference has some malicious
 software on it that afflicts your system.<br />
<br />
Just because Sophos and MSE say your system is clean does not mean your system is clean.&nbsp; You should interpret that to mean that Sophos and MSE did not find anything they know about.&nbsp; If you choose not to run MBAM and SAS, that is up to you.<br />
<br />
I am sticking to not running Sophos and MSE on th same system at the same time but you can choose to keep doing that it it is your desire.<br />
<br />
We still don't know what 'now many of my programs don't work' means and what 'will not allow me to do a reinstall by disk because the disk is now to old' means.<br />
<br />
Too many unknowns for me....<br />
<br />
Maybe Nirmal S has some other ideas for you.<br />

<h2>            Show or hide Recent Items on the Start Menu&#47;Task Bar</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On previous versions of Windows, we would be able to hide recent items from the start menu and the task bar. I am trying to hide recent items on the task bar, but the option is no longer there. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, what I mean by recent items are the list of files recently opened using a specific program. For example, if I right click on Visual Studio on my task bar, I get a list of all the apps I've been working on. I don't want these to display.</p>
