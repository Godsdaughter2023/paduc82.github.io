<h2>            Latest patches from MS have broken Windows APPx functionality Windows 10 Pro Surface book</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest round of patches from MS has broken my appx functionality on the surface book.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been down the usual path of checking ACLs, reregistering packages and even did a full reimage with personal data wipe. The latter worked until the windows patching updated the most recent patches and broke the system again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For MS reference the patches applied to this system most recently are from the 29/12/2015 and on:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3124200</p>
<p>KB3132372</p>
<p>System hardware update 17/12/2015</p>
<p>KB3119147</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to the patching process I did Yesterday the surface book was working 100% now everything works except the appx packages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relevant windows logs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ActivateApplicationForContractByAppIdAsUserWithHost of the app Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App for the Windows.Launch contract failed with The app didn't start..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server App did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at the DCOM permissions of the APPX host process and it's set to defaults and the defaults are as expected on a base build machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sysinternals Procmon shows the appx package launches from the surrogate DCOM process fine but just closes out as I can see in the GUI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can see MS just broke my machine with a patch even through I only patch once a month by turning off updates, Stellar. :/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know if there's a fix for this patch yet? A v2 perhaps? :D</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            microsoft solitaire collection 更新的等级制度 &#91;Translation- Microsoft solitaire collection Updated rating System&#93;</h2>
                    <p>就我目前观察到的等级晋升是与游戏获胜的场次与难度相关，那么为什么现在更新的等级制度不能直接根据之前所获胜的游戏来计算，而是从1开始呢？游戏记录都是有据可查的，实现根据历史数据直接计算等级会存在什么技术问题吗？</p>
<p>（作为几年的老玩家，看着这个等级1真的很不爽）</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Translation-As far as the level promotion I have observed at the moment is related to the difficulty of winning the game, why can't the current updated hierarchy be calculated directly on the basis of the game that was previously won, but starting
 at 1?</strong><br />
<strong>Game records are documented, what are the technical issues that can be achieved by achieving a level of direct calculation based on historical data? (as an old player for a few years, it's really unpleasant to look at this level 1)]</strong></p>

<p>In an earlier locked thread you stated this:</p>
<p>[quoteuser="Fullmetal1986"]</p>
<p>An e-mail was sent you detailing that the deleted post was considered spam.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that I appreciate you taking the time to reply and actually tell me why my Hank Hill post was deleted, but I wanted to make it clear that I have received no previous e-mail detailing why this was so. Do they have the right e-mail address,
 or did they actually send an e-mail?<br />
<br />
I would have tried to PM you directly, but because I only have a Silver membership, I am not allowed to send messages to other users. This seemed to be the only way I could actually contact you. Sorry for what will clearly be another necessarily locked topic.<br />
<br />
Funny, this post actually is fairly irrelevant spam. The Hank Hill "Yep" comment&nbsp;had&nbsp;comedic relevance to the thread in which it was posted.</p>

<h2>            Help I am stuck in a startup loop on my netbook and I need to get to important data on here.  </h2>
                    My netbook is running Windows XP, so I don't have a disk.&nbsp; However it is stuck in startup loop - the Windows screen would pop up then goes to the screen that says that windows did not shut down properly so when I choose any of the safe modes, it just lists
 the streams without giving me any kind of commands; if I choose last known configuration or start windows normally, it acts like it will reboot, but then says it is dumping the "physical memory" and goes through the process all over again.&nbsp; I don't have any
 disk and I can't afford to lose the data on here.&nbsp; Any ideas?

</span></span></p>
<p><span>You will have to borrow an XP installation CD to fix this, otherwise I think you will have to reinstall XP</span></p>
<p><span>Configure your PC to boot from CD if it isn't already set up that way. You may need to enter the BIOS to configure the PC to boot from the CD.</span></p>
<p><span>Set the boot order to
</span></p>
<p><span>floppy (if present)</span></p>
<p><span>CD/DVDROM</span></p>
<p><span>Hard disk</span></p>
<p><span>SAVE and EXIT</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start your PC with the XP Setup CD in the drive. When you see the "Press any key to boot from CD..." prompt, do so and let the CD-based boot process begin.</span></p>
<p><span>When the Recovery Console option is offered (Press R to start the Recovery Console), do so. You may be asked which Windows installation to enter, in which case
 type the number of the Windows installation you wish to work on (usually 1).</span></p>
<p><span>When prompted, enter the Administrator's password for that Windows installation. If you did not set a password just press ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>At the command prompt, type
</span></p>
<p><span>Bootcfg /Rebuild</span></p>
<p><span>ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The exact wording will depend on your setup, but after a few moments you'll see a prompt that says something like:</span></p>
<p><span>Total Identified Windows Installs: 1<br />
[1] C:\Windows<br />
Add Installation To Boot List?</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming the information you see is correct, enter
</span></p>
<p><span>Y</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Bootcfg will start the process of rebuilding the boot list to include the indicated Windows installation</span></p>
<p><span>After a moment, you'll be asked to "Enter Load Identifier."<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>This is the name of the operating system that will appear in boot menus.
</span></p>
<p><span>Type
</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Windows XP Professional
</span></p>
<p><span>or
</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition</span></p>
<p><span>ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Next you'll be asked to "Enter OS Load Options."
</span></p>
<p><span>For normal installations, enter
</span></p>
<p><span>/Fastdetect</span></p>
<p><span>ENTER</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Type
</span></p>
<p><span>Exit
</span></p>
<p><span>to leave the Recovery Console and reboot the PC, which should then start normally.<br />

<p>I agree completely. It's a video game. It's one and only purpose is for me to enjoy myself. Instead, I'm left with two options. Stop gaining XP and making progress of any kind. Or use some garbage equipment that I suck with ending every match at the bottom

<p>No I agree. I'm ok with trying things to a degree but if I get stuck on the gooser challenge or something similar it might cause me to lose interest. I'm ok with earning a regen or prestige but not to the point that it hinders or even frustrates my enjoyment.
 Also I feel real bad for the average players who will never have the skill to get past certain challenges. For a game that is touted as a game both hardcore and casual fans can enjoy I'm not seeing it with this regen system. Respawn please adjust this as I
 have seen people already losing interest because of it. </p>

<p>I am a really good player when it comes to games. So I am pretty good with the CPR and the AMG. So I think it's only fair that I have to use shotgun or the other gun I never use. I might help me get used to using them more. But I already bought my season
 pass so either way i'm stuck with TitanFall.</p>

<p>I think it's great that they've added challenges to the prestige system. You've got to earn it rather than just going through the rinse, repeat method that other games use. Getting to level 10 will, for once, mean you are actually good at the game.</p>

            Just unclicking the Microsoft update in Windows updates settings worked for me.&nbsp; It looks like Microsoft products like Word and Excel update automatically.&nbsp; You can go I into Word or Excel, click File, Account, and Update options.&nbsp;I don't think this is
 a coincidence, but I&nbsp;stopped receiving&nbsp;Windows 8.1 updates ever since I received the notification to upgrade to 10.0.&nbsp; (I am waiting for all the bugs to be fixed before upgrading to&nbsp;10.0).&nbsp; 80244019.&nbsp; 8024401F.&nbsp; Error.

<p>Hi Julie, </p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>You can change touchpad settings to turn the touchpad on and off, reverse scrolling direction and turn gestures off and on. However, there is no option to turn off the touchpad only while you're typing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To change the touchpad settings:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Attach the Cover to Surface.<br />
(If you have Wireless Adapter for Typing Covers, attach the Cover directly to Surface.)</li><li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>.)</li><li>Tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Change PC settings</strong>, and tap or click&nbsp;<strong>PC and devices</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click Mouse and touchpad.</li><li>
<p>Adjust your settings under Touchpad.<span><br />
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>

<p><span>I doubt you'll still have a system restore point after 3 months, but the problem may have been more recent so it's
 worth a shot.<br />
<br />
Go to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Pictures to see if there is anything there.&nbsp; If there is, this may be a corrupted profile.&nbsp;
<span>
To fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.<br />
</span><br />
<span>To search the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
entire</span> C: drive in Vista (a regular search is only a partial search) go to Start / Search Box and type in ‘&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;’.&nbsp; You can use wildcards like *.jpg if you wish.&nbsp; As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where
 you're typing and one will say Search Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed,
 hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span><br />
<br />
</span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 further information on how to use this feature at: </span><a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />

<br />
<br />
If you decide to use these recovery programs, stop using the hard drive immediately as you could overwrite the files you are trying to restore.&nbsp; Instead, slave it to another PC and run the recovery from there.&nbsp; Chances are good you will have lost a great deal
 of your work if the problem has been occurring for a full 3 months.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One X shuts down by itself.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a problem, I have not had 2 months with my Xbox ONE X and it goes off by itself,<strong> it locks up and simply shuts down.</strong> I already changed the power cord, I connected it to another side and the problem persists. The worst thing is that it is a gift that someone gave me from Los Angeles (USA) and they tell me that for the guarantee as I am in Colombia<strong> I have to pay 746,000 COP to change it for a</strong> <strong>RECONDITIONED</strong> and only give me <strong>90 days of guarantee. It is unfair!!</strong> I just opened the console <strong>two months ago</strong>. HELP!!!!</p>

<p>I had the same problem 2 weeks ago with my console.</p>
<p>Chances are high that this is not a defect of your console but simply and error in the current software update that was last installed.</p>
<p>This problem is usually resolved by a new update that will come soon.</p>

 Once they get your computer they take all your personal info then destroy your hard drive to cover their tracks.&nbsp;

            This just happened to me today, May 5 2015. &nbsp;Call ID came in as Not Available 1624. &nbsp;The caller had an Asian Indian accent. &nbsp;Claimed to be from Windows IT in Boca Raton, FL. &nbsp;He said hackers from NY were trying to get into my computer. &nbsp;He wanted me to
 press Window + R. &nbsp;I stalled and tried to get some info from him,it was obviously a scam. &nbsp;Asked for his phone number, finally he said, 786-245-URTMF. &nbsp;I replied UR2 and hung up.

            <p>I sent this to a my list.&nbsp; thanks!</p>
<div><span><span>FYI</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Please read.&nbsp; This is going nuts.&nbsp; I receive at least two a week. So many people fall for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually costs $500 to have them "release" your computer plus they leave the malbot on your
 pc and call every few months demanding more money.&nbsp;&nbsp; They bury the malbot where it cannot be removed.&nbsp; Most people scammed end up tossing their old computer and buying a new one.&nbsp;&nbsp; The WORST version of the&nbsp;scam is one put on your computer&nbsp;buried it in the
 registry of your e-mail file and documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT easy to do - thank heavens!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>So you move those "MUST HAVE" files to your new pc but the da ---- criminals STILL have you forever.&nbsp; Until you abandon your email and all documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bummer!&nbsp; This scam has been narrowed
 down to one city in "tech city" part of a city in east India.&nbsp; This is serious enough Microsoft and others has gone to the Indian government demanding they shut down the dozens of companies doing this.&nbsp; THOUSANDS OF PEOPE ARE DOING IT!&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As an aside = WHY CALL CENTERS DON'T USE SOUND DEADENING MICROPHONES??&nbsp; I CAN always HEAR DOZENS OF BAD PEOPLE SCAMMING OTHERS IN THE BACKGROUND.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><span>This is the first time I have EVER seen Microsoft put out such a warning!&nbsp; This is major serious.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please pass to friends.&nbsp; They just call random numbers assuming
 people have&nbsp;a computer!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a group I heard they&nbsp;bought a copy of AARP's member list.&nbsp; So many people are complaining to AARP they may be forced to stop selling their member list.&nbsp; They sell it for a million dollars to like life insurance companies and hearing
 aid companies.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can buy age specific cheaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like only older women over age 75.&nbsp;&nbsp; List is like gold.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard&nbsp;that list&nbsp;costs $250,000&nbsp;&nbsp; Only two million women on it but think how vulnerable they are to so many types on cons and scams!&nbsp;</span></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>On the entire AARP list&nbsp;you have 30(?) million people all with wired telephones and mostly not computer saavy- being older.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many just have a pc to see their grandkids on Skype and do a few
 emails with friends.&nbsp; So they are prime targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I am a retired senior level&nbsp;computer engineer&nbsp;(I have patents, still do a lot of consulting,&nbsp;etc.) if I have time I play with them with some of my hacking software (I NEVER EVER hack for bad reasons-
 only to mess up hackers themselves -- I back trace them and do things like add a porno redirect to their pc.&nbsp; I&nbsp;even have software I wrote&nbsp;that destroys their pc if I want to.&nbsp; But I have NEVER destroyed a computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; NEVER been that mad!&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Most of these scammers have NO computer protection.&nbsp; Zero.&nbsp; Takes me just seconds to take over not just one PC but an entire call center!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Guess they figure not many AARP people have techie smarts plus hacking software.&nbsp; I do!&nbsp; I heard&nbsp;my phone number is&nbsp;on a SHORT "NEVER EVER CALL THESE NUMBERS = NEVER!" list.&nbsp; But the list
 is usually ignored I guess.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had four call last week.&nbsp; So many people are dropping wired phones and just doing cell&nbsp;"targets" fall in number every day.&nbsp; I'd drop it if my wife allowed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Says "we're not real&nbsp;people unless we're in the phone book".&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>One guy I convinced I had his house surrounded by the police!&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him "if you show up at your house within an hour in your underwear that is the police secret code that you are OK and
 they will not arrest you!&nbsp;&nbsp; The guy sent me a message the next day mad as Hell.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Oh, I also wrote&nbsp;"you MUST&nbsp;yell all the way home "I am out here in my underwear for punishment for being a bad immoral con man!".&nbsp; I wrote the police have one detective already watching him.&nbsp;
 I wrote he had to then climb on his roof and keep yelling for 0 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>He wrote me&nbsp;"my neighbors laughed, took pictures etc".&nbsp; Could have been worse.&nbsp; I could have made him go home naked but I figured he might not do it.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>His wife was NOT happy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Called him a FOOL for falling for the prank.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have loved to have had someone video it but no way to know in advance who would be the fall guy.&nbsp;&nbsp; NO ONE now
 falls for the "underwear prank" as it is now known.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>His message said "we are moving - all because of you - you are a very bad people man!&nbsp;&nbsp; Americans are not supposed to be bad people!&nbsp; You are a bad American people!". I locked him out so he
 could not trace me or get my IP address. He could send me a message but that was it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I'm sure his "call center" people&nbsp;laughed as he&nbsp;walked home in his underwear.&nbsp; I suspect he is now driving one of those Indian pedacabs!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Gosh!&nbsp; "Gee wilikers Wally and Beaver! You have fun in life where you find it" is my philosophy!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moral: do not get one Gary Yantis upset!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am RARELY upset BTW.</span></span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><span><span>No matter what they do their pc goes to porn sites.&nbsp;But not forever.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm NOT cruel.&nbsp; &nbsp;I turn the pc loose after a week with a closing message of "see what it feels like to scam people!&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Go find another occupation or do GOOD stuff with your computer skills". I then list a dozen companies in India who hire locals to do needed things.&nbsp; Like Odesk.&nbsp; There are many more GOOD Indian computer companies!&nbsp;&nbsp; India is becoming a HUGE techie country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 99% are all in one area of the Indian east coast.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>"Steve" just called me. Same MO. Indian, large noisy call center. Told me he was calling from Microsoft Service Center and that I needed to press cntrl+Windows+ little r or else terrible things would happen to my computer. I told him this sounded strange,
 and he said he could prove it by telling me an ID number on my computer that no one else in the world has.</p>
<p>I asked for a callback number and he gave me - 210-888-9063</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I told him I would call back. Yeah right. </p>

            <p>Very simply, the whole rather obvious scam is to get you to log onto a website (in this case it was MICROTECHRESOLVE) and download malicious code.
</p>
<p>The rest of the stuff with getting you to type CTRL+R and ASSOC or &nbsp;MSCONFIG or EVENTVWR is just to make you think you have something wrong. The average joe with a PC should be able to spot this in about 2 milliseconds after picking up the call (I actually
 kept them going for 55 minutes!).</p>
<p>It is the oldies that are more likely to get confused.</p>

            <p>This happened to me this morning. &nbsp;East Indian woman... very busy call centre... lots of different languages in the background. &nbsp;The call id was from Montreal, QC, Canada 514-320-0874.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kept her on the line as long as I could and she finally said... "Sir... I think you are fooling me." &nbsp;I replied that I was part of an international task force... Homeland Security, FBI, NSA, CIA, Mounted Police, CSIS, FSP and that I'd kept her on the phone
 in order to track her location... which we had done... and an armed force is now entering the building. &nbsp;I wished her good luck and said I hoped she said goodbye to her family this morning.</p>

            This scam is still active. &nbsp;My cell phone was called from 860-951-7532. The person said that malware was detected on my Windows PC. I decided to play along. &nbsp;The woman asked me to do the CTRL-WINDOWS-R. After much back and forth due to noisy phone line,
 she said that she wanted me to open up Internet Explorer and input IP 14.141.175.148. When I told her I was doing a network check on this IP address first, she hung up. The Registered Domain for this IP address is static-vsnl.net.in. This originates from TATACOMM-IN,
 an Internet Service Provider, based in Mumbai, India. Through my online research, I found this is a known scam where the hacker tries to access your PC and upload ransomware into it or find your personal financial related information on your PC's hard drive.
 &nbsp;Beware.

<p>then he tried to convince me my email was sending out spam and follow the same basic instructions you guys listed.</p>

            <p>I was called by an unknown number just now, which in and of its own is a huge red flag. I was told by a woman who was obviously Indian and claiming that she was representing Microsoft that my computer had started sending out error reports at random, and
 that social networking sites, e-mails and search engines were corrupting the files in my operating system.</p>
<p>Now, I knew it was a scam immediately when she said she was from Microsoft. I am pretty damn sure Microsoft would send an e-mail if such a thing had truly happened, instead of calling with an unknown number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, she asked me to press Ctrl + Windows + R. I lied and told her that I did. She asked me what I saw, and at that point I figured I had to bail on the call, because it is a waste of my time. Told her that the power in my town went out, and guess what
 she said? She told me to turn my computer on. As if I could do that during a power outage. I explained the "situation" further, and my call was moved to some dude whose Indian accent was a lot more subtle than the woman's. I explained the "situation" to him
 as well, and then he asked if there was a better time he could call back. This just told me how stupid these people are. A power outage can last anywhere from a couple minutes to several days where I am from (The latter being extremely rare, though), and I
 assume how long power outages last varies a lot most other places, too.</p>
<p>So the dude said he'll just call me at some random point later, and when he does, I am gonna tell him that I researched what his associate wanted me to do, and tell him to get a job that doesn't depend on ruining people's computers.</p>

<h3> jbuss360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 Won&#39;t Connect to Windows 7 installed on HP</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a HP EliteBook Model 840 running Windows 7 Professional - Service Pack 1 - 64bit. I own a Microsoft Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 in which I purchased in 2007. It has always worked
 with every computer with an internal Bluetooth adapter however with this new machine it won’t connect. I have taken the advice from many threads in the Microsoft Community and still am unsuccessful.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. I have updated my services.msc file which connects the mouse at first but then greys out the device.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. I have attempted to disable my power settings for Bluetooth on a HP however there is no Bluetooth setting like this.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. I have put new batteries in the mouse.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. I have searched for new drivers and was unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span>5. I downloaded Microsoft intellipoint and it won’t find my device.</span></p>
<p><span>6. I have added and removed the device several times, restarted my BT service, restarted my computer, 20 + times.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Again I have read every thread out there and it won’t connect.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My mouse DOES connect to my iMAC, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, old Compaq, and old Desktop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft or Windows support please help me out. I purchased a Microsoft mouse so that I wouldn't have issues like this. As you can see I own a lot of Mac computers and was giving you another
 shot with this HP. Please don't fail me. Give me a driver or something to install to fix the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So that you know... when I go to device manager my Bluetooth radios say: Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R) 4.0 and Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator.
