<h2>            microsoft flight simulator gold activation key</h2>
                    I have two Microsoft Gold editions that I bought first hand still wrapped. I have installed each one twice as I progressed through four computers until i completed my flight simulator with two specialized made gaming computers. when I attempt to install
 either of these games i continually come up with error codes. Is there any way to purchase new keys for my games or are they just expensive &nbsp;coasters now?&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi AlexPsilopoulos,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are facing issues using the Logitech keyboard in Windows 8,
<span>it would be grateful</span><span> if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</span></p>
<p>1. What exactly happens when you connect the keyboard to Windows 8? Is it detected?</p>
<p>2. Do you receive any error messages or codes?</p>
<p>3. Which version of Windows 8 have you installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems the Logitech keyboard you are using is compatible with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>For further information, please refer the Logitech Support link:</p>
<p><a href="http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/32423/section/troubleshoot/crid/404/lt_product_id/7288/tabs/1,3,2,4,5/cl/us,en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 8 product
 support and device compatibility</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>You may try running the Hardware and Device troubleshooter and check windows updates for driver updates. You may try installing the same and check.</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<strong><span>a.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong>Press <strong><span>Windows Key +R</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>Control Panel.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>b.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong></span>Type<strong><span> troubleshooting
</span></strong>in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.<br />
<strong><span>c.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong>Click on <strong><span>Hardware and Sound</span></strong>, click on
<strong><span>Hardware and Devices.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>d.</span></strong><strong><span>
</span></strong></span>Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>After running the troubleshooter, check in Windows updates if any drivers’ updates are available for the
 keyboard. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>a. At the Start screen, type
<b>Windows Update</b>.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click or
<b>tap Settings on the right side of the screen</b>, and then select
<b>Install optional updates</b> from the left results.</span></p>
<p><span>c. When the Windows Update control panel opens, click on “<b>Check for Updates</b>”
 on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>You may refer to Logitech website and try installing the Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode.</p>

</p>
<p>Since Windows 8 drivers are not available, you may install Windows 7 drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span>a. Download the drivers from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right-click on the driver and click on
<b>‘properties’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on the
<b>‘compatibility’</b> tab and check the box <b>‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</b> and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.</span></p>

            <p>hello and thank you for helping me.</p>
<p>I tried the steps above but nothing works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as for the questions you asked me :</p>
<p>1: my computer finds a wireless HID keyboard and 2! mouses(maybe it&nbsp;is seeing the keyboard as a second mouse?)&nbsp;&nbsp;when I insert the unifying receiver. I downloaded the software of unifying receiver from Logitech and installed it but when I run it, the software
 says that the computer cannot find the unifying receiver.</p>
<p>2:&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't have a message or error codes</p>
<p>3: I installed windows 8 pro via the upgrade offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar &nbsp;issue but on my windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My k800 keyboard started mixing up letters like when I pressed "y" it actually wrote "y#" for some reason :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not if this helps you but it might explain why you can't log in but still use the arrow key to navigate bios.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; What do I lose by changing to a custom install.&nbsp; The main reason I wanted to upgrade was to keep my system operating without data loss.&nbsp; I can leave the computer running for a few more days for it to clean up.&nbsp; I note that the fresh install is
 cheaper than the upgrade - which is what caused the initial selection.

                    <p>My BRIO refuses to work properly with the camera app. I have it plugged in to an ASMedia USB 3.1 port on my motherboard (ASRock X99 Taichi) and I have tried multiple driver versions, but i cannot get the Windows Camera App to use my camera. Always says it's
 in use by another application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug my BRIO in to a USB 2.0 port, it works fine, but only gives me the lower resolutions (not acceptable as I bought it for 4k or 1080p/60), and if I plug it in to one of my Intel USB 3.0 ports, the camera app DOES work, and allows "4k/30fps" but the
 image looks horrid. When plugged in to the USB 3.0 ports, it doesn't matter what resolution I use, the image looks noisy and grainy like an upscaled low res image.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The BRIO does work within the Logitech Camera configuration application when plugged in to the ASMedia 3.1 port, and the picture looks amazing! Crystal clear!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am so frustrated with this, as Logitech says it's Microsoft's problem, and Microsoft says it's Logitech's problem.&nbsp;<br />
Other apps like OBS and XSplit DO show me images when plugged in to the ASMedia USB 3.1 ports (again, crystal clear), but they crash when I try to set the resolution to 3840x2160 or 1920x1080. Only a very select few resolution settings work without crashing
 the apps, and they're not resolutions I wish to use (very low). One of them works at 4096x2160, but my monitor is only 3840x2160, and since that's the standard for youtube 4k etc., that's the res I need to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I plug the cam in to the Intel USB 3.0 port, all resolutions work in both OBS and XSplit, but again, the image looks absolutely horrid. (Also, when plugged in to this port, neither app allows me to set the resolution to 4096x2160, which is as it should
 be given the maximum res of my monitor)</p>
<p>I KNOW I'm not the only one having this issue. I have tried a multitude of things to fix it, but absolutely nothing works. Deleting the USB drivers and reverting to default windows ones (v10.0.16299.15 and v1.16.26.1 - I think. Close to this number anyway)
 made absolutely no difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried re-installing the default drivers from my motherboard manufacturers website (Asrock - X99 Taichi- v1.16.35.1 and 10.0.16299.15) but again, no difference what so ever.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've even tried updating to the latest driver (v1.16.48.1) but same issue. I really wish someone could help with this issue. Why are OBS and XSplit and the Logitech app able to use my camera on this port with crystal clear image, but the Windows Camera App
 can't? Why do OBS and XSplit crash when I change the resolution to 3840x2160 or other resolutions?<br />
<br />
<br />
Please Microsoft... Help us. I'm 100% certain this has to do with the Anniversary/Creators/Autumn Update. I paid $240 for this webcam, and it's essentially a useless lump at present. I don't care about Hello for login, all I want is to be able to record 4k
 video in the camera app, and do timelapses. If by some miracle your fix stops OBS from crashing, that would be great, but not the biggest worry to me.</p>

<p><span>Hi Don, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most webcam devices are plug and play. If the webcam has special features that are not available on the standard or generic brands, it will require a manual installation from a downloaded driver from their manufacturer sites. To better assist your concerns
 with your webcam, <span>we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you bought your webcam, did you get a CD driver installer? </li><li>Can you confirm if this is a plug and play device? To view the webcam device, expand the
<strong>Imaging devices</strong> in the <strong>Device Manager</strong> and provide us the screenshot of it.</li><li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press <strong>
Windows + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> window. Type <em>winver </em>
and press <strong>Enter</strong>. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What were the recent changes made on your computer before you experienced this issue?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</span></li><li><span>Did you receive any error messages?</span></li><li><span>Did you already install the latest driver from your manufacturer's website?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any other webcam programs installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any other anti-virus programs installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Is your graphics card already updated?</span></li><li><span>Is your BIOS firmware already updated?</span><br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, if the driver is not working properly after updating it, you can run our utility called
<strong>Driver Verifier</strong>. Visit this thread: <span style="color: rgba(196, 89, 17, 1)">

<p>Ok. Addressing in order of points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No CD. Driver not available from Logitech website, only software like the configuration app etc. Auto installed driver upon plugging in camera.<br />
</p>
<p>-Given it did auto install the driver, I can only assume it's plug and play. Screenshot below. (Note, I've also tried switching the driver to the USB Video Device driver from Microsoft, but that doesn't work either. Only difference it made, was that the
 camera appeared as a webcam under "Camera" in device manager instead of Imaging Device.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca06f2f9-eb26-4270-8a5b-ca458fc8bba0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca06f2f9-eb26-4270-8a5b-ca458fc8bba0" /></a><br />
<br />
-Windows 10 Pro 64bit - Version 1709 (build 16299.64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No recent changes at all when problem cropped up. When I first plugged in the camera, I had it plugged in to a USB 2.0 port, and wondered why it didn't show me options for 1080p/60fps or any resolution higher. Upon realizing, I plugged it in to my USB 3.1
 port, opened the Windows Camera app, and was greeted with the message saying my camera was in use by another application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Custom built PC. Asrock X99 Taichi motherboard, Intel i7-6850 CPU, 16gb ddr4 2600, Gigabyte GTX1080ti Founders Edition GPU, Windows running on Samsung 500GB 960EVO M.2 SSD.<br />
</p>
<p>-I've tried installing multiple drivers (for both the Intel and ASMedia USB ports as well as the camera itself), tried using multiple apps from both the Windows Store and Desktop apps, but all apps behave the same (with the exception of Windows Camera, which
 is the only one that tells me my camera is in use by another app). There's details outlined in my original question regarding certain troubleshooting steps I've attempted. I've also tried resetting the WIndows Store and re-installing the apps etc. sfc /scannow
 and DISM show no problems at all.&nbsp;<br />
I've also had a level 2 Microsoft tech on the phone with me and remotely trying to troubleshoot, and thus far been unable to get anywhere. I've tried creating another user to see if it was my profile, but results are the same. Tried restoring my PC to a time
 prior to me having the camera, but it made no difference. I'm sure I've done more, but I honestly can't think of anything else right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The only error message I've received thus far, is the one regarding my camera being in use by another application. When I attempt to use it in apps like OBS, I am able to see a low res image (1280x720) but as soon as I try to switch resolution, the camera
 either turns off, resulting in the app showing no image, or the apps simply freeze and then disappear. No errors. No events logged in event log :\</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Again, there is NO driver available from the Logitech website. Only software like the configuration app and background changer etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Depends on what you mean by web cam programs. If you mean programs from other webcams, no. If you mean programs capable of using a webcam (like skype, OBS) then yes. I have tried many different programs. Skype (desktop version , not the new one) is the
 only one that works without issue besides the Logitech Config app, but I assume that's because it's low resolution, and you can't change the resolution. Unfortunately, I didn't buy this camera to use on Skype. I bought it to use for recording videos and taking
 timelapses to upload to youtube etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-I have Malwarebytes installed, and I have tried disabling it, but it makes no difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Graphics card drivers are updated regularly (usually as soon as new drivers are available)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-BIOS was updated several days ago funnily enough. It was v1.40, and updated to 1.50, but the only thing that was addressed in the update according to Asrock, was something to do with the network. Made no difference to this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers that I've tried have all worked fine. I've never had any issues of yellow exclamation marks in device manager after installing any of them. Device manager reports that the devices are working correctly all the time. All my other devices seem
 to work fine in these USB ports too. Through my searching about the internet, I have also found reports of devices like the Occulus Rift not working with ASMedia USB 3.1 ports, along with some other things like eye tracking devices. I have submitted a tech
 support case to Asrock just in case they can shed any light on the issue, but I suspect they will not be able to. Unfortunately, there's no way to directly contact ASMedia.&nbsp;<br />
I don't know if this is a driver issue, or a Windows issue really, and given the camera shows me a perfect image in the Logitech Configuration app when plugged in to the ASMedia port, it leads me to think it's a Windows issue, but who knows. I find it strange
 that EVERY other app I try crashes when I switch resolutions, or alternatively, work without crashing when it's plugged in to the USB 3.0 ports, but the image looks terrible in EVERY app (including the Logitech config app).</p>

<h2>            How to speed up boot up.</h2>
                    I read that WIN XP was designed to boot up to a useable application within 30 seconds. My Intel 2.4 Gig processor XP computer with 2GB RAM takes in excess of 2 minutes and 30 seconds to get from a cold start to a point where I can use an application. I
 have done dskchk, sfc, defrag, declutter, etc. All I have on the machine is Norton Antivirus 2010, Spybot search and destroy, and System Mechanic.

            There's your problem:<br />
<br />
Norton Antivirus 2010, Spybot Search &amp; Destroy, and System Mechanic.<br />
<br />
<span>Some reasons for computer slowness:<br />
<br />
1. Computer hasn't been maintained - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Maintenance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Maintenance</a> <br />
<br />
2. Computer is infected with malware - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
3. Hard drive is too full. Remove unnecessary stuff, uninstall unused programs. Don't forget to back up!<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Backing_Up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Backing_Up</a>
<br />
<br />
4. Flaky third-party software. Toolbars and add-ons are particular culprits in this area. Uninstall toolbars (Google, Yahoo, ISP-branded, etc.) and look carefully at what add-ons are in use in your browser(s).<br />
<br />
5. Computer has too many unnecessary programs/processes running in the background. Manage your Startup:<br />
<br />
For XP - How to Troubleshoot By Using the Msconfig Utility in Windows XP - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310560" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/?id=310560</a> <br />
The free Autoruns program is very useful for managing your Startup - <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx</a> <br />
<br />
For Vista/Windows7 - Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: msconfig and when it appears in the Results box above, right-click and choose "Run as Administrator".
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a> is also very useful.<br />
<br />
6. User is running a bloated/invasive antivirus program such as ones from Norton and McAfee. Replace with a better program. I recommend either NOD32 (commercial) or Avast (free). Avira is also good but the free version has an unpleasant nag screen (Google for
 instructions as to how to disable this). User may also be running more than one real-time antivirus/firewall/security program.<br />
<br />
7. User has installed new programs that are processor and/or memory-intensive (Photoshop, AutoCAD, Mathmatica or the like) and doesn't have the necessary hardware power.<br />
<br />
8. Hard drive is failing and is in PIO Mode. This is very dramatically slow (like being back in 1985). See Hans-Georg Michna's information here -
<a href="http://winhlp.com/?q=node/10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winhlp.com/?q=node/10</a> <br />

<br />
And the 30-second thing is an ideal, not necessarily what happens in the Real World.

            Malkeleah,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I will respond to your comments in order.<br />
<br />
1. I believe I have maintained the computer. As stated in my question. I have run dskchk, seagate's hard drive check, sfc, memcheck, and reinstalled System mechanic several times in an effort to clear the problem. I use System Mechanic and the MIcrosoft Accessories
 programs frequently to clear out clutter and insure that the registry is consistent.<br />
<br />
2. I don't believe I have a malware infection in that I have run Spybot several times with clear results. The system appears to run normally once boot up is finally attained.<br />
<br />
3. I have at least 30GB of hard drive free space on the C drive and 70GB of free space on the E drive.<br />
<br />
4. There is one non Microsoft Mahjong game and&nbsp; no other non microsoft programs on the C drive other than those mentioned.<br />
<br />
5. No applications are shown to be running using task manager during start up.<br />
<br />
6. I have a second computer,&nbsp; useing WinXP home also&nbsp;and has many more applications installed,&nbsp;which runs and has installed System Mechanic, Norton Anti Virus, and Spybot Search and Destroy. This computer boots in well less than a minute. I am trying to figure
 out why my problem computer takes so much longer to boot with&nbsp;only a small subset of the same programs.<br />
<br />
7. See item 6 above. I haven't installed any other programs. BTW, I was running AVG free antivirus prior to removing it to try Norton anti virus in order to try to more closely match the computer that doesn't have the start up problem.<br />
<br />
8. Dskchk and Seagate's hard drive check software both say the hard drive is fine.<br />
<br />
I do not expect to boot up in precisely 30 seconds or less. But I do think that, given the few programs I have installed, 2 minutes and 30 seconds plus is over long for boot up.<br />
<br />
<br />

            Turn off your computer, turn it back on, and start hitting the F8 key as soon as you see the BIOS screen. When the screen asking you how to boot comes up, choose the option "Enable boot logging". When Windows starts, go the the C:\Windows directory, and
 open ntbootlog.txt. You will probably find that Windows is trying to load something unsuccessfully. If it is a hardware driver, it can be a pain to fix. But post the content of ntbootlog.txt, and I'll try to help as much as I can.

            You completely missed the point. You have some invasive, system-hogging programs starting with Windows. The fact that those programs work well on another machine is irrelevant. Different hardware and drivers are involved. If you are insistent on using
 System Mechanic, etc. (not recommended by me), then you need to <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span>
</em>turn on boot logging as suggested by "TomJuan" but instead do clean-boot troubleshooting. You also need to look at what is connected to the computer (USB devices) since some computers are slow with USB devices like external hard drives/printers are connected.
 Also think about what Windows is looking for at startup. Mapped drives or network printers that no longer exist can do this. Look in Event Viewer to see if anything is failing, retrying, failing, timing out.<br />

            I agree with Malkeleah ... also about the USB part. As an example I can mention my canon scanner. If connected it increases my boot time with approx 20-30 seconds.

<p>That message signaled the end of my attempt to install the upgrade to Adobe Acrobat 7.1.0 Professional.&nbsp; Prior to that (for about a week) I had two less serious problems with the Adobe program.&nbsp; Every time I selected anything on the start menu ("Control
 Panel", or "My Computer" are two examples), I would have to sit through one or two or even three back to back sets of "Please wait while Windows configures Adobe" followed by "Please wait while Windows installs Adobe".&nbsp; Windows was getting way too busy.&nbsp; The
 Adobe programs always worked great.&nbsp; Even this past week, in spite of Adobe letting me know several times per day that "Adobe is unable to locate a resource in (the folder in the title)" the program (Adobe) wouldn't completely bomb out for the most part, instead
 it would valiantly struggle with the cantankerous operating system (Windows XP Professional), and pretty much get the job done.</p>
<p>But horrors came soon enough.&nbsp; When I tried to open a word document that I had worked on just the previous week, I got the totally rude "(Path name) is not accessible.&nbsp; Access is Denied"&nbsp; I tried to deal with being suddenly locked out of that folder by using
 the 'turn off simple file sharing/take ownership of the folder' fix for Documents folders that get seized by the system during a conversion to XP.&nbsp; But that didn't work.&nbsp; This computer came brand new equipped with XP 3 years ago.&nbsp; the only thing I did recently
 that could possibly have precipitated&nbsp; this disaster was installing Netgear to facilitate a change in internet access.&nbsp; I have uninstalled Netgear now but the chaos remains.&nbsp; I also disabled Windows firewall but that didn't help either.</p>
<p>I hope someone knows how to recover that folder, called "Documents", because a lot of what I get paid for is (hopefully) there.&nbsp; Fortunately, most of my work is in the "My Documents" folder that wasn't caught up in the glitch, and has now been backed up.</p>
<p>One more detail. The folder "Documents" used to be called "Shared Documents", and had 20 or so documents and a few subfolders (like "Jeff's Documents") but now claims to contain zero bytes. Can this be correct?&nbsp; Where is all my hours, days, and weeks of
 work that I thought was safely tucked away in that folder?</p>

<h2>            Removing a program in safe mode</h2>
                    After replacing XP with Windows 8 on my laptop, I was re-installing some apps and drivers, one of which was Toshiba Power Saver. I got a message that said Power Saver in incompatible followed by a fatal error. I tried to remove it from Add/Remove programs,
 but that resulted in another fatal error message. Now, each time I log onto my computer desktop&nbsp;I get the fatal error warning. Two attempts at System Restore, one with my Norton disabled, also failed to resolve the problem.&nbsp; I read on line that the only way
 to remove Power Saver is in Safe Mode, but there does not appear to be a Safe Mode&nbsp;in W8 that I can find.&nbsp; I don't have a whole lot invested yet and might consider reloading Windows from scratch. How hard would that be from my ISO disk? Everything else is
 running good except the annoying fatal error message every time I open the desktop. Any suggestions would be immensely appreciated.

Problem solved. Just re-installed os using ISO disk burned when I downloaded Windows 8.</p>

<p>Okay, there has to be a way to do this!</p>
<p>How do you get rid of uninstalled program icons that were put in the "notification area icons"?</p>
<p>I change my virus software from AVG to MS security essentials and AVG did a great job of removing all traces of itself except for the notification area icons. There has to be a way of controlling what icons get put in there?</p>

<h3> needsmesomehelp&#58;&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Am no longer allowed to personalize my gamer pic</h2>
                    I would like to know if anyone has any knowledge of issues regarding not being able to upload a personal picture for their gamerpic on the xbox one app. Personally it says that “because of your past behavior, you can’t upload custom images” it then linked
 me to the enforcement.xbox.com link, yet it says I haven’t done anything wrong. I haven’t ever run into any issues with xbox regarding my behavoir nor does it say anything on my account info for that link that puts me in a position where I can no longer upload
 a personal gamerpic. I know it isn’t a huge issue but if anyone could help, I’d greatly appreciate it!&nbsp;

<p>You can only request a review on what is considered to be an "active" case.&nbsp; At some point you should have been sent an email regarding an action against your account and in that would have been the why.&nbsp; If you violated to TOS for a gamer pic enforcement
 can set it so you can no longer post a custom picture.&nbsp; In other words somewhere in the past you or your account was flagged and you cannot update your gamer pic to a custom one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these forum we cannot work around any enforcement action only provide advice.&nbsp; If you think this is indeed in error then you will have to try and work thru a support rep either by chat or requesting a call back.</p>

            Actually, well, I wanted to make sure it was blocking me from doing the same thing on my actual xbox and when I went to do so, it allowed me to change my gamerpic to a personal one. So then I logged out of the xbox app and logged back in and it worked
 again... Don’t know why this happened but sorry to have of bothered you with this haha. Thank you for trying to help though!

<p>For some time I have downloaded music from Amazon, with the files going direct to Windows Media Player in WMA format. The last half dozen of downloads have suddenly appeared in MP3 format and when burnt to disc they will not play on my Sony CD system, which
 most definitely should play MP3. However, the burned disc WILL play on my car CD system. How can I get the Amazon downloads back to downloading in WMA format, which is brilliant for all my uses</p>

<p>OK, problem solved. The Auto Play dialogue box was not appearing and appears to have 'locked' into data CD option. When I tried to burn, the CD was not closing and ejecting automatically so I had to eject manually. Sometimes using a power off to get the
 CD to eject, often leaving me with a blank disc, although all indications were that the burn had taken place. &nbsp;All settings now set to default all working fine. Many thanks to all who contributed and offered help and advice.</p>

    <title>GROUP POLICY EDITOR HELP WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> king of eng1and  say:</h3>
<h2>            GROUP POLICY EDITOR HELP WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 64bit Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed to toggle windows features which can be done via Group Policy Editor but my system didn't come with it pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used this guide to install it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.itechtics.com/enable-gpedit-windows-10-home/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed it to a T, and got the MMC plugin error. I followed the next section and installed and ran the additional .bat files and it solved nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I saw they had another method on here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.itechtics.com/easily-enable-group-policy-editor-gpedit-msc-in-windows-10-home-edition/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran this installer and MMC appeared to work correctly, appeared. Changing any of the group policies didn't actually have any effect on my system whatsoever. I was unable to disable Cortana with it and had to use a regedit script. After then I forgot about
 it but today windows has been hassling me with intrusive update messages and installing the update caused further issues I didn't want, so I wanted to use GPedit to modify Windows behaviour on how updates work, but despite editing policies nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried various installers, one from here: </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.askvg.com/how-to-enable-group-policy-editor-gpedit-msc-in-windows-7-home-premium-home-basic-and-starter-editions/</p>
<p>
</p><p>and after no success I tried going back to the itechtics methods. I am unable to run the very first method now however, as part of that method involves pasting grouppolicy folders and gpedit.msc into the system32 folder, which WIndows will not let me do.
 Even if I change the owner of System32 to my username, it still does not let me have full control and just generates a brand new error when you get past the previous one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My GPedit went back to having the MMC error and upon running the other 2 installers in random order several more times what I am left with is GPedit with missing "administrative templates" now missing. Some of them are still there, but most are gone somewhere.
 Also where as the icon for software &amp; windows settings are modern, the icon for administrative templates is different and looks old (like an older version of Windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running in CMD "regsvr32 gptext.dll" and though the message I get is its been successful, nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't know where to go from here. I have no idea if policies changed in GPedit will actually have any effect, but in order to test it, I need the "Administrative Templates" folders restored back to their former selves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            blocking emails with .info addresses</h2>
                    This is a hotmail question: &nbsp;I got a virus in May, am now getting almost a dozen emails a day from strange addresses. &nbsp;Most of the addresses are *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;I've gone into the blocker and have cut and pasted everything from the @...on but the combinations
 I'm still getting seem endless; I tried to block @*.info but it wouldn't take it. &nbsp;Is there a way I can block anything with a .info address?

    <title>Ran SFC &#47;Scannow and found unfixable corrupt files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psyko12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ran SFC &#47;Scannow and found unfixable corrupt files&#63;</h2>
                    I ran sfc /scannow and was advised that Windows Resource Protection had found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them and the reference given was "C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log".<br />
<br />
So opening the log file from note pad I tried to manually search for strings with "cannot repair" but found zero. So how come it reports as such and cannot find the files within it's log that are corrupted.<br />
<br />
Also tried this http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833 article referred to me by a forum member on my previous query but that did not also show the files in question. It produced a 0 byte txt file "sfcdetails".<br />
<br />
I hope I don't really have corrupt files.<br />
<br />
If it helps I'll attach the cbs.log file or paste it here.<br />
<br />
http://www.mediafire.com/?0yynm2tzb4o &gt; this is the log..... <br />
<br />
Wish somebody could check it out for me<br />

</span></span></span><span><span>If the above step does not resolve the issue, then you need to perform In-place upgrade:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Warning: Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) Start the computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Insert the Windows 7 DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray. Wait for the Setup program to start automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) If the Setup program does not start automatically, click Start, type Drive:\setup.exe in the Start Search box, and then
 press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note In this step, Drive is the drive letter of the computer’s DVD drive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4) When the "Install now" screen appears, click Install now.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: When you receive the Get important updates for installation message, do not click Go Online.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5) Click Upgrade when the ‘Which type of installation do you want’ screen appears.

</span>If Windows 7 is now running on your computer, you have completed the upgrade to Windows 7.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

I've tried several fixes but I can't seem to solve the issue, including replacing 'rundll32.exe'.<br />
<br />
Is there any way someone could guide me through several different steps to try and solve my problem please ? It'd be much appreciated.

<p><span>Keep the computer on a clean boot and check for the issue status. If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem. Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
 After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please go through step 3 of the Kb to keep the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: </strong></span></p>
<p><span>Turn off Data Execution Prevention (DEP).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Another reason Rundll32 has stopped working can be popping up is if you have DEP running. DEP is a feature of Windows XP SP2 and Vista that prevents programs from running if it thinks there could be a problem.</span></p>
<p><span>You can turn off DEP by going to the command prompt and typing in the following command:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the start menu type CMD and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>b. Right-click on the command prompt and select “RUN AS ADMINISTRATOR”</span></p>
<p><span><span>c<strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></span><strong>bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOff</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Reboot and see if the problem has gone away!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: Turn on the DEP once you check the issue status.</span></p>
<p><span>Use “bcdedit.exe /set {current} nx AlwaysOn” to turn on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Turn off thumbnails in Folder Options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are having this problem when viewing pictures or videos in Windows Explorer, you can try one more thing.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Go to My Computer and click on Tools and then Folder Options. On the View tab, check the Always show icons, never thumbnails box.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, I would request you to reply us with troubleshooting result to assist you further, we’ll be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;obedbanegas</p>
<p>
</p><p>What have you tried for solutions? Are you able to sign in at all? You can try clearing the MAC address and if that doesn't work you may have to factory reset the console keeping games and apps.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi there,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Without knowing more about the issue, I would suggest the following:</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>1. Turn off the console and unplug it for 30 seconds. This clears cache.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>2. If the games are on disc check this page:
</span></span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/disc-error</span></span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>3. If the games are digital please remove and redownload your account:
</span></span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one</span></span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>4. Finally, please do a factory reset keeping games and apps, as this refreshes the
 entire console from many problems:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Info &amp; Updates &gt; Reset console &gt; "keep games and apps".
 (requires account redownload).</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Side Note:
</span></span><span><span>It is
</span></span><span><span>v</span></span><span><span>ery
 important to make sure you know the primary email/password to the account before removing it from the console</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>To check the email being used with the gamertag, go to
</span></span><span><span>Settings &gt; Account &gt; sign-in, security &amp; passkey;</span></span><span><span>in
 middle column at the top it will say "</span></span><span><span>show on home</span></span><span><span>"
 if it is checked it will rotate from gamertag and email on homepage. If it is not check marked, it will show in this box.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p><span><span>Thanks, we hope to hear back!</span></span></p>
