<h2>            Cannot access wifi airplane mode and hot spot</h2>
                    <p>My Wi-Fi setting will not turn on. I enter "Settings", slide it to "on" then when I exit settings it is resetting to "off". I am in an area of many hotspots and my machine recognizes none. I cannot figure what I did to cause this. I do note that under Airplane
 mode I do not have any option for "on/off" which is perplexing. I can scroll down to Airplane mode but the information box to the right is totally blank. this makes me think that the machine is in airplane mode and neutralizing the wi-fi option, but I just
 cannot tell.</p>
<p>The machine had been in the wi-fi mode running fine between msn and aol then suddenly lost signal.</p>
<p>It does not appear to be my hotspot because my other machine is accessing the signal just fine, and accessing applications without difficulty.</p>
<p>I have considered doing a refresh to 24 hrs ago but was curious if anyone else has encountered this and has a solution.</p>
<p>Operating on Windows 10 Home edition</p>

<h2>            Automatic Sleep timer doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Both the Settings page and the Control Panel are set to turn off the screen after 10 minutes and put the PC to sleep in 30. But it never goes to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why are there two different places to control this, and they can conflict? One doesn't override the other as far as I can tell, so which one *actually* is supposed to control what's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Why do neither of them work for me? PC stays on indefinitely regardless of what these are set to do.</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center screen is frozen due to pop ups. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> glendaneedshelp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center screen is frozen due to pop ups.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Background.</strong> &nbsp;I use Windows Media Centre to record my TV shows and watch them later. &nbsp;when turn on my system, the list of my recording is up. For years, I need to clear a regular pop up as the system thinks it has not had a clear Chanel signal
 and may not have recorded the programs. &nbsp;This annoying pop up is often wrong as the program has recorded successfully. the pop up is; 'No TV Signal' with the option to select 'Recorded TV 'or 'Cancel' I just click on 'Recorded tv' several times to clear this
 pop up. &nbsp;When it appears, it automatically locks the screen and the mouse won't select, until it is cleared..... &nbsp;No problem, until tonight. &nbsp;<strong>My problem</strong><strong>is; When I was clearing the normal several Pop Ups, with clicking on "Recorded
 TV," as usual, the screen froze by making a loud buzzing and jumping a bit,&nbsp;it then remains frozen because I can't clear the pop up because it has frozen the screen. A catch 22 . I can move the mouse onscreen but it won't select. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>I am using a computer
 tower connected to a TV I use the tv as the computer screen. &nbsp;I use a small air mouse with a mini keyboard. &nbsp;I don't want to turn off the computer tower because I know I won't be able to access when switched back on, it until the screen is unfrozen because
 it won't allow the mouse to click to select. The mouse does move but is locked out from operation by the frozen screen.
<strong>&nbsp;Please, Is then some way I can force the 'No Signal 'pop up to leave the screen?</strong> I don't have a keyboard to plug in. Microsoft don't support this product anymore so won't help. I need some bright person to help me troubleshoot this problem
 please help.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when the program is not working properly.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can try closing the program from the Task Manager and then reopen it. To close the program from Task Manager
 follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on empty space on the Task bar.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select Task Manager.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click on Windows Media Center and select End task.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Restart Windows Media Center and check if it freezes again.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p><span>You can also try updating the monitor drivers and check if that helps. To update the monitor drivers please
 refer the steps from the article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-10-update-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps.

<h2>            Family Safety doesn&#39;t block websites when immediately opening Internet Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Family Safety loophole!? Needs fixing please!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned on Family Safety and blocked all websites (except those that I allow) on my 11 year old's laptop running Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The security works great and blocks all websites...&nbsp; EXCEPT -&nbsp;If I boot the PC and log&nbsp;into his account and go immediatelt to Internet Explorer via the desktop (while Windows is starting up), it appears that Internet Explorer runs before Family Safety starts
 working.&nbsp; Once I have Internet Explorer open using this method, I can go to&nbsp;ANY site that I want and Family Security does NOT block&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, opening Internet Explorer during the boot process also appears to keep Family Safety from starting for as long as&nbsp;Internet Explorer is open.&nbsp; I can jump from site to site and use any links,&nbsp;until I close Internet Explorer; at which time Family
 Safety kicks in and starts working.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Can someone confirm this loophole?</p>
<p>If it does exist, then it doesn't do much for web blocking - is there any chance for&nbsp;a fix Microsoft?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not post this under the Internet Explorer, as I believe it to be a loophole with Family Safety.&nbsp; I did not verify whether this trick works with other browsers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Because this is a Family Safety Security issue the thread has been moved to the Family Safety<br />
Forum. <br />
<br />
This thread has also been escalated to the Microsoft Moderators due to the security involved.<br />

            <p>Hi Herb Jones,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting back. We tried to replicate the issue but we didn't encounter what you had described. Can you verify&nbsp;how long does it take for Family Safety&nbsp;to block the websites on Internet Explorer&nbsp;on startup (ex. 10 seconds after&nbsp;startup of PC,
 you open Internet Explorer and Family Safety will then block the websites).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, we request you to replicate the issue, then while&nbsp;Internet Explorer&nbsp;is open, go to
<strong>Task Manager</strong> (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) &gt; <strong>Details</strong> &gt; Check if
<strong>WPCMON.exe</strong> is running. After that, close Internet Explorer, then check if
<strong>WPCMON.exe</strong> is now running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, kindly provide us a&nbsp;screen shot of the <strong>Start-up </strong>
tab on Task manager then upload it in the private message area. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
To view it, be sure that you are signed in to Microsoft Community and click the notification

<p>I have received 4 emails just now as receipt for 4&nbsp; payments. I am not aware that I have made 4 monthly requests. When I tried to open the emails I could not.</p>
<p>Will you please delete the 3 payments.</p>
<p>I have tried your virtual assistant but it did not read what I wrote and the answers were rubbish. Most annoying.</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open your Internet Explorer 10 from the Start screen, go to your Outlook.com account and login, then at the bottom bar of Internet Explorer look to the right for the push pin icon. When you select it it gives a choice of Pin to Start or Add to Favorites,
 just select Pin to Start, it may ask you to confirm an Outlook Tile, select Pin to Start. That adds&nbsp;the Tile that says Outlook to the Start screen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, if you use your Microsoft account from that Outlook.com account to login to the Surface, you'll automatically be logged in when you access the account from the Tile on the Start screen.
</p>
<p>If you access your People and Calendar from Outlook.com, you can pin those to the Start screen too.

<h2>            Where is the download history for 360 online&#63;</h2>
                    There used to be a place on xbox.com to find the download history for the 360 and add those downloads back into my download queue remotely from the website. The support page for this still links to&nbsp;https://live.xbox.com/download/history but that redirects
 to an updated page which shows zero history for the 360 (and in fact only allows users to choose Xbox One and PC history)...

            I think if you go through your xbox 360 there is an option in system or settings under download history.

            Yeah; I know that it's on the console. I wanted to check it online with the issues currently affecting downloading content right now. That way I would know for sure that it was showing up. MSFT says they are still supporting the 360, but they keep taking
 stuff away and not updating the support pages. :(

<p>Yeah, I know. It's the other half of the reason that I wanted to use the website. It's so much easier to just use CTRL+F and type what I'm looking for then to scroll trough mini pages of content on the console.</p>

            I don't know. At first it was just glitchy because it showed up for some and not for other, then they just completely removed it. It was so much easier to use than the console though. :(

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />If you’re unable to hear audio, there are some things you can try. First, check if the volume is turned down or muted.
<br />
<br />If you have recently upgraded to Windows 10, your previous audio driver might not be compatible. Uninstalling and reinstalling your audio device might resolve the issue. Press Windows Key + X and click Device Manager. Then expand Sound &gt; video and game controller. Select your audio device, right-click it and Uninstall. Restart your computer and let Windows redetect it. You can also check Windows Update for the latest drivers for your sound card.
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, try running the Troubleshooting audio playback fix it.

            <p>I, like you, had the exact same problem. &nbsp;I have spent hours trying to solve this and eventually found the answer to the broken picture syndrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the programme itself go to Tools/Options/Display and untick the box "Image Progressive Rendering" click "apply" then click "OK".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally I have the compatibility set to Windows 7 and all tools work OK. &nbsp;Hope this may help.</p>

            Thanks a lot Graham. I had suffered that problem since years with several computers (others worked well) and I didn't want to leave Picture Publisher, one of my firsts and favorite programs (it came as bundle when I bought the scanner for my AMSTRAD 8086).

    <title>Finding a download for Windows 7 Professional 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgs101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Finding a download for Windows 7 Professional 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>This topic has been addressed in older posts.&nbsp; But the location for the download does not exist anymore (Digital river).&nbsp; MS has Win 7, but I couldn't find Win 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:&nbsp; I bought a floor model computer installed with Win7 Pro 64 bit several years ago, but didn't get a disk with it.&nbsp; I made a recovery disk (which isn't working now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had weird stuff going on with the program for about a year, so decided to make the change to Win 10 Pro.&nbsp; During the process of online help sessions, I was told to do a hard reboot.&nbsp; Now I have a blue screen of death -- prettier than in the past, but
 still gone.&nbsp; So now, I've been told to do a total reload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the product key, and MS assures me that it's legal.&nbsp; So what do I do now?&nbsp; I can't go to Win 10 until I get Win 7 up and running again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Your options are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Request recovery media directly from the manufacturer of the computer.</p>
<p>- Borrow a Windows 7 Professional 64 bit disc and use that with COA product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

<h2>            My Xp games will work on Vista&#63;</h2>
                    I'm old adult &nbsp;&amp; play at a site that is the largest FPS area TOURNAMENT for BF2...no one uses Vista due to all the probs and we have 1000's of members from all over the world . We play 12 hour battles every weekend Noon 'til midnight. Why is
<br />
this better for my 'safety'? to use Vista. ? +13,000 people went to EA for help &amp; it does't work. +3000 tried the 'fix'.<br />
&nbsp;We have MS employees that play with us &amp; they use XP Pro.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; This public net game still has many thousands&nbsp; daily-this always happens with a new OS -at least since I been here since<br />
win3.1...ain't life a ****.<br />

            Stick a fork in XP, it's done. I started gaming when Pong was a table sized game at the pool hall. Bill Gates still wore short pants and a "portable" computer was one that only needed 4 guys to move. There are a few games that won't run on Vista, heck,
 there were games that wouldn't run on XP. Remember the old Starwars series, where you flew X wings and other space ships, Wing Commander? Those didn't work on XP. hey had to redesign Solitaire when the pentium processors came out. Computers change, both hardware
 and software. If you wish to stay back in the last century so you can play one game, by all means do so, but don't blame it on an operating system that idiots read a bad review about the beta version 3 years ago and decided (without ever using it) was bad.
 Vista works great. Win7 works even better from what I'm told. If you want to play BF 2 and nothing else the rest of your life that's cool. Enjoy. Personally I like to move on, try new things. Many of the clans I see on the COD servers started with BF or BF2
 or even before that. Some still have their BF servers. Ever play with any DiG (Doorman is God) members or on the DiG servers? Try some new games, you might even like them. You aren'tstill using that 386 computer that ran your 3.1 are you?<br />
<br />
But anyways, very few of my games do not work with Vista. The ones that don't are due to the arrogance of the company that designed them, not Vista. Kind of like the Creative Soundblaster sound cards. They don't work because they won't write drivers for them.
 Why don't they write drivers for them? Because they want you to buy 'new" stuff. A guy known online as "DanielK" wrote drivers for Creative cards so that they worked fully with Vista, he was threatened with law suits by Creative rather than being thanked.
 Creative went so far as to write script that detected Vista and DIDSABLED features in the sound cards, effectively crippling their own product DELIBERATELY so you would have to buy "new" stuff.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I were you and thinking of making the switch to a newer and better technology, I would wait the few months until Win7 came out. Not because there is something "wrong" with Vista, but because I feel it will be supported longer than Vista. I got
 Vista when I built this computer over a year ago and have not had any major problems. Considering I use the 64bit version so I can run my games with 8GB's of RAM that is saying something, fewer products support the 64 bit version of Vista or XP even than the
 32 bit versions. I still haven't found a patch for my KOTOR II though I hear someone has been working on one...........<br />

            I've used Windows Vista full time since Beta 2, and I do a fair bit of gaming.&nbsp; Most "probs" are with 3rd party software and can be worked around.<br />
<br />
Out of my collection of PC games, going back to the mid 90s.&nbsp; I haven't come across one that can't be made to work with Windows Vista, sure some require compatibility mode, and some require administrative rights.<br />
<br />
The same stuff was&nbsp;said when Windows XP came out&nbsp;- which was much worse than Windows Vista on launch for gamers.&nbsp; 3dfx had only a few months before gone under and so many gamers were left without video drivers, the GeForce 3 had just been released, but the
 drivers didn't stablize for a good year after release.&nbsp; The system requirements for Windows XP was also a considerable jump up from Windows 98 (which most gamers used at the time), the minium RAM for Windows XP was 4 times greater than an operating system
 which had only been released a couple of years earlier.

<h2>            Windows update broke almost every application i use on a daily basis.</h2>
                    <p>So i updated windows 10 last night, came back to my computer this morning only to find that the applications i use on a daily basis now crash instantly, run at a fraction of the previous speed/smoothness or crash a few minutes into using the application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had a windows update screw me over this badly before. I'd really appreciate some assistance from any admins to get my system working to it's full potential once again. I don't want to have to re-install windows in order to solve this as it's a
 huge hassle and the fault of the software update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />If the following KBs are are installed, right click then uninstall the recent update since this problem started. 
<br />
<br />If it was a recent feature update such as the new Windows 10 1803, then I suggest you rollback.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            First very sorry this happened to you.
<br />Best then to rollback the update.
<br />Try this method.
<br />
<br />Go to start - settings - update and security - recovery - Go back to the previous version of Windows 10 and click Get started.
<br />Select No when it asks you to check for updates.
<br />
<br />Once the rollback is done then make sure you are not connected to the internet or it will try and update then block it ASAP.
<br />See link below on how to do that.

<h2>            External USB drive is not accessible</h2>
                    Same problem but let me add that one hard drive will work in the USB adapter fine, and another will not.<br />
The second is a new Western Digital, maybe needs formatting, but I can't see it in My Computer to do that.<br />
I had the same problem with a 1 TeraB drive and passed that to another, and got a 120 GB.<br />
Get the message drive is ready, but no drive shows.<br />
checked the driver in device manger and the drive shows " JMicron HDD USB Device".<br />
Did the same thing in a Win 7 home premium PC, and a new Win 8.<br />
<br />
I know the SATA USB adapter works because I just put a Samsung 40 GB system drive in it and it shows immediately with data.
<br />
<br />
The WD drive came with a jumper and a sign saying jumpers are not needed. I tried it both ways.<br />
<br />
So this is a generic problem with MS.<br />
<br />

            This is not a simple problem.<br />
The drive is 200 gb, and where a 160 gb drive will format, the 200 gb will not be "shown" so as to format.<br />
In the case of the 160, I used a WIN98 start-up floppy and Win 98 disc to setup up partitions. That sets E: partition and a F: partition, but on the screen teh F: was not formatable, in XP HP Compaq.<br />
The 136gb was NTFS formatable. <br />
<br />
So stick it in an IDE USB box and the Win 7 PC will format both E: and F:, and in fact, I formatted F: as FAT32. Oddly my Win98 PC can see and use the F:
<br />
I could not format F: in the XP Pro machine.<br />
<br />
But the 200gb apparently exceeds some kind of limit or is not recognizable by the bios.<br />
The funny thing is I labelled that drive NTFS I/13/2013 when I had a Dell XP Pro, in INK on the drive face.<br />
<br />
Obviously it's been FDISK 'ed, and partitoned, by me.<br />
Put it in a USB box and it is sensed but not shown as a drive on the screen, in HP Compac XP Pro, or HP Win7 home premium, AMD64.
<br />
<br />
Not a question of USB port, or jumper setting.<br />
<br />
Not a big deal, just curious.<br />
<br />

    <title>after upgrading from windows 7 to 8.1 audio cards are not supported - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cristian tarcea  say:</h3>
<h2>            after upgrading from windows 7 to 8.1 audio cards are not supported</h2>
                    <p>Hello ! I have a big problem after upgrading my pc and windows to 8.1 from 7. It seems like no audio cards are supported , as I tried with my TC Studio Konnekt 48 on Firewire , a Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 on USB and a MOTU 828 MKIII Hybrid on USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting audio glitches or dropouts or loosing the connection between the Audio Devices and Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these Audio Devices failed to work with my Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>It seems like they loose somehow the connection. My TC Studio Konnekt has a little icon that shows " DAW - Locked" when working and connected, and "DAW - NO LOCK" when it's not working and somehow didn't manage to "LOCK" to the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have audio dropouts , glitches and pops with the Scarlett 18i20 inside all of the DAWs (Fl Studio , CUBASE 5 , ETC) , and even on youtube or while simply listening to a song inside media player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>VLC player doesn't work at all , and if it does , the audio of any video is disastrous. full of glitches. Windows Media player plays the video for a while (10 seconds) and after , the video stops and the TC Studio Konnekt shows "DAW - NO LOCK" (The firewire
 led is still on as the audio device is still connected to the pc BUT SOMEHOW loses the connection with the OS).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried a MOTU 828 MKIII as I thought is my Audio Device the problem and the drivers , but it seems like the problem is from the OS. I have the same issues with any of these audio cards EVEN if I tried to make firewire work in legacy mode , and updating
 all the drivers for audio cards or downgrading to an older driver , I still have the issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S : I've also disabled the integrated audio card from the motherboard from BIOS , and the HDMI from the Video Card is also disabled , so no conflicts should occurred..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a big problem as I CANNOT WORK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone knows the problem ? I've had NO ISSUES with Windows 7 with ANY AUDIO CARD , no dropouts , no losing connection , no glitches or pops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my main question is : why does windows 8.1 rejects somehow , and loses connection with the audiocards , or doesn't properly play/work ? Is there a way to solve this problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !!&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Cristian,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sound problems can be caused by cables that aren't connected properly, damaged drivers, incompatible drivers, sound settings, missing updates, and problems with your sound card.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li><li><span>Is there any exclamation mark or error in device manager under sound card?
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run the audio troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might be able to solve some problems by running a troubleshooter that will automatically fix some common issues with audio.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;&nbsp; a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Press Windows key + C on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Type Troubleshooting and click Troubleshooting under Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Now select Find and Fix Problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select Troubleshoot Audio Playback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Follow the prompted steps to troubleshoot this issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to install the latest version of audio card drivers for windows 8.1 from the manufacturer website. If the manufacturer has not released compatible Windows 8.1 audio card drivers you can check for any lower version
 of sound card drivers. And install the sound drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also try running the Windows Updates and install all the available updates including the optional driver and firmware updates.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your fast reply !&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I've tried everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows sees everything as working fine. Tried latency checkers for audio problems.. No visual visible problems showed , ONLY in TC Studio Konnekt 48's Menu where the DAW seems to be NO LOCK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom made PC by me :</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 5820k&nbsp;</p>
<p>32 GB DDR4 2133 mHz</p>
<p>ASUS X99 A</p>
<p>Crucial 512 GB SSD</p>
<p>2 x 3 TB WDD Black</p>
<p>1 TB WDD Blue</p>
<p>Corsair RM750</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything , including the process of installing the drivers in Compatibility Mode.</p>
<p>There's a problem deep inside the OS. Maybe the Audio Drivers of Windows..&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other PC has Windows 7 and works like a charm , but I really do not want to make a downgrade and install everything again on the new pc that has Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I've tried the Troubleshooter and nothing to solve with it. :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice ? Any fixes that could come soon or maybe exists but I don't know about them ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The sound card is from TC ELECTRONIC - TC Studio Konnekt 48 (Firewire)</p>
<p>The high definition audio device shows error as I disabled it and uninstalled as I do not need it.</p>
<p>For the sound card I'm currently using the 2.5v driver installed in W7 compatibility mode as the latest driver doesn't work at all...</p>
<p>At least this one gives me a 20-30 minutes of work in DAW then crashes.. so still not a good thing.</p>

            <p>Is there any possibility to replace windows 8.1's audio direct sound drivers/registry/etc , with those from windows 7 ? It seems like it's a problem with the new Windows 8.1 reconstructed audio interface/directsound drivers , etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried mostly everything and it still doesn't work..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking on moving back to Windows 7 64 bit.. as W 8.1 seems to be a bit of a junk when it comes to Pro Audio Equipment or anything that stands for Audio applications at all.. Disappointing..</p>

<p>because the more wrestlers you have at one time takes away from the polygons that can be used, thats why you can only do 3 on 3 matches. &nbsp;Yukes have tried to up it, but had said that the more wrestlers you start adding the worse looking the graphics got,
 because of how much it would take to put ten in one match.</p>

<p>Well that's depressing info hopefully they find a way to do it on the Xbox One, cause I wanna do matches like The Shield and The Brothers of Destruction vs Evolution and HBK or do DX and The Shield vs The Rock,Stone Cold,John Cena,Hulk Hogan and Randy Orton.
 I just got so many matches in mind hopefully in the future they will know how to make it look nice and fun to play and what your saying makes perfect sense cause The Royal Rumble match looks ok not that great cause of all of the wrestlers are almost all bumping
 into each other every few seconds.</p>

<h2>            How can I legally download Windows Vista 64-bit Home Premium DVD ISO&#63;</h2>
                    


Hey guys, 



     I'm really good about being completely on the up-and-up with my software. I buy all my software, never pirate anything, not MP3s, nothing. I have personally purchased several copies of Windows 7, have all my keys, as well as the CDs. However, I have a Dell M1530 laptop that I recently installed Windows 7 on. Since I got a new computer, I am going to use that license and put it on my new machine. I HAVE a license key for Windows Vista 64-bit Home Premium, and I'd like to install that on my laptop. However, I don't have the original media. Is there any way I can legally download from microsoft the Windows Vista ISO CDs? 



I found something on torrent, but then had to download a torrent downloader which was taking forever, not to mention that it installed a TON of **** on my machine. I had to spend about 30 minutes uninstalling toolbars, disabling services, and all kinds of other **** and then ran Malwarebytes and AVG a few times. 



I just want to download the OEM ke

            <p>Never mind, I had to torrent it. I ended up downloading uTorrent and downloading a copy of the original DELL OEM DVD. Frustrating. Dell should offer the ability to download these ISOs if you can supply your valid key (on a web form)&nbsp;from the sticker on the
 computer case or media folder.</p>

<div>Here are the usual methods to resolve this issue:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>
