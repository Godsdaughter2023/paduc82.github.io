            Hi Nils, sorry but a Windows 95 PC will not be able to handle Windows 10 . . .
<br />
<br />The hardware would not be string enough to run Windows 10 and even if it could, you would be unable to get Windows 10 device drivers for that PC!

            Windows 95?  Is your machine still running that version?  That's amazing.
<br />I would think that Windows 10 would not work on that machine at all.
<br />My guess it is not compatible.
<br />Take a look at the link by Andre Da Costa to see if your machine that is running Windows 95 is compatible with Windows 10.

<br />
<br />If it is then you will need to do a clean install not upgrade.

            It is technically possible, if the machine meets the minimum system requirements to run Windows 10 and supports modern hardware requirements, then, you should be able to install it.
<br />
<br />How will I know if my computer can run Windows 10?
<br />
<br />System requirements
<br />Processor:  1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC
<br />
<br />RAM:  1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
<br />Hard disk space:  16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS
<br />Graphics card:  DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver
<br />Display:  1024x600
<br />
<br />To install Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. 
<br />
<br />Once you have satisfied these requirements, there are only two options for installing WIndows 10:
<br />
<br />Option 1. A clean install - Windows 10 setup is incompatible with Windows 95, so you would have to boot from the install media, then perform a clean install:
<br />
<br />Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Perform a marathon upgrade:
<br />
<br />Step 1: upgrade from Windows 95 to Windows 2000 Professional or Windows 98 SE (if your end goal is to install a Home version of Windows 10).
<br />
<br />Step 2: upgrade from Windows 2000 Professional to Windows XP Professional (if you chose 98 SE, upgrade to Windows XP Home)
<br />
<br />Step 3: upgrade from Windows XP to Windows 7
<br />
<br />Step 4: Upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10
<br />
<br />As you might imagine, this is not guaranteed to work out perfectly. But if this is a fun project you just want to try out for experimental purposes, then these are your options.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, you should purchase a brand new laptop running Windows 10 Pro in 2018.

            Apologies for asking that. Mistakes can happen which is the reason why asked.
<br />Sorry, but that is not possible although try using Andre's instructions-the chances are still bleak.

<h2>            Upgrade Windows 7 to Windows 10 on HP ProBook laptop doesn&#39;t seem compatible at all.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;It was installing when it asked for me to uninstall the following:</p>
<p>HP Critical Device Access, HP File Sanitizer, HP Theft Recovery, and HP Drive Encription. I did get the File Sanitizer and Theft Recovery uninstalled, however I could not get the HP Critical Device Access or the HP Drive Encription uninstalled. When I would
 try to uninstall one it would say to disengage one before uninstalling the other, and the place to disengage the Drive Encription was nowhere to be found, a circle of frustration.</p>
<p>I finally had to stop and shut down the computer. When I started it up, the desktop was all distorted and there was no wireless internet. I had to do a System Restore to get back on the Internet to contact you for advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you suggest. Please be simple in your instructions, my patience is very thin.</p>
<p>Do I have to install Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Its a host of tools you have to uninstall related to HP's Protect Tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have to do is follow the on screen prompts, if it says HP Protect Device Access Manager, close out the uninstall wizard and look through the Programs and Featuees for that particular app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is a list of what you will need to remove:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have a pen and paper near by so you can uninstall whatever dependencies it ask you to remove first.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You cannot format a disk or partition that is currently in use, including the partition that contains Windows. This is a safety feature so that you cannot delete Windows by accident. To reformat your SD card, restart your computer and try to format.</div>
<div>Try connecting SD card to a different computer, backup the data and format the SD card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To format the G: try these steps.<br />
1. Open Computer.<br />
2. Right click on G: and Format.<br />
3. Select file type NTFS and click format.<br />
4. Click ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persists, connect the SD card to a different port and check its functionality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information on "Formatting disks and drives" check this link: <br />

    <title>Windows 10 Print to PDF file size and font embedding - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Print to PDF file size and font embedding</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Ent 64 Bit and we are using an ERP software that prints invoices to PDF files.</p>
<p>On Windows 8.1 the pdf files were 70 kb in file size.</p>
<p>Now on Windows 10 the pdf files are&nbsp;350 kb in file size. (5 x&nbsp;bigger)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows&nbsp;8.1 the ERP native pdf writer was&nbsp;used (AmyUni 4.5) which created 150 dpi files and uses font embedding.</p>
<p>On Windows 10 the Windows native Print to PDF writer is used which creates 600 dpi files and does not use font embedding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can uninstall the Print to PDF writer in Windows 10 but my ERP software use it's native pdf writer and throws an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a possibility to enable font embedding on the Windows PDF printer? I already found how to change the dpi settings using registry settings but can't seem to find the font embedding feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say that the Windows 10 PDF writer isn't very professional and is too basic. We create 100's of pdf files a day and now they take up 5 times more space then they used too. I am NOT amused :'(</p>
<p>

            I solved my problem.It seems that Windows 7 creates additonal partition of 100MB&nbsp;along with system partition.When I was reinstalling Windows 7 I formatted C drive but not that additional partition and maybe this caused conflicts.I installed the system
 again but I formatted both of these drives and it works normal again.Thanks anyway.

    <title>acer aspire one and windows 7 install problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rt22022  say:</h3>
<h2>            acer aspire one and windows 7 install problem</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a 32 bit acer aspire one tiny laptop in really great condition for $35.00
</p>
<p>the battery holds a charge , there are no use marks on it anywhere.</p>
<p>it does have a windows coa on it with a legible product key but the windows version is not readable ( it looks like it was washed off )</p>
<p>the laptop does not have an os installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the acer support website using the serial numbers located on the bottom of the case.</p>
<p>the only information that is displayed on the website is that the laptop was originally preloaded with ( windows 7 ) thats it</p>
<p>but there are many many versions of windows 7...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the place that I purchased the laptop from wiped the hard drive.</p>
<p>these acer hard drives have a restore partition on them that can be used to reset the laptop back to factory condition but
</p>
<p>there is nothing on the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another acer aspire one so I made a repair disk with it and tried to get some results with it.</p>
<p>nothing.</p>
<p>I also made a factory default backup on it and tried to use it on the other laptop</p>
<p>nothing</p>
<p>so ... I tried to use a msdn 32 bit win 7 ult n to see if it would accept a install of win 7 at all</p>
<p>but when I try to install a win 7 os I get </p>
<p>nothing&nbsp; </p>
<p>so I took the hard drive out and placed it in a external drive and formatted it in ntfs thinking that</p>
<p>the drive had some type of acer hidden code on it that prevented the install.</p>
<p>then tried to load win 7 again.</p>
<p>nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>the hard drive is capable of holding data I tested that out.</p>
<p>acer no longer sells restore media for this laptop.</p>
<p>microsoft no longer supports win 7 pre installs</p>
<p>a license was purchased at some point in time from microsoft by acer obviously and that license should still be good</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that there should be some way to use this laptop with win 7 but cant figure which magic spell to cast on it
</p>
<p>
</p><p>could it be that I could simply use xcopy to copy the entire contents of the drive in my other laptop
</p>
<p>onto the drive in the laptop in focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>You can not use the operating system files or the recovery partition from your other laptop to reinstall 7 on that Acer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the repair disk you made on the other one is just that, a repair disk; not a reinstall disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the recovery partition has been wiped and as Acer told you they no longer sell the Windows 7 Recovery Media and as you know Microsoft does not offer ISO downloads for preinstalled operating systems, your reinstall options are limited.</p>
<p>________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also borrow the exact same Retail Windows 7 Edition&nbsp;DVD and use your Product Key to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker, which has the Product Key on it,&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>

</p><p><strong>You can also borrow the exact same Retail Windows 7 Edition&nbsp;DVD and use your Product Key to reinstall.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The COA sticker, which has the Product Key on it,&nbsp;is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just discovered that both laptops have the <strong>windows 7 starter</strong> sticker just below the keyboard on the left bottom</p>
<p>beside the <strong>intel atom</strong> sticker.</p>
<p>so one problem has been solved !!! </p>
<p>that is a start...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the main problem is that any version of windows 7 will not install onto this laptop as far as I can tell.</p>
<p>as soon as I attempt to install a win 7 os using a external dvd I get the message that
</p>
<p>no bootable device can be found...</p>
<p>
</p><p>there must be some <strong>acer pre requisites</strong> that need to be loaded onto the hard drive or into memory first
</p>
<p>before an os can be installed and if so then borrowing someones exact retail version of windows 7
</p>
<p>will not help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intend to contact acer about this to determine exactly which magic spell I need to cast on this demon in order
</p>
<p>to avoid throwing it into the trash can where I suspect many have fallen before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sell laptops that cannot be used once the hard drive crashes or gets wiped that way
</p>
<p>acer and microsoft can make more money selling laptops and operating systems.</p>

<p><strong>Just because they both have Windows 7 Starter on them does not mean that you can use the recovery media from one on the other.</strong></p>
<p>Acer were the ones who set up the recovery media<strong> that you bought from them</strong>&nbsp;so that their recovery media could be used on&nbsp; series on machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>these two laptops are the first acer products I've ever purchased.</p>
<p>normally I buy dell computers because of the support but these were really cheap and thats what I get.</p>
<p>if I need to install a os on a dell machine I only need a reinstallation media disk made for that machine and thats</p>
<p>all I need , you never need a product key or a coa to do an install because its built into the motherboard and that</p>
<p>is why I thought that a ((( FACTORY ))) reset for that machine could be used on another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thinking that acer had a reinstallation process similar to dell's but thats not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>and you (can) use the recovery media from one dell machine on any other dell machine of the same or similar models...&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>you just buy a reinstallation media disk on ebay if you dont already have one ... no hassles , no worries , and at the end of the day your up and running not watching youtube videos or searching through the internet or attempting to get some worthwhile suggestions
 from a microsoft answers forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it doesnt matter Who I bought it from there should be a way to reinstall the os after a hard drive failure or drive wipe.</p>
<p>the license was paid for at some time.</p>
<p><strong>the proof that the license was paid for is the coa on the laptop and the info on the acer support website.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>even if I bought a car with no engine in it , I could buy a engine for that car.</p>
<p>if I bought a boat with no oars , I could buy oars.</p>
<p>but if I but a acer with no os , I cant buy a os for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>surely you can understand the importance here , you are supposed to be a microsoft mvp
</p>
<p>or do you get to be a mvp by posting alot on the answers forum?</p>

</p><p>Acer fulfilled their duties to supply a means to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer recovery was press Alt + F10 at Boot.</p>
<p>To make Recovery disks you used their eRecovey process under programs.</p>
<p>NO ONE DID IT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer also&nbsp;kept Windows 7 recovery disk for many years for their customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With an Acer it is an OEM license and all support for an Acer is supposed to come from Acer, not from Microsoft..</p>

My emails are now coming in with SPAM markings.&nbsp; Examples are :&nbsp; SPAM-LOW: or SPAM-HIGH:.&nbsp; I have not changed any settings as far as I know.&nbsp; These are coming in on previously un marked emails from normal people on my email list.&nbsp; Also, adding them to a safe

            That marking is not coming from WLMail. The most likely source is your own security software. Otherwise, your Email Service Provider (the one whose server you are downloading these messages from) may be trying to be helpful.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your system won't boot and won't run a system restore after an update, we suggest performing a repair upgrade by downloading the latest .ISO file available for Windows 10.

            I'm confused by your reply? You start with acknowledging the fact my system won't boot or load up but you give me a link to a fix that requires you to be able to run it or start it from the system you are trying to repair? Your screen shots are not from
 a system that won't boot? As I explained initially this update stopped my system from doing anything but circling through a boot sequence never loading anything...so any fix I need requires me to run from bios or similar?&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A few possible reasons can be the cause of this error code. It is possible that this is due to system file corruption after a failed reset. To diagnose and fix this problem, let's start your PC in safe mode from the Windows recovery screen. After
 three failed boot attempts, Windows goes into recovery mode. It is a blue-colored screen with a title<strong> Choose an Option</strong>. To start in safe mode, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows Recovery Environment.</li><li><span>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>screen, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced options</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<strong>Startup
 Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 5 or F5 for<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you repair your PC using an installation USB or disc. To create an installation media and use it to repair your computer, follow the steps below: (You may skip steps 1-5 if you already have an installation
 media)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=616447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft software download website</a>.</li><li>Download the media creation tool and then run it.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).</li><li>Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>. If you do not see the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's
 website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Repair your computer</strong>. You will then be able to perform Startup Repair to repair your PC.</li><li>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Choose an option</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>screen, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshoot &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Advanced options</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Startup

    <title>Your most difficult Borderlands 2 boss battle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cammofthrones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your most difficult Borderlands 2 boss battle</h2>
                    
<p>Boss- Bloodwing level 22</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3 Players</p>
<p>1. Host-Level 21 assassin</p>
<p>2. Me-Level 10 soldier</p>
<p>3. Friend-Level 11 soldier</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Here is the catch.&nbsp; The host level 21 was was not playing at all. He had to go do something and was AFK.&nbsp; He is a friend and we said we would just try anyway for the challenge and xp points.&nbsp; So we had a level 10 and 11 trying to beat a level 22 Bloodwing.
 Keep in mind if the players die, Bloodwing regenerates all of her health.&nbsp; WOW what a battle this was!!&nbsp; Even with both of us throwing our turret at the same time and shooting nonstop it was brutal hard.&nbsp; In a good way.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After 2 and 1/2 hours and after my character leveled up to level 19 (which allowed me to finally use my level 19 slag gun) we beat it.&nbsp; The slag gun instantly made a massive difference. Once I slagged Bloodwing and we threw out the turrets, it ended quick
 after that. This does not even include the battle we had leading up to Bloodwing. Which was just as brutal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 and 1/2 hour battle. lol</p>

 the skags leaving me with no second wind chances. &nbsp;Stayed close to walls, tried to time her dives to avoid them but nothing. &nbsp;Those dives had ridiculous radius.
</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>By far THE most difficult boss battle. &nbsp;Had to have a level 42 Axton friend come in to help me kill her. &nbsp;When he joined it was a 1 shot. &nbsp;Can't believe how much easier she was with 2 people than solo ._.</p>

<p>Haven't had a problem with any of them besides Vermivorous the Invincible, me and 2 others took it on and died a few times, but we killed it because it was right next to a spawn so its health didn't reset. Didn't get anything worth while off the kill though.</p>

<p>a quartet of us level 32's tried to mess with Terra-whatever his name is, that big @@@ thresher. &nbsp;He would one shot me, take all my shields out, and all but like 25 health. &nbsp;We didnt even damage him. &nbsp;Other than that, I found the boss battles fairly easy,
 as I was generally a couple levels higher. &nbsp;I found the seemingly endless respawning mobs more difficult than anything. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I just solo'd Terramorphous the Invincible in True Vault Hunter Mode. Definitely the hardest fight I've had in the game. Which is especially frustrating considering I was expecting the craziest most awesome loot I've ever seen, and I didn't even get anything
 better than what I already had equipped.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;mdiiorio,</p><p><br /></p><p>Your deposit is being prevented due to a mismatch between your US Rewards Account region and your Spanish Microsoft Account region. Since your Rewards Account is a separate entity from your Microsoft Account, migrating your Microsoft Account region will not also change your Rewards Account region. Therefore, when your Rewards Account attempts a deposit in one regional currency, it cannot complete when your Microsoft Account is of a differing currency.
  </p><p><br /></p>
<p>However, this issue can be fixed by heading over to the Microsoft Commerce page at (<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) to update your Microsoft account to match your Xbox Live Rewards location. Another option if you wish to continue with Rewards in your current Xbox Live region is to opt out of the program at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/optout/</a>), wait 48 hours and then sign back up again, which can also take 48 hours.
  &nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>While you will lose your progress by starting a brand new account, you can start earning Rewards Credits that will successfully reward your newly registered regional currency. To confirm that you have re-registered correctly, you can check your join date from the MyRewards page at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>). If your join date shows a specific date, then your account has successfully been re-registered. If you see ‚Äú???‚Äù then your account is still being created. If you open a new post after being able to log in to your new Rewards account, you can request any pending deposits from your old account to your new one.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

            This error appears to relate to gpu performance, so have you got the latest graphics card drivers installed?<br />
Latest version of directX?<br />
If so, please tell us more about he problem, which version of windows, version of movie maker, what file type the photos are, how many, do you have any music, what file type, length of movie, when you get the error, ie when adding photos, when editing, saving
 etc, can you make a small move with less photos.<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to create a video from some of my photos and I have the same problem.<br />
<br />
I have a GeForce GT 650M, and a HD 4000 as second GPU using the optimus nvidia system.<br />
My drivers are up to date.<br />
I'm on Windows 7 x64 Professional, and I use the latest version of Movie Maker 2012 build 16.4.3505.0912)<br />
<br />
My project contains 500+ high resolution images (2000x1328).<br />
<br />
I keep having this error (0X887A000) every time I try to save my project to a video file.<br />
<br />
The message says "there are missing of unusable files in your movie maker project that are preventing your movie from being saved. please check that file preparation is enabled in options, or remove the files and try again."<br />
<br />
I tried with and without the file preparation option, with the same result.<br />
<br />
If I choose a 1080p preset, I hit the error at about 35% of the encoding, and if I try to lower the resolution (484x272 with the Zune HD profile) I manage to encode almost 50% of my video...<br />
<br />
Once the error has been thrown, some of my images are marked with a warning icon, and I can "fix them" (actually the fix is to delete them...) but the images are valid, and this is not even always the sames that are "not valid" if I try to reload the project
 and start the encoding.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps fix that annoying bug...<br />

            I would say your problem is down to the 500+ high res pictures.<br />
If you make 4 x 125+ hi res picture projects then join them back up into one whole one in a new project using the video files you saved does this then work ok for you?<br />

            <p>Hi Melvyn La√Øly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this concern, it is occurring due to the number of photos in that project. Movie Maker is having a hard time joining those high resolution images. I strongly recommend that you split your movie into 2 parts making the first part 250 pictures then the
 second, the other remaining pictures. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After creating the 2 part movie, put them in 1 project then burn them onto a DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
        </p>

            If movie maker is not capable to handle a few hundred images to produce a movie, I guess I will rather stop using it.<br />

            It's not a bug as MM is primarily a video editor not a slideshow maker, so your best option would be to use other software, if you don't want to use the work arounds suggested.<br />
I like photosdex proshow gold, not expensive and gives lots of editing options.<br />

            This comes more than a year after, now on windows 8.1, same nasty bug.<br />
"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It's not a bug as MM is primarily a video editor not a slideshow maker"</span><br />
I'm sorry but I was expecting more from a MVP.<br />
Let me put this in the right shape, IT IS A BUG! It's been there for ages, and a MVP excusing it by saying that because the main purpose of WMM is to edit video and not make a slideshow, did not help to solve this NASTY BUG.<br />
First, let me get this right, WMM is not a video editor, I cannot edit video on WMM, I can MAKE videos, by composing with other videos or images... and add funny transition effects.<br />
<br />
So this is a bug, and you as a MVP didn't help to solve it by making up some fake excuse.<br />
Thank you

    <title>Xbox One is stuck on Moderate NAT despite every attempt to change it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One is stuck on Moderate NAT despite every attempt to change it to Open</h2>
                    
<p>I'm hoping someone can help me here because it seems I've exhausted every possible option to get my Xbox One's NAT to change from Moderate to Open. I just recently moved apartment complexes and at my old apartment complex I always had an open nat. I was
 able to connect easily to Xbox One parties and chat with people. Ever since moving into my new apartment complex I've been stuck on moderate unable to chat with anyone in Xbox One parties with a handful of different error codes. For example, when I power on
 my Xbox and go into Network Settings to test the multiplayer connection under "Detailed NAT Information" it says "Your network in behind a cone NAT" which apparently is the message you look for when you have an open NAT. As far as status codes are concerned
 I've received multiple ones, the current one I'm looking at says "0x1040040000000000". I've done my fair share of troubleshooting and have tried the following solutions to this problem:</p>
<p>- Port forwarding ports 53, 80, 88, 500, 3074, 3544, and 4500.</p>
<p>- Disabling port forwarding and enabling the UPnP</p>
<p>- Disabling the UPnP</p>
<p>- Enabling DMZ</p>
<p>- Disabling DMZ</p>
<p>- Holding down all bumpers and triggers then exiting the detailed network statistics to see that my NAT type is now magically open, but the seeing under "Detailed NAT Information" "Your network is behind a port-restricted NAT", and then shortly after turning
 off my Xbox One it switches back to moderate. Also even when it says open I still am unable to connect to anyone's party.</p>
<p>- Power cycling my Xbox One</p>
<p>- Completely shutting down and unplugging my router</p>
<p>- Setting a static IP address for my Xbox One</p>
<p>The router I'm using is an ASUS RT-AC66R. Anytime I join a party it says "Due to network limitations, you can't join party chat right now. (0x807d0106)". I'm about 1 more error code away from pulling my hair out. Someone, please help.</p>

<p>Also, what I did was Settings&gt;Power &amp; Start up&gt;Restart now.</p>

<p>There are actually helpful video's on YouTube to help with this problem. Mine was doing the same, now it is Open!</p>

<p>you enabled DMZ and gave your X1 a static IP, but did you put your X1 in the DMZ?</p>
<p>if the only thing that changed was your location, then i'm guessing your ISP is being provided by the leasing company and they are running you through NAT, which means you are most likely double NATing.</p>
<p>assuming that is correct, gave your X1 a static IP, put that IP in the DMZ, should fix the problem.</p>

<p>By connecting directly to modem I assume you mean plugging my ethernet directly from my Xbox into the ethernet port in the wall, I did and my NAT went from Moderate to Strict.</p>
<p>As I said in my original post, I have tried the "Test Multiplayer Connection and hold down all triggers/bumpers" fix and for a short period of time my NAT will switch from Moderate to Open. However, even when it says Open I still run into the say error code
 and cannot hear or speak to anyone in a party. It is worth mentioning though that when I initially test my multiplayer connection under "Detailed NAT information" it says "Your network is behind a cone NAT" (supposedly what you want to see) but after doing
 the fix, having an Open NAT connection, I go back to test multiplayer connection and it says "Your network is behind a port-restricted NAT" under "Detailed NAT information".</p>
<p>I do believe I've given my Xbox One a static IP, unless I've somehow missed a step or two. When I go into my router's interface and enable DMZ it asks for the IP address of the exposed station, I put in (what I assume to be my now STATIC IP) into the box
 and hit apply. However, no change in NAT type.</p>

<p>I don't really understand it myself but have you tried calling your broadband provider to see what they suggest? Could be worth a shot.</p>
<p>I know from talking to friends here in the UK, various methods work for some, other's they don't. I know quite a few people who are with BT like myself. If they get NAT issues the LT, RT, LB, RB trick usually works. My cousin though who is with SKY found
 this trick doesn't work. </p>
<p>Also, in the Network Test screen on the Xbox One console, have you tried "Clearing Mac Address" I'm not sure what this exactly does but I've seen others suggest that.</p>
<p>On the Home Hub I use it has a Reset Button on top that 99% of the time sorts out any issues. It also has on the back a little hole just big enough to fit the tip of a pen in, this is a "Factory Reset" which my broadband provider suggests trying if all else
 fails. Has your modem got something similar you could try?</p>
<p>Hope you get it sorted.</p>

<p>some network providers have there own NAT enabled</p>
<p>you could try turning off your routers firewall see if that makes a difference/test, but I wouldn't recommend using it that way if you have other computers connected to it.</p>
<p>if you have plugged your console directly into your modem and still have Strict NAT I would have a chat with your ISP see if they can suggest anything.</p>

<p>Still unable to figure out the issue. Came to figure out that the ISP for my apartment complex is Suddenlink (which in the United States, North Carolina specifically, sucks). I went as so far to call the apartment clubhouse and ask if I would be allowed
 to purchase an outside internet provider, but it turns out they have a contract with Suddenlink, therefore I'm stuck with them. I called Suddenlink myself to try and troubleshoot, they told me to call the apartment clubhouse and put in a work order for an
 IT that works with my apartment complex to call me. Two days later, no call, I put in ANOTHER work order, finally got a call, missed it, and left a voicemail for the IT only to not receive anything back from him. This is pretty ridiculous, I've looked up all
 methods of port forwarding, tried every trick I can to keep an open NAT, but nothing. All I want to do is be able to join an Xbox Live party and be able to communicate with people while gaming.</p>

<p>Hi Mellow,</p>
<p>Your situation sounds difficult and as you suspect, it may be caused by your service provider. As you know, the best way is static ip and dmz in your router. My old router was the same as yours, but I can't remember if upnp was enabled too or not, so try
 both ways - my current router, the Netgear R7000 with dd-wrt firmware likes upnp on. Remember, DO NOT use static in the xbox one, leave it on automatic. This will ensure your router is controlling the leasing of the xbox's ip. Switch off all<a href="http://www.mann-tek.com/related-information/about-npt-and-bsp-threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.mann-tek.com/.../about-npt-and-bsp-threads</a>
 then Reboot Modem - Router - computer (xbox in your case). Carry out all three xbox network tests, top to bottom, then quit out of settings, then reopen and check nat status.
</p>
<p>If following this doesn't work, it must be your isp.</p>
<p>There's a good piece here too. Take note of the additional ports: <a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/46572/xbox-one-how-to-open-your-nat-to-connect-to-live-members-and-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            .zip is missing in Default Program list</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and when I received a .zip file I could not open it. When I went to the Default Programs listing to see what program association was set to open it - the .zip&nbsp; was not listed in the Default Program listing.
 How do I get the .zip file back?

            <p>MY .ZIP is now working again. This is what happened; the .zip was in the file association list without an association and that was why I couldn't open a .zip file so I clicked on and assigned Windows Explorer to open it, and when I went back to the list
 the .zip was gone from the list but it is now in the Protocol list as EXPLORER.ZIPSELCTION and I can now open my .zip files. So this was just another glitch that had to be corrected, after upgrading to Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            After updating Windows 10 - microphone doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Dell Optiplex 780 I'm running Windows 10. It upgraded from Windows 8 2-3 months ago and everything was working fine until today when last update was installed. Microphone doesn't work any more and none of my printers drivers are there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that in "Devices and printers" there're all devices separately, but that wasn't like that before update (at least I didn't noticed). Now there're headphones, my phone, monitors, microphone, speakers, keyboard, kvm switch, mouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update sound driver but without success.</p>
<p>Also tried with "troubleshoot" wizard - but again dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's hardware Ids:</p>

<span>create a restore point manually</span>. Restoring won‚Äôt affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Disclaimer: Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Deepak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding microphone issue I uninstall sound driver, but after restarting PC situation is the same. The thing is that Windows "see" my microphone but doesn't recognize sound. As I said, that happen after installing update. I'm using microphone all the time
 (working as Technical support) and that's why it's important for me to be functional. I'm using a headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding printer drivers, only printer that is available now is for printer which is connected with my PC. Other 4 printers are gone from Windows! They can't be found in "Device manager". So I should install one by one again?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore is last chance. I'm avoiding because it's true disaster. Nothing will work after that. I already tried system restore in past years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update version which is last installed is KB3124200. Do you think that issue will be solved if I uninstall that update?</p>

            Issue has not been solved. I think Microsoft doesn't have solution for this issue. The only solution is to buy new PC or new Windows 10 supported PCI sound card.

<p><b>Give full permission to the folder and check.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Right click on the <strong>Folder</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>
<br />
b. Select <strong>Security</strong> tab <br />
c. Choose <strong>Edit</strong> button (if prompted to click <strong>continue</strong>, please click on
<strong>continue</strong>)<br />

e. Click on <strong>Check names<br />
</strong>f. Click <strong>Ok</strong> <br />
g. Under Group or user name select ‚Äú<b>Everyone</b>‚Äú<br />
h. Under <strong>Permissions</strong> for system check <strong>Allow full control.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><span>Method 2: <span>&nbsp;</span>Try to delete in safe mode with networking to see if there are any conflicting programs:</span></b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can change your Gmertag for free ONE time, additional changes are 800 pts each. &nbsp;On your console, go to Profile, Edit Profile, then Gamertag to change.</p>

<p>Since you still have the random gamertag, you can change it online. If you go to edit profile here on the website, you should see gamertag near the top. Click change gamertag and then it should let you put in a new one.
</p>
<p>This only works when you have the random gamertag.</p>

<p>Please don't bump old threads.</p>
<p>Yes, you can still change your gamertag for free if you're changing the randomly generated tag you were given when you created your account.</p>

                    <p>Install Windows 10 from Windows 8</p>
<p>Worked well for some time</p>
<p>Started to be slow while starting and closing computer</p>
<p>Started to be very very slow and disconect while on internet</p>
<p>Made a reset</p>
<p>It took 16 hours to get to 99%</p>
<p>It stood 26 hours at 99%</p>
<p>I shut down the PC (after a total of42 hours)</p>
<p>On restart Windows wont load: stucks a while on the windows logo and then goes empty (dark grey)</p>
<p>
</p><p>No conclusive answer found on the other posts</p>
<p>The computer is an HP i7 three years old</p>
