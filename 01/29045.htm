                    Okay, I was able to fix the <i>Windows unable to update problem</i> with help from someone here. And it worked like a charm! But now I have a new problem...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The update worked, yes, but it won't let me install the updates. It says, <i>
"WindowsUpdate_80246008" "WindowsUpdate_dt000" </i>and I have tried searching for other solutions here but my problem again is that I am unable to find the
<b>BITS</b> in the <b>services</b> list.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I didn't have any upgrade BTW. And I have a Windows 7 Home Basic.</div>

<h2>            XBox One - A Pretty Weak Game Console</h2>
                    I've had XBox One since summer 2014, and it has went through many updates since then. XBox One is interesting enough, no doubt of that, and as a Blu-Ray player, it's great. But here is the problem. I have played several games, like Tomb Raider, Watch Dogs,
 Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag, Assassin's Creed Unity and Far Cry 4. They all look really good and play well, but to know that they play at 900p at 30 fps, and not native 1080p at 60 fps, not even 4k at 60 fps, leave me to think that the XBox One hardware
 is too WEAK for advanced games. Using modern x86 architecture with a multi-cored APU shouldn't be the point, as you see powerful PC-Gamers machines with one of the market's most powerful APU, CPU and GPU cards miles away from that of both XBox One and PS4!
 That is something to keep in mind. Microsoft has admitted themselves that the way XBox One originally was developed and marketed, was a mistake, and that XBox One has had a very troubled birth already. If Microsoft want XBox to be

<p>It was known by everyone remotely knowledgeable before the consoles were even announced, that a console which costs a few hundred bucks would not be anywhere near as powerful as a top of the line gaming PC, which can cost thousands.
</p>
<p>People buy consoles because of affordability and ease of use. The Xbox One is performing exactly as was intended by Microsoft and expected by consumers. Well, at least the ones with common sense.</p>

<p>I'm not really disappointed in any way. I also know that the games will look better as the life of the console goes on. The Xbox 360 put out some great looking games these last couple of years. I know it's just the beginning.</p>

<p>Think PC gamers are worse than Xbox And PS fanboys combined lol. The OP haven't said anything none of us already know and yet we still chose to a console instead of a PC.</p>
<p>I've always been a console gamer, tried PC once but found it too much of a headache, consoles are just easier and cheaper for me.

<p>4k at 60 fps is a long way off for consoles. It's not even in an affordable range for a PC either.
</p>
<p>The only thing I agree with you on is that this generation of consoles should be hitting the 1080p 60fps mark. In relation to this both of the consoles are underpowered. You act as if 30fps is not playable however, although not optimal It's still playable.
 I'm a PC enthusiast but I also have a xbox one, because the last thing I want to do after working behind a computer all day is then come home to be in front of one for the rest of the night aswell. &nbsp;Consoles are not just about raw power, they are about convince.
 Stop being so narrow minded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually have no clue what the point of this thread is. I think I've just lost brain cells even reading through that dribble.

<h3> deniz1433  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall Windows 10 without losing partitions</h2>
                    <p>I split my only HDD [1TB] into 2 partitions. 1 for personal data called C: [830 GB] and 1 for Windows 10 called W: [100GB] but right now I have Windows installed on my C: disk. Which is not what I want, and I NEED to reinstall Windows 10 because I didn't
 know that my key was for Win10 Single Language and I installed normal Win10. So OS migration won't work, and I need to reinstall Windows to W:. I do have an USB boot disk if I can put it to use. I have no data to lose on this computer except keeping the partitions
 split still.</p>

            Hi Deniz,
<br />
<br />To make sure you have control over partitions during the installation, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />When the Window comes up with all your partitions listed, select each partition with the exception of the 830GB partition and delete all those.
<br />
<br />You will be left with the 830GB partition and 1 unallocated space
<br />
<br />Click on the unallocated space and click next to install Windows 10 onto that space - this will ensure your data partition remains unchanged . . .

            Hi RickSchuster ... right click your task bar and go to task manager.
<br />Go to startup tab.
<br />Do you see anything related to HP?
<br />If so click and disable it.
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

            Hi Rick, this is very common after uninstalling HP printer software, a startup entry is left over . . 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Search the list for any HP printer entries, then right click and delete from there

<p>Found the HP files in the list, but it will not allow me to remove with Administrative authority, and keeps bouncing me out.&nbsp; I will admit that after all these years of using Windows on my home computer I have never understood why I don't automatically have
 that authority.&nbsp; Any further advice?</p>

            Hi Rick, yes, Windows 10 does put out a lot of those 'Administrator' warnings, even though you are an Administrator . . .
<br />
<br />When you an Autoruns, did you right click the program and choose 'Run as Administrator'?
<br />
<br />If you did and still cannot right click and delete the HP processes, are you allowed to just untick those in Autoruns - that will have the same effect and stop the dll popups . . .

            OK.&nbsp; I got past the administrative issue. The good news is that, using the utility,&nbsp; I no longer have any HP .dll files showing on my computer.&nbsp; The bad news is that it did not solve the problem.&nbsp; I am still getting the "run error" message when I boot.&nbsp;
 I appreciate your help, and while this is annoying it isn't the end of the world.&nbsp; Any other thoughts?&nbsp; Another reply I received suggested running DISM.exe ... Scanhealth and Restorehealth commands, but that did not resolve it either.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>While I was dealing with this, my wife looked it up on the HP Customer Support - Knowledge Base and found a posting on 'Run DLL Error Displays During Startup (Windows).</p>
<p>It suggested making sure hidden files are open, and then directs you to:</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</strong>; where you can delete the shortcut icon lableled
<strong>Monitor Ink Alerts - &lt;printer name&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>I have removed that shortcut, and, lo, the problem has been solved.&nbsp; My thanks to you and the others in the community for your advice and patience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you tried redeeming through the Xbox? &nbsp;Just say "Xbox, Use a code" Depending on the code, you may either have the Kinect recognize the code by putting it in front of it or manually entering the 25-character code. &nbsp;</p>

            You need to check to see which Bluetooth system your PC is using.&nbsp; If it is using the default built-in Microsoft Bluetooth "system" then it seems that Microsoft will not allow any audio over the Bluetooth signals<br />

<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
Here's a few things to try.&nbsp; You can test to see if it works after each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disconnect power from Xbox for 30 seconds, then plug it back in.</p>
<p>2. Try hard wiring the connection (this will determine if it's wifi or your network connection in general)</p>
<p>3. If you have a modem/router from your ISP, and that's not the one you replaced, see if they can test or replace it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 will not sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> demonnightwish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not sleep</h2>
                    <p>I've been browsing the other community questions about this with no success to fixing my issue. This is a custom built computer with a clean Windows 10 install on it. At first I was having trouble with my computer starting from both sleep mode and shut down,
 and have since fixed the shutdown problem. However, the sleep mode is persistent and slightly different from before. So here's my situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Computer used to sleep only on command for a couple minutes then wake from sleep.</p>
<p>2. Since fixing the auto-boot from shutdown thing by disabling the "hybrid sleep mode" in power settings my computer will go to sleep upon clicking the command and then immediately wake up. I tell it to sleep again and it does so only to wake immediately
 again.</p>
<p>3. On the third command to sleep it will stay asleep for a few minutes before waking again.</p>
<p>4. My computer also completely ignores my Power Manager Schedule to put the computer to sleep after 1 hour of inactivity. Timed it and it sails past as if not scheduled at all. Unacceptable.</p>
<p>5. I've tried looking everywhere I know in Device Manager, Power Management in control panel, and other places and nothing has worked or is somehow not applicable to my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm tired of having to wrestle with this so really hoping to get enough help to resolve this here instead of having to take it to a computer shop and pay for that if I can fix it myself.</p>

            <p>The steps that I have done so far is check and set my preferences in the Power Plan Settings (which my computer ignores so far), and look in every menu I can find relating to power management. In the "Change advanced power settings" part of the power plan
 options (sleep drop down sub-menu) of the Control Panel is where I turned off the "allow Hybrid sleep" setting that was preventing my computer from obeying my shutdown commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For drivers, all are definitely current. I am vigilant about making sure things like that are updated.</p>

Let's open the Command Prompt and enter <strong>powercfg -requests</strong>, this will show any process or device that interferes with the sleep function.<br />

Let us know how it goes.

<p>That **** means you should run it from a command prompt with admin privileges.&nbsp; To do that, hit &lt;Win+X&gt; and select the obvious from the menu that appears.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I now disable Local Network Security settings in Windows 10 anniversary upgrade in order never to be asked for my network credentials when I search on my Home Network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note I didn't have this problem before I updated to the 10th anniversary upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it fix the problem If I revert/downgrade to my previous version of Win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Leo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ISUSPM.exe is a software installation manager. It can be a virus or malware as well. Run a full scan on your device using your antivirus program and check your Programs and Features if there are any applications you're not aware.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store&#58; Apps download, but are stuck on &#34;Installing&#34; forever.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like some help with an issue I'm having with the W10 Store. As the title said, the store downloads the first 4 apps on the list (the others on the list remain on pending), the downloads complete normally, then when those 4 apps start installing, the
 installation process simply doesn't start. It just stays there on "Installing" without progressing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried the fixes for the pending issue, without success. Deleted cache, used wsreset.exe, etc, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><li>Runtime Broker is a Windows　process in Task Manager that　helps manage permissions on your PC for apps from Windows Store. It should only use a few megabytes of memory, but in some cases, a faulty app might cause　Runtime Broker　to use up to a gigabyte of
 RAM or more.
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>If　your RAM use is high and your PC is running slowly, an app may be the cause of the problem. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to　open Task Manager and then, on the
<strong>Processes</strong> tab,　check to see how much memory Runtime Broker is using. If it’s using more than 15% of your memory, you probably have an issue with an app on your PC. To stop Runtime Broker from using so much memory, select
<strong>Runtime Broker</strong> in the list, select <strong>End task</strong> to close Runtime Broker, and then restart your computer.</li><li>

I've tried the steps above, but with no results. Runtime broker was running at 4.1 mb only, no problems were found with the store troubleshooter, and sfc couldn't fix it either.<br />

All out of ideas.

<h2>            Not saving - Rise Of The Tomb Raider</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I recently bought Rise Of The Tomb Raider on the Microsoft Store. However, when I try saving the game it just comes up with the save icon but never actually saves (nor does it auto save or make any save file either). I've tried multiple times and got quite
 far but lost that data because the game isn't saving.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to solve this? Any help would be appreciated!</p>

</p><p>Apparently there is a bug in a&nbsp; specific part of the game that corrupts the save. You may have played to that point ?</p>
<p>I don't know the specifics, but you should be able to find details of what not to do in this part of the game
</p>
<p>and avoid the save game bug.&nbsp; A restart of the game is likely necessary .</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Party Chat</h2>
                    
<p>So i got a ban yesterday for inappropriate messages and chat and what not and my ban was lifted today. &nbsp;I can join parties and play all games and hear people but for some reason they cannot hear me. &nbsp;I can send messages as before i could not. &nbsp;I can also
 receive them. &nbsp;i called xbox support and they put me through all these steps but none of these work. &nbsp;Finally they said i had to hard reset my xbox and erase everything or wait 24 hours and see what happens. &nbsp;i feel like all the stuff i went through was pointless
 and were steps i already took. &nbsp;You guys or anyone have any help or input? anything would be appreciated thanks</p>

    <title>Wifi is being throttled to 15Mbs no matter how fast the available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dglidden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi is being throttled to 15Mbs no matter how fast the available connection is</h2>
                    <p>This is on a new MSI GE62 laptop with the Anniversary edition patches applied. &nbsp;Intel AC 3165 wireless chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically exactly what the subject says. &nbsp;No matter how fast the connection is, the best I can get from Windows is 15Mbs. &nbsp;At home, the device status shows it's got a 72Mbs connection to the wifi router, and at work it says 100Mbs but the actual throughput
 is being limited to 15Mbs while viewing Task Manager, and corroborated by looking at the download speeds in Steam or going to Speedtest.net. &nbsp;Even going to another computer on the same network, I'm limited to 15Mbs. &nbsp;I have a MacBook Pro, iPad, and Android
 tablet on the same wifi network who all get the expected performance via Wifi. &nbsp;It's specific to this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going direct wired gets me exactly what I'd expect from the feed I have (about 60Mbs) and obviously even faster when going direct wired to another computer on the same network. &nbsp;So it's strictly limited to only my Wifi getting throttled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's NOT my ISP throttling me, because I get 15Mbs to anything on the same network, and wired, I get full-speed even over the Internet, so please don't confuse local throttling with my ISP throttling me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled the firewall and antivirus and tried, no luck. &nbsp;I've installed the latest drivers direct from Intel, no luck. There was some sort of "Network performance boost manager" thing pre-installed by MSI but I uninstalled that right away and still
 the same results. &nbsp;It's not set as a "Metered Connection" and I don't have any metering enabled. &nbsp;I've dug around in every networking setting I can find to no avail. &nbsp;Googling "Windows is throttling my Wifi" doesn't turn up anything useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blowing away and reinstalling Windows is not really an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>então Felipe MK, na verdade eu não sei bem exatamente como conectar o xbox ao PC pois eu nunca conectei meu xbox ou meu PC, sem contar que meu PC não tem Media Center:P, esses tutos são do proprio site, www.xbox.com/pcsetup, mas o que acho você pode fazer
 é tentar conectar primeiro o PC para então depois conectar-se ao Media center, se vc não já tenha feito assim nessa ordem</p>

<p>é dificl isso!! conectar uma coisa na outra!! to tentando entender o tutorial, sem Media center, e o tutorial parece que cita outra versão de Windows que não o 7! pois as opções diferem do tutorial pro que tem no meu windows... isso porque o tutorial é do
 windows 7 e meu windows é o 7 (sem media center) mas eu vou postar aqui e agora os dois tutoriais que tem no site</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sem Media Center</span></p>
Windows Media
<p><strong>Passo 1: Ligue o compartilhamento de conteúdo</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Iniciar</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Painel de Controle</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Redes e Internet</strong>.
</li><li>Selecione<strong>&nbsp;GrupoCasa e Opções de Compartilhamento</strong>. </li><li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Alterar configuração avançadas de compartilhamento</strong>.
</li><li>Abaixo de&nbsp;<strong>Transmissão de Conteúdo</strong>, clique em&nbsp;<strong>Escolher opções de transmissão de conteúdo</strong>.
</li><li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Ligar transmissão de conteúdo</strong>&nbsp;(o acesso de administrador é necessário neste passo).
</li><li>Nomeie sua biblioteca de conteúdo se desejar. </li><li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Escolher definições padrão</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Ajuste a&nbsp;<strong>Classificação</strong>&nbsp;e as&nbsp;<strong>Restrições Parentais</strong>&nbsp;se desejar.
</li><li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. </li></ul>
</li><li>Por padrão, todos os consoles Xbox 360 na rede estão permitidos a conectar. Você pode mudar isto se desejar.
</li><li>Click em&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Passo 2: Configure seu Xbox 360</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Na área&nbsp;<strong>Meu Xbox</strong>, selecione a&nbsp;<strong>Biblioteca de Vídeos</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Músicas</strong>, ou&nbsp;<strong>Imagens</strong>.
</li><li>Selecione seu computador. Os computadores na sua rede estão listados por nome
</li><li>Selecione o item para tocá-lo. </li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Com Media center</span></p>
<p><strong>PASSO 1</strong><br />
Se você já usou anteriormente seu Xbox 360 com um Windows Media Center (PC), você vai precisar remover a conexão existente. Senão, *** para o Passo 2.</p>
<p><strong>Em um Windows XP Media Center PC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Iniciar</strong>, vá a&nbsp;<strong>Todos os Programas</strong>, depois em&nbsp;<strong>Acessórios</strong>, entre em&nbsp;<strong>Media Center</strong>, e então clique em&nbsp;<strong>Gerenciar Extensão do Media Center</strong>.
</li><li>Selecione seu Xbox 360 e clique em&nbsp;<strong>Propriedades</strong>. </li><li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Remover</strong>. </li><li>Clique&nbsp;<strong>Sim</strong>&nbsp;para confirmar a remoção. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Em um Windows Vista ou Windows 7 Media Center PC</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Clique em&nbsp;<strong>Iniciar</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Center</strong>. </li><li>Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Tarefas</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Configurações</strong>. </li><li>Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Extensão</strong>. </li><li>Selecione a&nbsp;<strong>Extensão do Media Center para Xbox 360</strong>. </li><li>Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Desinstalar</strong>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>No Xbox 360</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Vá em&nbsp;<strong>Meu Xbox</strong>&nbsp;e então em&nbsp;<strong>Configurações do Sistema</strong>, depois selecione<strong>Computadores</strong>.
</li><li>Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Center</strong>, e então aperte o botão&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>.
</li><li>Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Desconectar.</strong> </li><li>Aperte o botão&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>&nbsp;até voltar às&nbsp;<strong>Configurações do Sistema</strong>.
</li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>PASSO 2<br />
Pegue a Senha de Instalação do Xbox 360</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aperte o botão do Media Center no controle remoto ou vá até&nbsp;<strong>Meu Xbox</strong>, e selecione<strong>Windows Media Center</strong>.
</li><li>Avance pelas instruções na tela para obter a Senha de Instalação do Media Center de 8 dígitos. Anote essa senha.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>PASSO 3<br />
Adicionar Extensão</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Em um Windows Vista ou Windows 7 Media Center PC, abra o Windows Media Center. Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Iniciar</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Center</strong>.
</li><li>Selecione&nbsp;<strong>Tarefas</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Adicionar Extensão</strong>. </li><li>Quando for solicitado, coloque a senha de 8 dígitos que você recebeu do seu Xbox 360.
</li><li>Complete a instalação da Extensão. </li></ul>
<p>enfim, esses métodos são para o windows 7... e agora que eu percebi, Felipe MK, talvez seja por isso que esteja dando erro para vc conectar seu Windows Media Center em seu xbox, pois o PC, ao que parece, não se conecta &nbsp;com o xbox, logo tente fazer aqui
 que falei de conectar o PC para depois configurar o Media center!</p>

<h2>            Pros&#47;Cons of X1 compared to Ps4&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So, im really leaning to getting a Ps4. I wanted one because id have more access to rpgs but now i know that KH3 and XV are coming to X1 im kinda meh.. I also wanted one because of the $100 lower price. But at the same time i feel like i shouldn't just throw
 the X1 under the bus yet. I have no problem with the 24 hour check-in. But the used game thing kind of confuses me i have no idea how it works is there an article about it some one can send to me on how this works? Detailed? &nbsp;I also have no problem with the
 kinect ( i have no paranoid of being spied on i also don't feel like ive done any thing wrong TO be spied upon im so boring like why would any one spy on meh?) Though i do hate the forced kinect did raise the price to such a high level.<br />
So basically TL;DR I am | | that close from &nbsp;deciding on a Ps4, and i need help on making a solid decision Or should i just wait till near Nov and see if ms changes their policies?</p>

<p>I'm sick of seeing all the misinformation going around the gaming subreddits. It's really frustrating to see people furiously hating the X1 without having all, if any, of the details. I'll try and break this down for you guys so here we go.</p>
<p>To start off, the Xbox One will allow you buy games at launch through digital download or through discs by going to a retail store.</p>
<p>USED GAMES</p>
<p>One of the X1's main feature is the ability to install the disc directly to the hard drive and play it without a disk. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is a feature many asked for when the feature was added to 360, but it was only to allow the game to run
 better.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular believe, the used game does exist in the X1.</p>
<p>"Trade-in and resell your disc-based games: Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers. Microsoft does not
 charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games."</p>
<p>What can we take away from this? Easy. If you bought a disc based game, you can sell and trade it to any participating retailer. It means that game publishers will work out deals with retailers in order for the developers and publishers to take a cut of
 used games sales. Microsoft will not receive any money from these transactions. If you bought a digital copy, just like any digital copy, you will not be able to do this.</p>
<p>FIRST PARTY GAMES</p>
<p>"In our role as a game publisher, Microsoft Studios will enable you to give your games to friends or trade in your Xbox One games at participating retailers. Third party publishers may opt in or out of supporting game resale and may set up business terms
 or transfer fees with retailers. Microsoft does not receive any compensation as part of this. In addition, third party publishers can enable you to give games to friends. Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities
 with our partners."</p>
<p>All first party games will be allowed to be resold and be given away (more of this below).</p>
<p>RENTING GAMES</p>
<p>"Loaning or renting games won’t be available at launch, but we are exploring the possibilities with our partners."</p>
<p>Microsoft and companies such as Gamefly are working on a system to make this work.</p>
<p>DRM--WHY?</p>
<p>As we saw above, you will be able install your games to your hard-drive and have your entire library available to play without putting the disc in the disc tray.</p>
<p>This is why the 24-hour check is required. Without this, many copies of the same game could be installed into multiple X1's and it would be absolutely crumble game sales.</p>
<p>The drawback to this is not being able to game offline. Microsoft has said that the final decisions to this issue have not been final. I believe if they allow you to play offline with the disc in the disc tray, this would become a non-issue.</p>
<p>PRIVACY</p>
<p>This is one of the biggest things people have been complaining about. Microsoft has already addressed the issue, but of course it fell on deaf ears. People already had their pitch forks out and had Sony on a pedestal by this point.</p>
<p>"You are in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused: If you don’t want the Kinect sensor on while playing games or enjoying your entertainment, you can pause Kinect. To turn off your Xbox One, just say “Xbox Off.” When the system is off, it’s
 only listening for the single voice command -- “Xbox On,” and you can even turn that feature off too. Some apps and games may require Kinect functionality to operate, so you’ll need to turn it back on for these experiences."</p>
<p>As I've stated before, you will have the control to everything that the Kinect has to offer. If you don't want it to hear you? You can do that. If you don't want it to see you, you can do that. Don't want it to listen for the "Xbox On" while it's off, you
 can also do that.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about the Kinect's privacy settings, you can click this link: Kinect Privacy</p>
<p>XBOX ONE- A GAME OF CIRCLES</p>
<p>Now onto the other things. As some of us know, you will be able to have a "circle" of friends, 10 people to be exact, that will be able to access your game library from anywhere (in the same region, I'm assuming..still not clear about this) at anytime (as
 long as you or someone else in your circle isn't playing it). This is of course how things work now, two of your friends can't play the game at the same time from one disc on two separate consoles.</p>
<p>This is a feature that is absolutely wonderful, but the people raging about it had not heard about it before.</p>
<p>"Give your family access to your entire games library anytime, anywhere: Xbox One will enable new forms of access for families. Up to ten members of your family can log in and play from your shared games library on any Xbox One. Just like today, a family
 member can play your copy of Forza Motorsport at a friend’s house. Only now, they will see not just Forza, but all of your shared games. You can always play your games, and any one of your family members can be playing from your shared library at a given time."</p>
<p>I absolutely love this feature. For example, my cousin is 200 miles away when he's away to college and I've let him borrow LA Noire and Dead Rising. I've yet to receive those games from him. With this feature, we don't have to be close in order for him to
 borrow any of my games! It's crazy as to how so many people dismissed this feature because it's a big jump forward in digital technology. No longer will my friends or family have to be close to me in order for them borrow one of my games.</p>
<p>GIVING AWAY GAMES</p>
<p>Do you have a game that you will no longer play? Your friend can still play it off of your Xbox (if they're in your circle). What if they're not? As long as they have been in your friend's list for 30 days, you can give a game away to your friend, free of
 charge! This can only be done once per copy.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Microsoft has left it up to the publishers to decide whether or not you will be able to give your games to your friend. As stated above, first party games will allow you to this.</p>
<p>AFTER-THOUGHT: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</p>
<p>The big change in the Xbox Live system is the feature to allow all users on one console to have gold by just one user having it. For example, if I have Xbox Live Gold and my brothers also use the same console, they will also be able to use all the perks
 of a Gold account. They will have access to all the games on the console even if it was installed through my account.</p>
<p>In short, one Gold account subscription per Xbox.</p>
<p>AFTER-THOUGHT OF AN AFTER-THOUGHT, A KINECT STORY</p>
<p>Disclaimer, the following is information that I believe. I have no source for some, just my opinion.</p>
<p>The main question I'm seeing is why the Kinect is being forced upon us. This is what I believe is the case in relation to this matter.</p>
<p>The past version of the Kinect was not the big leap in innovating that Microsoft wanted. It is a powerful machine, but many developers were not making games for it. The games that were being made specifically for the Kinect we really not that great. They
 didn't appeal to many gamers as they were soft and childish. This wasn't what Microsoft was looking for from developers.</p>
<p>Why weren't developers making games for the Kinect? Was it because they couldn't?</p>
<p>A CHANGE OF MARKETS</p>
<p>If a developer made a game for the Kinect, their market instantly became much smaller. Why? Not everyone has a Kinect. As of February 2013, the Kinect has sold an estimated 24 million units. This does not mean that these units have been sold to individual
 customers, but to retailers. Which means that there are Kinects in the shelves or warehouses that will never reach the individual customer. In comparison, the 360 has sold an estimated 77.2 million units, again not all sold to invidual customers, but it's
 safe to assume that there a lot more 360's in the hand of an individual customer than there is Kinects. In an instant, your market shrinks to about 31% of the possible market. Keep in mind, this number will change depending on how many units of each product
 have been sold to each consumer.</p>
<p>With that information given to you, what I believe is happening is simple. Microsoft is shipping a Kinect with every console because like this, if you own an Xbox One--you will aso own a Kinect. With this, I'm thinking Microsoft is ensuring the developers
 that the market is out there! In this move, Microsoft want the developers to explore the possibilities of the Kinect. They want newer innovations as they believe they've made a product with enormous potential. Why do you believe they were shoving the Kinect
 down everyone's throat last E3? They wanted to expand their market.</p>
<p>Just think of everything that can be developed for the Kinect. For example, Dead Rising 3 will have a feature where it will listen outside of the game through the Kinect. If you make a loud sound while playing, the zombies will hear you and they will come
 after you. This is the kind of thing Microsoft is looking for with the Kinect, innovation.</p>
<p>As to why it can't be disconnected, that I'm not sure. Maybe it's for the same thing? I can't expand further on this.</p>
<p>With this, we are done with explaining the information that a lot have missed and hopefully will be able to see that the Xbox One really isn't what they think.</p>

<p>O.K. and from the other point of view...</p>
<p>You can download games onto your PS4 directly just like with the XBone, and through a cool system you can start playing it already whilst it is still downloading. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>used games - pretty much the same as it has always been. &nbsp;No problem with PS4, no need to be an issue.</p>
<p>Privacy - kinect can be turned off IN THE MENU's which doesn't mean someone can't back hack it and turn it on remotely, since it has to be plugged in at all times. &nbsp;Removal not possible and have the system work. &nbsp;Also, forcing me to buy a 100 dollar peripheral
 that I DO NOT WANT. &nbsp;There has never been a single Kinect game that has been worth playing as anything other than stupid dancing games. &nbsp;Which I despise, but apparently some people like. &nbsp;So I am being forced to buy functionality I don't want to use. &nbsp;If they
 simply wanted the voice activation crap they could have put on a simple microphone for CONSIDERABLY less. &nbsp;Wouldn't have had nearly as much of an issue with that. &nbsp;But no, they had to tell me how to play my games.</p>
<p>The system must connect through online once every 24 hours. &nbsp;If it can't connect online, your system will no longer be a console gaming device, it will only be a blue ray player. &nbsp;Oh, and you can ALSO watch TV, coz that is some kind of feature.</p>
<p>The Specs of the PS4 are considerably more powerful (50% more powerful GPU, 8 gigs of bleeding edge GDDR 5 ram)</p>
<p>The game trading system is ridiculously convoluted, (there is a pro in there however. &nbsp;You can have up to 10 'friends' that can play the games in your games library, and it will even, supposedly, allow you and someone else to play the same game at the same
 time off of one copy. &nbsp;Which is cool. &nbsp;As long as you don't have more than 10 friends and family members.) and you have the ability to GIVE someone a game, but then that game can never be given again.</p>
<p>Worst in my mind is the fact that because of the cloud and DRM and mandatory check ins, you can not actually ever own your game. &nbsp;You are always at the mercy of things you can't control. &nbsp;Internet goes down for more than 24 hours, can't play. &nbsp;Microsoft
 servers go down for more than 24 hours, and you can't play. Try to go somewhere without a high speed internet connection, and you can't play. &nbsp;Go outside one of the 21 countries not supported by MS, and you can't play. &nbsp;And it doesn't matter if you supposedly
 'own' the games. &nbsp;MS can stop you from playing 'your' games at any time, for any reason. &nbsp;And there is no way for you to prevent it.</p>
<p>So there you go, the alternate view.</p>
<p>And NO, I am not a PS4 Fanboy. &nbsp;I am a MS fanboy who has been made sick by the direction MS is going.</p>

<p>Fair enough, i have never been one to lose internet for long periods of time and if i need to ill find a way, i also heard that the check in only requires kilos so high speed internet is not a necessity &nbsp;i guess. I like the give feature but it is kind of
 meh that it can never be given again meh But yes i can understand your points.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft is just trying something early that the world is going to have to deal with later.</p>

<p>Actually it is a possibility that since a check in only requires KB/s of data, your mobile phone can basically do it.
</p>
<p>On the subject of the RAM</p>
<p>The principle differences are:</p>
<p>•DDR3 runs at a higher voltage that GDDR5 (typically 1.25-1.65V versus ~1V)</p>
<p>•DDR3 uses a 64-bit memory controller per channel ( so, 128-bit bus for dual channel, 256-bit for quad channel), whereas GDDR5 is paired with controllers of a nominal 32-bit (16 bit each for input and output), but whereas the CPU's memory contoller is 64-bit
 per channel, a GPU can utilise any number of 32-bit I/O's (at the cost of die size) depending upon application ( 2 for 64-bit bus, 4 for 128-bit, 6 for 192-bit, 8 for 256-bit, 12 for 384-bit etc...). The GDDR5 setup also allows for doubling or asymetric memory
 configurations. Normally (using this generation of cards as example) GDDR5 memory uses 2Gbit memory chips for each 32-bit I/O (I.e for a 256-bit bus/2GB card: 8 x 32-bit I/O each connected by a circuit to a 2Gbit IC = 8 x 2Gbit = 16Gbit = 2GB), but GDDR5 can
 also operate in what is known as clamshell mode, where the 32-bit I/O instead of being connected to one IC is split between two (one on each side of the PCB) allowing for a doubling up of memory capacity. Mixing the arrangement of 32-bit memory controllers,
 memory IC density, and memory circuit splitting allows of asymetric configurations ( 192-bit, 2GB VRAM for example)</p>
<p>•Physically, a GDDR5 controller/IC doubles the I/O of DDR3 - With DDR, I/O handles an input (written to memory), or output (read from memory) but not both on the same cycle. GDDR handles input and output on the same cycle.</p>
<p>The memory is also fundamentally set up specifically for the application it uses:</p>
<p>System memory (DDR3) benefits from low latency (tight timings) at the expense of bandwidth, GDDR5's case is the opposite. Timings for GDDR5 would seems unbelieveably slow in relation to DDR3, but the speed of VRAM is blazing fast in comparison with desktop
 RAM- this has resulted from the relative workloads that a CPU and GPU undertake. Latency isn't much of an issue with GPU's since their parallel nature allows them to move to other calculation when latency cycles cause a stall in the current workload/thread.
 The performance of a graphics card for instance is greatly affected (as a percentage) by altering the internal bandwidth, yet altering the external bandwidth (the PCI-Express bus, say lowering from x16 to x8 or x4 lanes) has a minimal effect. This is because
 there is a great deal of I/O (textures for examples) that get swapped in and out of VRAM continuously- the nature of a GPU is many parallel computations, whereas a CPU computes in a basically linear way.</p>
<p>basically even though GDDR5 is made for better graphics, it can cause lag. (what we saw at e3, perhaps?)</p>
<p>X1 and Ps will be almost equal in power. It's also not microsoft stopping us, it is the publishers decision. If the publisher doesn't want to implement the cloud guess what? No 24 hour check up on that game.</p>

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD drive not working&#47;missing registry values</h2>
                    Hi! I've been trying to get my machine to read a DVD (a movie), however it will not run it. When I tried other DVDs, it wouldn't run those either. When I called Dell tech support, they remotely took control of my machine and attempted to uninstall Daemon
 Tools Lite. When they couldn't find the uninstall file for it the tech support guy went into the system registry and began deleting values within it. He went too fast for me to track it. After he did that, I started getting messages from iTunes saying that
 it was missing registry values to read/write CDs and DVDs. Could someone tell me how to restore such values to the registry?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Re-install Daemon Tools Lite (does not matter if it runs) - when complete REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Use Revo Uninstaller - Free Version to remove Daemon Tools Lite<br />
<br />
Revo Uninstaller - Free Version<br />
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a><br />
<br />
After Revo is finished close the program and REBOOT<br />

<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />

<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<br />
3. After trying the above in a thorough manner (doing this before doing the above is probably<br />
a waste of time as the same errors would be present) try a Repair Installation which allows you<br />
to keep the programs and data though redundant backups are always a good idea.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows in Safe Mode loads a limited set of drivers. Though a little complex you can have it load audio in many cases.<br />
