<h2>            Renaming of Folders</h2>
                    <p>I am using Win 10 v1709 Build 16299.309 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, along with many others, have an issue of not being able to Rename a Folder from the Right Click Context Menu.</p>
<p>I have Full Ownership of the Folder in question.</p>
<p>I did not have this issue on earlier versions of Windows.</p>
<p>This is an essential Command for any Operating System.</p>
<p>I am surprised that Microsoft have not corrected this annoyance with an Update, as it goes back a long way in time.</p>
<p>The numerous suggestions on the Internet do not work.</p>
<p>The Fix for this should come directly from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please advise of a Proven, Successful Fix for the Issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The function is still available, however no known bug has been confirmed. For this one, normally according to reports, we shouldn't be able to rename folders if you are viewing them in Small Icons. Suggested is to adjust icon view to anything apart from
 Small Icons and you shall be able to rename the said folder. (Source: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/b4da4617-f4ec-465e-a43d-f7e365784f99/still-cant-rename-folders-in-windows-10-file-explorer?forum=win10itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>TechNet</strong> <strong>Forum</strong></a>). Please access the said link/thread for other solutions proposed by our community members.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have any other concerns, don't hesitate to come back to us.</p>

<p>Thank You; but changing to Lists does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is ridiculous - Renaming of Folders and Files should be able to be carried out regardless of Icons or Lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also; i notice that I cannot Cut and Paste from one Folder to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think this is a Bug - I think it is a Programming Stuff Up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should have a Proper Fix for this Bad Programming - Users should not have to muck around with a multitude of suggested fixs, including the Registry, which many do not understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still seeking Wise Input for this issue.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I have also encountered occasional problems with naming Folders and it very much has to do with what Menu you are viewing the Folders in.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When I open "This PC"&nbsp; (by either typing that into the Cortana/search window or saying "Hey Cortana open This PC) in the Desktop on the left there is a Folder labelled with (username) whatever yours may
 be. It is the name of the person with verified admin authority to use this device. When I click on THAT I see a list of all the Folders I have installed on my device.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From there I can edit those folders by right clicking to change the name. I can move and paste new information to those folders, ANYTHING I want to do.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OTHER Menus are not quite so accommodating.</p>

<p>Thank you to all who have responded to my query.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was able to Rename a troublesome Folder (Medium Icon) by adding "All" to the end of Folder Name.</p>
<p>Today, after reading posts, I tried to Rename that same Folder, by removing "All" from the Folder Name.</p>
<p>Error Message:: Close Folder or File and Try again..</p>
<p>I am Logged in as an Admin User and I have Admin and User Ownership (Full Control) of the Folder in question.</p>
<p>Changing Icons to Lists does not and should not make a difference in Renaming Folders.</p>
<p>I went backwards 5 levels of Folders to My Documents and <strong>successfully Renamed
</strong>my Adobe Folder (Medium Icon) by adding "All" to the Folder Name.</p>
<p>I have not got a clue as to why this should or could make any difference.</p>
<p>In my extensive experience in servicing computers, I have never encountered an issue with the Renaming of Folders, with older Windows Systems.</p>
<p>I believe this is a Programming Issue and should be attended with a Microsoft Fix<strong>;
</strong>but how do you bring it to the notice of Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards and Thank You</p>

<p>Hello Keith, Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I went into Safe Mode and was able to Rename that particular Folder with success and I then Renamed it back to its original state, with success.</p>
<p>This just not make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then Restarted, then went to the same Folder, where I was able to Rename it by adding "All" with success.</p>
<p>I the tried to Rename it back to the original state and that Failed with the usual error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a Loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And off topic, is the ridiculous drawn out procedure to enter Safe Mode.</p>
<p>What was ever wrong with the old Function Key Method, that had been in fashion through all versions from Win95 to Win 8.</p>
<p>There is nothing like making a Simple Process, Complex.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who are these current day Microsoft Programmers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You Keith.</p>

<p>F2 works as it always did if things are normal. If things work in Safe Mode, then something optional is starting later that is interfering with things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step is to see if you can rename after a Clean Boot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another likely suspect when things aren't going right in Explorer is a poorly-coded Shell extension. Troubleshooting those is done by downloading ShellExViewer, using it to disable 3rd party Shell Extensions:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Again, the fact that rename works in Safe Mode means that the problem most likely is not caused by Windows itself. You've just got to do some good old-fashioned process-of-elimination troubleshooting.</p>

    <title>GamerTag Inactivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h2kzer0  say:</h3>
<h2>            GamerTag Inactivity</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Readers,<br />
<br />
My name is H2Kzer0 and there is a Xbox gamertag I been waiting to snag. It has been 4-5 years now. The user has been inactive on day one. The individual basically got the gamertag and never used his or her account, with only 0 gamerpoints. My point it this,
 us hardcore gamers want our gamertags that we are usually known by. Sometimes noobs get these gamertags and go inactive for years and years. Recently I got sick of waiting, now that it has been officially 5 years that the gamertag I want has been inactive
 by that user. The Microsoft employee on the phone confirmed that the policy for inactive members is "7" years and that to me is unacceptable. Something needs to change in favor of the members who are active members of Xbox live. Are we not the core of the
 gaming platform? Are we not the very heart of the Xbox franchise? 7 years is too long to wait to claim a gamertag from someone who obviously isn't playing or who is obviously not a dedicated member. A year to two years is a fair amount of time to budget and
 reclaim your name. If not reclaimed then give the gamertag to the real gamers who rightfully deserve that name; as we live for the gaming world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My request from Xbox personnel and those appointed to assist other gamers is to bring this topic up to Microsoft. It needs to be addressed and it needs results. I am sure that I am not the only one who has notice this issue. Maybe a suggestion of allowing
 a reservation on gamertags for the right price. So not only does my idea come with a marketing plan but it also reflects the concerns of hardcore gamers wanting to feel more at home.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>sorry game tags are not just used for Live gaming but also used for Windows Live games for PC and Zune so you will just have to keep trying to change your name to that name or change it to something different as you cannot request a game tag that is being
 used.</p>

<p>I appreciate the responses, however I am not giving up. What others call a waste of time I see as room for improvement. I will continue to contact a supervisor or someone who can take my suggestion to heart. I am sure that I am not alone and others feel
 the same as I do. </p>
<p>Responses such as: "Dude do you have no life? It's just a gamertag," "Waste of time," and "Never going to happen are not answers to my solution."</p>
<p>Yes, my problem may be mediocre to the other problems out there but it is still an issue and I am a customer wanting results. If gamers rarely use their gamertags then they should forfeit their gamertags earlier than the 7 years standard requirement. I am
 suggesting Xbox to change this policy. I will keep everyone updated on my progress. When you want something you do not stop going after it or say it is a waste of time. People say that about politics and look at our country because of that mentality. That
 is right, nothing gets done or corrected. I am one of the few who sees an issue and one of the few determined to see results. Thank you for reading and for the respectful responses. Any negative responses will be ignored.

<p>Dear H2kzer0</p>
<p>There is no way around this. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but simply the only way anyone will every be able to do something like that, as far as remove a gamertag from an unused account, will have to be done by a teir 3 agent or an agent you cannot
 speak with on the phone. If the gamertag your trying to take is someone else's account then there is no way possible to get that. You were misinformed by the agent on the phone as you probably spoke with someone new or someone who just wanted to give you an
 answer but for an account to go inactive it takes way more than 7 years. The reason why they have it set up like this is for those who leave us and want to come back at a later time will always still have the same account. I believe just as everyone else that
 this should be limited to a year or two years however the only way this can be changed is by directly contact Microsoft and not a supervisor that cant do anything on the phone. To contact Microsoft there is a feedback link at the bottom of the page. I know
 you say you really want to try and find something but they are simply the only people you can actually talk to that would be able to do something as the policy is what it is. Since the gamertag isn't your's its just not an option to get that gamertag until
 our system deletes it. To contact anyone they can change that policy there is a feedback link at the bottom of the page. It will go directly to our Microsoft agents in Washington. Sorry for the bad news.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;H2Kzer0,<br />
<br />
I hear where you are coming from. There is a tag I am also hoping to get someday.. ;)<br />
<br />
If you are looking to change some policies, I would suggest posting in the&nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_feedback/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox LIVE Wishlist/Feedback</a>. This is the best place to discuss awesome ideas such as this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the note of releasing old GT's, have you seen what <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/yahoo-accepting-requests-inactive-email-ids-205604767.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Yahoo is doing with their old email address</a>? Seems like a good way to do it. Maybe someday we will do something similar. :D</p>

            Hi IntenseJames
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can have only one Onedrive of one type - One personal Onedrive + One business Onedrive. 
<br />Hence, you can't have two personal Onedrives / two business Onedrives.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Generic USB Audio Device drivers will not load</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a lenovo x301.<br />
<br />
I am trying to connect a series of music devices (keyboards and microsphones) to my laptop to no avail. here are the pertinent facts:<br />
<br />
- The devices all work on&nbsp;6 other Windows 7 machines of a variety of types<br />
- The devices all use the <strong>generic</strong> 'USB Audio Device' drivers. There are no specific drivers for these devices.<br />
- My USB key seems to work - so the USB ports are basically functional.<br />
- The devices friendly names are all identified<br />
- The .sys and .dlls that are used on the other 6 machines are present on the X301<br />
- When I go into the device manager and try to manually choose the 'USB Audio Device' driver - it is not available. i spent hours looking for it : - )<br />
<br />
I am mystified.<br />
<br />
Help :-(</p>

            For Security Issues on NTFS drives:<br />
This may be part of the problem.<br />
1. Make Yourself An Administrator User<br />
2. Set the permissions on your OS partition (like C: Drive) to EVERYTHING YOU ARE to Full<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ADMINISTRATORS/USER/COMPUTERNAME/SYSTEM/EVERYBODY&nbsp; (well, everything you think you are)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There also may be something like OWNER which you give special permissions and not full<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you got to close the properties after making each major change then reopen to contunue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you made the ADMINISTRATORS be the OWNER this means you got FULL and SPECIAL permissions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all ADMINISTRATORS which is the most possible freedom&nbsp;that I know of.<br />
3. MAKE the Admininstrators OWNER of everything possible ( some things are always prohibited so it seems )<br />
4. possibly run chech disk after this<br />
5. If everything boots up after shutting down you can continue but until you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; are able to shut down cold iron and restart in MSCONFIG normal mode<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; you are having serious troubles that must be fixed first.<br />
<br />
FOR THE USB PROBLEM:<br />
THIS WAS CERTAINLY MY PROBLEM.<br />
NOTE: REMOVE ANY TEMP HARDWARE STUFF CURRENT PLUGGED IN, FROM YOU USB PORTS<br />
6. If you can not get the proper drivers to load or no response when trying to plud in USB cameras or MP3 players do the following<br />
&nbsp; A.&nbsp; GO INTO THE VARIOUS WINDOWS FOLDERS; &nbsp;inf ( may be hidden); SYSTEM32&nbsp; AND SYSWOW64( GOT A 64 bit system )<br />
&nbsp; B. RENAME ALL FILES THAT BEGIN WITH wpdxxxxx.inf/.pnf/.exe/.dll/.*&nbsp; to [WILDCARD].[WILDCARD].OLD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this way you save the old files without destroying them ( save them forever or until sure you can delete/kill them )<br />
7. POWER OFF your SYSTEM, wait 15 to 30 seconds<br />
8. RESTART ( power on ) your system<br />
9. WAIT UNTIL YOUR SYSTEM FULLY BOOTS ( DISK ACTIVITY LIGHT EXTIGUISHES )<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS may take several minutes like 10 or 15 minutes then you just see small flickerings of your drive<br />
10. PLUG into any USB port that is free your removiable drive devices<br />
11. You should now be getting a response from windows like it is the very first time you ever plugged it in<br />
<br />
NOTE: This was the only way I could fix this problem after days of playing around with this problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no error solutions given by microsoft itself that will solve this problem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if this does not work for you the only solution that I can think of will be to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; restore your system before the problem or reinstall the entire OS within the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same Partition without disturbing any of your other partititions.<br />
<br />
IT seems to me that windows installed a seperate WPD driver for each and every device you connect<br />
to USB and that explains why all the various WPD files. So much is going on it takes the programmers knowledge<br />
to properly fix this issue and thay are just not creating decent error messages that will help<br />
you fix these things as a layman.<br />

            Hi SleepyAlligator,<br />
<br />
<br />
The connection issue you're experiencing when streaming online videos might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to the specific website/s you're trying to visit. It may also be due to an intermittent internet connection.<br />
<br />
That being said, do you have a stable internet connection? Have you tried using a different device in streaming the same videos online to see if the same issue will persist? Just to confirm, do you mean you're not experiencing the same performance issue with
 your mentioned websites?<br />
<br />
If it's a possible malware, you may run your antivirus software to check if there are unwelcome files on your system.<br />
<br />
Can you share with us when did this start happening? What were the recent changes made before this happen?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.
        </p>

<p>I'm not sure how stable my Internet is or isn't, nor how to check on that. Occasionally in a game, I'll get a message or some lag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try videos on another machine. This is the only machine I have, however. When I stream videos, sometimes on one website where there is a clip, sometimes on another for news or something, I will have to wait while it loads throughout the video, pausing
 every so often.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than it possibly having something to do with Starwars: Battlefront II, the game I'm currently enjoying, I do not know of any recent changes.&nbsp;</p>

            It is a volume license key used by organizations and is managed through Key Management System hosted on a centralized server. Hence, you can not use it.
<br />
<br />Notice the word KMS (Key Management Server), GVLK (Generic Volume License Key )
<br />
<br />The key is not a valid key to be used. It is a counterfeit license. You will have to buy a new license for Windows and use that.

<div><br />
Prime95 Setup;<br />
- extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice<br />
- double click on the executable file<br />
- select "Just stress testing"<br />
- select the "Blend" test.&nbsp; If you've already run MemTest overnight you may want to run the "Small FFTs" test instead.<br />
- "Number of torture test threads to run" should equal the number of CPU's times 2 (if you're using hyperthreading).<br />
The easiest way to figure this out is to go to Task Manager...Performance tab - and see the number of boxes under CPU Usage History<br />
Then run the test for 6 to 24 hours - or until you get errors [b](whichever comes first)<br />
The Test selection box and the stress.txt file describes what components that the program stresses.</div>

<br />
<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<em>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.<br />
If you continue to get BSOD here are some more things you may want to consider.</em><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the in-built memory diagnostics (run MDSCHED) or the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing.</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

            <p>The request deposit button is only available when you have at least 1,000 credits pending, but less than 5,000. It's just so you can have credits deposited before needing to have 5,000 pending first. Once you reach 5,000, they are automatically scheduled to be deposited by the following 15th or 30th of the month. So if you get to 5,000 between the 1st and 15th, they are deposited at the end of the month. If you get to 5,000 between the 15th and 30th, they are deposited by the 15th of the next month.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro RTM 0x80070035 error trying to access a shared folder on Vista</h2>
                    I see this error appears a lot in this forum. So, I'm not going to go thru each one, looking for Windows 8 posts<br />
<br />
Anyway, I see from a few searches in Google this is starting to become a prob, with some people, who use Windows 8.
<br />
<br />
If a PC (with a previous version of Windows on it),&nbsp; is networked to a Windows 8 PC, it can access the shared folder in Win8. However, Windows 8 cant access a folder on previous versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
It comes up with a message saying the above. The 1st time I clicked on diagnose, it said there were no probs with this computer.
<br />
<br />
But there is a config prob with the networked PC (Vista). There is nothing wrong with Vista. It networked fine with the previous version of Windows I had installed (Win7). And nothing has been changed in Vista<br />
<br />
I've tried 3 times (while I'm still in Win8, I havent rebooted yet). Just by closing the network window and reopening it, it gives me access and then path not found the next time<br />
<br />
1st time path not found. 2nd time got access to the shared folder in Vista. 3rd try. Path not found again.<br />
<br />
So, this sounds like a bug or something in Windows 8.&nbsp; It's like something is timing out or something. Because I just got access to the shared folder again. after a few mins.<br />
<br />
There are no firewalls on both of these. Just windows firewall. File and printer sharing are ticked on both. The only diff is, I installed Win8 on this PC the other day. And Win8 cant access the shared folder, I created in Vista<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>

<p>b) Type ‘<b>Windows firewall</b>’ and press
<b>Enter</b>.</p>

<p>a) Press ‘<b>Windows + W</b>’.</p>
<p>b) Type ‘<b>Defender</b>’ and press Enter.</p>
<p>c) Click on ‘<b>Settings</b>’ tab and uncheck ‘<b>Turn on real-time protection</b>’.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b>Warning</b>: Antivirus software, Windows Firewall and Windows Defender can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</p>

            I dont use Homegroup, the only PC networked is Vista which doesnt support it. So, its disabled<br />
<br />
From what I've tried / seen its like it doesnt let me access the shared folder at first, but after so many minutes I can get access. Its like Win8 shuts me off, from accessing the shared folder in Vista. Which doesnt happen, if I want to access the shared folder
 on Win8 from Vista. I get in the folder everytime I try<br />

            <p>I have exactly the same issue - this is a fresh install of Windows 8 Pro RTM. The moment the updates go on Network seems broken. Additionally I notice RAS Async adapter has code 45 status and is greyed out. Disableing firewall for private network solves
 the 0x80070035 issue instantly. I also tried resetting firewall with no effect on the spurious 0x80070035 error when accessing certain network shares. The Network troubleshooter finds no issues, the machine(s) in question are listed in NETWORK&nbsp; yet when trying
 to access "Network path not found error 0x80070035" comes up. ALso uninstalled NIC drivers, reinstalled etc. with no effect. This is clearly some BUG.
</p>
<p>When things are working the way they should RAS Async adapter is logged as present in device manager.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Ideapad S510P touch on windows 8.1. the keyboard will randomly stop working (just like it did midway through this sentence).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to use the touch keyboard to login and for anything else once logged in. the only time it works is when i disconnect the battery for 10 seconds and start up the computer, but it only worked for 5 minutes till i started typing this. touchpad and touch
 screen still work, just not the in-house keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried updating the driver but it said that it is up to date. is this now a hardware issue? really hoping its not... ive already checked filter keys and sticky keys, and they are both turned off.<br />
</p>
<p>any suggestions? sorry for poor capitalization and grammar, it just sucks typing on touch screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>note: it may be from when i touch numbers....</p>

<h2>            My usual desktop has gone on windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hi! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my windows 8.1 device to windows 10 last night. Once I upgraded the start menu and the others were as in the description but in about 5 minutes, while I was checking the new features my usual desktop disappeared. Now my start menu is all over
 the screen and it's really wired and annoying at the same time. I tried all the things in settings menu but nothing worked. I even tried restarting it but didn't make any difference. Every time I open and closes another window the usual windows&nbsp;7 and 8 desktop&nbsp;appears
 and vanishes in a second but I&nbsp;can't get to it. If anyone can help with this problem, I would really appreciate it!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. I really appreciate that. But I'm sorry to say that it didn't work. I still have the same problem I had. My desktop keeps vanishing and I can't access it at all. If you have any other solutions I would be delighted to read and follow
 them.</p>

            <p>Sounds like you might have changed the setting for the Start Screen to tablet mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look under settings, personalization, then Start and look to see if the option to use start in full screen is set to on. If set to on the start screen would likely cover your whole screen as you are describing.</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying and I'm sorry to say I have tried it but didn't work. I can't access my desktop at all. Anyway thank you again and I think since my laptop is a mini 2 in 1 laptop, it's more like a tablet and I guess that's the reason even if I change
 my settings as you say it doesn't work and I guess I'm going to have to live with it.</p>
<p>

    <title>Audio issue with Windows 10 laptop when headphones are not plugged in. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindayz45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio issue with Windows 10 laptop when headphones are not plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>My Lenovo laptop (with Windows 10 installed) is having trouble with audio and I'm unable to hear it except when my earphones or headphones are plugged in. My laptop's left stereo channel is working fine but the right isn't. When I&nbsp;tried changing the volume,
 I either only hear the first tiny bit of the sound and I don't hear the rest of it or I do not hear it at all. I tried a series of solutions such as troubleshooting and uninstalling and reinstalling the sound driver using Device Manager but faced no luck on
 getting it fixed. Are there any solutions to get the audio issue fixed so I can hear through my laptop again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further details, my sound driver is Conexant SmartAudio HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: My laptop model is Lenovo G40-30 80FY. My laptop had Windows 8.1 pre-installed but I upgraded it to Windows 10 for free via the Get Windows 10 program.</p>

            Hi Cindayz45
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these steps and check after each step. You have already tried some of these, skip them.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />4. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Guided Walk though - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Adviser. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps to fix your Audio issue.
<br />- Check with boo-table disc and load other Operating system to check your internal speaker. (it will install all drivers and work from cd/dvd)
<br />

<br />
<br /> If its not working in other os also, i recommend a hardware service for laptop.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved. re

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the "Balance" for the speakers ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is entirely possible that your right speaker is failing... Either the speaker itself, or the connection...</p>
<p>It may even be a problem with your headphone jack\plug connection sticking, and not fully turning on the speaker when it is removed...</p>
<p>All I can suggest is to try tinkering with the speaker output settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try surround sound and any other variations of settings you have available...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of them vary by machine... Others are part of Windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click on your Speaker Icon (Volume), you should see "Playback Devices"...</p>
<p>This will list everything available to play audio... Try different selections, then hit apply...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be a Icon on your Taskbar for the Conexant SmartAudio HD...</p>
<p>Right clicking on it should bring up a menu with something like "Manage" as a option...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current machine uses a RealTek Audio which looks like this...</p>

            Tried the method you provided as well as trying out the generic audio driver then uninstall it and reinstall Conexant SmartAudio HD and it worked so therefore, its fixed for now. Thanks for the help! In case my laptop gets audio issues again, I’ll let
 people know.

<p>My laptop's sound isn't staying that way and recieved an audio issue again, previously, I was able to hear the audio again but had some glitches prior to the audio being broken and unheard again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to school today and I checked the TSO at lunchtime and they didn't help me fix it then I went to the school office and said they'll do what they can to fix it (I'll have to visit the school office the next school day and they may ask a computer specialist
 to fix it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's the hardware issue, not the software or setting issue that's causing the audio issue. Hopefully the school office staff and the specialist will fix it ASAP (I have funding by the way, not all personal laptops have school fundings).</p>

    <title>Speakers&#47;Headphones mish-mash&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sleepy.girl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speakers&#47;Headphones mish-mash&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am having a strange problem of which I haven't been able to find a solution.&nbsp; I have a 2.1 stereo system speaker set up to onboard audio in my dell desktop running windows 7 64 bit (fresh install, new machine).&nbsp; A few days ago, the speakers stopped working.&nbsp;
 I was surfing the internet when I first noticed it and had not changed anything noteworthy.</p>
<p>After several reboots and troubleshooting, the speakers are still not working.&nbsp; But I discovered a few strange things.</p>
<ul>
<li>The subwoofer continues to work while the two speakers do not.&nbsp; </li><li>Connections to and from speakers were checked, re-plugged in.&nbsp; I can clearly hear them connect to the subwoofer upon plugging in the connections.</li><li>Headphones plugged into front jack kind of work;&nbsp; It sounds as if they are playing what the top speakers should be playing but vocals/voices are extremely difficult to hear.</li><li>Subwoofer continues to work with headphones plugged in. </li><li>If I disable the speakers, both the headphones and subwoofer stop working.&nbsp; If I disable the headphones, both the subwoofer and headphones continue to work.*</li><li>Plugging in the default audio (speakers) to front headphone jack does nothing.</li></ul>
<p>I have taken a lot of steps to fix this; I'll rattle them off so I don't waste your time listing off the basics. :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Ran audio troubleshooter. No problems detected. </li><li>Updated drivers for sound card from both device manager and dell.com. </li><li>Uninstalled drivers, rebooted, then re-plugged in so drivers would get a fresh reinstall.</li><li>Ran "Fix It" at <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems</a>.&nbsp; Only problem detected was that headphones were disabled (see above).</li><li>Removed physical connections for both headset and speakers, reconnected. </li><li>Verified that none of the volume settings were muted. </li></ul>
<p>Do you have ANY idea what may be the issue? I am nearing my wit's end.&nbsp; Thank you in advance! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit: Do you think Ventrilo settings could have messed this up in any way?</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />
system description<br />
TOSHIBA Laptop, Model L505-S59903, Intel Core 2 T6500 @ 2.1 GHZ, with 3GB memory<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit, SP1, newly installed 8/16<br />
installation dvd was burnt from Digital River .iso for win 7, Home Premium 32 bit SP1<br />
Win 7 Product key has been activated<br />
<br />
system does not have anti-virus installed but windows firewall is active<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem Description<br />
<br />
After installing windows I used windows update (WU) to install the first<br />
group of about 25 updates.<br />
About 20 installed before a reboot was required.<br />
After that 2 more installed and the rest failed with the 80070570 error.<br />
I restarted WU and had a group of 55 updates to download and install.<br />
Several installed but 51 failed with the 80070570 error.<br />
<br />
Since then none have installed with WU!<br />
<br />
<br />
Corrective actions attempted<br />
sfc <br />
chkdsk<br />
clean boot<br />
Numerous uses of Mr. Fixit<br />
<br />
Manually reset Windows Update Components per the steps provided in KB 971058<br />
&nbsp; To rename the catroot2 directory I had 2 stop the cryptsvc service.<br />
&nbsp; Some of the registry steps failed because of bad or missing entry points into the dlls.<br />
&nbsp; Some of the registry steps failed because the specified DLL was missing.<br />
<br />
I have been able to manually install individual updates listed as "Security Updates for w7".<br />
I can not manually install updates listed as "Update for Windows 7".&nbsp; These manual updates download<br />
a Genuine Validation program on my computer.&nbsp; When run, this progam provides an error message
<br />
that say it is out of date, get a newer program!&nbsp; Don't you just love M$!<br />
<br />
I have tried using WU to install single updates or in small groups.<br />
In all cases WU failed with the 80070570 error.<br />
<br />
I have also tried reinstalling win 7 and using win 7 RTM iso instead of a SP1 iso.<br />

            No - running sfc /scannow will not help.<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will not replace a missing msvcrt40.dll file.<br />
<br />
That is not how sfc /scannow works, that is not what it does and that is not what it is for.<br />
<br />
I know because I booted into Safe Mode so Windows File Protection is not running, deleted the msvcrt40.dll file on purpose, rebooted normally and ran sfc /scannow to completion and the file is still missing.<br />
<br />
Why don't you try it yourself and see it it helps?<br />
<br />
I don't know why Support Engineers who are engaged by Microsoft continue to suggest things that have no chance of working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you never actually try your own suggestions to see if they work or do you just post a link to the System File Checker KB article
 every time there is a DLL problem and never actually try it yourself?&nbsp; These useless ideas just waste time and will only further frustrate the person with the problem when they don't work.<br />
<br />
Every time there is a DLL problem, some Support Engineer seems to suggest sfc /scannow and that is not going to to be the solution, and if the original poster does not have a genuine XP installation CD with the same Service Pack as their installed Service Pack
 (most people don't), sfc /scannow is going to complain - alot.&nbsp; You need to mention that too, or don't suggest it at all.<br />

            What is your XP version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
What is the complete message you receive regarding the missing msvcrt40.dll file?<br />
<br />
For example, here is a popular one:<br />
<br />
AAM Updates Notifier.exe - Unable To Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because MSVCRT40.dll was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Exactly what does your message say?<br />
<br />
Since the msvcrt40.dll file is covered under Windows File Protection it should never be missing and it takes extra effort to delete it.&nbsp; If it is really missing, it was probably quarantined (effectively deleted) by you unspecified antivirus/antimalware software.<br />
<br />
There may be a copy of the msvcrt40 file in other places on your system.&nbsp; Look and see if you can find a copy in one of these folders:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
If you can locate it in one of those folders, copy and paste it into this folder where it belongs:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
If you can't find it, you can download one from my SkyDrive and put it into the folders where it belongs - that is assuming that the Support Engineer advice will get you back on the Internet.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here is how to do that:<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these two folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />

<a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called msvcrt40 when the file name really needs to be called msvcrt40.dll (if the downloaded file has no extension you will
 have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
That may not solve all your issues, but you will at least be past that part and then we can fix the rest.<br />

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 10 and wanting the old key - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 and wanting the old key</h2>
                    Hello, I have recently acquired a new SSD and want to change my old HDD in my laptop. This laptop runs a genuine Windows 10 version that I have installed from a disk (as a Windows 8 back in the day and upgraded). I would like to reinstall the windows on
 my new SSD but I have no idea where I can get my old key back from, as I never had a key for windows 10 but a free upgrade , but on the other hand I had a key for windows 8 that I can't find anymore. I would like to know if there is a way to get the key from
 my current installed windows for a re-use.

            Yes. Activation in Windows 10 is quite easy. Windows 10 uses digital license mechanism where your Hardware ID with Activation information is stored on Microsoft servers. As soon as your system connects to the Internet, your OS is activated. <br />But,  Make sure to install the same version of Windows though.
