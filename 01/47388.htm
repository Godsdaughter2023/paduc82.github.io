                    I installed windows 8, now when I play scrabble, the red ball moves the letter off of screen instead of placing it where the arrow is.

<h2>            In Windows 10 the thumbnails on my photos don&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently bought a new laptop and after transferring all my stuff onto it, the thumbnails on most of my photos (not all) don't display.</p>
<p>This doesn't happen to every single photo and some work totally fine.</p>
<p>I have tried all the solutions I could find online and none of them have worked. I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearing the disk cache for the photos</p>
<p>I've made sure the show thumbnails box is checked in both file settings and in the system settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that sometimes happens is that when I open the photo file the thumbnails will appear for a second or two but then flash and some will disappear while others stay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I've noticed that if I change the view size from Large icons to medium then all the thumbnails are visible but this is pointless because they are too small to see which negates the whole point.&nbsp; As soon as I mess with the view size then they all disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be great because I am about ready for setting fire to the laptop!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Carl.</p>

            Hi CarlKnowland
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following and check after each
<br />
<br />If these are Onedrive pictures (you can right click on a file &gt; Properties and see whether you path has Onedrive in it) - Right click on Onedrive app &gt; Uncheck Files On Demand &gt; Reboot your PC
<br />
<br />Otherwise do following for non Onedrive pictures
<br />
<br />1. I am assuming that in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Extra large icons. large icons or medium icons - One of them is checked, As these are only views which would show a thumbnail of picture. 
<br />
<br />2. Open File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; View tab &gt; Uncheck Always show icons, never thumbnails (If this is already unchecked, check it and OK..Then go back again and uncheck it and OK
<br />
<br />3. Type control in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Control Panel &gt; Type system in Control Panel search box &gt; Click View advanced system settings &gt; Click Settings under Performance &gt; Check Show thumbnails instead of icons
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

</p><p>
</p><p><em>If you see this reported you can help customers understand that their system does have DirectX 12, but they need a video card and driver that supports it to fully utilize it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Their best bet is to refer to the IHV (NVidia\AMD\Intel) sites to see what

<h2>            Surface pro pen not writing fluidly</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have had my surface pro 4 for a couple of weeks and have been using the Surface Pro pen which has worked excellently. However during use a few days ago the writing became jagged and is not pretty much unusable. I have attached an image to this question
 to illustrate the result of writing with normal pressure applied</p>
<p>The Microsoft troubleshoot suggests changing the battery which I have tried and re pairing the bluetooth device, which again I have tried unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>Can anyone help? <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/12ec7bf6-8e51-4c53-bf47-b6f7f94c50b0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Windows 10 highly unstable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geordankrahn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 highly unstable</h2>
                    <p>This is not a question, just a statement. I have used Microsoft's products for years without issue. I recommend Windows over anything else because its familiar and easy to use and a damn good platform to both learn on and create on, however, my recent experiences
 have caused me to change my mind about this. I was not going to waste my time here, but i think i need to else Microsoft wont learn a damn thing. My current hardware uses the X79 Intel chipset, and i purchased Windows 8.1 pro to begin learning software development.
 As stated before i was a Microsoft enthusiast. I willingly went for the Windows 10 free upgrade figuring the OS would be better than 8.1.</p>
<p>Well, a few short days after the upgrade i started getting bluescreen issues, mostly kernal power issues(never could figure out the cause). Nothing that i could fix myself, so i ignored the issues figuring an update would solve my problem. I thought i was
 correct here when i got build 1511, holy crap, no more stability issues, gaming was great and i could learn development and use my machine for long periods of time. Then one day i noticed a forced restart due to an update. I got the Anniversary Update build
 1607. This build was used for almost a whole year. But during that time i had continuous issues, only corrected by clean install or restore points. Software development was out of the question and gaming was the only thing i could use this system for. I figured
 out how to fix some of these stability issues myself, but these fixes were always short lived as every signle day an update would reverse the work i had done, so i gave up on it. Finally my system corrupted when i installed a new HDD(exactly the same as the
 other one in my machine). Windows was trying to read as a RAID device but i had RAID disabled in the UEFI and the bluescreens were happening daily now . The problems compounded even more when i re imaged all the way back to build 1511, which for a few days
 was perfect and 0 problems. i liked it this was and even contacted microsoft support to disable automatic updates so i could reliably use my computer. Support disabled the service responsible for auto updates and GAURUNTEED it wouldn't update to the newer
 builds. He was wrong, as my windows DID infact try to update, got corrupted and once again i had to clean install. Luckily my data was on another HDD. So by this point i had the Creators update build 1706, and i was having so many bluescreen issues and then(after
 just 2 days since the clean install) windows updated alot of my drivers including my display driver(there was nothing wrong with Nvidias driver, why force a generic display driver?) and when it restarted, i refused to properly boot, appearantly my boot sector
 was overwritten, so i went into the recovery environment and i couldn't even sign into my Microsoft account in the recovery environment, even after a password change it refused to sign in. my only option was yet another clean install. This time all my data
 accross all drives could no longer be accessed. Performing a clean install corrupted all my data completely, and this never happened before. So i decided to make my last purchase to Microsoft EVER! I bought windows 8.1, and downloaded the media creation tool
 on windows 10 one last time. Im now using windows 8.1 pro until it goes end of life. I really enjoy using it, by far much more stable and reliable than the entire 2 years i used windows 10. AND NO FORCED UPDATES. im honestly afraid to turn on auto updates
 due to the terrible stability issues i had with windows 10, and i have used windows xp, vista, 7 in the past with updates turned on. These past 2 weeks have been VERY productive, i turned auto updated off indefinately and found a way to disable maintenance
 to avoid lock up, otherwise 0 issues, bluescreens gone, no more kernel power errors, no more driver corruption. It should be noted that i use trusted software including Microsoft Visual Studio. As stated before i prefer Microsoft's products, but after this
 experience i will NEVER invest in the future of windows. I am already test driving various Linux OS's and may even consider MAC OSX for software support. I think it would be in Microsofts best interest to scrap windows 10 and build a fresh new OS which doesn't
 cause these kinds of issues, My brother's laptop bricked because it updated to the creators update.(automatically updated) He used an older Sony Vaio and we checked the manufacturers website for window 10 support, his model was not supported. Why force an
 update for a computer which is not compatible? At least i can still use my machine, his laptop is fried. Terrible support, terrible experience. I dont need to hear about everybody else's great experience using windows 10, some chipsets are supported better
 and windows 10 works fine for those machines, in my experience, my chipset is not meant for windows 10 and actually performs better with 8.1. This kind of check and guess compatibility is garbage. Microsoft, i was once a big enthusiast now I'm preparing to
 migrate to BETTER and more STABLE environments to work in.</p>

<h2>            Hard to explain issue.</h2>
                    
<p>I've been off xbox live for a few months and have had a new wireless router since the last time I played online. I bought a month's membership last week and have struggled to play any games.</p>

<p>I am fully connected to xbox live, I can join parties and chat with no problems. I mostly play call of duty and fifa 12, but I turn fifa on, and occasionally it lets me play one online game before saying that I've lost my connection to the ea servers, and
 will not reconnect at all, yet i am still in a party with perfectly good connection. Call of duty is even worse. Whenever i try matchmaking I'll get into a game and within 30 seconds it kicks me from the game telling me that there's a problem with the call
 of duty servers (this happens with modern warfare 2 and 3, and black ops) the game keeps allowing me to join games and then kicking me, extremely frustrating.</p>

<p>Need a solution as this issue is very frustrating, thank you.</p>

<p>also, i am using a 250gb xbox 360 elite with a wireless adapter.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You'll find quite a few people with similar issues here with Virgin <a href="http://community.virginmedia.com/t5/Gaming/bd-p/Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
community.virginmedia.com/.../Gaming</a></p>
<p>Try going wired as a test if you can, but if you still have the same issue wired I'd say its likely to be an issue with Virgin, does it happen all day or just peak hours?</p>

            <p>Check for obstructions that is close and could interfere with your router's signal strenght aswell as the external wireless network adapter. Try changing your router's wireless channel manually to a different channel (e.g. 11). Try changing/lowering the wireless mode (802.11 mode:). If your router's wireless security protocol is set to WEP try changing it to WPA or WPA2. Make sure UPnP is enabled.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I appreciate what you are saying but wireless can be troublesome, just because it worked before it doesn't mean it will always work, a new device in the home could affect wireless, your neighbour could have a wireless network that is drowning yours out,
 many things can affect wireless.</p>

            Hi Cindy.
<br />
<br />Does sound like malware.
<br />
<br />If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the cause.
<br />
<br />No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an extreme overkill point.
<br />
<br />How do I find and remove a virus?

<br />TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com.

    <title>Moving recovered data to existing Windows 10 system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhohenstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving recovered data to existing Windows 10 system</h2>
                    So I recently had a failed hard drive.&nbsp; A company was able to recover all of my data but moved it to a non-bootable drive.&nbsp; I literally have ALL of the data in the exact same file directories and structure it came from.&nbsp; My question is, can I copy all
 folders/files back to my new Win10 system to replace all current data and have it behave the same as my original drive before it failed, meaning all programs and system settings would be restored as they were?&nbsp; As I mentioned, it's literally an exact copy
 of all files from my dead drive, just without the OS.&nbsp; I'm reading on other forums that the system backups and registry are saved in these system folders so I was hoping that if I just replaced what was there then it would work.&nbsp; Any advice or suggestions
 are greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thanks!

            You can have all your data copied back but not programs.
<br />Programs have to be installed to the operating system because it has to register dlls etc. 
<br />So if it is just your documents folders, music, favorites etc.
<br />I would go to each folder do a select all and copy and then paste them in your folder in the machine.  This is the safest way to do it without messing up your existing operating system.  Seen to many users try and recopy a drive and lose permissions etc.  
<br />That is my recommendation :)

            Hi John
<br />
<br />All you can copy over from that data is your personal files - Documents, Images, Videos . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Programs and settings will not be able to be carried over, you will corrupt your new Windows Installation
<br />
<br />Copying over Applications is not an option, they will need to be re-installed afresh
<br />
<br />Do not copy over any Registry files or entries - you will corrupt your new System

    <title>&#34;Wireless networks Detected&#34; followed by &#34;No wireless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> np560  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Wireless networks Detected&#34; followed by &#34;No wireless networks were found in range&#34;</h2>
                    Trying to help a friend with their laptop!&nbsp; It is a Lenovo R61i laptop is model 8932A54, about 16 months old.&nbsp;
<strong>WIN/XP SP3</strong> is the only OS.&nbsp; It was working on this wireless network until they went on vacation and tried to connect to public wireless networks! Their daughter's laptop continues to work fine with this wireless network, and it also shows all
 the neighborhood wireless networks as well.&nbsp; The R61i&nbsp; Has a built-in wireless "<strong>Intel Pro\wireless 3945ABG network connection</strong> " wireless adapter.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Connectivity and internet access works fine via the ethernet port.<br />
<br />
Here is what I have done so far:<br />
<br />
It has Norton AV.&nbsp; I made sure it was up-to-date, and then ran a full system scan.&nbsp; It was clean.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated and I WILL RESPOND regarding results!<br />
<br />
Ran Windows Update (after I got it working - see below) to get all critical updates.<br />
<br />
Did a "Repair" on the wireless connection with these results:<br />
<ul>
<li>Wireless networks detected </li><li>No wireless networks were found in range </li><li>Windows could not finish repairing the problem because the following action cannot be completed: Connecting to the wireless network
</li></ul>
This when the laptop is 5 feet from the wireless router.&nbsp; It is a Dlink<br />
Updated the driver from the Lenovo web site per recommendation from Intel support:<br />
<ul>
<li>old driver was 11.1.1.11 </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>new driver is 12.4.0.21 with a date of 3/4/2009 </li></ul>
<br />
Went into BIOS and reset BIOS to its original settings, saved and rebooted.<br />
<br />
Checked Device Manager.&nbsp; Everything looks OK, no yellow or red devices<br />
<br />
Deleted the network adapter and let Windows re-create it.<br />
<br />
Disabled and Enabled the network adapter<br />
<br />
Checked the event logs.&nbsp; The only entry is on the System log.&nbsp; I don't know if this event log entry is significant or not, but here it is:<br />
<br />
Source: NETw5x32, Category None, Event 7036.<br />
The service entered the \DEVICE\{78E5EBB6-A194-4E9F-A840-E05CC39A5823} state.<br />
<br />
0000: 00 00 08 00 02 00 62 00<br />
0008: 00 00 00 00 7c 1b 00 40<br />
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br />
0018: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br />
0020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00<br />
0028: 57 44 52 56 e7 00 00 00<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not yet tried bringing it up in "Safe Mode with Networking"<br />
<br />
I should add that "Windows Update" was also not working. Getting: Some updates were not installed.&nbsp; Error code 0x41. I did get it going by downloading and installing the latest version of Windows Installer 3.1, version 3.1.4001.5512<br />
<br />
Don't think there is any relationship between these two problems, but stranger things have happened.<br />
<br />
The laptop has a 3-year extended warrenty and I am about ready to toss it in Lenovo's face as a hardware error.&nbsp; The thing that blows my mind is "Wireless networks detected" followed by "No wireless networks were found in range"<br />

            Hi Shawn<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance.&nbsp; Here is the final resolution to this problem.<br />
<br />
The "clean boot" you suggested worked as indicated, but it had no effect in making wireless networks visible.&nbsp; Ditto booting in "Safe mode with networking".&nbsp; We took the laptop to Office Depot; they ran basically the same tests I did, with the same results.&nbsp;
 Their Tech did manage to get it to connect to the store wireless network by Defining it Manually, but it still wouldn't show under "Display Available Networks".&nbsp; He suggested we call their 800 support number.&nbsp; The only new thing the phone support guy came
 up with was to "Ping 127.0.0.1" which I don't think involves the wireless in any way.&nbsp; He wanted me to call Comcast to check out the internet connection.&nbsp; Under the principle of "don't create a new problem while you are working on an existing problem", I resisted
 going here as two other computers are working just fine on this Comcast connection.<br />
<br />
We finally settled on doing a complete reload of Windows.&nbsp; This consisted of pressing a blue key on the laptop during boot to bring up "Rescue &amp; Recovery", then specifying "Restore my hard drive to the original factory state" and "do not save any files" - we
 previously backed up the contents of "My Documents" onto a thumb drive.&nbsp; This reload really didn't take as much time as I had thought it might; only about an hour.&nbsp; Most Important ---&nbsp; NOW THE WIRELESS NETWORKS APPEAR; and connect as they should!&nbsp; We did have
 to apply SP3 as the reload brought it back to a SP2 status.<br />
<br />
I guess the lesson here is that sometimes just reloading Windows is the most time-efficient solution to some of these mysterious problems.<br />
<br />
I was having a hard time convincing myself that it was a hardware problem when the system would detect wireless networks but would simply not show them!<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your assistance.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi gearbrain,</p>
<p>Is it happening for all the applications installed on your computer?</p>
<p>You may try creating a shortcut again and check if it is working.</p>
<p>This problem occurs because of a Microsoft Windows function that does not allocate the shortcut memory structure correctly if the shortcut (.lnk file) has a target of less than 14 characters.</p>
<p>To work around this problem, make the shortcut read-only. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Right-click the shortcut and then click Properties.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click the General tab.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click to select the Read-only check box, and then click OK.<br />
Check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>You may try creating new user account by following the instructions in the link below and check if it is working.</p>

This should not keep happening every 15 minutes OP, If no one has any other suggestions it seems like your console may well need a service.
<br />
You can set that up by phoning support for your region or on this website.</em></p>

<p>The thermal paste might be going bad or the cpu chip heatsink might be loose. Either way it needs service and doing it yourself is very difficult, so the best thing is to have MS fix it.</p>

</p><p>I understand that you would like to write your signature on an online document through touch input. I'm here to help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, could you provide a bit more information about your issue? We would like to know whether you are using the desktop or metro version of IE and whether you have been able to do this on other sites. Also, is the section with the signature a field
 for written input, or is it some other item on the page? Which website is this on? You may want to contact the website administrator about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know this information so that we can help you with this issue.</p>

<h2>            Theater mode remove videos</h2>
                    
<p>I had almost 2GB of space on my drive. Now I'm under 500MB. The drive space started "vanishing" after I started on MW3. I've disabled the theater in vault, but that space is still there. Any ideas on how to remove that stuff?</p>

<p>Hi Phoenix Seven7</p>
<p>You can remove any game recordings by going to settings/Storage/your drive/Game and apps/</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Find the MW3 dir and i you'll find files called "game replay file" you can safely remove all of them and they avg 2-3 mb each</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Ps if you have any difficulty finding them feel free to message me or invite me to a party chat on xbox</p>

<h2>            BSOD 0x0000003E MULTIPROCESSOR_CONFIGURATION_NOT_SUPPORTED - Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have just installed a 2nd processor in my Windows 7 x64 machine.<br />
<br />
I cannot now boot into Windows as I am getting a BSOD with the error message MULTIPROCESSOR_CONFIGURATION_NOT_SUPPORTED<br />
<br />
Both processors are exactly the same model number (Intel XEON X5460 quad core)<br />
<br />
I have done a search and found a link to&nbsp;this KB update (for Windows Vista/Server 2008)&nbsp;-
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973879/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973879/</a>, which I have downloaded,&nbsp;but&nbsp;it DOESN'T run under Windows 7 - I just get a message saying that the update package is not applicable to my machine.<br />
<br />
Is there a similar update package for Windows 7?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rob

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: System File Checker (SFC)</strong><br />
SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</div>
<div>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:<br />
a) Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type <strong>cmd </strong>in the Start Search box.<br />
b) Right-click <strong>cmd </strong>in the Programs list, and then click <strong>
Run as administrator.<br />
</strong>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
c) At the command prompt, the following line, and then press <strong>ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow</strong></div>
<div><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7?<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</strong></a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to keep the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.
<br />
A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.<br />
You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After the trouble shooting steps, refer to<strong> Step 7 </strong>
from the clean boot link to set the computer back to normal start up mode. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue persists, I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer support for further assistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this information helps.<br />

            Instead of using Device Manager, go to the Asus website and download the new version of the driver directly from them. &nbsp;That should do the trick, I've had lots of users come back and say getting the new driver directly from the manufacturer solved the
 problem.

            <p>Hello Fatty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>

<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on “Settings” tab and then uncheck the option “Real Time Protection”</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on “Save changes”.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            wired xbox one controller with samsung galaxy s5</h2>
                    I want to use my wired xbox controller to play some older games on my phone. I have micro usb adapter for it but I can not get the controller to work with my phone. I have checked that the adapter is working with other usbs and I can't seem to figure out
 why my controller will not even turn on. I can only find help regarding the 360 on the internet, can any body help me?
