<h2>            Microsoft Flight &#40;2012&#41; LIVE access code &#40;product key&#41; is needed&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I reached 215 G in the game Microsoft Flight 2012. A few years ago I bought the Hawaii pack through marketplace, as well as 'Moule'&nbsp;aircraft. Some days ago this game was corrupted and I deleted it. Then I decided to reinstall it again. When I try to
 sign in, it is necessary to enter the key (valid product key). The key that I entered a few years ago I could not find. Is it possible to regain that LIVE access code &nbsp;(product key)? Please, is there someone from tech support, who can really help me with this
 key to enter the game !!!!!! WolfPhantassin</span></p>

<p><b>&nbsp;<br />
</b>Hi. I recently installed all of my Sims 1 on my Vista pc. Because I installed them in the wrong order The Sims updated itself when I tried to play and removed
 all the expansion packs. I then tried to install it again but it keeps telling me that House Party is already installed but it gives me the option to install it when i insret the disk. I have removed the sims from the uninstall/remove programs from Control
 Panel, and have manually removed the file from C:/Program Files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been on The Sims website and done everything possible as to what they have asked, and they said The Sims House Party is stuck on my reigistry
 and this is something I need to ask Microsoft for help with please can you help me? Thanks</p>

<p><span><br />
If you feel adept to the task, you could remove the offending the entries from the registry yourself. Click on:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Start --&gt; Run... ---&gt; Type in Regedit --&gt; Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The keys would probably be in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE or HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Look for the Sims or Maxis. Deleting the entries out should enable you to reinstall it again, but be careful in the registry and make a
 backup of anything you delete using File --&gt; Export in the Registry editor. You could mess up your computer.<br />

            <div>Hi Ashlyn,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing issues with apps in your Blu Windows Jr phone. I will be glad to assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you tell us:</span>
</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message when you try to open the apps?</p>
<p>2. Which all apps are you facing problem with?&nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try the following suggestion and see if it helps:</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to install all the latest windows updates and check if <br />
it helps.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try doing <strong>Soft Reset </strong>and see if it helps.<br />
<strong>Soft Reset</strong><br />
The <strong>soft reset </strong>is the same thing as pulling your battery (on devices where that is possible). This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation. You perform
<br />
the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then press and hold the <strong>volume down</strong><strong> + power</strong> buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the
<strong>'slide down to power off' </strong>prompt appears).</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Example of situations where the soft reset should solve the problem:<br />
•An app that usually starts won't start<br />
•The camera won't open<br />
•The device starts using too much battery<br />
•The device starts behaving oddly.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Startup Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys so here's the deal. &nbsp;I have recently updated my OS to Windows 10 Pro (clean install from ISO file). &nbsp;I did this on a different computer because the computer, my main rig, was giving me issues installing the OS so I swapped the drive over to my other
 desktop and installed the OS, no problem, the drive works on the other rig and boots right up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, when I try to boot from the same drive on my main rig I get through POST and the computer gets stuck on the windows logo after the little dots spin in their circle for a few goes around. &nbsp;I have tried removing excess hardware (NIC card, excess
 USB hardware, CD/DVD drives etc.) to the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw another post that said when the user restarted the machine he/she had no issue booting. &nbsp;However, I cannot even restart the machine as it gets stuck from a cold boot and the only way to start over is to completely shut the machine down and boot from
 a complete power down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where I think the problem may lie:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running on an (ancient) IBM Intellistation Z Pro 9228</p>
<p>8GB Ram</p>
<p>Dual CPU's both Intel Xeon 5150's.</p>
<p>GPU is a Nvidia Gtx 1060</p>
<p>Main Hard Drive: Seagate Firecuda 2TB SSD/HDD Hybrid drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have booted from this drive before with an older version of windows and wanted to upgrade to ten in order to grab the drivers necessary for the GPU which I recentlypurchased, thus spiking this whole problem to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input/suggestions are a great help and thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Jericho,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the response, however I had originally had Window 10 Enterprise version 1511 installed on my machine. &nbsp;I was having issues installing a graphics driver which I thought was due to the fact that I was running enterprise so I downgraded to Pro.
 &nbsp;Little did I realize that I had "downgraded" to Pro version 1607. Since posting this question I reinstalled Enterprise on my machine and, after some fiddling, realized that the issue was the anniversary update (1607) as the machine only gives me this issue
 when the anniversary update is installed. &nbsp;</p>

            Hai arul thanks for the reply. I try all options. Because I had good knowledge on computer maintenance. I think drivers are not supported for both problem's. After trying all as I know I didn't get any result. But in win 7 I didn't have the problem . Drivers
 are updated by drive pack solution. Before in win7 cntrl panel smart audio icon is there. In win 10 there is no icon . Plz give any other suggestions.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing digital audio archival work. Today I was given 2 memory sticks, 1 with MP3 files the other Wav files from the sound engineer who has been cleaning up these files. They were originally analog, which once digitized needed to be cleaned up further
 with an add on program to Pro Tools on an imac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to open one of the WAV files, this message box came up -</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(12, 52, 61, 1)">Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(12, 52, 61, 1)">When I tried to open a MP3 files, this message came up -</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(12, 52, 61, 1)">Windows Media Player encountered a problem while playing the file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(12, 52, 61, 1)">The basic digitized recording prior to clean up opened and played without any problems.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Tracy - One idea that comes to mind is that you could try opening the files with 'Audacity' - normally that will open both wav. and mp3 files (<strong>Important</strong> -
<p>If that fails then you'll need to consult your sound&nbsp;engineer regarding what method he used to create them.</p>
<p>Info and Audacity download here... (make sure to check for unwanted add-ons before saving)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.audacityteam.org/about/</a>
</p>
<p>Edit - I should just also ask that you have checked the usb device in another port - possibly even on another PC...</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

<h2>            Booting and shutdown speeds are slow</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is Asus ROG GL553VE and my OS is installed on 128gb SSD (It is not an NVMe SSD). I'm on the latest windows update 1803. I've noticed that after updating to the latest windows version the startup and shutdown times are really slow. I've disabled
 fast startup and I ran into few issues while using it. It was significantly fast before updating to 1803 and without using fast startup. I always keep my system updated.</p>
<p>Also, I regularly run disk cleanup and disk defragmentation at least&nbsp;once every month and I've disabled all unwanted startup programs.</p>

<p><span>The startup speed was significantly improved after I updated some random drivers vis device management. I updated WiFi and Bluetooth&nbsp;drivers and that resolved the network disconnection issues. Also after I updated to 1803 I noticed some hardware drivers
 which performed well after update going haywire after a few days. It usually works okay after reinstalling or after disabling and then re-enabling it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>After searching the internet I saw that the startup and shutdown issues are widespread throughout the Windows 10 community. My 7-year-old desktop with windows 7 ultimate, 4th generation i3 with an HDD has a significantly better startup and
 shut down speed than my high specced gaming laptop. It is high time windows did something to resolve this issue.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>I booted to safe mode. AFAIK safe mode has only essential windows processes and all third party drivers and softwares are disabled. Even while shutting down in safe mode it took nearly the same time. Also, the disk usage
 LED was on indicating high disk usage. Most probably the issue lies within windows itself.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1)Disable all your third-party anti-viruses and enable&nbsp;<span><span>Windows Defender</span></span>&nbsp;only.</span></p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>This doesn't use to happen while in windows 1709. I don't think my antivirus is causing issues. I'm using Kaspersky Internet Security and it is updated regularly so it isn't causing any compatibility issues.<br />
</p>
<p><span>2) Keep at least&nbsp;<span>30%</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>30GB</span>&nbsp;of free space on your hard drive for optimum results.</span></p>
<p>A: As for the hard disk part, my primary drive is a SATA SSD, it has nearly 50% free space. My secondary drive is an&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HDD which is also well maintained. Both drives are regularly optimized and defragmented.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I've noticed that during shutdown there is a high amount of disk usage as the disk indicator LED is almost like it is ON.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) Make sure that your hard drive is not full (With warning message indicated in&nbsp;red colour).</span></p>
<p><span>A: No, it is not full and is not in red colour</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4) Make sure you are using an&nbsp;<span><span>Administrator account</span></span>.</span></p>
<p><span>A:&nbsp;</span>I've only one account on my laptop so it is the administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5) Unplug all unnecessary external devices that are not currently in used (External hard disk, webcams, USBs, etc.).</span></p>
<p><span>A: No, external devices are left connected while startup and shut down</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6) Have a stable Internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span>A: I don't know how having a stable internet connection affects startup and shut down speeds and in case if you were&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wondering I do have a stable internet connection</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7) No background applications running.</span></p>
<p><span>A) Other than the regular windows processes and other necessary processes nothing else is running.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8) All other programs and applications that are not in used were closed.</span></p>
<p><span>A) All foreground and running applications were closed before shut down</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>9)&nbsp;</span>If you are using a laptop, make sure that the power adapter is plugged in.</p>
<p>A) Yes, I'm using a laptop. The startup and shut down speeds are similar while plugged in and on battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) Update the&nbsp;<span><span>BIOS</span></span>&nbsp;(Basic Input/Output System) driver by downloading them from your computer manufacturer’s website.<br />
A) The BIOS is updated and is the most recent one available</p>

As mentioned before I do my updates as soon as it is available. I'm on the latest version of 1803 with the latest cumulative update KB4284835. Also like I said before, the issue worsened after feature update 1803. All issues mentioned before still persists
 even after installing the latest patch.

            Actually I found the culprit for the slow shut down today. One of the updates enabled the clear page file at shutdown. Disabling this option by modifying the registry did the trick. Now the shutdown speeds are back to normal.

<p>
</p><p>Every time there is an upgrade to Windows 10, all my font settings are totally destroyed!&nbsp; I am nearly blind and when Win10 first came out it took me 3 days (no exaggeration) to get all my font settings back the way I need them, now once again I need to
 do this. &nbsp; I have most of them fixed, but my task bar, clock, and live mail are so small I can not read them and have found no way to fix this problem. I know how to make the icons on task bar larger, but that does not increase the text size enough. What am
 I missing?</p>

<h2>            Intel atom z3700 processors not compatible with windows 10</h2>
                    I am writing for those who have a winpad or tablets like me with intel atom z3700 series processors, i upgradet from windows8.1 32bit to win 10 32bit and when i made the clean win 10installation there a many driver incompatibilities with intel chipset
 so i can not use it with this defive i hope microsoft and intel will fix this problem because i also forgot to write down my 8.1 windows product key and i cannot go back to my previous windows, its the worst horrific problem i have ever had with computers
 because now i also cannot install windows 8.1 i made a 8.1 usb bootable but with no key i cannot do anything and i have bought this winpad one month ago im very unlucky now the only thing i can do is buy a new one and i have no money :( and needed this to
 work with all the money i had for this i dont understan why microsoft sais that my device is compatible when it is not, this is very sad, and for shure they will say me to buy a new 8.1 windows licence, what else can i do?&nbsp;

<h2>            amdkmdap stopped responding and Application &#63;&#63;&#63;.exe has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware.</h2>
                    <p>Recently i have been getting these errors all the time:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Application ???.exe has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Display driver amdkmdap stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the solutions i have seen, reinstalling drivers, changing graphics settings, monitoring GPU heat (around 56C) when gaming, adding/changing TdrDelay qword.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently changed my GPU to a RX460, with CPU being Pentium E5700 - i am upgrading this this week though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason why it's doing this? is it a bad GPU? I've only had a a few weeks and it's already been back to the supplier who can't find a fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>All games, or just those that stress the system the most ?</p>
<p>- TDR errors can be notoriously tricky to troubleshoot. The error always blames the driver, which all too often</p>
<p>sends people on a failed mission of trying different drivers,&nbsp; but the reality is the driver can be the last part
</p>
<p>of a chain of events that causes the lag which results in a TDR, and if you have not installed a new driver</p>
<p>around the time the TDR's start, it is very unlikely the real culprit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you are upgrading I reckon you may as well wait, as this will (should) rule out any hardware you are replacing</p>
<p>(cpu and motherboard ?&nbsp; RAM too ? ).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>[EDIT: </em></span>I forgot one thing. Have you checked for a BIOS update since getting the RX460 ? While not always
</p>
<p>necessary, a newer BIOS is often helpful with new series gpu's ...&nbsp; </p>
<p>Another reason for waiting for that new cpu &amp; motherboard ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The source of the issue can be either hardware, or software. Software conflicts are often</p>
<p>overlooked. You may find a conflict with a Service or Startup program by running in Clean Boot.</p>
<p>- Note that Clean Boot does not help isolate programs you may launch manually after booting into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- While heat can often be a clue to a problematic gpu, other things can go wrong with the gpu that don't</p>
<p>create excessive heat, but generally these will show as artefacts, or the card will just suddenly cark it.</p>
<p>If the TDR occurs often the supplier should have also had an issue with it if the card is faultin, but if it
</p>
<p>is not persistent he could well have missed it, as you can bet he would not have spent a full day actively
</p>
<p>testing all scenarios.</p>
<p>Fair chance the gpu is OK though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A problem with HDD and RAM are also contenders,&nbsp; so they should also be tested for errors.</p>
<p>- Inadequate, or irregular current from an old or cheap psu is another potential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Regarding the Registry key. I reckon 10 is a bit higher than necessary. 8 is plenty high, and&nbsp; I've done
</p>
<p>well using 5 for about six years. I wouldn't risk disabling&nbsp; TDR altogether.</p>

<p>It used to be on the newer games (ones that demanded 4-cores+(i have a dual core at the moment)), but now it seems to be anything, even older stuff with graphics turned down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled Windows 10, but this did not cure the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have the newest version of the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried swapping/changing the slots with the ram. like i said, i'm getting a new mobo, ram and CPU so that should rule out faulty RAM/CPU. PSU is brand new too.</p>

<p>Yes, the new hardware may well sort out your problems.&nbsp; If not, you need to do the hard yards
</p>
<p>regarding software conflicts.</p>
<p>If you have not already, I would still run tests on the HDD/SSD as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to testing the HDD/SSD with Windows disk check, <em>Crystal Disk Info</em> shows details for a number</p>
<p>of parameters that can lead to issues. </p>
<p>I have a couple of old HDD's that I use for extra backups because they have&nbsp; yellow flags on one or two items,
</p>
<p>and I found that while Win7 did not have an issue with them, Win10 seems to want to 'fix' (but fails to)</p>
<p>them all the time, particularly when I ran a WIn10 Clone on one of them .</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I had been using windows movie maker for quite some time but when my old computer was replaced, I now get this message when attempting in import .avi files.</p>
<p>.avi cannot be imported because the codec required to play the file is not installed on your computer. If you have already tried to download and install the codec, close and restart Windows Movie Maker, and then try to import the file again.</p>
<p>I do not know which codec is missing or where to go to get it.</p>
<p>My operating system is Windows XP<br />
Please advise.<br />
Thanks.</p>

=======================================<br />
There are many types of .avi files...the following utility can<br />
help you identify the codec that was used to create the .avi files.<br />
<br />
If you download GSpot and drag/drop the .avi file on it...you<br />
can find out which codec you need to play it.<br />
<br />

(left click the text:&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Download GSpot')<br />
(on the next screen.....<br />
left click:&nbsp; 'Download [ GSpot 2.70a ]')<br />
<br />

Or... you might try installing a codec pack.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always best if you create a System Restore<br />

<p>I would suggest you to restart the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot:</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</p>
<p>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</p>
<p>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</p>
<p>f) On the
<b>‘Startup’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></p>
<p>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. </b>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.<br />
d. Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
<br />
</b>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</b>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing
 the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</b>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem
 item.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step 7:</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</p>
<p>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</p>
<p>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would also suggest you to
<b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create a new user account</a></b> and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the above steps do not resolve the issue, I would suggest you to
<b>refresh</b> the computer and check if it helps:</p>

            As I said earlier. Method 1, Method 2 was not an option for me. Method 3 did work.
<div><br />
<div>I did try out refresh my pc last night itself and it worked. I saw the same answer now. :-)&nbsp;</div>

<div>This is the only issue. even i had to install my antivirus again.</div>

<p>I see this issue regarding error reporting since beta version. How come Microsoft is not looking to solve it. Its more than 8 to 10 months that this error is reported and that too it is a critical error.&nbsp;</p>

 short of ram windows, and then other errors, and the oddest thing is I started getting phones calls half way describing what is happening, but it is from a linear chart graph, and so I did not quite put it all together until I got the werfault.exe windows

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update error - 0xc1900101 - 0x20017</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have been trying to update my old Asus F5SL laptop to Windows 8.1 for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have this weekend performed a reinstall of Windows 8 onto a new SSD to improve performance, and then thought I would try the 8.1 update from the store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No joy - received the error 0xc1900101 - 0x20017 after the blue screen following first boot after the update completes installing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read online that this one is possibly down to card reader drivers, so I uninstalled the SD card driver from Device Manager and tried again - no luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will keep trying!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Martin</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2) You may try out some hardware related troubleshooting actions to the machine and they might be helpful. For example, a user fixed the issue by removing picture card, while another by replacing
<em>PCI-E</em> Card from the motherboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3) Make sure you’ve have everything related to Operating System updated to latest one like drivers, hardware component etc. Outdated components may also be the root cause.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As you have already run the Upgrade assistant and everything appears to be compatible, it is not the issue with the laptop.
</span>You should not disable Windows updates as you stated in the previous response.
<span>There are some updates you might need before you can install
</span><span>Windows 8.1</span>. In most cases, the latest updates will be installed automatically using Windows Update. But if you don’t have automatic updates turned on and you need to check for updates manually, or if you'd like to check to see when the
 latest updates were installed, you can do this from Windows Update. </p>

            <p>Hi Mahesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nirmals instructions include a step to disable windows from updating drivers following a fresh install of Windows 8, so that is what I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran windows update to install the required KBs to make the 8.1 upgrade appear in the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted ASUS my laptop manufacturer to see if they have any suggestions - I hope they are working with Microsoft to resolve the driver bugcheck issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is 6 years old, but works fine with Windows 8 - I really hope we can work together to get to the bottom of this problem. So many others are affected.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here are some additional tips :<br />
<br />
Be careful as a lot of these programs and services actually need to run and often removing a few<br />
does little to speed the machine while making the&nbsp;machine less friendly to use.<br />
<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135<br />

How to troubleshoot performance issues in Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950685</span></a><br />
<br />
Optimizing Microsoft Windows Vista Performance<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/959062<br />
</span></a><br />
To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click TaskBar -<br />
Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick reference (if you have<br />
a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />
<br />
How to Check and Change the Startup Programs in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a><br />
<br />
A quick check to see which are loading is Method 2 there - using MSCONFIG then post a list of those here.<br />
<br />
Method 1 using Windows Defender will tell you more specific information about each program.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is a little more complex though you might have a few services running you can do without.<br />
Be careful as disabling a service can impact the ability of other services to run and cause issues<br />
down the road.<br />
<br />
Also some programs add services which might not really need to be starting automatically. You can<br />
often put these type services on Manual to reduce their impact on performance.<br />
<br />
To see these compare those in Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top Right Click on it RUN AS ADMIN<br />
to those in the default of Vista as listed here by BlackViper. Ignore and that are on Disabled (which do not run)&nbsp;or
<br />
Manual (which run only on demand)&nbsp;- for any Automatic or Automatic Delated Start you can post those in here if<br />
you need help deciding if you need to run them. A few of those could be set to Stop and Manual so the calling program can run them as needed.
<br />
<br />
BlackViper also makes some tweaks to the default windows services however I would not do those unless you<br />
really understand the total significance of changing a default service. So use it as a tool to compare.<br />

<br />
you need done for now.<br />

-------------------------------------------------------<br />
Another thing that help performance is updated drivers - Vista loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Readyboost can help, more RAM and ReadyBoost is even better and RAM is fairly cheap these days.<br />
<br />
The max readyboost drive supported in Vista is 4 GB - if you get a drive larger than 4 gig you can use the
<br />
remainder for storage.<br />
<br />
You need a very fast drive and pay little attention to manufacturers claims they are ReadyBoost Ready as<br />
even some slow drives claim that.<br />
<br />
ReadyBoost does it make a difference<br />

<br />
I use a SanDisk Titanium and it does pretty well - check the Speed Ratings users get at Techcrater to<br />
help decide the brand to get.<br />
<br />
Hope these help.</p>

Limit how many programs load at startup
<div>
<p>Many programs are designed to load automatically when <span>
Windows</span> starts. Software manufacturers often set their programs to open in the background, where you can’t see them running, so they’ll open right away when you click their icons. That's helpful for programs you use a lot, but for programs you rarely
 or never use, this wastes precious memory and slows down the time it takes <span>
Windows</span> to finish loading.</p>
<p>Decide for yourself if you want a program to load at startup.<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more
 disk space:</span></p>
<p><span>Programs and Features: Uninstall unwanted Programs.</span></p>
<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the
<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the
<strong><span>Scan</span></strong> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<strong><span>
</span></strong>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />
<br />

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then
<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator
</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator
 or insert the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:
<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<h2>            Surface Book - Cannot get NVidia GPU to work with Visual Studio 2017 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book with i7/16GB/1TB Performance Base, and I cannot get Visual Studio 2017 Pro to use the dGPU. I have selected Visual Studio in the NVidia control panel, and selected the dGPU from the list for it to be default for that program, and still,
 when VS launches, it does not use the GPU, as evidenced by the detach icon not showing it in use, and the screen being able to be detached. I know that the GPU works, as Photoshop uses it, and when it is running, the screen cannot be detached. Even going to
 the folder where devenv.exe is, and right-clicking that file, and running with the GPU does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also switched Photoshop to use the integrated graphics in the control panel, and it did so as expected, so the NVidia control panel seems to be working, just not with VS 2017. I am also unable to get VS 2015 Pro to use the GPU, though I was able to
 get it to work with my prior Surface Book, which was replaced under warranty with the one I have now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            Yes, I've reinstalled drivers. I'm on Creator's update.&nbsp;No error messages. No error messages - VS just runs with the integrated graphics, though dGPU is selected.

    <title>No login screen and hibernation on asus eeepc 901 with windows 7 rc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No login screen and hibernation on asus eeepc 901 with windows 7 rc can anyone help please&#63;</h2>
                    <br />
Hi i've installed windows 7rc on my Asus eeepc 901. Its got inbuilt 3G and i've upgraded the ram to 2Gb and Thrown in a RunCore 64Gb solid state drive. It seems to run quite sweet with full aero options working so really amazed as i would not even of considered
 putting Vista on this spec mc.<br />
<br />
However i have a few issues. First off wheen windows loads you just get a blank screen, you can hear its loaded fine but no login screen is displayed. if you press the power/sleep button twice then the login screen is displayed. I figure its booting into sleep
 mode maybe? anway anyone now why it is doing this and or a fix?<br />
<br />
Secondly Hibernation does not work at all the screen goes blank but machine refuses to turn off, HDD leds jus keep blinking away. There was initialy issues with the power management driver however windows downloaded a new driver in the action center. I've searched
 the asus website in hope of finding windows 7 drivers but have had to wing it with xp driver where possible or whatever windows automatically picks up.<br />
<br />
any help or suggestions would be much appreciated. I'm only a home user so laymans terms please.<br />
<br />
Thanks Si.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry to dig an old thread but this one is on google top 10 :)<br />
<br />
The solution to the problem has arrived from ASUS.<br />
<br />
You should upgrade your BIOS to get Windows 7 boot correctly.<br />
<br />
I have an EEE PC 901 (the first one modded with 128 GB Runcore + 2 GB RAM) and the BIOS 2103 made my day on the RTM from MSDN.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />

            Yopu system needs to find an improved chipset driver for 'ACPI'.

<p>Hi Kat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that the Ethernet is currently disabled. Kindly follow these steps to help you resolve your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Restart your modem and try a different port on the router.&nbsp;<span>If the port being used is broken or doesn’t work well, you cannot be connected to the
 router. Unplug the cable from the port and plug it into another port to see whether the problem resolves.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span>Check the cable. Make sure
 the cable is not broken. Swap a cable to do a test. If the problem is caused by the cable, it will work after swapping the cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 3: Enable Ethernet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
1. Press&nbsp;<span>Win+R</span>&nbsp;(Windows key and R key) at the same time.&nbsp; A Run dialog will appear.</p>
<p>
2. Type&nbsp;<span>devmgmt.msc</span>&nbsp;in the run box and click on&nbsp;<span>OK</span>&nbsp;button. The Device Manager window
 will pop up.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<br />
3. In Device Manager, expand&nbsp;<span>Network adapters</span>&nbsp;category.</p>
<p>
4. Next to the Ethernet card device name, if you see a computer icon with an arrow on it, the Ethernet has been disabled.</p>

<p>
<br />
5. Then right-click on the device name. Click&nbsp;<span>Enable</span>&nbsp;from the pop up menu.</p>
