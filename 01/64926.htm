<b>
<p>Windows 7 Home</p>
</b>
<p>Premium SP1 with RENESAS-USB3-Host-Driver-21281-setup <b>problematic</b></p>
<p>Anything from 1 to 10 re-installations of USB 3.0 driver required for connection to take effect</p>

<p>Windows 8 Consumer Preview </p>
</b>
<p>with Renesas USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 0096 (Microsoft) This driver is Native to WIN 8, when uninstalled , RE-installed automatically with 'Scan for Hardware Changes' or Restart</p>
<p>Anything from 0 to 6 re-installations of USB 3.0 driver required for connection to take effect</p>
<p>Once achieved, connection is solid, can backup etc BUT lost on restart</p>
<b>
<p>OBJECT: </p>
</b>
<p>Demonstrate that problem lies with WIN 7 / WIN 8 - Once connected, that lets your Host Controller and USB 3.0 drivers off the hook</p>
<b>
<p>METHOD:</p>
<p>A.</p>
</b>
<p>Use USB 2.0 - Until the Windows 7 team get their fingers out, time lost trying to make USB 3.0 work better used with that (slower) Backup.</p>
<b>
<p>B:</p>
</b>
<p>For those who want <b>USB 3.0</b> to work and have the thrill of faster Access/BackUp</p>
<p>1. TOOLS: (USB 3.0 Host Controller PCI/PCI-e in your machine)</p>
<p>USB 3.0 Extention Cable (NOT 2.0) for ease of access(!)</p>
<p>USB 3.0 HDD External Drive AND/OR Flashdrive- USB 3 AND/OR USB 2**</p>
<p>** Host Controller and Ext. Cable can also handle USB 2.0, USB 1.1 - Part of WIN 7 weirdness</p>
<p>is when connected, on occasion, USB 2.0 Flash Drive NOT recognised (although connection sound, LED made) - Problem Not experienced with WIN 8 - Solution: Re-install driver</p>
<b>
<p>2.(a)</p>
</b>
<p>INSTALL USB 3.0 Host Conroller Software/Drivers (see list below) IF WIN 8 - not ness.</p>
<p>PLUG IN USB 3.0 Extension Cable (Otherwise you'll be on your knees, many,many times - unless it's a Laptop)</p>
<p><b>(b)</b> PLUG IN USB 3.0 OR USB 2.0 FlashDrive - LED flashing, staying On, b-boing on speakers? - Good - Autoplay Window up? (might not be enabled) so check My Computer - Drive shown as 'Removable Drive'? - SUCCESS</p>
<b>
<p>3. </p>
</b>
<p>ROUTINE for Multiple Attempts to coax WIN 7 into USB 3.00 connectivity</p>
<p>a. Start/Control Panel/Hardware&amp;Sound then OPEN Device Manager (leave open)</p>
<p>b. Expand - Universal Serial Bus Controllers - (near or bottom)</p>
<p>Locate - Renesas Electronics USB 3.0 Host Controller - (Ignore Root Hub)</p>
<p>Right click - select - <b>Uninstall</b> - <b>Ok</b> (If you tick box for delete driver, you'll need to re-install drivers)</p>
<p>REMOVE Flash Drive and/or Ext. HDD</p>
<p>c. Device Manager - Action (pull down menu) - Click on 'Update Driver Software..' / 'Scan for Hardware Changes'</p>
<p>What you want to see: [installing Device Driver Software] (Not shown WIN8)</p>
<p>Then: [Your Device is ready to Use]</p>
<b>
<p>Good, </p>
</b>
<p>but no guarranty of success - failure message? Repeat Step 3<b>.(b)</b></p>
<p>PLUG IN Flash Drive and/or Ext. HDD - Connection? (see <b>2.(b)</b>)</p>
<p>IF NOT - REPEAT Step <b>3.</b> (As many times as you can bear, my limit - 10 times per session) ( 6 times for WIN 8)</p>

<p>OPINION:</p>
</b>
<p>This is a<b> controversial topic</b>, only in the sense that searches reveal many users with this problem and apparent silence from Microsoft (not slagging off, I am a fan)</p>
<p>For Example: </p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=usb+3.0&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=windows_7&amp;askingquestion=true"><u><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=usb+3.0&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=windows_7&amp;askingquestion=true</span></u></a><span>
 Microsoft Answers yields zilch for 'USB 3.0' search</span></p>
<p>The fact that Microsoft are now collaborating with Renesas (was NEC) on WIN 8 Native
</p>
<p>Renesas USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 0096 driver means that it should work and</p>
<p>any solution applied to WIN 7.</p>
<p>This cannot be a priority for Microsoft, only gentle pressure from users might help.</p>
<p>PROBLEM: Some Installations with WIN 7 don't encounter USB 3.0 bug, so:</p>
<p>BLAME: MOTHERBOARD / BIOS&nbsp;&nbsp; [Old PC after all] OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Host Conroller Hardware Card / Firmware OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Host Conroller Software/Drivers OR</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O<b>PERATING SYSTEM (o/s)</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MY ARGUMENT and Simple Logic is:</p>
<p>IF <b>USB 3.0 </b>works flawlessly with WINDOWS XP </p>
<p>THEN Installations of WIN 7 and WIN 8 on the same Platform (Same Hardware),</p>
<p>which exhibit no other problems and are perfeclly stable, should work.</p>
<p>Once connection is established, USB 3.0 works flawlessly - no breaks or drops</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are enough clues above, for someone knowledgable to push the envelope along,</p>
<p>Putting it simply, WIN 7 / 8 are 'weak' in STARTING process even though Device Manager reports 'This device is working properly.'</p>
<p>It might reside at the Boot/Logon stage</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Another thought, IF all was well with these newer O/S's they should be</p>
<p>reporting error codes in Device Manager for USB 3.0 Host Controller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clue: WIN 7 uses more than one version of:</p>
<p>USB Mass Storage Device (Driver Date &amp; Version) {randomly?}</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One is: 21/06/2006 6.1.7600 16385</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1.7601 17514</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7601 17577 There may be more, but not found</p>
<p>any advantage with any particular one re: 'start_up' Glitch</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those who care - WIN 8 example is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21/06/2006 6.2.8250.0 and XP 01/07/2001 5.1.2600.0 </p>
<p>Possible clue: </p>
<p>WIN 8 came up with this error in Device Manager (USB Mass Sorage Device) </p>
<p>- 'Port Reset Failed' - when Flashdrive plugged in on BOOT/LOGON</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's all folks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. What ever you do, don't mention the CHIPSET, I mentioned it once but i think i got away with it...</p>

            <p>I personally am experiencing problems with USB 3.0 and Windows 7, but I believe this is a issue in regards to chipset drivers. Because Windows 7 doesn't seem to have any class driver support for it, but Windows 8 does. In regards to it working under Windows
 XP, that is interesting. Are you sure it is not operating at USB 2.0 speeds.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the interest - Host controller first installed with XP - well tested</p>
<p>eg. Diskmark Seq 31.99 USB 2 - 79.25 USB 3 (read)&nbsp; 45.45 (write) for WD MyBook</p>
<p>Not quite 10 x faster as 'claimed' but worth having.</p>
<p>Can't help feeling that Microsoft has spent scant attention to this Utility, hence fingers pointed in all&nbsp; directions. No of NEC/Renesas driver releases is indication that they are trying and there are others.</p>
<p>Windows 8 is better, less attempts to fire up but my question is if it is chipset driver issue, would</p>
<p>USB 3.0 work at all in WIN 7/8 ?</p>
<p>Just checked Diskmark for USB 3.0 HDD from WIN 7 Seq Read 79.51 Write 47.18</p>
<p>All I can add is, keep trying, method is as detailed as I can make it</p>

            <p>Windows 8 includes native class drivers for USB 3.0 and with the new Ivy Bridge CPU's from Intel, it is automatically supported. See the following:</p>

            <p>I have a Gigabyte GA-X79-UD5 that contains the Fresco Logic USB 3.0 controller.</p>
<p>The driver&nbsp;Fresco supplys works with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Until the chip manufacturers all supply Windows 7 drivers, there is not much Microsoft can do.</p>
<p>Have you tried this?</p>

<p>Now tested&nbsp; six NEC/Renesas&nbsp;USB 3.0 Driver&nbsp;versions/releases, since first one,</p>
<p>(26/10/2009) There must be some reason for all this activity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firmware upgrades for the NEC Chip on Host Controller are available but won't</p>
<p>risk it unless I can ID current Ver.&nbsp; and can revert to it, after all, working well,&nbsp;except</p>

<p>Feel that fix is close at hand, after all there are no catastrophic failures mid Full</p>

            <p>Dear zircon99.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I second your observation(s). Had problems with a USB 1.1 legacy device (printing dongle) on a mid-2011 HP laptop (with Renesas USB 3.0 chip).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recognized odd behaviour of printing dialogue after installation (correct installation that is, when using the USB3.0_allOS_2.1.28.1_PV utility, you will end up having TWO installations of the USB 3.0 driver package on top of each other, must remove/unistall
 the old one manually).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the new properties of the printing dialogue: it now has an option 'open device in administrator mode',
<u>which wasn't there before</u> the update. BUT: you'll have to call up the properties twice (instead of once before), first time normally, second time in admin mode in order to reassign the USB connection (ports, are reassigned upon unplug-replug operations).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have more success with the printing dongle now on this laptop (uses an el-cheapo prolific chip) with WIN 7 x64, only on my other machine (WIN 7 32-bit with NVIDIA 8600GT graphics but intel chipset) it still will stall frequently when printing, requiring
 unplug-replug ops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peculiar, isn't it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But they're definitely getting closer. Hope engineers will work this out for us (millions) of tech-unsavy users (chocolate reward promised for solution provider, honestly!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greetings from Switzerland.</p>

<p>As many users, I'm experiencing the anoying error code on the subject of this post.</p>
<p>This error code ocurs when you try to upload a edited video to onedrive.</p>
<p>Upload studio processes the video. The process bar arrives at 50% and then, after a long while it apperas a message telling you that something was going wrong. You recieve the code on the subject and bye bye.</p>
<p>I've seen on the forum that this error is massive. It doesn't happen to everyone, but to a lot of people.</p>
<p>While Microsoft is working on it, please support that suggestion on XBOX uservoice. We need that Microsoft allow us to download the saved videos through Xbox.com while upload with upload studio to onedrive doesn't work.</p>

<p>I have had a similar problem, the same error code. I try to Upload various videos from a specific time period and everytime I'm prompted with this message, Interestingly when I try and upload videos from a different time period, recorded days earlier, no
 problems what so ever. Xbox customer support just spiel the usual clear this un-plug that rubbish ( as if you had'nt already tried that ) and suggest this error code is to do with NAT settings which is also rubbish. Maybe there was some kind of corruption
 to these files ? Maybe it is time to let go of them videos I know I Have Xbox don't seem to care about it. Frustrating I know but hey since when did Xbox actually resolve an issue.</p>
<p>( You may get lucky and speak to a representative who knows what there talking about it's rare but does sometimes happen)

<p>The message for me has now changed, error code : 0x80040212 stating '' The gameplay clip that you tried to open has been deleted or was never publlished, please select another clip to watch '' Considering the clips in my game DVR I'ts not been deleted on
 my end, and It's obviously not published yet, due to no single verification view showing. Out of interest have you had any problems with the latest update ? I think that has something to do with it, as mine does'nt exist as of yet ? I got the video announcing
 it but no update ? Xbox customer support quoted a different website to me account.xbox.com.en/uk/gameclips ??</p>

<h2>            After windows 10 upgrade I keep getting stuck in airplane mode.</h2>
                    Has anyone gotten any viable info from Microsoft about how to alleviate the problem of computers getting stuck in airplane mode in Windows 10. It seems that they just threw this OS out to us but no one knows how to fix it because it seems that every on
 that has downloaded Windows 10 is having the same problem. When I called the support center none of the so called tech that I spoke with had any answers or clues to how to fix this problem. If anyone knows what to do about it Do Tell. Very frustrated with
 Windows 10 and always having to reset and re install after airplane mode gets locked in. HELP!&nbsp;

Ridiculous as the only way to sort will be for MS to download an upgrade to Windows 10. Unless the PC in question is connected to the internet via an ethernet cable it won't be able to download the patch not that as yet there is one. Not pleased as having brought
 a laptop over from the UK it cannot be used in the US with wifi so had to buy another one. Are Microsoft just plain stupid or careless? They certain seem disinterested in helping out their customers with this issue. Really helpful plugging their new operating
 system without any support.

For 3 months I have had the same agonizing problem with wi-fi since upgrading from 8.1 to 10 but I believe I have found the solution! First connect to the internet via ethernet.<strong><em>You may want to try just disabling or uninstalling the airplane mode
 switch in the Human Interface Device first.</em></strong>Since I have a Dell laptop I went to Dell.com support did the diagnostic and received a service tag number after that scroll to drivers &amp; downloads, choose the find it myself tab. Notice the list of
 driver updates. Before you do any of the updates google or bing (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>order of driver installation</strong></em></span>). This list the order in which to download and install the drivers. After this is done you
 may still have go in device manager under Human Interface Devices and disable the airplane mode switch or uninsatll it. I uninstalled mine. It showed back in after a reboot but I haven't had any issues with wi-fi connection since. My airplane mode can't turn
 on now but my wi-fi is working fine. Yippee! That was the long way around. You may want to try just disabling or uninstalling the airplane mode switch in the Human Interface Device first.

<p>Thanks for your reply, unfortunately, I followed your suggestion and uninstalled airplane mode from HID, but my computer still says its in airplane mode and won't let me manually switch out from settings or by troubleshooting with the&nbsp;windows diagnostic.
 &nbsp;Anymore suggestions? </p>

<p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could occur if there is issue with the network or wireless card setting.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You will need to activate the wireless card from the Control Panel.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Tap on <strong>
Windows Key </strong>and click on <strong>Search bar</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Then type <strong>
“Device manager</strong>” without the quotes and expand <strong>Network Adapter.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right click your<strong> modem
</strong>and then click on <strong>Properties.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Power management tab</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Then uncheck <strong>
Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>
Ok.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I would suggest you to install all the latest drivers. Also try to update the Network Driver in Device Manager and check if it helps.</span></p>

            Inadvertently or otherwise, you've installed DriverSupport -- and you should remove it.  You do NOT need any third-party utility to "keep your drivers up to date."  In general, don't update a driver unless you have a specific reason for doing that -- and getting the "latest version" is not a good reason.
<br />
<br />Although Driver Support suggests that you can simply remove it by using the normal Windows "uninstall" methods (<a href="https://www.driversupport.com/uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.driversupport.com/uninstall/</a>), you might be better off doing a more thorough job by downloading and running MalwareBytes free trial (<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>).  You can uninstall MalwareBytes after you run it if you wish.

            Open Start&gt;Settings&gt;Apps and Features to uninstall Driver Support and any other programs you didn't install and don't rely on.   
<br />
<br />Then go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Windows 10 Refresh which reinstalls Windows while leaving out the factory bloatware that throttles Windows and causes endless issues, and lets you save your files.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p><span>Hello Sherrywwj,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Vista Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have any anti-virus or anti-spam software installed? If yes, try to turn off its mail scanning or shut down the security software and try to send the attachment.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Ethernet card to connect the computer to Internet, try to boot the computer in safe mode with networking and verify if you are able to send the attachment. To
 boot in safe mode with networking, keep tapping F8 key when you restart the computer. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode with networking, select and press enter. If it works in safe mode, boot in normal mode and try disabling all the security software.
 Later try to send the email with attachment.</span></p>
<p><span>If it helps, you need to contact the security software manufacturer to see if there's an update to fix the problem.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also try to optimize Internet explorer on your computer. Access the link below and follow the steps to optimize Internet explorer.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</a></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, reply back with the following details.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are you able to send e-mails without attachments?<br />
2. Are you able to send the attachments using a different e-mail account like hotmail?<br />
3. When was it last working fine?</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.

<h3> drprw  say:</h3>
<h2>            My wifi connection does not work after latest update &#40;patch on 2&#47;13&#47;2013&#41; for Windows 8.</h2>
                    My laptop running windows 8 (it is an upgrade from Windows 7) performed the latest set of Windows 8 updates and restarted. Now, my computer says that I am connected to my wireless router but there is not internet connection. I had NO PROBLEMS with my WiFi
 connection on this laptop running Windows 8 until this morning (2/14/2013) after restarting to finish installing the latest updates. My computer will tether with my cell phone (so it's not the wireless adapter) AND the mac I have connects to the internet via
 my WiFi connection without issue. Something in the latest patch to Windows 8 has created this problem. I cannot find anything on the internet to troubleshoot. Anyone know what I should do?<br />
<br />
It is a Dell Studio 1645 (I think that's the number) with 8 GB RAM and an i7 processor. Again, this problem just started this morning (2/14/2013) after installing all the windows 8 patches. Thanks to anyone for their advice.<br />

<h2>            YouTube videos Unavailable.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, just calling this issue out, no replies are needed, I will not be reading them or responding.</p>

<p>Youtube is having issues. &nbsp;The issue might be connected with Youtube App on my mobile</p>

<p>I have noted that when I load (or throw over) a video it will play fine, then if I continue to the next in the playlist, YouTube will be "Unavailable at this time."</p>

<p>However, if I close the app, restart it, it will play the video, then repeat issue for the next. &nbsp;And so one.</p>

<p>If I do it using the controller, it works fine. &nbsp;It seems to be a communication issue between the two platforms.</p>

            <p>Hi Jinxsie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue in burning the disc. It is burning very slow.&nbsp;The reason your drive burn slow&nbsp;is that you previously had put in a dirty or scratched disk &amp; your drive light was flashing on &amp; off for a while trying to read
 it before you ejected it. When your drive accesses a bad disk like that for a period of time it can go into PIO mode which is slow. DMA mode is faster than PIO mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Direct memory access (DMA)</strong> is a feature of modern computers and microprocessors that allows certain hardware subsystems within the computer to access system memory for reading and/or writing independently of the central processing unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Programmed input/output (PIO)</strong> is a method of transferring data between the CPU and a peripheral such as a network adapter or an ATA storage device. In general, programmed I/O happens when software running on the CPU uses instructions that
 access I/O address space to perform data transfers to or from an I/O device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided in the article mentioned below and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Make sure that the all the files you're trying to burn are not corrupted. To see whether the files you want to burn is corrupted, try playing or viewing them using Windows Media Player. If the files don't play using the Player,
 Windows DVD Maker cannot burn them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> If issue persists try to run the fixit available in the link below and check if that makes any difference</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Open the Playing and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu‑ray Discs troubleshooter</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>If you are using Windows DVD Maker then choose a slower burning speed for your DVD burner by doing the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Return to the <strong>Add pictures and video</strong> to the DVD page, and then click
<strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the <strong>DVD burner speed</strong> box, select
<strong>Medium or Slow</strong> and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let us try the below methods and check.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to run hardware and devices troubleshooter and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Press the Windows + X, and click on Search.<br />
2. Type troubleshooting and select Troubleshooting.<br />
3. Click on Hardware and Sound and select Hardware and Devices and click on Next to run the troubleshooter<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Method 2: Update USB Controllers.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To update the USB Controllers from Device Manager follow these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Go to Device manager in control panel.<br />
2. Select Device manager and a Device Manager window will pop-up.<br />
3. Double Click on USB Controllers to expand.<br />
4. Right click on the USB Controllers that is listed and select Update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Reset your computer (keep my files).</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We would ask you to reset your computer and see if the issue resolved. Please note that here in this reset we would keep your files and only the programs and applications will be uninstalled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open start menu and select the settings button.</div>
<div>2. In the settings windows, select “Update &amp; security”.</div>
<div>3. In the “Update &amp; security” windows, select “Recovery”.</div>
<div>4. In “Recovery”, please select “Reset this PC” and click “Get started”.</div>
<div>5. A blue screen will follow giving you two options, Click either "Keep my files" or "Remove everything," depending on whether you want to keep your data files intact. Either way, all of your settings will return to their defaults and apps will be uninstalled.
 We would suggest you to select “keep my files” options.</div>
<div>6. Here, Select "Just remove my files" or "Remove files and clean the drive" if you chose to "remove everything" in the prior step. Cleaning the drive takes a lot longer but will make sure that, if you are giving the computer away, the next person will
 have a hard time recovering your erased files. If you are keeping the computer, choose "Just remove my files."
<div>7. Click next if windows warns you that you won’t be able to roll back to a prior version of the windows operating system.</div>
<div>8. Click reset when prompted. Windows will restart and take several minutes to reset itself.</div>
<div>9. Click Continue when prompted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also follow the below link for further troubleshooting:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong></div>
<div>
<p>When you use System Reset to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Please let us know if the issue got resolved or you need any further assistance.</div>

 software at all, which keeps my Windows uncluttered, and when I need to reinstall Windows, I just backup the folder where all portable software is and the cryptocontainer to an external drive, format local drive, do a fresh install, and copy back the folders
 to get all the apps with all the settings. The only thing left is to set up default programs and file associations to make the pc open files with correct portable apps. This also serves another purpose: I use 3 PCs daily, and to sync all programs and settings
 between them, I just copy over the said folder and crypted drive container, and I'm good.</p>
<p>This long preface is to avoid the stupid argument "lol your portable apps are not designed to be used as desktop apps, do a proper install of the programs". I have good reasons to do it the way I do it.</p>
<p>The issues started with Win8, which showed empty icons (a blank paper sheet), if you put the shortcut into start menu, taskbar or desktop. Probably because of the drive not being mounted at logon, when these icons are populated. This also

</p><p>recheck those two settings after I boot and mount the crypto container where Firefox is, everything opens fine. Until next reboot. How can I fix it? I tried putting shortcuts on c: drive and pointing default programs there, also I tried symlinks and other
 stuff to no avail. I don't like the idea of having the set default program batch run
<span>every time</span> I mount the crypto drive, even though it's possible. This behaviour was not present up until Win10. How to prevent windows from unchecking that? Can I change ownership of that registry tree? Which tree?

</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated.</p>
<p>These are clean installs of Windows 10 Home, PRO and LTSB with all updates upto March 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Also, could we have an app-free version of Windows, cleaner than KN? Microsoft should not force apps into OS, or create apps in the first place.</p>

    <title>Logitech C170 Webcam AND Alienware Integrated Webcam DO NOT WORK in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shandoxp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech C170 Webcam AND Alienware Integrated Webcam DO NOT WORK in Windows 10</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I have been trying to fix the Alienware webcam issue for some time now, and from everything I've read on the internet it looks like Dell are blaming Microsoft and Microsoft are saying it's Dell's problem. I haven't had a reply from Logitech yet, as I only
 bought the webcam yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>As a consumer, I really do not care whose issue it is. I have a computer that&nbsp;Dell said was compatible to upgrade to Windows 10,&nbsp;a full valid licence for Windows 10, and according to the compatibility list, the C170 is Windows 10 compatible.</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question/issue is <strong>when is this going to get fixed?</strong></p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not fixed in the near future, then I will have no reasonable alternative than to start taking action for some sort of fix/compensation for my inability to Skype my elderly parents in the UK.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I believe that Australian Consumer Law (see website below)&nbsp;states that a product has to be "fit for purpose", and clearly neither Microsoft nor Dell/Logitech can be bothered to fix what is really a simple issue of a compatible Windows 10 driver which appears
 to be affecting an awful lot of people on many different systems. I would assume (though I'm not a lawyer) that the Australian Legal System will agree with me that this would fail the "fit for purpose" test.</p>

            <p>OK,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Integrated webcam, Dell insist it's just the standard Microsoft Driver (usbvideo). When trying to update the Driver, Windows says "Windows could not find Driver Software for your device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did manage to get it working by using an extremely old "unsigned" driver, but that caused other issues, so had to remove that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Logitech webcam, I have already installed the Logitech Software in both normal mode, and compatibility mode (tried Windows 8 &amp; Windows 7) with no luck. When trying to update the Driver, Windows says "Windows found driver software for your device
 but encountered an error while attempting to install it. (Device cannot start (Code 10)).</p>

            <p>Still no response??</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty much the same as I've received so far from both Dell &amp; Logitech, though Dell have been somewhat helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always with large companies, "It's not our fault, talk to [insert another company here]" seems to be the mantra. Who would have thought that something as simple as getting a STANDARD Windows 10 driver to work could be so much hassle? After all, it's not
 as if they couldn't just update the Windows 8.1 driver (which DID work).</p>

<br />
<br />Well 1709 the Fall Creators Update is now the latest version.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load or use the "Even better methods" or "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />----------
<br />
<br />Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have update the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            <p>I received a C1900101-40017 failure error according to the update log when trying to update from Windows 7 SP 1 to the production version of Windows 10 Home. As far as I have been able to determine Microsoft has no online answer to what this error is or
 what it means.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the update on an hp&nbsp;G62 Notebook PC,&nbsp;Product number: LD643AV, running&nbsp;Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Service Pack 1. It is supposed to be compatible with Windows 10 according to Microsoft specs. So why does it have problems with the upgrade. I think
 that I will attend next years Microsoft stockholders meeting to see if Mr. Nadella has some answers for why the problems after all the testing. In the meantime, I will be happy that after the failed installation of Windows 10, the software successfully rolled
 the OS back to Windows 7 and appears to be working okay so far. I sure as heck am not going to update my other hp PCs.</p>

            <p>For what it's worth, I had the same problem on my own HP ProBook with an i7 CPU and 16 GB of RAM, running Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was very insistent in attempting to download and install, even after I had unchecked its box in the available updates listing. I finally had to hide the update to get some peace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, the thing I am least likely to do is to update any of my computers to this version of Windows. Here's the money question: How long will my copy of Windows 8.1 be supported with security updates? I couldn't care less about feature updates.</p>

            I thank you for attempting to solve the, problem, but for me it keeps giving that error code, and if this is any use to you, says that it failed during the second boot. Not sure if that helps or not. I'm tempted to try a clean install, but I have no clue
 if entering in my windows 8.1 pro activation code would work for the windows 10 pro activation. Any help for either the reboot problem or whether a clean install would help?

            A clean install of Windows 10 will prompt you for a Windows 10 activation code, which you won't have unless you had successfully upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; It's a chicken-and-egg problem.&nbsp; I'm in the same boat, with the C1900101 error code.<br />

            Yeah. Best types of problems. Though I have found that if you install on a separate partition you can install. Maybe if you transfer the activation file it will work? Not sure if thats even permitted, probably should wait for the microsoft specialist to
 say whether we can or not. Can't test it at the moment anyways, I'll be away from my PC for about a week. But that might be a quick fix if it is allowed.

 2 time I try I got the same error then I try with out download update for the installation that work great. So the problem is in downloading update for the update So If you still get this error don't update with Windows update or update the installation during
 setup of update of Windows 10. Also I reinstall Windows 8.1 fist to take everything off my pc just in case I had to had to make a new recovery image wich I did. you might want to check if your recovery is set up as mine was not and had to make a new recovery
 image. BACK UP ALL YOU DATA YOU WANT TO KEEP</span>

            <p>Thanks, Ganesh, but I'm afraid the update fails on reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that the best thing for MS to do would be to allow us to generate W10 keys with our present W7/W8 keys and to let us then do our own fresh installs. &nbsp;The update system is unfortunately unreliable for a number of users.</p>

            If the update fails on boot it will just restore you Old Windows also i dont know if you know this you can maker a copy of your partition with thé Windows on and save it as a wim file. The best thing is to back up your Windows fist then you will keep everything
 anyway &nbsp;look it up on Google make a Windows wim file if you need a Windows8.1 pe disk I can copy mine for you&nbsp;

                    Thanks for the paper weight. I live in the middle of no where can't get home internet. Drove a distance to a friends house, did the initial setup then installed and updated rise, dead rising 3 and forza 5. Only to find out that campaign requires internet.
 This is the best loop hole I've ever seen with the disk based games here's the quote from xbox one "Your Xbox One doesn’t need to be connected for you to enjoy offline features of games. In fact, you can take the Xbox One anywhere and play any disc-based Xbox
 One game on it. The only times you need an online connection are for initial set-up of Xbox One, and to get the latest system and title updates before you start playing some games. Basically after a phone call to the support line they tell me that there are
 some games that can be played offline. Guess what all the good games save to cloud which means when you play single player campaign it has to save on the internet. No longer can you game without an internet connection. Now I'

<p>I'm not sticking up for anyone here, maybe I miss herd? But I thought Microsoft stated the Xbox1 needs to update every 24hrs? Not necessarily need a internet connection 24/7, but to be able to update once a day. I could be wrong cause they flipflop what
 they said a few x.</p>

            Hi Nikki.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you choose the Sign In Options below the password box to change it to using your Password - which will always be present to use alternatively?  
<br />
<br />If so here are fixes for the PIN:  
<br /><a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/windows-10/fix-your-pin-is-no-longer-available.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/windows-10/fix-your-pi...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/your-pin-is-no-longer-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/your-pin-is-no-l...</a>
<br />
<br />If not  I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this.  First try whichever method works here:  
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then first see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />It may also be necessary to create bootable media to access Command Prompt at boot to use Option Five to enable Built-in Administrator,  or to Reset or do the Clean install:<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt to attempt enabling Built-in Administrator.  
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account to sign into and test, move your files over and when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            There is one possible performance issue.&nbsp; Bluetooth and wireless network adapters can interfere with each other as both seem to operate on the 2.4Ghz radio band.&nbsp; However, in active use, this has not occurred for me, yet.<br />

            Hello zhao1997,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Community.<br />

The version of Windows 7 is the cause of your issue. You must have Ultimate or Enterprise is order to have multiple display languages.<br />
