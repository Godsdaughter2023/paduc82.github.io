<h2>            Calendar no longer pops up when clicking the clock in taskbar.</h2>
                    <p>My desktop updated today (November 30) to Windows 10, version 1709, and the calendar no longer pops up when you click on the clock in the lower right area of the task bar.&nbsp; How can I fix this?</p>

<h3> thecookiecorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi Internet Speed is slow. I can restore it to very good, but after shut down it becomes as  slow as it was before</h2>
                    <p>So the problem is that I get 1-6 mbps by Speedtest, but it should be 100 mbps.<br />
I have Asus K501UQ, with Intel Dual Band Wireless AC-7265. After uninstalling the device's driver windows installs the most suitable driver, I connect to my network and get my 100 mbps. BUT when I shut down my laptop it shows me previous 1-6 mbps.<br />
<br />
I have the same laptop with the same wireless card and it shows the same results.<br />
<br />
Booting with Ubuntu LiveUSB is OK, solid 100 mbps. Then I boot to Windows and it gives me the same solid 100 mbps. But after a while 1-6 mbps.<br />
<br />
My iPhone SE always give me 40-50 mbps, in the time when my laptop shows 1-6 and 100 mbps. So I don't think it's the router or provider's issue.<br />
<br />
I can't even understand how to google this problem and can't say, whether it's adapter's issue or WIndows. How can I check where the problem goes from? Maybe some tips? It's very annoying.<br />
<br />
<em>Quick note: Sometimes, when you go to "update &amp; security" and force to update windows, it downloads something, intalls, then reboots and speed shows you 100 mbps. If that's the problem (that windows is always downloading updates) then why it's doing it
 every day delaying my workflow?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>UPD 1 August 2018:&nbsp;</em><em>I've noticed that it helps, when you reboot a laptop. The thing is, I boot up my laptop, check the speed and see that it's 1-6 mbps, then I immediately reboot laptop, check the speed and it shows me 100 mbps</em></p>

            Thanks for reply. Yeah I did that before, but no luck. It does the same thing. For the first time I got 100 mbps. The next day I have 1-6. Then reinstall the driver and that goes in circle.

<h2>            Pandora TV in Internet Explorer</h2>
                    
<p>Having an issue in IE, I can browse to https://www.tv.pandora.com/xbox just fine on my account. I can sign in and listen to music all day i even added it to my pins and have used it multiple times. My wife on the other had wanted to use Pandora on her Xbox
 live account (she has gold as well), however whenever she tries to browse to the same website IE auto forwards her to about:blank. We've tried going through google, bing, and typing the website directly in to the address bar. All of our IE settings are the
 same. Any help on finding a fix for this is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Groove Music won&#39;t update collection. &#40;PC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Groove Music Does not update collection despite me changing directory, moving the files from the specified folder, putting them back, updating Groove or even updating Windows itself.<br />
<br />
This started when Groove stopped detecting newly added music files, so I though that deleting all the Music files and re-importing them again would solve the probblem, unfortunately, this made all the Music files disappear from my collection. now groove doesn't
 have any Music Files listed, although it can play a file if I open it from Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm running <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 on PC, build 10586.
</span></strong>(Problem was present even before the November Update)<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Groove Version 3.6.1513.0&nbsp;</strong>(Problem was also present in previous Groove versions)<br />
<br />
<strong>Note : The metioned PC is not on the Insider Program</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your fast reply.</p>
<p>I tried choosing a keyboard many times with no success. it works for the screen language but not for the keyboard input.</p>
<p>The 2 pictures shows a interesting detail, no layout is given for any of the keyboards:</p>

<p>Solution found !!!</p>
<p>The registry key under:</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layouts]</p>
<p>was totaly empty. </p>
<p>I checked the key on a other win10 computer and that key had entries for many languages. I then copied the key "Keyboard Layouts" to the "ill" machine.
</p>
<p>Everything is working now, problem solved!!</p>

<p>Yeah - This works fine.&nbsp; Opens my library of pictures and inserts whichever photo I choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having done a little more research through the gmail forum, it was suggested that the subject line be changed when forwarding.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried this and it worked with one picture and then worked with twenty pictures.&nbsp; At least this seems to be a temporary fix
 to the problem.</p>

<div>Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
We are aware of a problem with images not appearing or appearing broken when a message is forwarded.<br />
<br />
The Gmail team is working on investigating the issue and finding a solution.&nbsp; In the meantime, please try sending images as attachments instead.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience, I know that this is a real pain. <br />

    <title>Fallout 3 DLC not working offline...&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fallout 3 DLC not working offline...&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the game back in 2008 and beat it, loved it, and cared for it like it was my own... so I decided I trade it for the GOTY edition. I did, but not too long after that it was stolen so I went out and bought a new copy of Fallout 3. (by this point I
 had already downloaded all the downloadable content and completed it.) This brings me in today because it has been several years since then and I have already moved but my place does not offer wireless connection because I'm in redneck territory, anyways,
 I booted up Fallout 3 on the same console <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em><strong><span>(so don't give me that whole spill about License Transfers.)</span></strong></em></span> but it doesn't let me boot up my DLC at all offline... Is it Xbox Live accessible only?</p>

<p>MisteRxHipsteR,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you are having issues with your DLC. For some reason it seems like quite a few folks have difficulties with the Fallout 3 DLC. Assuming that License Transfer isn't your problem, have you tried deleting the DLC and the re-downloading the content
 again to see if this fixes the problem? Let us know and we'll go from there. Thank you,</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply but unfortunatly I'll have to try whenever I get some Wi-Fi. I think this needs to be addressed to Bethesda (even though it is such an old game but still very enjoyable) because if many others are havin the same problem then this needs
 to be fixed. If you guys could email them about the issue of get a petition started then I'm sure this could be an easy patch. I will get back to you as soon as I try your idea.</p>

<p>Hi HipsteR--I too have this issue with the Fallout games :( &nbsp;One workaround is to find another GOTY copy if possible. Most used game stores/pawn shops/large retail chains like Wal-Mart may have copies. Best of luck to you--its an awesome game &amp; I hope you
 get to fully enjoy it &nbsp;=)</p>

<p>G'day HipsteR!<br />
<br />
From your Game Activity, it appears you haven't yet played Fallout 3 on this particular Gamertag, is that correct? If the DLC was bought on a different Gamertag, then your console may need to connect to Xbox Live to verify the content licenses. If this is the
 case and you still have the other Gamertag, can you try playing the game on that? And would you be able to find a connection for your console temporarily to try connecting and playing on this GT?</p>

<p>I did play it on another GT (I'm only using this one because I lost the password to my last one but I can still play on it.) I gave it a try but it says the same on the original GT. That is a good idea so I will update it and see if it works then. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            PC waking unwanted</h2>
                    <p><strong>This has gotten out of hand.&nbsp; </strong>New computer, and reliving the frustrations I had with the old one until I stripped all ways windows could wake itself....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to trust that when I put my computer to sleep, that it will stay asleep until it gets user input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The windows system fails to respect the power setting "allow wake timers" to disabled. This setting should be definite. Like many things, the windows developers don't care, they set wake timers for UpdateOrchestrator, and silently turn turn things back on
 after a user turns them off..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before thinking I haven't turned off the usual suspects like wake on LAN.. I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself an advanced user, I cant imagine the frustration a layman would have with this issue. I don't think its fair that I have to google how to disable in system, registry, power settings, task scheduler, and go to the extreme of stripping file
 permissions away from windows as to block its ability to write to them to keep my computer asleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a real pain in the <em>donkey</em> shutting my computer down and no longer having the trust/convince of waking and resuming my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
"C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;powercfg /waketimers<br />
Timer set by [SERVICE] \Device\HarddiskVolume2\Windows\System32\svchost.exe (SystemEventsBroker) expires at 6:24:54 PM on 2/14/2018.<br />
&nbsp; Reason: Windows will execute 'NT TASK\Microsoft\Windows\rempl\shell-usoscan' scheduled task that requested waking the computer.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for you to set up Cortana on the said PC, make sure that the language, region, time &amp; date is correct. Just simply go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Time &amp; language&gt;Region &amp; language</strong>. Next, under <strong>
Languages</strong>, click on original Language (Country) that shipped with the OS. Click set as default, then Sign out and back in for the new settings to take effect. After that, you can refer to the steps on how to set up Cortana from this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What is Cortana?</a></p>

    <title>Microsoft Store always downloads to the C&#58; drive, no matter what. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leptoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store always downloads to the C&#58; drive, no matter what.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a very frustrating problem and I think the only solution is to reinstall Windows onto a larger partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to download Sea of Thieves in the Microsoft Store and it's downloading to the C: drive. I really despise the Microsoft Store and I've always refused to even open it, much less rely on it for anything, so I'm at a loss as to what the problem could
 be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sea of Thieves is a 21 GB game. I only have 15 GB of free space on the 110 GB Windows partition (C:). I can't find enough stuff to uninstall or delete to free enough space on the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already changed all the storage settings to put new apps (and everything else) in my F: drive. When I start downloading the game, it asks me where I want to install it, so I select the F: drive. Neither of those actually had any affect, the files are
 still being downloaded to the C: drive and the download process stops when the drive is full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that leaves me with only one solution - reinstall Windows onto a larger partition. That is absolutely unacceptable. Why can't Microsoft design anything correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated but this isn't looking good. Maybe I can symlink or junction the Microsoft Store folder to a custom location on another drive?</p>

            Hi leptoon,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you here, sorry to see you're having a bad experience with this. You can try specifying a new directory in the Registry Editor, though it's no easy fix, but I'm here to make it at least a little easier by guiding you through it.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together and enter: regedit
<br />
<br />In the new Registry Editor window, navigate to the following: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Appx
<br />
<br />Right-click that Appx folder, then click Permissions... in the context menu, then click Advanced. Change the owner to your name. Enter your user name in the box under "Enter the object name to select", then click Check names. Once your name has been verified, click OK. Make sure that "Replace all child object permission entries with inheritable permission entries from this object" is checked, as well as "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects." Click OK again.
<br />
<br />Make sure that the Administrators and Users groups have full access. Now change the value of the PackageRoot entry on the right pane, to the directory you want to set it to.
<br />
<br />Reboot if you have to, but this might work without it. I hope this helps. If this didn't work or if this worked, I'd like to hear about it. Let me know.       
        </p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the game isn’t compatible with Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As the game was working on Windows 7, I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Make sure that you have the setup file for the game before following the steps.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.
</li><li>Locate the game “Hyper rails” game and right click on it. Select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.
</li><li>Locate the folder that has the .exe file for the driver. Right Click on the setup file and click on
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and check the box which states “<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>”.</li><li>Select the <strong>Windows 7</strong> from the drop down list. Click on <strong>
Apply</strong> and then on <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Double Click on the setup file and follow the onscreen instructions to install the game.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>For reference:</strong></p>

<h2>            Refunds on games that don&#39;t save your progress</h2>
                    I bought Ark: Survival Evolved and its Season Pass, I played it for a few days but every time I would exit the game my progress would not save, so I filed a refund request which took 3 to 4 days to be answered just to be denied, I think its stupid that
 I can't get a refund and that it took this long for them to answer for a game that doesn't even work properly, and there wouldn't be much use for owning the season pass if I do not have the base game, I should be able to get a refund for this bull crap or
 at least a refund for the base game, some of the worst costumer service I have ever had to deal with and its making me not want to deal with Microsoft ever again, the Steam version of this game works perfectly and saves all my progress so it seems this is
 Microsoft's Store problem and I should get a refund for something that should have been fixed already.

    <title>Windows Annerversary Features Update 1607 fails to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> byroncallas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Annerversary Features Update 1607 fails to install</h2>
                    <p>I have attempted to install the1607 anniversary update 6 times. Each time if freezes at 71% in the final installation process
<strong><em>(Working on updates 71%. Don't turn off your PC. This will take a while. Your PC will start several times.)&nbsp;
</em></strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/034860ad-1221-46d9-a77b-51c4b07cf720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/034860ad-1221-46d9-a77b-51c4b07cf720" /><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I
 have let it stay in the freeze positon for as much as 24 hours with no movement.
</span></a>After freezing, I must perform a&nbsp;hard reboot.&nbsp;It proceeds to successfully reinstall the previous version of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are similar posts for variations on this installation fail with complicated methods suggested for fixing the problem, with scores of&nbsp; feedback saying that none of the suggestions work. I've tried the suggestion to turn off Windows Defender, with no
 result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;problem of freezing at 71% seems a common percent others have encountered, but other people do report other failure scenarios and messages.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I attempt scores of time consuming solutions that don't seem to have worked for anyone else, and since this problem seems to have been around for a while, has a reliable solution been found, specifically focusing on those people experiencing the failure
 at 71% in the final installation reboot? Consistency of freezing at 71% for lots of people would seem to be a pointer (?). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No peripherals attached, no USB devices, no external mice, no CD or DVD drive, no external hard drives or other storage media.&nbsp;Ethernet connected with 20mb download speed. Samsung Chronos, Win7 original installation, with Win 10 installed over it as a free
 upgrade over the internet;&nbsp;all updates successfully installed until this 1607 fail. Windows Defender reports no infections. There have been at least six attempts, including the solution to manually request the update download and initiate the update from the
 Windows Update feature, and to try it with Windows Defender disabled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A reliable solution would be much appreciated. Tell me where to send the check, tacos arrachera, tequila shots, Super Bowl Tickets; name your price.&nbsp;&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, Gerry disappeared.&nbsp;Maybe we'll hear from him again someday? Let's hope he is well.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Response to those requesting solution:&nbsp; </strong>Others with the same problem requested that I post any solution I found for this problem. Following is&nbsp;my report, after ten days of work, much of it described above, and finally reaching Window's live
 tech support;&nbsp;they&nbsp;were very&nbsp;helpful. <br />
<br />
<strong>How we got there:&nbsp; </strong>The first technician, after reviewing all the steps already taken above,&nbsp;remotely ran&nbsp;the SFC tool and found a considerable number of corrupted files;&nbsp;the tool reported&nbsp;that it fixed the corrupted files. The technician believed
 this would solve the problem, but the update resulted in the same&nbsp;failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My problem was escalated to&nbsp;Microsoft's&nbsp;Level 2 Technical Support</strong>; we scheduled a meeting for two days later. They called on time. The new Technician, Rahul, remotely performed a few tests, and&nbsp;tried another update attempt. It&nbsp;failed exactly
 as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Corrective Action: </strong>At this point,&nbsp;it&nbsp;was hypothesized that the cause of the problem&nbsp;was one or more programs with corrupted files, and related corruption in the registry, that would be nearly impossible to find quickly, if ever. It was
 proposed&nbsp;that the wisest course of action&nbsp;was for&nbsp;Rahul to&nbsp;remotely perform a <em>
Windows Custom Installation.&nbsp;</em>I was informed my data would remain safe, but I would have to reinstall all third party programs.&nbsp;However&nbsp;my Window's installation would be akin to having a new computer with the most current Windows installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The <em>Windows Custom Installation </em>was performed successfully.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The laptop is running like a charm. Rahul proceeded to also remotely reinstall my
<em>Microsoft Office 365</em> programs. <br />
<br />
<strong>Post Mortem</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the circumstances, the solution worked. It will take me a couple of days to reinstall all my programs.&nbsp;If I had taken this step early on, it would have saved me&nbsp;ten days of fruitless efforts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">It seems clear from the scores of posts on the web that no one has&nbsp;found a
<em>reliable</em> solution to this specific problem except to, essentially, perform a clean install of Windows10. It seems this
<em>Windows Custom Installation, </em>is a good way to go. <br />
<br />
My time with Rahul was about 6 hours as he worked remotely, taking control of my computer.&nbsp; Approximately five of those hours was waiting for the one failed attempt and the final successful attempt to do the necessary file downloads and for Windows to perform
 all the installation processes. All in all, my dedicated activity was about an hour, but I had to be present for the six hours to let Rahul in and out of the computer during all the different boot sequences. Mostly, it was an exercise in patience. But it worked.&nbsp;
 If others find&nbsp; better and more&nbsp;reliable solutions, it would be nice to see&nbsp;them posted here.
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Recommendation:&nbsp;</strong>Barring others presenting reliable solutions, I recommend that after a couple of failed attempts,&nbsp; get in touch with Microsoft support via their chat service, explain your situation (you can direct
 them to this link as reference, suggesting they review the first 27 replies&nbsp;detailing the methodical diagnostic steps initially tried:
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-annerversary-features-update-1607-fails-to/c04f1b83-9281-4c4a-9905-8d2856b85815">
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-annerversary-features-update-1607-fails-to/c04f1b83-9281-4c4a-9905-8d2856b85815</a>) and allow them to perform the
<em>Windows Custom Installation. </em>It pays to be patient. It did take six hours. But if you are willing to be patient and methodical, stick around&nbsp;during the process,&nbsp;and there are no fatal hardware failures causing your problem (a possibility), this approach
 should pay off. <br />
<br />
<strong>Acknowledgment: </strong>I would like to thank Rahul, working from India, who was indeed patient and clear in his direction, and resourceful researching this arcane problem. He got the job done in the very best spirit of what good and thoughtful customer
 service is about.&nbsp;Likewise, following Gerry's many suggestions, while seemingly futile, were supporting steps that helped verify that a range of diagnoses and treatments, at least in my case,&nbsp;could be eliminated.
<br />
<br />
<strong>CASE CLOSED</strong><br />

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently bought a Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It said that it would come with a 30-day trial of office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go about activating this trial? Does it start on first boot, I didn't make a microsoft account when I first booted the machine, do you need one to claim the free trial, also do you need a credit card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the possible chance this surface has been used and returned, is there a chance the 30 day trial already been claimed?</p>

<h2>            Sorry, there seems to be a problem with Hotmail right now</h2>
                    <p>I'm getting this message when I try to sign in to my hotmail account online "Sorry, there seems to be a problem with Hotmail right now". I'm also having problems downloading any email from this account in my Windows Live Mail on both of my computers. The
 error I'm getting in windows live mail is </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Server Error: 5102<br />
Server "https:mail.services.live.com/DeltaSync_v2.0.0/Synx.aspx"<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8DE2003</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not having any problem accessing my other outlook account. From what I can see I'm not the only one that's had this problem in the past. I haven't changed anything and my antiviris is Microsoft Essentials.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more problem is I am also having problems accessing my outlook offline with my tablet as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Latest update. I can now access my outlook account online but can't through windows live mail</p>
<p>now I get a error message that the service is not available. Is there a problem with the system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now access my account online but I'm getting the same error message in Windows Live Mail on my computer. I deleated the account, recreated it and still get the same error message as above.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can sign into my SkyDrive and MSN I did recieve an email on my Windows Live Mail that didn't download right. That's why I was&nbsp;trying to go online and access it from there. If this email is what's causing the problem I would delete it there but as you can
 tell I can't access my account online. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can now access my Outlook online but can't download it into my Windows Live Mail. I'm getting the same error message. I deleted the account, recreated it and still can't access it through WLM. I'm also having the same problem accessing it on my tablet
 and other computer as well. </p>

            <p>Hi Bearwolf56,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience this matter may have caused you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As our initial troubleshooting step, we encourage you to remove and add your email account in Windows Live Mail. To do so,&nbsp;please refer to the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How do I add an account to Windows Live Mail?</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also recommend that you check for an email stuck in your Outbox. If there are, delete all the messages (may need to go offline for this and resume normal operation after deleting) then try to send another e-mail to check if you will get the same error
 message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For additional information on how to resolve this issue, you can refer to the article below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/how-can-i-resolve-machine-configuration-issues-in/7462aa67-6131-4504-a11b-7060a95c694b"><strong>How can I resolve machine configuration issues in Windows Live Mail?</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if the issue persists, we would like to ask the impacted email account in a private message I created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Please sign-in to this website in order to see the Private Message tab where you can provide the email account. We also need you to reply back to this post if you already provided the information on the private data area. This will help facilitate
 our actions regarding your issue.</p>

                    <p>I&nbsp;see that it is a cable that I have seen before (generic). Does this mean that I can use any cable that fits. I forgot to take my power cable&nbsp;with me and wonder if we have one that fits where I&nbsp;am. I am guessing the transformer is now internal (its a white xbox s) so any cable that fits should work? I just dont want to damage my xbox because the cable is in some way special? I&nbsp;can't imagine so but don't also want to be glib. TY</p>

    <title>Upgrading to Windows 10 from a Domain - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10 from a Domain</h2>
                    <p>I have two Windows 8.1 computers that I have on a Windows 2012 R2 domain.&nbsp; To get the Windows 10 app to show up, I removed my computer from the domain and rebooted and it showed up.&nbsp; I did my reservation and entered my email.&nbsp; When I did this to my partners
 pc, the app showed up but it was already reserved.&nbsp; How will I upgrade these pc's?&nbsp; Do I need to take mine out of the domain the night of July 28th?&nbsp; Then when mine upgrades I would simply rejoin my domain and remove the other from it, upgrade and rejoin or
 can I leave them both in the domain and which will upgrade first?&nbsp; The domain is just personal.&nbsp; Not business or anything (I just play with it).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<div>With a pool of more than a billion devices to upgrade to win 10, only a <strong>
small portion</strong> of those will get win 10 on July 29. &nbsp;First, the insiders (those who have been testing window 10) will get it starting on July 29, there are ~5 million insiders.</div>
<div>After that, in the coming <strong>weeks and months</strong> Microsoft will upgrade those who have "reserved" win 10 in waves.&nbsp;<span>Those who have</span>
<strong>"reserved"</strong> <span>their copies of Windows 10</span>
<strong>will be notified</strong> <span>
"once our compatibility work confirms you will have a great experience, and Windows 10 has been downloaded on your system,"</span></div>
<div>If Microsoft determines a user's system is "not yet ready for your upgrade," the company will provide more details, such as contact information to enable users to get more details from app developers and device makers.</div>
<div><span><em>Each day of the roll-out, we will listen, learn and update the experience for all Windows 10 users.</em></span></div>

    <title>Windows updated overnight and now my google calendar is all sorts of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> libbydaugherty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows updated overnight and now my google calendar is all sorts of messed up...</h2>
                    <p>My surface pro 3 was plugged in overnight and when I woke up in the morning it was just getting finished with some sort of system upgrade. &nbsp;Some minutes later, I opened my Google Calendar (in Chrome, not in any sort of app) on my PC (not the surface that
 had just updated) and the calendar was all wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The calendar was fine the night before. &nbsp;I usually check it every night before bed to see what I have to do the next day. &nbsp;I have several repeating events (classes that are at the same time every week) as well as special meetings, appointments, and other
 blocks. &nbsp;Nothing appears to be at it's correct time or on it's correct day. &nbsp;Several events have repeated themselves and are overlapping. &nbsp;Several events are missing or have reverted to older versions that had been previously edited or removed. &nbsp;It's chaos
 and my best guess is that perhaps the calendar has partially reverted to a previous version during a time when I was still setting up my class schedule for this semester. &nbsp;Even still, some of the dates/times that events are at now are ones that I never entered
 personally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Absolutely <em>nothing</em> has changed between last night and this morning other than that Windows 10 on my surface updated. &nbsp;I was asleep, so clearly I didn't do anything manually. &nbsp;My PC and Surface are synced via Chrome and also via Windows, so I can
 only assume that whatever update Windows did to my surface has messed with my google calendar/chrome settings for all my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is Microsoft's way of trying to get me to use their calendar instead of Google's, it's not going to work. &nbsp;It will be a huge PITA to revert everything back to normal, which is why I'm hoping there is an easier fix, but I will do it if I have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are: &nbsp;Is there a way to revert my calendar back to the way it was before the Windows update? &nbsp;Has this happened to anyone else? &nbsp;Can we make sure this doesn't happen again with future updates?</p>
