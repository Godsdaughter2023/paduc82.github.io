<h2>            Merge Network Locations in Win 7</h2>
                    <p>I have two separate wireless internet connections. A wireless card &nbsp;named WIFI and a wireless USB adapter named USB. I have access to two&nbsp;</p>
<p>different Service providers through two different routers. &nbsp;I can connect to the internet in several different configurations with no real</p>
<p>issues, &nbsp;just a question. &nbsp;When I am in the Network and Sharing Center and I view my configuration, I can click on either of the two&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public Network icons and I get to the Set Network Properties window, what does the Merge option actually do here in this scenario?</p>
<p>Will it actually treat both connections as one? &nbsp;I would like some more info if possible, thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Windows has created multiple network locations for a network that you want treated as a single network, you can click&nbsp;<strong>Merge or delete network locations</strong>&nbsp;to consolidate them, or to delete locations you no longer
 need.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is usual that every time you connect to a wireless network location the signature is left in windows which makes it easier to connect it next time.&nbsp; But sometimes when you connect manually to the same wireless network again it creates another signature.
 This results in creation of multiple network profile.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Serious issue after Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi All!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I've tried to install Windows 10 Creators Update on my work PC (HP Z220 Workstation with Intel Xeon E3-1225V2, 12GB RAM).</p>
<p>I've been used Windows Upgrade Assistant (Windows10Upgrade9252.exe), all process was smooth, but after last reboot and login desktop icons has no text, system menus was empty: for example after mouse roght click on desktop menu appers but without text.</p>
<p>Exactly same, like described in&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/intel-clover-trail-processors-are-not-supported-on/ed1823d3-c82c-4d7f-ba9d-43ecbcf526e9</p>
<p>I used system rollback to go to previous version of system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this some kind of option to safely install&nbsp;Windows 10 Creators Update on my PC or I have to wait for new wersion?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">Check

</p><p>Thank you for reply!</p>
<p>Unfortunately my workstation is not listed on both lists: for &nbsp;Anniversary Update and Creators Update.</p>
<p>Maybe it's becouse of graphic card - I'm using internal Intel HD Graphics&nbsp;10.18.10.4358 (2015-12-21)</p>

            Microsoft is doing a roll out in waves, so I would go back to your previous version and wait until it is offered to you through Windows Update. I would also periodically check the manufacturer of your computers website to find out about support.<br />

<p><strong>Galera, fiz no &nbsp;single player todas as missões do Halo 5 no lendário, mas não desbloqueou a conquista Lobo Solitário e conquista de concluir todas as missões no lendário. O mais engraçado é que no jogo consta que fiz todas missões no lendário. As
 conquistas ficam travadas em 93% e mesmo rejogando a ultima missão, que deve ser a que não contabilizou , não&nbsp;adianta. Grato pela ajuda. OBS: Estou conectado a Live.</strong></p>

<p>Bug, é raro mas ocorre. Pode levar algumas horas ou algumas semanas, mas é certo que irá desbloquear. Uma de minhas conquistas travou por duas semanas e desbloqueou enquanto eu jogava outro jogo.</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide the following detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Is the account to which you are trying to sign in is a Microsoft account or a local account?
<br />
2) Do you refer to the Start screen when you say App screen?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the account to which you have set up is Microsoft Account then password protection cannot be removed as for every Microsoft account there is a unique password.
<br />
</p>
<p>If the account to which you are trying to sign in is a local account then you can follow the steps given below.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps given below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows Key + X Key.<br />
</strong>b) Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click on <strong>User Account.<br />
</strong>c) Click on <strong>Manage another Account</strong>. Click on the account which you have set up.<br />
d) Click on the option <strong>Change the Password</strong>.<br />
e) You will see boxes, remove everything from there and click on <strong>Create Password</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Remove the password protection.<br />
<br />
a) Open the run box by pressing <strong>Windows Key + R key</strong>, type <strong>
netplwiz </strong>and press enter.<br />
<br />
b) This should open <strong>User Accounts </strong>box which will display a list of all users on the computer. From here you can add, remove or see properties of any user.<br />
<br />
c) Select the user from this list and uncheck “<strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong>” and then click on
<strong>Apply</strong> button.<br />
<br />
d) Now you will be presented with a dialog box which will prompt you to enter password. Do so and then click on
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
e) Also click on <strong>OK</strong> in the User Accounts dialog box.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
In Windows 8 after you sign, you will be guided to start screen not to the desktop. This is by design.
</p>
<p>Check for the issue after you follow the above given steps and write to us if you face any issues. We will assist you further.
<br />

<p>Hi Patricia. For starters, just click on the battery icon (see below) on your taskbar. Mine is at the bottom and the PC came with it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change your taskbar is quite easy -&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/29280/windows-10-how-to-use-the-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&gt;This MS article is very helpful.&lt;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how you get on. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Insert image is not working in Edge - I'll switch to IE and do it from there in a few minutes!</p>

<p>Sorry about that delay, Patricia. Do you know that there are options available that affect the battery?
</p>
<p>To see them, just to to Settings (gear icon above the Windows icon bottom left of your screen)
</p>
<p>then&nbsp; &gt; System &gt; Battery to select other options available to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping this helps.</p>

            mine too Shawn. I would have posted snips but decided against it when the blasted Edge/'insert image' failed again (same with 'insert hyperlink at times - both issues reported to Performance problems. I'm particularly impressed with the clicking the icon,
 as it take us straight through to where we can adjust the settings.

<p>Hi Julian. It worked for me four months ago, and also for Shawn, an MVP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been quite a few Windows Updates since then - I'm on v1803 and you're only on v1709. That was released a year or so ago so I suggest that you create your own thread as no-one is likely to pick up this one.</p>

<p>1709 is release n-1 - 7 months old, not a year and I have all the intermediary updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new SB2, it came with 1709. These are reported as having lots of issues with 1803 so I've delayed the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've installed BatteryBar which tells me everything I need. But it is bonkers that I can't see the estimated battery time on Microsoft's flagship laptop. This is doubtless a bug on Microsoft's part.</p>

<div>(wmic product where "name like '%%Microsoft Silverlight%%'" call uninstall)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I query HKEY_CLASSES_root\installer\products and send the results to a text file. &nbsp;I then query the results to look for Silverlight. &nbsp;If it finds it, it deletes the key. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(</div>
<div>REG QUERY HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Installer\products &nbsp;&gt; silver.txt</div>
<div>
<div>FOR /F "Tokens=1-5 DELIMS=^" %%i IN (silver.txt) DO (</div>
<div>Set RegKey=%%i</div>
<div>CALL :START)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>GOTO :OS-CHECK</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>:START</div>
<div>REG QUERY %RegKey% /s | Find "Microsoft Silverlight"</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>IF NOT %ERRORLEVEL%==0 GOTO :AlmostDone</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>:DELETE KEY</div>
<div>REG DELETE %RegKey% /f</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I repeat this in a few other registry locations to be sure that all old installs of Silverlight (or whatever software I am installing) are removed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I came across an interesting discovery this week when updating Silverlight. &nbsp; &nbsp;The installation was corrupted (because I forgot to unlock the file I downloaded) so when WMIC ran, it did not find any software to remove, thus leaving the key in HKEY_CLASSES_root\installer\products.
 &nbsp;I kept noticing that all of the subkeys were being deleted, but could never recreate it, until this morning. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I realized my critical error. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As you can see in the picture below, when I run REG QUERY &nbsp;HKEY_CLASSES_root\installer\products on Windows XP, the results I get not only include "!REG.EXE VERSION 3.0", but also HKEY_CLASSES_root\installer\products. &nbsp;This does not happen on Windows 7.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what was happening was that the REQ QUERY would run against HKEY_CLASSES_root\installer\products and find Microsoft Silverlight and then promptly delete every sub key under HKEY_CLASSES_root\installer\products. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a996df1-c429-4a42-a1c9-b9f71ecd705d" />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So the actual questions here are this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Any way around this on Windows XP?</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Is there a better way to accomplish what I want?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            <p><span>Hi Jeanne,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concerned. Let me help you to post your query in the right forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try simple steps and check if this helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>You should be able to connect the kindle device to the PC using the kindle charger, since the charger is regular USB cable. When you connect the kindle device it should detect on the system as drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The drive consists of three folders called audible, music and documents. The first two contain are audiobooks and MP3s, the third, 'documents', holds pretty much everything else, including downloaded
 books, text files, PDFs and screen grabs. You can capture your Kindle's screen display at any time by holding shift and alt while briefly pressing 'G' on its keyboard. Grabs are saved in .gif format.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are unable to transfer the file, it would be best if you contact kindle support team, they would be best to help you with this kind of issue.
</span></p>

<h2>            Touchpad has quit working - Drivers are not showing up in Device Manager</h2>
                    <p>Last month, my touchpad stopped working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I searched for the drivers, none were listed using Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a factory reset of the computer (HP Stream 11) and the drivers did not show up. I downloaded the drivers from the HP website and installed them... they STILL do not show up.<br />
<br />
I just ran the&nbsp;HP PC UEFI Hardware Diagnostics Component test for Mouse, and the cursor appeared (using the touchpad) for the test. When I clicked out of the test, and attempted to use the touchpad again, the cursor disappeared, and AGAIN, no drivers appear
 in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running Windows 10 on the computer.</p>

            Hello czarkhasm. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Thanks for publishing your query.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below to solve your problem:
<br />
<br />1 In Start, find Device Manager and select from the list of results. In Mouse and other pointing devices, select the touch panel, open it, choose the Driver tab and select Update driver. If Windows is not a new driver, look for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow the instructions.
<br />
<br />2 If those steps have not worked, try uninstalling the touchpad driver: open Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) the touchpad driver and select Uninstall. Restart the device and Windows will try to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />3 If that does not work, try using the generic driver that is included with Windows. Follow these steps: in Device Manager, right-click on the audio driver (or keep it pressed)&gt; Update driver software ...&gt; Browse the computer to find driver software&gt; Let me choose it from a list of drivers Device compatible with mouse with HID, select Next and follow the instructions to install it.
<br />
<br />If the problem is not solved by changing the driver, there may be a problem with the touch panel. For help, contact the PC manufacturer.
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp; cristhian!<br />
<br />
There is no touchpad option in Device Manager, so options 1 and 2 can't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 3... which is the audio driver?<br />
<br />
These are the drivers associated with audio<br />
<br />
Audio inputs and outputs</p>
<p>&gt;Microphone (Realtek High Definition Audio)<br />
&gt;Speaker/HP (Realtek High Definition Audio)<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Sound, video and game controllers<br />
&gt;Intel(R) Display Audio<br />
&gt;Realtek High Definition Audio<br />
<br />
There is also a "High Definition Audio Controller" driver under System devices<br />
<br />
</p>

<h2>            Skype on iPad  occasionally does not connect...getting a dripping sound.</h2>
                    <p>Once in a while Skype does not complete the connection but simply makes a dripping sound. &nbsp; This seems to be a random event.</p>
<p>Is this related possibly to Skype infrastructure issues?</p>

<p>Oh my, that made me chuckle too. This is kind of embarrassing I would think. This is an unnecessary reply from me, but you'd think he would just be like "No, I bought it, I'll play it anytime I want."</p>

<p>Hard to take a thread like this seriously, but in all seriousness. &nbsp;If you bought it. it's yours and can do whatever you want with it and shouldn't have to be sharing it if you don't want to simple as that. &nbsp;Surely at 24 years old you would know how to handle
 a situation like this...</p>

                    <p>I have just added a contact to the Windows 10 people app, and was given the choice of combining this contact with another. This I chose to do with a family member of my contact, but now all the telehone numbers are&nbsp; put together and I do not know which one&nbsp;
 goes with which brother. How can I unlink these combined&nbsp; contacts?</p>

<p><span>Hi Ninaco,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The People app is your address book. Combine contacts is a feature to link duplicates to a single contact to avoid confusion. To overcome the issue you’re facing, I suggest you to try the steps listed below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Unlink Contacts:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open <strong>People </strong>app, click on the contact that is linked, and select
<strong>See More </strong>on the right pane.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Separate</strong> for the contact you want to unlink.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Reset People app:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you’ve&nbsp;multiple contacts that are linked, resetting People app would unlink contacts and put everything in place.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Exit <strong>People app, </strong>if open.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open <strong>Settings </strong>and click on <strong>Apps</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate <strong>People app</strong> on the right pane and choose
<strong>Advanced Options</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Reset.</strong></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once reset is complete, open People app to see if the contacts are still linked.</span></p>
<p>

<p><span><span>original title: Win7 BSODs on New PC</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hey there, thanks in advance for the help all.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Christmas I got a custom built gaming PC, here are the relevant specs:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>i7
 950 Processor</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>80gb
 Intel SSD (Windows is installed here)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>1tb
 HDD</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>6gb
 DDR3-1600 RAM (2gb x3)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Geforce
 GTX 580</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Gigabyte
 GA-X58A-UD3R</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When I got the PC, I noticed that it was behaving a little strangely on startup. Instead of booting windows immediately,
 it goes through a Gigabyte splash screen and then a black screen with white text where it searches for drives, before then booting to C (the SSD). It still does that every time it starts up. Another fun fact is that during shipping, there seems to have been
 some damage to the computer--notably, the HDD was dislodged and shaken around a bit, and the drive cable connecting the SSD to the Mobo was damaged. The SSD-end of the cable was broken off with part still in the SSD--however I just stuck it back in and it
 seemed fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The computer seemed fast and I was able to run some games at first, but as soon as the BSODs started to become frequent
 my ability to play games became worse and worse, I think because the BSODs are corrupting files from the games I download off Steam. Now whenever I go in to verify the game's integrity (repair missing/damaged files) I get a BSOD. I can generally avoid BSODs
 if I stay away from multitasking (it crashes when the load is at about 3 large programs), but almost every program on my system appears buggy or damaged now. Steam had startup issues, iTunes is just acting weird, etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The link below has the contents of my C:/Windows/Minidump folder, zipped up. I'm really hoping that this issue is
 an easy fix!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1930120/Minidump.zip</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>EDIT: Oh and one thing I noted, so far I have seen the error codes 0x1A and 0x3B.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks all!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Edit – Changed font from grey to black</span></span></p>

<p>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</p>
<p>Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features, Intel EIST or Turbo Mode (Disable it),&nbsp;<br />
then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>Disconnect any other internal hard drives and external USB devices.<br />
Check for any loose hard drive power or SATA cables, Graphics card or other power cables.</p>
<p>First try running Memtest86+:&nbsp; This runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours (at least 3 full passes), if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

If you have a copy of Windows XP around try installing it temporary (if not Windows 7 will work as well)<br />
"No need to activate as you get a 30 day grace period which is perfect for testing"<br />
and then use the following tools (this assumes the memtest shows no failures)</p>
<p><br />
After Windows is installed:</p>
<p>Device Drivers: Did you install the motherboard manufacture's latest device drivers?<br />
Check their support site for the latest drivers as the CD that came with the motherboard may have<br />
older less stable drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Graphics card manufacture's download site: Download and install the most recent Windows 7 drivers<br />
for your card.<br />

<p>Thanks for that list, Stuart, but I don't think that any of those resources will help me unless I know where to start. I would appreciate if you, or someone else, could analyze my Minidump files to determine whether this is more likely a software or a hardware
 issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already tried to use memtest86+. I made the bootable disc and had it running, but for whatever reason after it ran for a number of hours (while I was out of the room) the test restarted, and I didn't exactly see any results. I will run memtest again
 if it's&nbsp;necessary, but right now I'm headed out to get a replacement drive cable to replace the SSD's connector.</p>

<h2>            Windows Firewall preventing access to particular website. </h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sainsburysdiets.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sainsburysdiets.co.uk/</a></p>
<p>Most of the pages were loading extremely slowly, so I contacted the support page for the website and was advised that the only problem they were aware of was one caused by windows firewall, which, for those members using it, caused the site to run very slowly.
 They told me to try the site with windows firewall turned off to find out if this was my problem, which it was. When windows firewall is turned off the site runs fine.</p>
<p>They say there is nothing they can do at their end to help solve the problem, and obviously I can't turn off my firewall everytime I want to use the site, which will be several times a day, so I would like to know if there is a setting I can change in my
 firewall which will solve the problem. I know that you can open ports to allow certain programmes to run, or you can place programmes in the 'exeptions' category, but I havent a clue what to do about a website which won't load!</p>
<p>Any help appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>Visiting the page I can understand why the Firewall is trying to prevent the page from loading!</p>
<p>Try another Browser like Firefox and see if that will help?</p>
<p>Did they say why the Firewall blocking the site?</p>
<p>Does the Firewall or the browser which Blocking/loading the site slow?</p>

<div>Loads "extremely slowly" is an understatement. I tried and just about</div>
<div>gave up using both Firefox 3.6 and IE 6.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I really doubt it's the Windows firewall (although I admit that it's</div>
<div>suspicious that the page loads quickly with the firewall disabled).</div>
<div>Given that there are millions of web pages that load quickly with the</div>
<div>Windows Firewall enabled, the odds are that there IS something wrong</div>
<div>with this website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might point the support staff at sainsburysdiets to the following</div>
<div>results from the W3C web document validator (The World Wide Web</div>
<div>Consortium (W3C) is an international community that develops standards</div>
<div>to ensure the long-term growth of the Web), which indicates many coding</div>
<div>errors in the web page you're trying to load:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why (or whether) those coding errors seem not to matter with the Windows</div>

<p>Looking further into the issue it seems that the supporting files (style + javascript) are gzip encoded. The windows firewall running on a Windows XP Service pack 2 machine was dropping packets (windows firewall running on vista did not) - so the browser
 was waiting for the whole file to be delivered and not getting it. Hence the delay. Turning off gzip compression has stopped windows firewall from dropping the packets. This however does not answer the question why windows firewall + packet filtering is dropping
 packets. This fault does seem to have been addressed in subsequent releases of the firewall / os.</p>
<p>We are currently looking at the log files of windows firewall to determine the exact cause.</p>
<p>After examining the log files we have come to the conclusion that we have no solution so unfortunatley gzip encoding will have to remain off. If anyone on here can shed light onto the packet filtering of windows firewall running on XP&nbsp; then I would appreciate
 it.</p>

<p>Thanks for the replies. I'm glad to know its not just me and there is actually a problem!</p>
<p>I will send the support person I have been in contact with at Sainsburys a link to this page, if you don't mind, maybe she can pass it on to the technical people.</p>
<p>So, since I can't do anything about it for now, I have another question. If I have Norton AV, Spybot and Ad-aware running, do I really need to have my windows firewall running at the same time. Does it do something the others don't? Or is it safe enough
 for me to turn it off? Or is there something else I can do?</p>

<h2>            Why did my pc&#39;s audio,wireless network aero themes and AVG antivirus stop working when it could attatch usb mouse end external hard-drive&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;It's weird. I was fiddleing a little bit with msconfig startup programs, and user control(did not need to dim the desktop when informing me of changes, so just 1 step down)<br />
I asked the pc to shut down. a few hour later when I came back and turned it on, It had switched to windows classic theme, still with the same wallpaper. it said audio drivers could not be found, the same with wireless. AVG free antivirus did not work. it said
 that no servieces of AVG was running. &nbsp;I tried to boot in failsafe mode. I could scan with avg but still no audio or network. It said I was not allowed to. And I am the only administrator. So I ticked on all the startup processes in msconfig and rebooted both
 in normal and failsafe mode. same problems.
<div>During this the wallpaper changed to windows classic blue color.</div>
<div>During the evening I fell asleep while my pc was unplugged and running. I can't remember if I shut down the pc or not, but next morning when I booted the pc was working "fine" the wallpaper is gone but I can update and run AVG and post this question.<br />

<h2>            PC randomly restarts</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been having an issue with my pc restarting itself during gaming: kernel-power 41 (63) error. I've tried troubleshooting this with no luck. I just downloaded Aida64 to test my system stability, when I selected the GPU it notified me that tdrDelay was
 set too low. Is this the cause of my issue, and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>What game or games are causing the TDR, and what are your system specifications - include brand and model graphics processor and cpu.</p>
<p>If the TDR is happening while <em>not</em> gaming I would put a hardware fault at top of the list, after verify the graphics driver is up to date,</p>
<p>or reinstalling the current driver to verify it's not been corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>[EDIT:</em></span> -OK! Had a look around and don't think the old Registry key fix is relevant on Win10 any more, so I've deleted the instructions.</p>
<p>Upping the time before TDR was never much help on Win7 either (but was still worth doing), and the Win10 Registry has a new pair
</p>
<p>of TDR related keys in a new Registry sub-folder which are not in Win7, so I don't know their function.- From what I gather if you have Intel HD graphics and a dedicated Nvidia or AMD graphics card
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or uninstalling the Intel HD graphics driver will prevent TDR for
<em>some</em> users </span></p>
<p>(I have Intel HD w/ Nvidia and have not problems with TDR myself though) ]</p>
<br />
<p>- TDR was introduced with Win7 and was meant to prevent premature BSOD when a game lags. Unfortunately it is a mostly</p>
<p>failed concept, and can be as difficult to troubleshoot as BSOD.</p>
<p>The TDR error <em>always</em> blames the driver, but in reality the driver is more often just the last link in a chain of events that led to the TDR.</p>
<p>[EDIT: Well apparently Intel has changed that theory recently :\ ]</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The real source of the problem can be either hardware faults or software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- As per your other thread -&nbsp; dxdiag reports are next to useless, Just post your system specs.&nbsp;

</span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Application and System</span></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> reports</span> can be useful at times .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the TDR has created a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">mini-dump</span> file you may want to post that as well. They also tend to blame the gpu drivers,</p>
<p>but can occasionally be more on target.</p>

- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Anti-Virus software</span>, particularly AV suites that run a number of programs in the background<br />

- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Malware, Spyware or Virus</span> are possible. Run a full boot-time scan with your AV.<br />
A virus called iehighutil.dll&nbsp; that come as an added bonus from some torrent downloads is one example.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">System 'optimising' software </span>is another possibility.<br />
- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Games often cause TDR. In some cases this is due to using too high graphics settings.</span><br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>System: 32 gb ram; 5930k; x99 deluxe motherboard; 2x 980ti 6gb; 970 vnand m.2; 850 evo.</p>
<p>It was working fine, the only things that changed on the system was the latest Windows update, and the new Nvidia driver. (I've tried an older driver)</p>
<p>The game it seems to be doing it on is DayZ; however because it's random I can't really varify without playing them all. It hasn't done it at all on desktop so far.</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers etc. to no avail.</p>
<p>I've done full system virus scans; disk checks; sfc &amp; dism with no problems indicated.</p>
<p>I've now completely reinstalled windows, updated all drivers and it's still doing it.</p>
<p>I don't think it's the tdrdelay anymore (it isn't present on my desktop or laptop just tdrWatch), my laptop is running it fine. I'm beginning to think it's hardware.</p>
<p>I've tried disabling audio drivers etc.</p>
<p>I've just been trying it again whilst taking sensor logs, it rebooted again. I'm still going over the logs, if you'd like to see them let me know.</p>
<p>I'll take the pc apart tomorrow and check there's not any obvious signs of damage on the motherboard (expanded capacitor etc.)</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>David.</p>

<p><em>"the only things that changed on the system was the latest Windows update"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Not version update1809 I hope. If so, the update could very well be the source. 1809 was pulled because of data loss,</p>
<p>but going by the forums, it looks to be riddled with issues. Loss of audio, and the Intel graphics driver issue (which I think is to do with&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Intel HD audio component ) being the most prevalent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I was thinking because of DayZ's reputation for being buggy the may be the cause, but if it was running OK before an update,</p>
<p>probably not. However the update may have introduced a conflict between the game and another software ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Try running with one gpu installed at a time too, and if you still get TDR try using a single card in the second slot.</p>
<p>(Extreme example - I remember suggesting someone on the Nvidia forums a couple of years ago remove one gpu,</p>
<p>and on removing the second card the slot fell off the board.&nbsp; )</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>No, I'm still on 1803. I did however update (I always keep everything updated) to the new Cumulative Update before all the warnings started coming out on YouTube et al. I guess I was fortunate as it didn't seem to affect my system. Everything was still running
 fine. The problem seems to have started when the&nbsp;update was re-released, however, I've not got an issue on the laptop (which is below minimum specs for DayZ but&nbsp;runs it at 30 fps+ on medium).</p>
<p>And, I've now done a complete reinstall of Windows.</p>
<p>Apologies, I forgot to mention that I've run memtest etc. with no problems; everything&nbsp;has been reverted to&nbsp;stock; and I've disabled sli. Nothing is working. I've looked at my&nbsp;power supply monitor readings, there doesn't seem to be any power spikes or drops.
 I've contacted Corsair for so advice (AX1200i). I was already on the latest BIOS, but I re-flashed it anyway.</p>
<p>I've checked all power connections: no apparent issue. Tried different power outlets.</p>
<p>I'll take the system apart and check for any problems on the motherboard, and try with just one card.</p>
<p>I'm on my desktop (instead of mobile) writing this, the issue seems to be only when I game.</p>
<p>The only other game I've tried so far was Jurassic World Evolution-I played that for about 2+ hours without issue, however, because it's random I don't know if I gave it long enough or not. DayZ is definitely the worst for this issue. I thought I'd solved
 it the other day when I managed to play DayZ for just over 2 hours, but it restarted again.</p>
<p>The Windows error I get is Kernal-Power 41 (63), the only reason I thought it was the TdrDelay (never heard of it before) was that Aida64 said it was too low. I downloaded Aida64 to stress test the system, but never ran it because I&nbsp;wasn't certain whether
 or not to allow the software to alter that value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree DayZ is buggy, but no one else I know is having this problem. I'm at a loss.</p>
<p>Thanks for your continued help.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>David&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>"I'm at a loss."</em></p>
<p>Same here mate. I have no more ideas.&nbsp; I have the latest cumulative updates as well, and probably missed 1809 debacle by a few hours</p>
<p>(probably in the time it took me to do my pre-version update C:\ drive backup clone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the Kernal-Power 41 error indicates is the machine crashed (rebooted without cleanly shutting down ), so you can get this
</p>
<p>error from any lock-up that requires rebooting via the case button, or random reboot.
</p>
<p>Anything that prevents Windows from doing it's thing as when you shut down properly via the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I take it back... More ideas....</p>
<p>- Fair to assume you are using the High Performance Power Plan ?</p>
<p>- Or, how about this long shot... An unusual power related issue I'd never heard of before this week is the BIOS setting</p>
<p><em>Aggressive Link Power Management.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone who was having a problem with his gpu crashing wasn't having any luck and resorted to trawling his BIOS and found that</p>
<p>ALPM was enabled by default on his motherboard, and disabling it solved his problem.</p>
<p>I think his issue was only when running Overwatch.</p>
<p>Another one of those irregular gaming issues. As it works out I have one mobo that defaults enabled, and another that defaults disabled,</p>
<p>and I've never had a problem with it enabled. </p>
<p>Enabled shouldn't really be a problem for anyone as all ALPM does is lower the power to SSD/HDD when the machine is at idle.</p>
<p>( Maybe it's more of a problem if you use Sleep or Hibernate with ALPM enabled ? )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers - BD</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>EDIT :</strong></span></p>
<p>- If you want to try the old TDR timing fix anyway. First try the key below in the Graphics Driver folder, but you may find</p>
<p>that with Win10 it works better in the Graphics Driver\TDRWatch sub-folder.</p>
<p>(I thought I was clear on this after doing some checking, but there is nothing specific to Win10, so still not sure it will help)</p>
<br />
<p>Open regedit and Navigate to -<br />
H_KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ System \ CurrentControlSet \ Control \ Graphics Drivers&nbsp; - or \TDRWatch.<br />
Right click on the open field and click on New / QWORD (64bit) Value,<br />
Name the new key:&nbsp; TdrDelay -&gt; double click it -&gt; Set the value to 8. </p>
<p>.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes, I've tried every power configuration.</p>
<p>Thank you for trying to help, I do appreciate it.</p>
<p>I'll see what Asus and Corsair say, in the meantime I'll try editting that registry value.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Cant download profile error 80151103</h2>
                    
<p>ok so I have searched through many posts about this problem but none of them were recent or helped me out any. The problem started when I tried to log in today and my xbox asked for added security. After failing to log in despite knowing my correct password
 and everything I started to trouble shoot. After many failed solutions I resorted to deleting and reinstalling my profile to find that it will not let me, stating something like "you cannot download a profile right now error 80151103." I have tried deleting
 and reinstalling the xbox update, deleting cache 3 times with a reboot, I updated my proofs. Im about out of ideas here.</p>

<p>Sorry that I keep posting to my own comment but I just wanted everyone to know that I have I have reinstalled my profile back to my HDD and everything is working fine again. I believe Skunkboy74 was right about it being on Xbox live side. I recommend just
 turning off your console for a bit and trying later as it will probably solve it self. Please nobody panic like I did. It will all be ok. :P</p>

    <title>. del key on the numeric keypad stops working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oleg k .  say:</h3>
<h2>            . del key on the numeric keypad stops working</h2>
                    So I'm running Windows 7 pro and MS office 2007 pro. I do a lot of work in Excel and every once in a while for no apparent reason my del (.) key on the numeric keypad will quit working.  this is not a hardware issue, I already confirmed that several times.  Usually it is fixed by restarting the PC but seriously when I have bunch of applications open and in a middle of a project that is not the most convenient time to reboot my PC.   By the way, when this happens this key stops working in all the programs.  The numbers 0123456789/*-+ work just fine but the (. del) key does not. What the **** is causing this???  How do I fix this stupid problem???  This is very very very very........ IRRITATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thanks.

            Seems that no one has any clue about this problem out there, but I had it happen again today.  Same story, doing some work in Excel, as usual using shortcut key combination and all of a sudden Del (.) key just quit working again.  the Period (.) key on the alphanumeric keyboard section works just fine, but the Del (.) key on the numeric section just quits, like it's not even there.  Just plugged in a second keyboard and it's the same ****, the key still does not work on either one.  Unplugged and back and still not working.  What is this stupid problem!!!  Only starts acting like this when working in Excel, and when it quits working it does it in everywhere else.  This is a brand new PC running Windows 7 pro with MS pro on it.  Dell Precision T1650.  Using standard issue DELL keyboard L30U and L100 (one at a time).
