<h2>            Ring of Elysium - Battle Royale game</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>don't know if you've heard about the new battle royale game "Ring of Elysium" but I've played it and its awesome. If you compare it with PUBG, its way better, better graphics, there are some new ideas which I think makes it better than Fortnite as well.
 Problem is, that its only on Steam and of course with keyboard and mouse controls only. As I am console gamer over 10 years I would like to suggest it for "to whom it may concern" to bring it to xbox one. THX.</p>

            I haven't heard of this game. I'll have to take a look at it on Steam when I get the chance. It would probably be best to ask the developers themselves if they plan on releasing the game on any other platforms though.&nbsp;

            It's Tencent's own version of PUBG. Came out earlier this year but only in Asia. They've added EU and US servers in the past few weeks, and released it on Steam as well. I haven't played it myself, but it looks pretty good and has a great selection of
 weapons, including the fantastic M1 Garand.

            Definitely get in touch with the games developers and let them know that you would love to see their game come to Xbox One, I'm sure there are many others who would love to play it on Xbox One as well.

<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1803 &#47; importing photos from SD card</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I upgraded to Windows 10 Version 1803 in June, I can't import photos from SD card.&nbsp; It doesn't see any photos on the card, but they are there (appear OK in my camera).&nbsp; Originally this machine had Windows 7, but was upgraded to 10 prior to the
 V. 1803 upgrade (if that's significant).</p>
<p>Have Googled and read many things suggested by many people (including Microsoft Community) none of which seem to work for any of them - or me - for the ones I've tried.&nbsp; Is there a bug in V. 1803 pertaining to this?&nbsp; It used to be so simple (click on photos,
 click import, it would see them on the card, click / check boxes on the new ones to import and done!) and now hours and hours wasted over several days trying to figure out what changed or went wrong w/ the upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Al.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is the SD card driver installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button?   If not download and install the latest from the Toshiba Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If the driver is there, then from Driver tab select Roll Back, or if that's not present choose Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />If driver is in place, what happens when you insert the SD card?  Is there any activity detected or a listing that shows up in File Explorer you can click to open, or right click to Format?  See how here:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/format-sd-card-using-windows-4128719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/format-sd-card-using-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If these all fail run the Hardware troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Does the SD card show up in another device and work?
<br />
<br />Does another SD card show up and work in this device?
<br />
<br />See if the SD card shows up in Disk Management (reached by right clicking Start button) by scrolling down on Drive map to look closely for it by size and name.  If not right click to issue a Drive letter so it shows up in Explorer.
<br />
<br />Other troubleshooting steps:

<p>Greg, I tried what you (and Andre) suggested, but didn't solve it.&nbsp; This afternoon kept doing more digging and found what sounded like / or similar to my issue (see SOcalkpr of Feb 5, 2018, below) - only it pertained to Update 1709 vs. 1803.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So I tried keyotu80's instructions of a little more than a month ago, about downloading&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=25&amp;PFid=25&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false#RTS5101/RTS5111/RTS5116/RTS5169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RTS5101/RTS5111/RTS5116/RTS5169&nbsp;(Software)</a>&nbsp;from
 Realtek.&nbsp; It didn't start working "right away," but after a last ditch effort at a restart, it did.&nbsp; Frick'in AMAZING!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Have ALWAYS been wary of "updates" screwing something up - and will be even more so in the future.&nbsp; Ridiculous the time wasted getting something to work again that Microsoft screwed up in the first place!!!&nbsp; ... and only to get a few next to worthless features
 I really don't care about / will never use anyway.&nbsp; &nbsp;This novice gets the feeling no one at MS knows what's going on there anymore / no one is in charge of the asylum!&nbsp; There's got to be a better way for MS to come clean with their customers / users with known
 issues that exist and the fixes for them!&nbsp;</p>

<span>Q:</span><span>Realtek PCIE Card Reader No Longer Functions After Fall Creator
 Update 1709&nbsp;</span>
<div>
<p>Hello.&nbsp; My HP Laptop was updated to the Windows 10 Fall Creators update 1709 back in November.&nbsp; Since then, my SD Card reader no longer functions.&nbsp; I have tried to uninstall and reinstall the drivers.&nbsp; I have searched all over google for potential
 fixes for this and so far nothing has worked.&nbsp; I tried to troubleshoot the hardware.&nbsp; Windows shows there is a problem with the drivers but offers no solutions.&nbsp; When checking the properties in the device manager, it says the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)<br />
<br />
The request is not supported."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<h2>            PUR-RiskReject error while trying to purchase app on Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>I am getting a PUR-RiskReject when purchasing an app from the Windows 10 store on my Lumia 928 (running Windows 10).&nbsp; This is the first time this has happened.&nbsp; I made a purchase in JAN 2016 without any problems.&nbsp; My Microsoft Account has not changed nor
 has my form of payment (PayPal).&nbsp; I live in USA and my region, date and time is set to USA.&nbsp; The app I am trying to purchase for my phone is Yaht 3D (of whom the developer is located in UK).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I getting this error?&nbsp; My form of payment with PayPal is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now, in order to ascertain if the issue lies with the Microsoft Account(MSA) you own, I suggest you to use another device using the same MSA and check if it allows you to purchase the app from Windows Store.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Let us know the results for us to be able to assist you further.</p>

            <p>I&nbsp;was trying to purchase an app (actually <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/lahtohetki/9nblggh0fmbq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this very app</a>)&nbsp;from the US Store from Windows 10 Mobile while basing in Russia and using a payment card issued by some Russian bank.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Regional settings on the phone are set to United States (All settings|Time &amp; language|Region|Country/Region).</p>
<p>2. My Microsoft Account is set to the US.</p>
<p>3. My Billing address <strong>is set to an US address</strong>.</p>
<p>4. The Store used&nbsp;is the US Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I wasn't able to purchase the app using&nbsp;these settings. To purchase the app I had to use my PayPal account where Billing address was set to my location in Russia. However, in Microsoft Store the PayPal payment option was set for purchases in the
 U.S.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I wasn't able to purchase the app using payment option with the card issued by Russian bank and Russian billing address specified in Microsoft store.</li><li>I also wasn't able to purchase the app using payment option with the card issued by Russian bank and&nbsp;US billing address specified in Microsoft store.</li><li>I was able to purchase the app using payment options with the card issued by Russian bank and Russian billing address specified in PayPal where in Microsoft Store this payment option was targeted for purchases in the US.</li></ol>
<p><strong>It looks like your Regional setting of your payment option (For purchases in XXXX) listed in Microsoft Store must match the country where your card was issued.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I kindly ask MSFT representatives to comment on this. Why&nbsp;are we restricted to&nbsp;payments in&nbsp;the region specific to the country that issued the card? What if I want to buy&nbsp;some&nbsp;goods in the US and have them delivered to&nbsp;an US address&nbsp;without having a bank
 account in the US?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>@Exotic Hadron:</p>
<p>I know that is thread is old, but I would like a reply from MS too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, my region is US, I was in US when I was making the purchase and my payment is through PayPal using a US credit card and my US billing address. So I should not get this error. Other apps I am able to purchase without any problem and these apps
 are developed outside of the US (I have several from Russia!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to contact the app developer and he kindly gave me a gift certificate to "buy" the app.&nbsp; But he did not have to do this - nor should he needed too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I feel that security is important in how payments are handled I feel this needs to be looked into so that app developers can get paid for their work and that end users can make purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live part of the year in Prague, Czech Republic and I've noticed that I have to change the region on my phone to US before making a purchase and since it's coming from an IP address outside of US, I have at times needed to notify PayPal first to explain
 why I'm not in my "home" country.</p>

                    <p>I'm trying to make a video slideshow with the Windows 10 Photos app - I selected the photos, they appear in a row at the bottom of the screen but then I cannot find a way to select them all in order to change, for example, the duration of all the photos.
 There must be a way to select them all but none of the usual methods seem to work.</p>

            This seems to be a limitation of the app at this time. The video editing features of the app are still maturing. I recommend you submit feedback to let the team know. Press Windows key + F then submit your feedback about the limitation.

<h3> steveallen7455  say:</h3>
<h2>            Widows 10 Upgradiding, fresh install whatever&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I would like to start with the fact that I have read many posts and replies. Normally I do not take the time to imput my own thoughts, as I find that eventually someone gets around to resolving these issues. However, one of the issues that has had me frustrated
 for the whole of last weekend, is the fact that windows 10, (I have upgraded both Pro and Premium) does not appear to show the UEFI options in the settings-update &amp; security-recovery (as stated on Micosoft and many other help sites). The tile, or card does
 not show as an option. It seems that many do not have the ability to answer the question that is put forth! There are many answers in how to "download and install 10 to a flash drive", how to use a "backup image", how to roll back to "pevious os". I have noticed
 that many are stating that, (if one reads the question) having installed 10 you cannot acces the UEFI/BIOS. The menue is missing, boot the machine and due to the security of the UEFI (which is a fantastic idea) you are not able to use the M/B "delete, F2,
 (F12 for boot options in my case), this is why UEFI was designed, was is not! If the menue is not there one has to find a way to fool the M/B that there is a hardware problem so that you can get into the BIOS in the tradional way, hence remove the HDD, remove
 the CMOS Battery. I have upgraded, I have reverted back, I have fresh installed, (on my four year old motherboard and one a few months old) both with UEFI features. The result is the same, the setting is not available in windows 10, so far as I can see. I
 would finish here though I can hear the cogs of the IT pro's ticking away, why would you want to get into the settings anayway? Well they Know the reasons why but it would only prolong the agony, there are many reasons but my main one was because I wanted
 to re-install windows 8, (as much as I do not like it) but at least it worked. Unless you can change the UEFI settings or get into the M/B BIOS this will not be possible.</p>
<p>I wrote this blog partly thanks to Foxonly's answer to an old Blog. People just do not listen!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to help. However, we will need some more detailed information on what game you are playing and on what console you are&nbsp;using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we would need more information about what 6 digit access code you are referring to because I don't recall needing a code to enter when playing games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only 6 digit code I know is the passkey and that is a security option you choose for signing in to Xbox Live or accessing account settings on the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us some more information and we will be happy to assist!</p>

</p><p>This is called your passkey. Whoever set the pass key up will need to enter this. If it was your parents I suggest asking them. Here is some

<p>Where did you find the product key you are using? You are not, by any<br />
chance, using the product key that's on a sticker attached to your<br />
laptop, are you?</p>
<p>If you are, that's the wrong product key. It's the product key for<br />
Windows, not for Microsoft Office.</p>

            Ok. Can you please try the following and let us know (if you're using a laptop, of course)?

Shut down your PC. Remove the battery, press and hold the power button for 60 seconds. Put the battery back in and start your PC again.

    <title>Xbox One Controller - Vibration zu stark - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller - Vibration zu stark</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p><br />
ich habe folgendes Problem: </p>

<p>Alle Controller die ich habe vibrieren seit Dienstag Abend (nach 2 Stunden Watch Dogs zocken) zu stark.</p>
<p><br />
Es hört sich an als würde ein RC-Copter starten wollen... fühlt sich auch so an.</p>
<p>Ich habe die Konsole neu installiert, das Controller Update gemacht, Controller von Freunden getestet... immer das selbe Problem.</p>

<p>Kennt das Problem Jemand?</p>

<p>Grüße</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;APPiNA7OR!<br /><br />Just to clarify, are you saying that your controller is vibrating too strong? &nbsp;In order to make sure that we are not missing any troubleshooting steps, I recommend trying a few if you haven't already.<br /><br /><strong>Please give the following steps a shot:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console powers off, wait 5 minutes.</li>
<li>Power on your console.</li>
<li>Replace the batteries in your controller.</li>
<li>Test a different controller to see if you encounter the same issue.</li>
<li>Test your controller on a different console.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the game you are playing, you may be able to disable controller vibrations in the game settings. &nbsp;Give the suggested steps a try and let us know if the issue continues to occur.<strong><br /><br /></strong></p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>The thumbnail filter for .wmf files was&nbsp;deprecated quiet a few years ago because of security vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>You can use third party programs to view the wmf thumbnails. These third party programs convert the image thumbnails into their own proprietary format to display the thumbnails.</p>
<p>One program is the free Irfan View program. It comes with a separate thumbnail viewer.<br />
<a href="http://www.irfanview.com/main_start_engl.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">IrfanView Download</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The&nbsp;third party software program(s) mentioned in this post are not supported by Microsoft.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></p>

                    <p>If my CPU is not supported for the Windows 10 x64 why not allow a downgrade to 32 bit windows 10 ?</p>
<p>My computer only has 2GB of ram anyway. I meet all the specs of 32 bit and I can actually clean install it without any problems. It just wont activate cause my windows 7 is 64 bit. Why not give us poor guys with older CPUs the free upgrade in 32 bit.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, what cpu do you have? Secondly, you can only upgrade from 32 bit to 32 bit or 64 bit to 64 bit. If it bothers you so much, get a legit Windows 7 32 bit installed then try to do a Windows 10 32 bit upgrade.</p>
<p>

            <p>AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 3800+</p>
<p>I am one of the many being told our CPUs are not compatible with CompareExchange128</p>
<p>and windows 10 x64 setup will not run. However I have burned both versions ( x64 and x86 ) to disks, and I can go into the sources folder and run setup and install the 32 ( x86 ) version just fine. last night I was setting up Cortana, she was opening up
 my emails and telling me the weather and everything. The 32 bit version mind you. But it will not activate since it was not a legit UPGRADE through the setup.exe in the root of the disk. So I had to format and reinstall my windows 7 x64 and download and reinstall
 all the 300+ updates today. Now I'm back to windows 7 again. my beef is this... If the 32 bit version runs just fine without that CompareExchange128 problem, why can I not be given the option to Down/Upgrade to the 32 bit version of windows 10 from a 64 bit
 version of windows 7. As long as my win 7 is activated and legit. All they would have to do is check my product key from my windows 7 and issue me a legit windows 10 key to me.</p>

</p><p>whats more I cant find the old folders to propogate anything onto other storage or anything.</p>

<li>Did you make any changes before the issue started? </li><li>Have you tried connecting your microphone to another device? </li><li>When did you notice the issue? </li></ul>

            <p>The only changes made to my computer we in the automatic updates Microsoft sends out.&nbsp; I noticed the system had a problem when I tried to tune my guitar using the "Pitch perfect musical instrument tuner" software I had been using and got no response.&nbsp; I
 tried it using the built in microphone in my laptop.&nbsp; Then I plugged in an external mike.&nbsp; Then I tried plugging my guitar pickup directly to the input port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the control panel and searched for the volume control.&nbsp; At first it only showed the volume control for the speakers.&nbsp; When I finally found the control for the mike, it showed that the mike was muted.&nbsp; I clicked the "Mute" icon and the Mike came
 on and went right back off.&nbsp; I wondered if it was a feedback problem; so, I tried to reduce the volume on the speakers.&nbsp; I found that the controls were tied together.&nbsp; If you reduce the volume on the speakers, the mike volume goes down too (even if the mike
 is muted).&nbsp; I then disabled the speakers by connecting external speakers and turning them down separately.&nbsp; By searching in the control panel, I got it to display the volume mixer panel.&nbsp; With that I was able to see that in the few seconds the mike was un-muted,
 The computer was actually receiving sound input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the recording device control panel, I see that the Mike is registering sound; but it is not being communicated to any of my software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As I continue to open the "volume Mixer" control panel, more icons are being displayed.&nbsp; Now the mike is no longer showing muted, it is the "Microsoft(c) Register Server".</p>
<p>Now the mike doesn't even work for a few seconds.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;your webcam is disabled this can mute the microphone. The mike and camera in a lot of laptops are on the same expansion board so if you disable the webcam the microphone is disabled also.</p>

<h2>            Client does not understand purpose of Service Packs</h2>
                    I have a client and I have difficulty in explaning a matter related to purpose of SPs. Any comment is appreciated.<br />
<br />
The client has a computer running an application with SP2 and creates a file on that computer. Then sends the file<br />
to an overseas user using a computer with SP1. The overseas user experience some problems with the file,<br />
tries with another SP2 machine and it is all OK. <br />
I told the client that the problem may be something in the file and it is not related to SP2-SP1 compatibility. He<br />
insists SP2 should be compatible with SP1. I tried to explain, SP is not a new version release, it fixes bugs etc...<br />
and we never speak of compatibility between SPs. SPs are not for creating problems it is for fixing problems.<br />
I will not give the name of the application because he may see the post. He now decided to roll all the computers<br />
back to SP1 that I do not aggree with him. <br />
<br />
What do you think ? <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>When most people think about keeping their systems secure, they think about security patches rather than service packs. In fact, one of the most frequent mistakes people make when performing security maintenance is to over-rely on patches and under-rely
 on service packs. You may be surprised to know that there are significant differences between the two, and that service packs, rather than patches, should be used for the heavy lifting. In this article, we'll discuss the differences between patches and service
 packs, and the most effective strategy for using them.</p>
<div>Same Genus, Different Species </div>
<p>Similar to the way plants and animals can be classified into family, genus, and species, Microsoft software can be informally classified to indicate its scope and purpose. From top to bottom, here are the terms we generally use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>product family</em> is a collection of products that have a related purpose. For instance, the Microsoft Windows® product family includes all Windows operating systems, such as Windows 3.11, Windows 95, and Windows 2000.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A <em>product</em> is one member of a product family. For instance, Microsoft Windows NT® is a product in the Windows family.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A <em>version</em> is an instance of a product. For instance, Windows NT 3.5, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000 are different versions of the Windows NT product.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A <em>service pack</em> is a periodic update that corrects problems in one version of a product. For instance, there have been six service packs for Windows NT 4.0. Some Microsoft products use the term
<em>service release</em> rather than service pack, but the terms mean the same thing.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A <em>patch</em> is an update that occurs between service packs. A patch is sometimes also referred to as a
<em>hotfix</em>. Most patches are built to correct security vulnerabilities, but we also build patches to correct critical stability or performance issues. In this article, though, we'll only discuss security patches.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You can see that service packs and security patches are closely related. Both are vehicles by which Microsoft corrects bugs in its products. But the similarities end there. Patches and service packs have completely different scopes, and if you understand
 the differences between them, you can use each most effectively.</p>
<div>Service Packs are Strategic Deliveries </div>
<p>The chief difference between service packs and patches is that service packs are strategic deliveries, where patches are tactical. That is, service packs are carefully planned and managed, and the goal is to deliver a well-tested, comprehensive set of fixes
 that is suitable for use on any customer's system. In contrast, patches are developed on an as-needed basis to combat specific, immediate threats to our customers' security.</p>
<p>The key thing to remember about service packs is that they are <em>planned</em> releases. Everything about a service pack is planned—how many there will be, how often they'll be released, and how they'll be delivered to customers. The reason all this planning
 is needed is because, in our view, every customer should apply service packs as soon as possible after they're released.</p>
<p>Service packs have a carefully-selected scope and are delivered at carefully-selected intervals. If we were to produce lightweight service packs at rapid intervals, administrators might judge that they were not worth the time and effort required to apply
 them to hundreds or thousands of machines. On the other hand, if we were to produce very large service packs at infrequent intervals, administrators might be leery of installing such a large code change. We try to reach a "sweet spot" in which the service
 packs are just the right size and are delivered at just the right interval so that administrators will install them promptly.</p>
<p>Patches are just the opposite. Because we can't easily change the scope and frequency of service packs, we develop patches to provide interim solutions to security issues that arise between them. Patches are by their very nature unplanned—and we always hope
 we'll never need to build one. But software development is an imprecise science, and we know that there will always be bugs—some of which affect security. As a result, there will always need to be patches. But they're not a replacement for service packs –
 service packs have two enormous advantages over patches.</p>
<p><strong>Service Packs are Comprehensive</strong></p>
<p>Service packs have a significantly larger scope than patches. This can be measured in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Service packs address a wide variety of bugs. Every service pack addresses not only security bugs, but also bugs affecting stability, performance, proper operation of product features, or other areas. In contrast, a patch is tightly focused on one and only
 one issue.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Service packs resolve minor as well as major bugs. On the other hand, we know that customers have things they'd rather be doing than installing patches, so we only develop patches for issues that warrant the disruption they cause.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Service packs are cumulative. Every service pack is a "roll-up" of all previous service packs for that product—for instance, Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a includes every change made in Service Packs 1 through 5. Moreover, whenever we release a patch, we
 always include it in the next available service pack.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The net result of all of the above is that service packs are the best way to keep your system in top condition. Patches certainly have their place, but even if you were to install every patch Microsoft ever released, it wouldn't eliminate as many bugs as
 simply installing the most recent service pack.</p>
<p><strong>Service Packs are Better Tested</strong></p>
<p>Because they're planned releases, service packs are quality-driven. That is, we won't release a service pack until it meets the same quality standards as the product itself. Service packs are constantly tested as they're built, and then undergo weeks of
 rigorous final testing that includes testing in conjunction with hundreds or thousands of third-party products. If the testing reveals bugs that will prevent us from meeting our quality standard, we'll delay the release of the service pack.</p>
<p>In contrast, response time is the paramount issue when we build a security patch, because security patches are built in response to a clear and present danger to our customers. As a result, we have to balance the thoroughness of the testing against the need
 to deliver the patch as soon as possible. The amount of testing varies depending on several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is the issue public? If it is, it significantly increases the time criticality of the issue and reduces the time available to test the patch. This is one reason why responsible security professionals work with the vendor whenever they find a security vulnerability—it
 results in a better patch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>What functions are affected by the patch? A patch for a vulnerability affecting a core operating system function requires deeper testing than one that affects an isolated part of the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>What third-party products will the patch affect? A patch that changes how third-party products work with ours requires much more testing than one that doesn't.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>We always test our patches as thoroughly as we can, within the constraints of time in which we have to operate. But, in the end, patches are more likely to contain regression errors than service packs are.</p>
<div>Getting the Best of Both Worlds </div>
<p>It's probably obvious by now that the best way to secure your systems is to stay up to date on service packs, and use patches for their intended purpose—protecting your system until the next service pack is available. But what exactly does this mean?</p>
<p>First, it means that you need to plan to adopt service packs. Running an out-of-date service pack, and then piling patch after patch onto it is simply not an effective way to keep your systems up and running. (Although it's a lot better than running an out
 of date service pack and <strong>not</strong> installing patches). Consider setting up a test lab to evaluate service packs early, and develop plans and policies for rolling them out promptly. You might even want to enroll in service pack beta programs when
 possible, just as a way of getting an early look at what's coming.</p>
<p>Second, be choosy about the patches you install. One of the reasons we accompany every bulletin with a FAQ is so customers can understand exactly what risks a vulnerability poses, the effect it could have, and the machines that are primarily affected. If
 a vulnerability doesn't apply to your environment, don't apply the patch. Also, consider categorizing patches according to the risk the vulnerabilities pose. If a vulnerability poses a serious risk to your systems, apply the patch right away. But for minor
 vulnerabilities, consider having a regularly-scheduled update process that allows you to install several patches at once. This will make life easier for both you and your users.</p>
<p>Following these simple guidelines will give you better uptime, happier users, more free time and, best of all, better security. It's just a matter of using each tool to its greatest advantage.</p>

            I think the client is an idiot, and you need to quit doing business with him if he doesn't understand or accept what you are saying. Just make sure he knows his computers are at serious security risk, as well as operational risk, and some programs may
 not function without the latest service packs, and that it will be very costly to do the repairs.<br />
