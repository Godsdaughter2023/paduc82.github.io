<h2>            SSD drive upgrade activation problem.</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys, I have a little problem with this automatic activation thing after &nbsp;adding a new SSD card to My Desktop, on which I installed a fresh version of Windows 10 . So I do have a couple of questions. But before going to the questions I wanted
 to phrase step by step what I did, so you have a good feel of what is going on here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing to know is that before the lunch of Windows 10 I had a laptop and a desktop running windows 7. and as soon as Windows 10 came out I upgraded both of them with no problems. After the upgrade were successful I decided to install a
 fresh version of Windows 10 on each, which worked flawlessly with no issues on activation. I'm logged in both of my devices with the same Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Then I decided to upgrade my laptop with a new SSD Drive, on which I installed a fresh version of Windows 10 and had no problems.</p>
<p>After that I decided to do the same for my desktop, and I upgraded it with a new SSD drive, which I just added, I didn't remove any of my old drives. I decided to install a fresh version of Windows 10 on that SSD . I was happily using my desktop
 when I saw a message on the down right corner of my display saying That I needed to activate Windows. So I opened to activation window found in Settings and I saw a heart breaking message in red letters saying "We can't activate Windows 10 on this device because
 you don't have a valid digital license or product key. Go to the Store to buy genuine Windows. Error Code: 0x803f7001"</p>
<p>I went through the "Troubleshoot" screen which seamed to be looking for Activation problems, but I came with the same kind of message saying that the only way to activate windows is by going to the store and purchase the software.</p>
<p>Below that screen I saw a link saying "I change hardware on this device recently", I though this is going to solve my problem! But I got the same kind of massage, no possible to activate Windows. I saw the link &nbsp;<a href="https://sdx.microsoft.com/wlt/flow#/ineligibleDevices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See
 other devices linked to your Microsoft account</a>&nbsp;and I click on that and I can only see my laptop listed. So I decided to try and see if I can logging my Microsoft account on a browser, Which I kind of knew was there but I had never logged in for any reason,
 so I didn't know what to expect. and There I found not two, but three devices listed! One of them my laptop, and two desktops with different names, but the same Mother Board model. I checked and confirmed that one of them was in fact the one whit the SSD card
 that I was using and having problems with, so I decided to boot with the old hard drive and see the computer name, and in fact is the other one listed.</p>
<p>I know for sure that the Windows 10 on the old hard drive is activated, because I always kept it updated and had not a single sing that wasn't.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<p>Do I have to wait longer to get it activate?</p>
<p>Why on the windows settings I see only my laptop listed (this is on the desktop settings) and not the other two devices that are listed in my Microsoft account?</p>
<p>Please help me guys! I got couple of more computers from family that I maintain and I order a couple of SSD for upgrading them too. I don't want to have any issues with those.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks : )</p>

            <p>There shouldn't even be an issue requiring reactivation with a simple hard drive change, so there must be something interfering:&nbsp; my guess is leaving the old drive plugged in which is always a red flag which can lead to derailed boot files.&nbsp; I'm surprised
 it didn't configure a Dual Boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Always unplug all other drives during <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd do is boot into the old drive on the same PC with others uhplugged, assure your MS account is associated with the Digital License in Activation settings by signing in and looking for the message saying this, as explained in

<p>
</p><p>Then shut down, swap out the drives, sign back in to MS account and run the Activation Troubleshooter.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for replying Greg</p>
<p>I followed your indications but still can't get it to activate. This is what I found.</p>
<p>Firstly I should say that I didn't include some important info in my last post. I was trying to keep it short, which didn't work out very well anyways ; ) The thing is that I actually unplugged all drives and plugged only the new SSD when installing the
 fresh windows 10. After I got it running I turned the machine off and plugged all them back and made sure to set the boot priority to the new ssd drive. That's the reason why I don't get any boot menu. That said I did what you told me and unplugged and let
 only the old drive with windows 10 connected. I went to the "Activation window" and it clearly says that the license&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>is linked</em></span> to my Microsoft account and there is no problems there. &nbsp;There was something
 that I wanted to try and that was to change the "Computer Full Name" in the new installed Windows 10 to match the old one. I though that might help because as I wrote in my previous post, I got three machines listed in my Microsoft account site. and two of
 them are clearly the same machine with different names, but the same Mother Board Model. I did just that and restarted the machine, but still the same, so I again ran the command prompt as admin and executed slui 4 as you point me to refresh the license status,
 but as happened before it didn't do anything, no errors no prompt windows, nothing. I restarted the machine anyways but still the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one thing that bothers me though, In my Microsoft account there are this two machines listed with the same Mobo and the laptop, well this is how they are listed:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (This is the laptop)</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DESKTOP-DGNKxxx</span></li><li>Compaq Presario xxxx</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Serial #: CNU8160YQL</li><li>Windows 10 Professional (10.0.14393.576)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (This is the Activated win10 on the old hard drive)</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DESKTOP-UBPQxxx</span></li><li>H61MLV</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Serial #: None</li><li>Windows 10 Professional (10.0.14393.576)</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(This is the win10 on the ssd not activated)</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DESKTOP-C2NKxxx</span></li><li>H61MLV</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Serial #: None</li><li>Windows 10 Professional (10.0.14393.479)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As you can notice the desktops don't have the Serial number, and I think that might be because of the crappy mobo that I have : 0 That serial number I think might be an important piece of information that the algorithm is not catching and there for not being
 able to recognize these tow devices as the same. After I changed the computer name on the new Windows, on the Microsoft site is actually showing them with the same "Computer Name" which I will revert back to it's original.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't konw what else to try, but I have big hopes after reading your reply that it has to work. Now I will wait for more pointers from you guys.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Juan, the problem may be that if it detects two installations on the same PC, that then they need separate licenses.&nbsp; You can only use the Digital License for one.&nbsp; You'd need to buy a key to insert for the second.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you say that you tried slui 4 command to refresh the hardware signature, but were unable to get it to work?&nbsp; Did you use an Elevated Command Prompt?&nbsp; If it works you need to speak with an agent to see why it's not being&nbsp; allowed.&nbsp; If it doesn't then
 there is some sort of corruption so I'd go over the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist - Microsoft Community</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'd do next is open the Contact Support app and ask for help there.&nbsp; Explain everything you've done.&nbsp; See what they think.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks Greg</p>
<p>I never had the in intention of having two separates Windows. That is why I decided to disconnect the old drive for installation so I din't get dual boot. &nbsp;I actually was just about to format my old drive. I in fact have little to none personal files on
 that drive, only windows and installed programs, so I just almost format it right after the ssd installations was successful, and I didn't boot into that drive until I found the problem.</p>
<p>I contact support and see what they say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this problem solved soon after my last message but didn't have time to post how I got it to work.</p>
<p>I contacted support and I&nbsp;granted remote desktop&nbsp;access to someone from Microsoft, I guess. But the person trying to find the issue could not find a solution even after getting access to both my drives, the old with the linked MS account, and the new ssd&nbsp;that
 was not activated. Not sure what he told me then, but not solution found. But I never give up myself, and what I did is I decided to make an image of the old drive and record that image to the new ssd. I had some challenges though, the partition on the old
 drive where the OS was installed was 500GB. So I shrunk that partition to the size of the ssd&nbsp;and I recorded the image on it. then I booted on the ssd and, YES, was showing as activated. Now I knew that wasn't enough. I needed a fresh installation on windows
 on that drive, not the old dirty OS of the old drive. So, I waited for a couple of days, crossed fingers and proceded to install a fresh and clean win 10 on the ssd. I deleted all partitions on the ssd&nbsp;and created a new one, and proceeded to install windows,
 I had little hope to tell you the truth, but if it didn't work I will just put the image of the old drive back and use it like that until I get another idea. Well, when all the installation was done. oh yeah! problem solve. Until this day no problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Store and Photos app not opening</h2>
                    <p>At the moment the Windows Store and Photos app (there may be more) are not opening. When trying to open the initial splash screen pops up then it vanishes. When trying to open a jpeg I get an error message saying the app didn't start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through the steps on the following link:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/photos-app-not-working-in-windows-10/ff405237-3097-4c87-982f-b46b7fb7fddf?page=2&amp;auth=1">answers.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;and
 at the last step I get the message that "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC". I have copied the log file below. Is there a way to fix this?</p>

 check if the any of the app files are missing or corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the issue and in certain cases will fix the same to enhance the performance of the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In many cases, the
<strong>Windows Store</strong> will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, this tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue persist,
<strong>reset</strong> the store cache by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Resetting Windows store will clear, and empty the cache without changing account settings or deleting the installed apps. It is usually located in the
<strong>%SYSTEM%</strong> folder in the PC.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<span>Open <strong>Run</strong> command by pressing
<strong>Windows Key + R</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open <strong>Windows Store</strong> and check if the app can now be installed/purchased on your device.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> If the issue persists, create another administrator user account by
 referring to </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Set up accounts</span></span></strong></a><span>&nbsp;on
 Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Likhitha,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions, sadly none of them are working…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message only states that “the app didn’t start” and this only happens when I try to open a photo. Otherwise there are no error messages…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only recent change was updating Windows 10 to its latest version 1511, after this update is when I noticed the issue with the Windows Store and Photos App (I was testing other apps and the Maps app is also not opening)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created another profile after the two below methods were tried and the same issues were observed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1 results: When running the troubleshooter I receive a message stating “Troubleshooting couldn’t identify the problem”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2 results: received the message “ms-windows-store.PurgeCaches” “the app didn’t start”</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have also tried to purge the local cache as mentioned in other places online but this didn’t work as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3 results: After setting up a new administrator account I was still unable to open Windows Store, Photos and Map apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions on how to fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Jacob</p>

<h2>            Forgot Local Password</h2>
                    I turned off my computer for the first time in a while since switching to using a local account, and I forgot my password to my local account. I was never told nor prompted previously to set up a Password Reset Disc, I didn't even know what it was until
 today. How can I get back into my account? If it comes down to restarting everything, file loss is not&nbsp; a big deal to me, since all I had was music I can re-download.

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Version 1809 You do not have permission to access files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p5browne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Version 1809 You do not have permission to access files on a workgroup networked computer</h2>
                    <p>After spending a week trying to get Workgroup networked computers to communicate with each other, I finally got the solution. I originally could see the other computers in the network, but kept getting the `You do not have permission to access \\PC-Name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under System Properties, each computer was given a Name, Computer description, and a Workgroup Name (Common to all &nbsp;computers))</p>
<p>
</p><p>99% of the info I found online, including Microsoft's website, was WRONG!</p>
<p>You Do NOT have to change any Services items such as Function Discovery, Network Connections, Peer items, SSDP, DNS and UPnP, etc. LEAVE ON DEFAULTS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all comes down to how you set up your sharing on each computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting up Windows Settings &gt; Network and Internet &gt; Status &gt; Change connection properties &gt; Select Private</p>
<p>Back to Status: </p>
<p>Sharing options &gt; Under Private &gt; Turn on network discovery , and Turn on file and printer sharing</p>
<p>Sharing options &gt; All Networks &gt; Turn off password protected sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my purposes, I will setup a folder called Shared on each computer in the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, right click on the Shared Folder &gt; Properties &gt; Shared Properties &gt; Sharing &nbsp;&gt; Advanced Sharing &gt; Put check mark in Share this Folder. Shared name is Shared &gt; Permissions &gt; 2 items should now be available Everyone and Administrators (PC-NAME\Administrators).
 3 Allow permissions should be checked for Full Control, Change and Read for both Group or user names. If a Group or User is missing, add.</p>
<p>Also under Shared Properties &gt; Security &gt; 4 listings: Everyone, SYSTEM, PC-Name (PC-NAME\PC-Name), Administrators(PC-NAME\Administrators) and Allow check marks for all items. (If any of these 4 listings are missing, Add)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The systems originally had earlier versions of Windows 10, and since the computers were new, I deleted the old version and installed the 1809 version brand new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had issues with the Intel Driver Assistant and Dell's Support Assistant knocking out the network. By passed, and only used Dell's Command Update. Any driver issues not installing, downloaded directly from Dell. If upgrading an earlier Windows 10, and you
 run into either of these 2 upgrade programs, you may want to remove before the upgrade. If using, be aware they may cause issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 3 of the computers are talking to each other. As a precaution, after up and running, added in one program at a time, and checking after the network was still a go.</p>

    <title>An inaccessible drive with 0 byte in size appears every time I started - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alex k y yau  say:</h3>
<h2>            An inaccessible drive with 0 byte in size appears every time I started my computer.</h2>
                    
<p>I have assigned drive letter Q to a partition of my USB drive. After I removed the USB drive with the safely remove notification icon, the drive remains in the hard disk list in Computer of file explorer. I examine it and see that it is of 0 byte in size.
 I tried <em>mountvol /r</em> to remove it. It doesn't work. Then I tried <em>mountvol Q:\ /d</em> . It doesn't work either and gives me "access is denied" error. I tried<em>diskpart</em>
<em>list disk</em> and <em>list volume</em> . Both gives me no indication that a drive or volume took that drive letter. I also tried the GUI disk management,<em>diskmgmt.msc</em> which gives the same result.</p>
<p>How can I free that drive letter and remove that invalid device? Is it harmful to leave it there? Thanks for your help.</p>

<p><span>Hi Alex K Y Yau,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The drive letter remaining in the&nbsp;explorer doesn’t look harmful. However you can free the drive letter from the registry.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that you’ve logged in from the account that has administrative privileges.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: This section, method,
 or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you
 modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the windows help article below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Back up the registry</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to start, type regedit.exe and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate
 to the following registry key:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on&nbsp; <strong>MountedDevices</strong> and then select <strong>Permissions</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Check the option to make sure that Administrators have full control to the registry key.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Also
 in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices registry branch selected, in the right pane, find and locate a registry value which represents the troubled USB drive letter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you have inserted and mounted a lot of thumb drives, USB flash drive, or external hard disks before, you will likely still see a lot of remaining registry value. In this case, double click on each remaining registry key values to view its binary data. Inside
 the binary data, there will be trace of the name of the device that this registry key represents.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 the correct registry value is determined</span><span>, r</span><span>ight click on the registry value name, and the select&nbsp;<strong>delete</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Exit
 registry editor and verify if the drive letter still exists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Increasing RAM access for a single application.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have an application that needs to access between 2- and 3-G of RAM (I have 4-G installed,) in order to operate fully. Will Windows 7 (Home Premium, 32-bit) let a single program use this much RAM? I ask, because I know XP and Vista both came with
 a factory-installed command that limited Memory access by a single program to about 1.5-G, to keep it from interfering with other running programs. In both cases, however, the command could be over-ridden by a new command entered into the operating system.
 Is this how it is with Win 7? &nbsp;Is there an 'inhibiter' like this that can be over-ridden? If so, I'm guessing the new command would be entered through the "command prompt" function, but I don't really know if this is so, or what the proper command would be.
 Can anyone educate me about this?</strong></p>

                    My monitor is an LG 23MP65. It somehow managed to disable the file and now I can't access any OSD or use the power button or anything else.

            Would contact the manufacturer of the monitor for that for better assistance. It has nothing to do with the OS

<h2>            Unable to add another user account to Windows 10 in settings</h2>
                    Hi, Several people in the community have suggested creating another user account and logging into that account to fix the start button problems with the critical error. &nbsp;I have tried going into settings to add another user and nothing happens. &nbsp;I have
 tried going through the control panel and settings from the start button ( I have a bandaid fix for the start button) I need a better fix so I can turn off my computer instead of just putting it in sleep mode, Does anyone have a work around for getting another
 user account set up on my pc?

            <p>There are several ways to add a new user account. Try this method:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use the keyboard combination <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>to bring up the
<strong>Run </strong>window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the box, type in <strong>control userpasswords2 </strong>and click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In the window that opens, click <strong>Add </strong></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>4. The next screen will ask whether the user wants to sign in with a Microsoft account or not. Click the option at the bottom that says
<strong>Sign in without a Microsoft account</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click <strong>Local Account</strong> when presented again with the two options. Proceed to set up the user account.</p>
<p>

            Thanks #aakkam,&nbsp; I was able to create a local account and then change it to Administrative.&nbsp; Edge is back and the windows button is now working on left click instead of the dreaded blue Critical Error box.&nbsp; I do have a question.&nbsp; If I change this to a
 Microsoft account will the problems with Windows 10 start button come back?&nbsp; Do I need a Microsoft account on this user name if I will not be accessing this user name on my other devices? And lastly, will patches on other updates apply to my original corrupted
 user account (that migrated from Win 8.1) still come through.&nbsp; I am hoping MS will still fix this. Thanks

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why Should I use a Microsoft Account?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To download apps from the Windows Store</li><li>To be able to use Cortana (this is changing soon)</li><li>To use OneDrive</li><li>Signing in with a Microsoft account will sync your settings between devices. For example, if you tweak the appearance of your wallpaper, colors, theme, etc. and sign into another PC with that Microsoft account, you'll get the same settings.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Why Should I use a Local Account?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you don't use the Windows Store</li><li>If you don't use Cortana</li><li>If you don't use OneDrive</li><li>A Local account is more traditional. Some people prefer having one identity on one PC, and don't want to have their settings synced between PCs.</li></ul>
<p>All updates installed on a PC, regardless of the account type, apply to the entire system.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue. This is the first post I found with someone else actually having the same problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to add a couple extra User Profiles when I initially upgraded this laptop to Win 10 (biggest mistake of my life so far, by the way). I got so frustrated with Win 10 that I actually went out and purchased a whole new laptop that still had Win 8
 loaded! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am not happy with my new laptop because I bought a cheap one that is sluggish and times out a lot. I decided to come back here to my Win 10 machine and give it another try after a few months of not using it at all. I was able to log in to my initial
 User account, but I cannot add any NEW user accounts. I even deleted a couple of the extra User Accounts I added to this machine previously in case there was a limit to how many accounts I could have on this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting the same exact error message you are getting, and I tried it twice, with two different Microsoft Outlook email accounts. One that I created in the process of trying to add a new User section, and the other I created in advance, just in case
 that was the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if you ever got this resolved. I do not see any responses to this. We can't be the only two people in the world to be getting this error message. Hoping MS sees this and helps, because I cannot find a way to reach them directly with this issue.
 Many thanks to anyone who can offer a solution.</p>

            <p>No, this hasn't been resolved. I've spent hours with Microsoft Support, tried multiple solutions including copying old files and using the command prompt, but nothing worked. Using the command prompt I can create the profile, but nothing in the profile works
 i.e. start button, shortcuts, etc. I've given up for now, although I may give it a try on another computer that I've upgraded recently and see if I have a similar issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I couldn't be more help! Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi Paul, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may occur when system files get corrupted. Here are some solutions that you can try to resolve the issue:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the Automatic repair</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> to download the installation media. Once you've created the recovery drive,
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">boot your Surface from the the recovery drive</a></strong>.&nbsp; On the Windows Setup screen, choose your language preference, click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong>&nbsp; &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>
Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Automatic Repair</strong>.&nbsp; Restart your computer when the repair process is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the System File Checker tool</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If running the Automatic repair didn't work, run the System File Checker. It is a that scans and
<span>troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To do this, boot your Surface from the recovery drive then go to
</span><strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>.Type
<span>D<strong>ISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></span> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. Then, type<strong> sfc /scannow</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>. This will <span>scan all protected system files, and replace corrupted files. Once done, type Exit and restart your Surface.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Rebuild the Boot Configuration Data</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If running the System File Checker didn't work, try to rebuild the <strong>Boot Configuration Data.&nbsp;
</strong>Again, go to <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Type the the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>bootrec/ scanos </strong>and press<strong> Enter</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixmbr</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong><br />
<strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong> and press<strong> Enter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run Check Disk</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If rebuilding the Boot Configuration Data didn't help, run Check Disk to scan the hard drive for any errors. In the Command Prompt, type
<strong>chkdsk /r</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Wait for the process to finish then restart your Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If check disk did not find any errors and still the issue occurs, try to <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023533/surface-restore-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset your Surface</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the the solutions work, then this is a possible hardware failure and you may need to

<h2>            Windows 10 activation Home not pro</h2>
                    <p>I jusg built a new gaming pc and installed windows off of a flash drive, I chose windows 10 pro and continued without a key. Yesterday I bought a windows 10 home key... when i go to settings to activate it says it does not work. I am assuming this is because
 the pc says version ‘windows 10 pro’ but it is only a home key. I have uninstalled windows numerous times but it doesn’t let me change to home...</p>
<p>please help.</p>

            Hi Kaleb, you have to now trick the installation media into giving you the choice of which Edition (Home, Pro . . .etc.) of Windows 10 to install
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that document 
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save Aa, at the bottom of the Save As dialog, change file type to 'All Files' then save that file as ei.cfg (note you must manually add the cfg file extension) 
<br />
<br />Then copy that ei.cfg file into the Sources folder in your Installation Media 
<br />
<br />Then when you begin the Installation, you should be asked which Edition you want to install . . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />[EditionID] 
<br />Core 
<br />[Channel] 
<br />Retail

                    I'm running&nbsp;two ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series video cards on Windows 10. I want to install the newest DirectX. I looked in the diagnostic tool and it says I have Version 10.1. I have gone to Windows Updates and checked for updates, but it says it's up to date.
 I'm not able to play certain games, since I don't have at least Version 11. Any help would be thankful.

            <p>Actually, the previous post is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you run dxdiag, the DirectX version reported on the first page is the version supported by your OS - which is 12 for windows 10. To see the
<strong>actual </strong>version that your GPU supports, go to the "Display" tab and look for Feature Levels. It's most likely that the highest level shown there will be 10_0 or 10_1 and not 11_0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In reality, your GPU does not support dx11, and there's little you can do about it.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Driver error when trying to pair Microsoft Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse to Lenovo Ideapad Yoga running Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased the Microsoft Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse but cannot get it to pair with my laptop.&nbsp; I am using a Lenovo Ideapad Yoga running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The mouse will show up on the Bluetooth settings page and will attempt to pair, but ultimately
 fails and gives me a "Driver Error" message.&nbsp; I tried downloading the Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse app from the Microsoft Store but it won't do anything until the mouse is paired.&nbsp; I tried going to Device Manager and searching for the mouse in order to right
 click and update drivers, but the mouse does not show up.&nbsp; I also tried running Windows Update to see if there were any updates to install.&nbsp; All with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm able to pair the mouse with my MacBook Pro with absolutely no problems.&nbsp; I find it very interesting that it's this hard to pair with a laptop running Windows 8.1</p>

            Hi there, I wound my way through the phone support and got to a place where they wanted to charge me $80 for a one day subscription, but when I told them the mouse was brand new and i hadn't used it yet, they did go ahead and transfer me to a tech. She
 took over my computer and after about an hour of finangling, finally had to uninstall and reinstall the blue tooth driver (to do so, she had to download a tool off the lenovo webpage) and then i was able to connect the mouse with no problems and it is still
 working fine 2 weeks later.<br />

<h2>            Starting applications in the background</h2>
                    <p>I currently use Windows 10. I have yet to see any windows operating system support this feature, but I recall OS/2 used to.</p>
<p>I would like to start applications in the background, so I don't have to watch their loading screen, or keep hitting alt-tab to go to a different program while I wait for what I just started running to load.</p>
<p>Basically, my problem is when I start an application, it gets focus, and I have to fight it to get focus back to a different application that I am running. Loading an application can take 30 seconds to a minute since I tend to run things like virtual machines
 on my computer, or Really Big applications that use a gig or 2 of memory.</p>
<p>Is there some way I can start an application and not have it get focus, so it can do all its loading in the background, and just wait for me to go to it later and start using it?</p>

            <p>Change your shortcut of the program to "start minimized" and when&nbsp;you launch it it will start off minimized in the taskbar out of view.&nbsp; It will finish starting, but it will stay hidden and&nbsp;you won't see it until you intentionally go to the app yourself
 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this for shortcuts on your desktop, or shortcuts on the taskbar.&nbsp; Just go to properties by right-clicking (and if on the taskbar, right-click again on the icon in the jump list above "unpin") to reach properties and change the startup run mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's a program you can run from the command prompt (like advanced things like SQL or Hyper-V items), you can do that using the "start" command.&nbsp; Type "start /help" at the command prompt to see how to force minimized starting from a command prompt too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For even more functionality there are 3rd party tools, but I like the built-in stuff if I can help it.</p>

                    I know it is a safety feature so no will get to use your computer if you leave the room, but I only use the computer when no one is at home.&nbsp; I shut it down when I am finished.&nbsp; It is a pain&nbsp;to every few minutes to have to re sign in every time I leave

To address your concern, we suggest that you adjust your screen timeout setting. It helps you set the time on how long before the screen will be locked due to inactivity.<br />
<br />
You can follow the steps below on how to set your screen timeout:<br />
1. Right-click on the <strong>Desktop</strong>, then choose <strong>Personalize</strong>.<br />
2. Click <strong>Lock screen</strong> found on the left pane.<br />
3. Click <strong>Screen timeout settings</strong> at the bottom part of the page.<br />
4. Choose your preferred screen timeout on the drop down list under <strong>Screen</strong>.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 64bit Bluescreen Crash - BCCode&#58; 116</h2>
                    So, after more or less fixing a bluescreen problem with BCCode: 124, it's about a month later and I'm having a problem with my graphics card...<br />
Here's some of the details I could gather from the crash dump files.<br />
<br />
<b>VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (116)<br />
Attempt to reset the display driver and recover from timeout failed.<br />
Arguments:<br />
Arg1: fffffa8007ed54e0, Optional pointer to internal TDR recovery context (TDR_RECOVERY_CONTEXT).<br />
Arg2: fffff8800494de30, The pointer into responsible device driver module (e.g. owner tag).<br />
Arg3: 0000000000000000, Optional error code (NTSTATUS) of the last failed operation.<br />
Arg4: 000000000000000d, Optional internal context dependent data.</b><br />
<br />
I had a similar kind of problem before, where I'd be using my PC for just about anything. The screen would hang, before going blank for a few moments... and then would come back on displaying a message saying "Display driver stopped responding and has recovered".
 It was a nuisence, but didn't cause too much trouble. It didn't bluescreen crash beforehand, and I could use the PC fine afterwards, so to begin with I just ignored it.<br />
<br />
However this has been a problem I can remember having since not long after I got my graphics card, and recently it's developed into something worse. The same problem has been happening more often, but after hardly even recovering, it'll instantly happen several
 times more in quick succession (screen hang - goes blank - display driver recovers, then repeat) before crashing completely with BCCode: 116. I'm not sure how to treat this, since my graphics drivers should all be up to date, and I've set all the graphics
 settings back to default in the NVidia control panel, even though I'm sure they were default to begin with...<br />
If it helps, I'm using an NVidia Geforce GTX460 graphics card, from Gigabyte.<br />
Thanks for any help you can offer guys, I'll post the rest of the crash dump's contents below, for anyone who can read through it.<br />
<br />

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".</b><br />
<br />
<i>Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.</i><br />
<br />
<i>As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
&nbsp;Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
&nbsp;Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.</i><br />
<br />

            That makes a lot of sense, and helps a lot... but I would've thought it shouldn't be anything to do with cooling. I've rooted around the case not long ago, and run some air duster around it, and I also have plenty of fans in there to help with cooling
 (all running at full speed whenever it's turned on). I also keep a keen eye on the temperatures, and it hardly goes much above 30 degrees celcius, peaking at about 40 degrees when I've been running games.<br />
I'll give it another dust down just for the sake of it, and see if I can fiddle with the driver versions some more... But apart from that, are there any settings I should be wary of, just in case?<br />
Thanks again for the help, hopefully I can get this sorted out soon, and finally have no more problems with this build! If it does turn out that the graphics card is faulty however, it shouldn't be too much of a job to just replace it (been looking for an excuse
 to upgrade as it is).<br />

These can be related to heat, power, video ram, or the card itself.&nbsp; I would give fixing this one (or at least finding out what its problem is) before buying a new one.<br />
<br />
40C isnt a bad temp for a card under load.<br />

            Sorry for the long delay, I've had to put this on hold while I've been preparing to move back to university.<br />
In the meantime though, I've accumulated some more dump files, asside from the initial BCCode 116 which kept appearing to begin with. I've uploaded the dump files to dropbox, from just after the BCCode 116 issue started happening;
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/anho1dw9xrjxqs7/minidumps.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here for the zipped folder of minidump files</a>.<br />
Also, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mtb4422ybt5n205/DxDiag.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a> for the specs of my PC.<br />
<br />
Apart from BCCode 116, since the problem started, I've also had BCCode 7A, and the dreaded 124 has also seemed to return just now... ironically, I crashed just as I was trying to post here a few moments ago.<br />
I'll be trying more fixes, but unfortunately I don't have a whole lot of time to work on fixing it until I'm moved into my new place. I have however looked into some of the other dump files, and read up on general fixes, such as running a disk check... so I
 think that's one of the first things I'll do for now.<br />
<br />
Also, it might be helpful to refer back to this thread (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/windows-7-64bit-bluescreen-bccode-124/a7a18e59-e7b2-4393-8bd9-9b62bd46ebe7">click here</a>) of my previous BlueScreen
 problems for more context, since although I hate to say it... despite thinking that I'd solved my previous issue, it's probably the case that it hasn't yet been fixed afterall, and it could be the same unresolved fault(s) causing the problems I'm having now.<br />
I am having this problem more and more often again, so it's becomming more than just a nuisance.<br />

            Following suggestions? Don't mean to come off as sarcastic, but would help if ya could finish that post... XP<br />
Something small to add as well, I've also recently had instant bluescreen crashes any time I try to run certain games; Saint's Row: The Third, and Serious Sam 3 BFE. I used to be able to play Saint's Row absolutely fine beforehand, with this build, so it seems
 odd that it's crashing now. These crashes happen when trying to start up the games, and like I say, happen pretty instantly. Again, the BCCode for each one is either 124, or 101 (so again, misc hardware errors).<br />
<br />
Could this problem somehow be related to the PSU? I've started to think recently that seeing as I've had it for a while, maybe the amount of power I'm getting out of it has degraded slightly. If I remember rightly it should be 550W, whereas the amount of power
 required for the build should've been around 430W (that was before I added/ changed around hard drives however, and added a couple more fans). Just a thought, although somehow I doubt it'd solve everything to get a new PSU, even if it did help at all.<br />
Either way, I've included the last 2 or 3 dump files from when this happened into the original zip folder, along with the others.<br />

            ...Another long delay, where I've tried a lot of other different fixes, and I've managed to clear my BCCode 116 problem. The issue was caused by 2 add-ons in firefox for NVidia 3d vision, which I didn't even realise were installed. I disabled them in firefox,
 and uninstalled them both completely from my PC, and I haven't had the same issue with BCCode 116 ever since.<br />
<br />
I am still having intermittent crashes with BCCode 124, but I may have discovered the cause. One of my earlier attempts at fixing crashes was to update the BIOS, but since then (as stated in my last post) I have also noticed crashes (BCCode 124, and 101) occuring
 when I open certain games, which I had previously been able to play. I've researched people having similar issues, and it all points to an issue with AMD FX-4100 Bulldozer CPUs, and the BIOS. The solution given in most cases is to get an update for the BIOS
 from the motherboard manufacturer, but considering I had already done that, it seems as if the updated BIOS has only worsened things. I think I've even confirmed that the BIOS is the root of the problem (at least in the case of certain games crashing my system),
 as I am able to play these games perfectly, so long as I'm using something called Orochi-CEG... which is supposed to help as a temporary solution to a problem with the BIOS.<br />
<br />
With regards to a permenant solution, unfortunately, I'm already running the most up-to-date official BIOS for my motherboard. There is also a Beta version, but I cannot seem to reflash my motherboard with it, using the flashing utility bundled with the BIOS,
 due to Windows "compatibility" issues... So now I'm hesitant to try and reflash the BIOS manually with this Beta version, in case the BIOS is incompatible.<br />
<br />
I've already looked into this without any results, but if anyone else could shed any more insight on this particular issue with the BIOS, I'd really appreciate it. My motherboard model is GA-78LMT-S2P (rev. 4.0), manufactured by Gigabyte, and I'm currently
 running the FC version of the BIOS. The Beta version is FDc.<br />

<br />
I'm already grateful for all the advice that's been given so far, and I'm sorry again that my replies have been few and far between... I'm not trying to restart an old thread, but I figured people with similar issues may also find this helpful.<br />
Right now I'm trying to find out if this Beta released BIOS (FDc) is safe and stable to use with my current build... so if anyone knows if it's compatible/ stable, then please let me know!<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit - I'll also try and get those logs, and system information included in this post at some point tomorrow, but for now it's been a long day.....<br />

            <p>I updated to Windows 7.&nbsp; Have a geforce6200 graphics card.&nbsp; The computer crashed using windows media player and randomly while surfing the net.&nbsp; The media player was fixed using the advanced codecs program called Shark.&nbsp; The random crashes were fixed by
 turning off the "use hardware acceleration when available" function under the advance tab in Firefox.&nbsp; I guess geforce 6200 doesn't have that feature.&nbsp;
