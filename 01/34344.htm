<h2>            Unable to make any permanent changes in safe mode &#40;Vista&#41; also blue screen of death with an error 0x0000008E &#40;</h2>
                    
<p>Original title:<span>Unable to make any permanent changes in safe mode (Vista)</span></p>
<p>I am troubleshooting a friend's laptop that has Vista installed that had stopped functioning properly due to viruses. There was some initial troubleshooting work done on the laptop (that was not performed by me) that only made the computer function worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No recovery discs were included with the laptop, although there is a recovery partition, it is not accessible under the Windows Recovery Environment (a separate issue itself) and no recovery discs can be immediately ordered from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The starting state of the laptop was Vista would boot normally most of the time, although any attempts at accessing the internet would be slow and ineffective. One glaring issue, which I have never encountered before, was the primary hard disk is not recognized
 by the operating system, i.e. looking under Administrative Tools -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Storage -&gt; Disk Management would only show the optical drive; there was no disk 0 listed despite two drives being mounted and accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Various anti-spyware/malware programs (Malwarebytes has already been installed, I installed and ran HijackThis) were run to find and remove any lingering spyware/malware programs. There was also a rootkit virus detected in the boot sector which I believe
 was causing most of the problems, although it was not the only virus. I removed all the viruses that were detected and checked the hard disk for errors (a few were found and were fixed)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the present state of the laptop is Vista during a normal boot crashes before the login screen with a blue screen of death with an error 0x0000008E (0xC0000005 0x8209A2A7 0xA69CB91C 0x00000000) with no driver or processes listed. There is some process
 that is trying to access a file that now no longer exists, which is causing the error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A safe mode boot is successful, however any changes that are made in safe mode do not stick (i.e. Windows settings, disabling services, running anti-spyware programs, removing programs, etc.) I have already enabled the built-in administrator user, logged
 into that account and still no changes that are made are permanent. To illustrate what I am talking about, the auto restart on a fatal error option is still enabled on this laptop. Whenever I uncheck that options in safe mode as the administrator, the next
 time I try to normally boot the computer, it crashes and restarts. The next time I log into the admin account in safe mode the option is still checked. Right clicking and running any programs as administrator also does not make any changes permanent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The result is I can not change anything to try and fix this laptop (despite my numerous efforts I have tried thus far). I have run<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>from the command prompt (as
 the administrator logged on as the administrator user) and no problems were indicated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is frustrating me to no end; if it was XP I would have fixed this hours ago. I would appreciate any assistance.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have Kaspersky antivirus software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Possible causes of this error may include the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Hard disk damage</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>General hardware configuration problems with the BIOS, the memory,
 the hard disk, or with other devices</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Incompatible device driver</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Incompatible software</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>One or more of the random access memory (RAM) modules that are installed
 on your computer are faulty.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Unplug all the external devices connected and check f the issue repeats.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: <span>
&nbsp;</span>Boot using minimal RAM. For Example, if you are using 4GB(Gigabytes) of RAM of 2 sticks, then remove one of it and then try booting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the issue id fixed, then you can install the rest of the RAM.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Do hardware clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Do a hardware clean boot to isolate which device is causing the issue. For doing hardware clean boot do the following steps</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Unplug all the external Devices</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Start the System in Safe mode. (Pressing the F8 key while the computer restarts)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Go to Device manger</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Device that can be disabled for doing a Hardware clean boot are</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1. Video Cards</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;2. Sound Card</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;3. Network Card</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;4. USB Devices and controller (Please don’t do this if you are using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>5. CD and DVD</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>6. Modems</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>7. Ports (serial and parallel)</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>After doing this if you are able to Boot in Normal Mode try to enable the device one by one and check out which device is causing the issue .Try to install the latest driver for
 that device or contact the hardware vendor.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply and assistance,</p>
<p>There is no Kaspersky antivirus software installed to my knowledge, the only presently installed antivirus is AVG.</p>
<p>My main problem is not necessarily determining the source or cause of the 0x8E error (which can be very tricky to track down).</p>
<p>My primary problem is that any changes that I make while logged in as the administrator account (or any other user account) do not persist after a reboot. I did attempt a hardware clean boot with minimal RAM (there are no external devices) as you suggested.
 A normal boot failed with the same error message as before (0x8E). Rebooting into safe mode under the same administrator account revealed that all the devices that had been previously been disabled are now all reenabled again. I do not believe this is a normal
 behavior and is the only reason that I can see to make all troubleshooting of the 0x8E error to have no effect to this point.</p>
<p>This is what is so infuriating, as no changes that I make in safe mode persist to the next boot, so no amount of troubleshooting for the source of the 0x8E error has had any effect. Once I am able to make changes that actually persist on a reboot, then I
 can begin the task of determining the cause of the 0x8E error.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>You may check out these:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 start and type “msconfig.exe” in the search bar without the quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on the boot tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Make
 sure “Make All Boot Settings Permanent” is checked.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>And
 click Apply and check if that makes any difference.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: If not, do an in-place upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>Warning: Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer
 being deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and software programs. If a worst case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage
 devices before you perform an in-place upgrade. </span></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below and follow option 1 that explains how to perform an in-place upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968279" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968279</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: You need to have a Windows Vista DVD in order to perform an in-place upgrade.</span></p>

<p>Performing step 1 does not make any differences in the errant behavior of safe mode.</p>
<p>The owner of the laptop has already backed up all of their data beforehand, so a complete reinstall is what would be the preferred method of fixing the problem. However, there were no system recovery discs included with the laptop. And the "recovery" partition
 will not correctly boot into the windows recovery environment so a full reinstall will not work through that method. New recovery discs can't be ordered from the manufacturer anytime soon. I also do not own a Vista install DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The windows recovery environment problem involves what actually boots (when the recovery option is selected) doesn't match any of the screenshots I have seen for the winRE, or any of the pop-up windows that should occur in the winRE.</p>

            I am also having similar problems with a friend's computer. I have decided to reformat the hard drive and start over by installing Windows XP Pro. Everything goes fine until it gets to the point of starting the welcome screen to actually do the setup etc.
 That's when I get the errors (I believe they are the same as the ones listed above). My question is:&nbsp; how do I get Vista off the computer? I haven't tried formatting from the DOS prompt yet but its coming. I worry that his computer is just completely trashed
 and he needs to get a new one. I can submit other details as to what the computer is doing if needed....just didn't want to bog down this post. Basically just need to know how to get Vista off and XP on.

<h2>            Xbox Live profile won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download, error code 8015000A, tried everything, problem has persisted for over 3 weeks</h2>
                    
<p>HELP! I'm desperate. <br />
<br />
EVERY single time I try to download my Xbox Live profile on our Xbox 360, it starts downloading for 1-2 seconds and then I get this:
<br />
<br />
"Sorry, Xbox Live profile can't be downloaded right now. Try again later. <br />
<br />
8015000A" <br />
<br />
I have cleared the cache and done all the tricks and tips posted on here numerous times.
<br />
I have tried waiting - for 3 weeks, trying a few times every day. <br />
I share the console with my boyfriend who managed to download his profile a few weeks ago with no difficulty.
<br />
<br />
What is going on??</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue now. Deleted profile, cleared the cache, rebooted the system, and started downloading my profile and BOOM there's the error code 8015000A. Before this error I could sign in onto Xbox live, have a fully functional dashboard, go to
 recent games and select any game. Upon disc/hard drive game loading, I get disconnected from Xbox live. Very frustrating cause I just dumped $60 on a game</p>

<p>First I have to say that is one big mess to begin with. You are using the home group in a very unnecessary,&nbsp;confusing and improper way to share and it is&nbsp;corrupt. Improper File Structure for access to the other Computer, Carol-PC's Network Shared Public
 folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. First, Your default network WITHOUT JOINING A HOME GROUP, is for sharing files between computers. That is what your public folder is for.</p>
<p>C:\USERS\PUBLIC </p>
<p>2. You use the default public files or create additional ones in the public folder and everyone on your home network can access them all.</p>
<p>3. Try opening the "Network folder". There you should see Carol-PC, Your PC, Shared Media Devices, probably your Router/Modem. Open up Carols-PC and you will see "PUBLIC", "USERS" and any other Individual Files or Folders&nbsp;she has&nbsp;selected to share in the
 share settings. Open Public and you are now accessing Carols-PC Public Shared Files and Folders. This is where you should put files to share with others on your network.</p>
<p>4. But you need to go into advanced sharing settings and set as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fd80142-b82e-4e08-9616-a5ccb0c89ab5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fd80142-b82e-4e08-9616-a5ccb0c89ab5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a7656c1-6502-41d0-9d33-821abc9e817f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a7656c1-6502-41d0-9d33-821abc9e817f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0041c1d4-d87f-4a9a-becf-905ffc61254f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. In the network folder, you can right click on the other computers in your network and create shortcuts to your desktop and pin to "Quick Access".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Also, Printer sharing by Windows is controlled by network sharing settings. No Home Group is needed to share a printer.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p>A&nbsp;HOME GROUP is for sharing "MEDIA DEVICES" and "YOUR PERSONAL FILES". So instead of putting what you want to share into public folders, you can choose which media devices and personal folders to share. Personally, I join Home Group for media purposes, but
 I do not share my personal files. Everything I share goes into my NETWORK SEAHAWKS and PUBLIC FOLDER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Home Group Settings:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a1c4d68-eba7-4110-b135-721075180ef0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a1c4d68-eba7-4110-b135-721075180ef0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Sharing Personal Files For Home Group:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/907c8f73-208d-45a2-8e60-c96dbe0f3728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/907c8f73-208d-45a2-8e60-c96dbe0f3728" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>B. Sharing&nbsp;Media Devices&nbsp;For Home Group:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a508a88-d73b-46f6-a29a-795d8c17559c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a508a88-d73b-46f6-a29a-795d8c17559c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Below is the default HOME GROUP FOLDER FOR A USER and the folders shared. But you see above I do not share any Personal Folders or Media Devices. If I wanted to share anything personal, I would change settings above or put them in the Shared Public User
 folders. But these are the only folders, if shared, you can put items into "ONLY"&nbsp;these folders to share for HOME GROUP. You can also create new folders in your Library folder and select to share with Home Group and they will appear in folder below.</p>
<p>NOTICE: HOME GROUP\Tracy (Blacked Out)</p>
<p>You see 8 Sharing Folders "BY DEFAULT" Any other sharing would be in&nbsp;computer Network and Public Folders or individual Folders or Files you individually select to share.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/720dc0db-511c-42f0-8589-4d30fcfed2b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/720dc0db-511c-42f0-8589-4d30fcfed2b7" /></a></p>
<p>If you want&nbsp;your public folder to show in HomeGroup folder then go to C:\Users\Public (AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS SHARED ON YOUR NETWORK) RIGHT CLICK ON PUBLIC AND SELECT PROPERTIES. THEN SELECT THE SHARING TAB. THEN IN ADVANCED SHARING, CHECK THE BOX ON THE
 TOP "SHARE THIS FOLDER". CLICK APPLY&nbsp;and OK. Then above that, CLICK ON THE SHARE BUTTON. IN THAT BOX, TO LEFT OF "ADD" CLICK THE ARROW AND SELECT HOMEGROUP, AND SELECT TO READ AND WRITE. CLICK ON SHARE BUTTON ON BOTTOM AND THEN CLICK ON "CHANGE SETTINGS" ON
 THE BOTTOM. NOW YOU PROPERLY HAVE YOUR PUBLIC FOLDER IN YOUR HOMEGROUP FOLDER. (See Below). (Public folder is now there)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abef7c86-29fb-4522-b4e8-f16609e1e999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abef7c86-29fb-4522-b4e8-f16609e1e999" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now everything shared is accessed in Home Group folders with proper permissions and accessibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Then From Carol-PC you have a mess of Home Group shared files and Files&nbsp;from Carols-PC network public&nbsp; folder. You have one big mess and a total corrupt file system in Home Group and all those Folder Network Connection Icons shown in your photo except
 the "Blue Library Icons are accessible through The "Network Folder\Carol-PC Icon. There should be all Carol's Public network shared folders and those others - 1, 2, C, Books, Books_2, flp, My Documents and Pictures. Putting these in the Home Group Folders
 may cause corruption and access issues trying to access from HOME GROUP FOLDER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Here is a view of My PC - "NETWORK\SEAHAWKS" Here you see All Drives and Folders I share (Names are cut out in photo). You see the default folders USER and PUBLIC. I share a lot on my network, they go into Network&nbsp;SEAHAWKS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7aa61995-cbdb-4226-92ae-fc8bd80c8701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7aa61995-cbdb-4226-92ae-fc8bd80c8701" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Now you see below&nbsp;where to put any shared content in either your public folder or copy it to other computers public folder. This is where you share all Files and Folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f98057d-25b2-44bc-82a5-9113d4dd5cff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f98057d-25b2-44bc-82a5-9113d4dd5cff" /></a></p>
<p>NOTE: REMEMBER, Home Group shares your personal files from those default folders giving to you in HOME GROUP USER-FOLDER or any extra folders you create in your library and choose to share with Home Group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Here is one of the other PC's on my Home network STANS-PC. See the Default User and Public Access Icons. The User Icon would be to access all "Stans-PC "HomeGroup shared personal folders located in his HomeGroup Folder if he chose to share them.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1380516f-69d7-49b6-a15f-4915cb4a278b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1380516f-69d7-49b6-a15f-4915cb4a278b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Now the Public Folders:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8913f438-cb17-4ffa-a7f4-370844ea8e6a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8913f438-cb17-4ffa-a7f4-370844ea8e6a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:I have created shortcuts to each others computers and put them in public folders for quick access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Network Folder Shows all PC's on network and&nbsp;is also where you access shared media devices.
</p>
<p>Note: Because of the issues on Windows 10 not showing available computers in network folders, (See Below)&nbsp;which in my case, I get them all showing and fixed and then Windows Update F..ks them up again, I have just created new shortcuts (In the New Shortcut
 wizard enter&gt;&gt;\\ComputerName)&nbsp;to other computers and put them (Shortcut Icons) in shared folders and in quick access until Microsoft fixes this damn ridiculous ongoing issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eeabde75-5404-4e1f-8abb-222b37df406b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eeabde75-5404-4e1f-8abb-222b37df406b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I fixed this issue again. Computers are visible:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc42ede6-2545-4937-84b8-9caa8b2a1e00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dc42ede6-2545-4937-84b8-9caa8b2a1e00" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did all this to show you that your file system is a total disaster, probably corrupt on some and improper for sharing some of your content from Home Group Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I never use the Library Folders or the HomeGroup Folder for any sharing or for any reasons at all for that matter. It is all in Network folders for sharing. A perfect running Home network on all computers, which there is 5 when all connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also: Mapping network drives and creating remote desktop connections can cause you many bad issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Finally, to access The Home Group media device folders on another computer that is joined. Open up "This PC" and the shared personal files are located here as shown below. RED ARROW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note the files with RED CHECK MARKS in my pc folder are the same in my Home Group Folder that I can share my personal folders within the Home group if I choose to do so.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Search Feature Not Working Properly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been Googling a lot to try to fix this problem that I recently discovered, but nothing seems to be working. It started maybe a week ago, and I discovered it when I wanted to search for the calculator. I work a lot on my computer, and therefore I use
 the calculator a lot as well. I remember that all my desktop programs had been pushed to the left (I sort them into two categories, one on the left and one on the right). This may or may not be related to the issue I'm experiencing now. I also cannot access
 Settings through the Windows menu (including subcategories in Settings). I've tried these fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Look for corrupted system files (no corrupted files found)</li><li>Expand the indexing area (to include all folders)</li><li>Troubleshoot the search and indexing feature
<ul>
<li>It says: "invalid permissions on windows search directories", but when I try to change the owner to my admin user, nothing changes</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Reinstall Cortana</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone out there can help me! :O&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are my system specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home x64</p>
<p>Processor: Intel Core i7-2600K CPU @ 3.40GHz&nbsp;</p>
<p>RAM: 32 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Tried troubleshooting Windows Store, without it solving my problem.<br />

<p>Hi Petter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for following up. Just to verify, can you tell us when did this issue start to occur? Also, did you make any changes on the settings on your PC, or any other changes that could point us to the cause of the issue? Please advise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, we suggest checking if this is a case of a corrupted user profile. Try to create a new local account and see if you would still have the issue on that new account. Once you've tested it, please let us know the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best.</p>

    <title>Surface startup very slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zagadka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface startup very slow</h2>
                    <p>So I got my Surface Pro a month ago. It worked fine, probably until the April 1803 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when booting, after logging in, the Surface holds at a black screen for as much as 5 minutes. The mouse can move and ctrl-alt-del works, but otherwise it does not respond. Once it loads Windows, it works beautifully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried safe mode and startup repair. I'm afraid that I'll have to do a system reset, but I'd prefer to avoid that, and know what happened for future problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            Roll back.
<br />I have a surface pro 4 and i have the update paused for 60 days.
<br />It is best to wait at least 30 days when a new feature update comes up before using it.  That's my advice. 
<br />
<br />But you can try updating your graphic driver as well as see if turning fast startup helps.
<br />
<br />Turn off Fast Startup
<br />
<br />Right click your start button Click Power options 
<br />Click Additional power settings under Related settings 
<br />Click Choose what the power button does 
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable 
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended) 
<br />
<br />Click Save changes and reboot see if that helps.

<h2>            wireless driver - media disconnected problem - I think&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>For the last week I have not been able to get wireless access to my pc.&nbsp; I have intel centrino wireless adapter and this and the microsoft wifi direct virtual adapter keep showing 'media disconnected'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the intel driver - I initially lost the 'media disconnected' but still couldn't connect wirelessly but now I'm back to the 'media disconnected' message.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried various suggested solutions without success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially the troubleshooter gave 'missing protocol' message now it's given up and says it can't identify the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be very welcome and I'm getting very frustrated and have wasted a lot of hours trying to sort it.&nbsp; It's a pain having to use the ethernet cable all the time (that works fine).
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Alison</p>

<h3> sdghdhae  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dear Microsoft, I hate being Here-Let-Me-Google-That-For-You&#39;ed</h2>
                    <p>Just got Windows 10. &nbsp;I want to change the color of the taskbar. &nbsp;I still have not figured out how to do this, by the way, but along the way, this happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right-click on the taskbar and hit "Properties," then in the "Task Bar and Start Menus" dialog box, I see the helpful-looking "How do I customize taskbars?" link. &nbsp;I click on it and get this website:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.bing.com/search?q=How+do+I+get+help+in+Windows+10&amp;filters=guid:%22e92bbce1-ed70-4e9c-b66d-bb9387b479b7%22+lang:%22en-us%22&amp;form=S00028</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen, Microsoft, I know how to use a ****ing browser to search for things. &nbsp;Either take me to help on "How do I customize taskbars," or don't leave a little link that suggests that such help exists. &nbsp;Either way would be fine; either way would be so much
 better than what you are currently doing, which is basically just saying "Google this yourself, ****!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I wanted to send feedback that this was super annoying--the Microsoft website claims that you can't email Microsoft unless you sign in with a Microsoft account (which is obviously absurd), but then when you do, there is no apparent way to email tech
 support. &nbsp;Thanks, Billy G!</p>

            <p>I'm not from Microsoft, but I think I can help you with some of this.</p>
<p>For the feedback you can use: Start -&gt; All apps -&gt; Windows Feedback</p>
<p>You can search and see if anyone else has submitted the same feedback and vote it up, or add your own.</p>
<p>And I agree it is stupid to have links to search the web, something like this should take you directly to an answer, there is no telling what that query might pull up today, tomorrow, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the taskbar Settings is what you are looking for, but maybe it is probably not as flexible as you would like.</p>
<p>Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Colors</p>
<p>This is sort of an all or none thing, given that the settings control more than just taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the contacting of support, there are a couple of ways:</p>
<p>Start -&gt; Contact Support (in Windows 10 only)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log into your Microsoft Online account with your web browser and then select Support in the upper right.</p>
<p>And then Contact Answer Desk</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of these are email, they are chat systems, I don't see a way to send email, but it is certainly the best way to get in touch with a human I can find.</p>

<h3> tn792  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS_WebcheckMonitor&#58; explorer.exe - Application Error</h2>
                    <p>When it first started, my desktop icons would not show up and the mouse cursor would have the loading circle for a few seconds before flashing to a blue screen and then back to my desktop. It would keep flashing/switching from these two every few seconds
 and it was annoying. Luckily I was able to find a solution (on a separate computer) and open up my task manager to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea2fe6b2-370a-4864-b095-56c2a2d5a9f6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea2fe6b2-370a-4864-b095-56c2a2d5a9f6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning those two off managed to stop the screen from flashing/switching, and I was able to finally access my desktop. However, these two annoying pop-ups appeared a couple of seconds after.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b6c6cc5-51a6-4072-90e1-186aedcc9eba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b6c6cc5-51a6-4072-90e1-186aedcc9eba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were to click "OK", my screen would flash back to blue, then back to my desktop, and this pop-up would appear again. If I clicked "Cancel", this would appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f900e036-6fb9-48de-af2a-6c7653e60e23?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f900e036-6fb9-48de-af2a-6c7653e60e23?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking "OK" on this pop-up would make the screen flash blue again, then back to my desktop, only for the first pop-up to appear again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These pop-ups were not too bothersome at first as I would just move it to the bottom right of the screen where I would never see it, and I could access my computer as usual. It is now becoming a problem as now every time I turn off/restart my computer. My
 screen starts to flash/switch from my desktop to a blue screen again, forcing me to repeat the process above every time I turn on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my drivers, graphic cards, and have scanned for viruses. Everything seems to be updated and I have no viruses on my computer. I am hoping that it is not a hardware issue, and that maybe there can be a solution to this before I open up my PC.
 I would rather not spend money on repairs, or a new part(s), if this issue can be easily fixed.</p>

<h2>            Twitch - associer un nouveau compte au Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>

<p>A avoir streamé Sunset Overdrive un peu trop tôt et après trois avertissements de la part de twitch (ok c'est de ma faute), mon compte est suspendu ad vitam eternam. Seul problème c'est que sur Xbox One, la console considère toujours que c'est le compte
 banni de twitch qui doit diffuser. Donc forcément, c'est impossible de diffuser. J'ai droit en retour à un code erreur 0x30220005.&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ai beau desinstaller twitch, supprimer (partout) les données sauvegardées. Je ne peux rien faire. Pourtant j'ai réussi à associer mon nouveau compte twitch avec une console "concurrente" sans problème (console à l'origine liée au 1er compte). Il va sans
 dire que je ne peux évidemment pas me rendre sur le site de twitch pour modifier certaines infos sur mon 1er profil.</p>
<p>Je ne sais pas si c'est très clair mais mon intention c'est de retenter une synchro entre mon GT et ma nouvelle chaîne Twitch. Si qqun à la solution ou une idée je suis preneur !</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Slim Random Reboot Loop Solution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big guy maxi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim Random Reboot Loop Solution </h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys/girls</p>
<p>Was recently having an issue with my Xbox 360 slim 250 Gb rebooting randomly, sometimes within seconds of me turning it on, sometimes not at all, and everywhere in between. This was obviously getting very frustrating, so after a lot of searching, experimenting,
 trying power cords, cleaning the touch Xbox logo on the outside and the connecting pins on the inside etc, I realized it was the HDD. As I didn't want to fork over wads of cash to get one here in Australia, this is the solution I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had a 1 Tb Seagate external drive laying around, format it, transfer save files, profiles etc.
</li><li>Remove Xbox HDD drive (while off of course) </li><li>Find a 32 Gb usb stick, plug into to back. </li><li>Turn on, go to settings, storage and allocate unformated 32 Gb usb as the System drive.&nbsp;
</li><li>Sign into Xbox live </li><li>Download updates. </li><li>Problem solved and good to go. </li></ul>
<p>While you can play games without the system drive, you can't update the system, or use your Xbox live account at all, so I recommend setting up the system drive.</p>
<p>Sorry about the wall of text! &nbsp; </p>

<h2>            live mail times out frequently then downloads all mail again</h2>
                    windows 7 with Live Mail (LM)&nbsp;and POP3 server.&nbsp; Frequently downloads mail&nbsp;then times out because it&nbsp;hangs up on various other messages remaining on the server that LM won't or can't download.&nbsp; When I start live mail again it downloads the same messages
 over again and times out again.&nbsp; Yes, I can go to the server site and delete everything and LM&nbsp;will work ok for a short while.&nbsp;&nbsp;No pattern.&nbsp;I have shut off anti virus and firewall but&nbsp;LM still&nbsp;times out.&nbsp; I have set the server timeout to max but that is not
 the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I never had this problem with good old Outlook Express.&nbsp; No problem sending mail out.

            Best thing to do is switch to another email program.&nbsp; Microsoft tends to be way to pushy when it comes to security and functionality.&nbsp; We all need to send and receive attachments yet microsoft doesnt allow this to happen smoothly or as smoothly as other
 programs.&nbsp; Even when signing up the confirmation email ends up in the junk mail box why I donno I never banned emails from microsoft.&nbsp; Its just simply the way microsoft writes programs they never work very well and they are way to bothersome even when they
 change your homepage to about:securityrisk because you change a few security settings talk about being a pain in the butt.&nbsp; I cannot even use IE because of the popup bar at the bottom always trying to get you to change something or speed something up you can
 never stop this annoyance from happening UNTIL you switch to another company.&nbsp; It gets even worse when you HAVE to use windows 8.&nbsp; Your best bet is to switch to another company try mozilla.<br />

</p><p>This morning I keep getting a message that my Windows will expire soon. I didn't know that is possible, it was pre-installed when I purchased by laptop.

<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps, went to activation, it seems I must change my product key... must I buy a new licence now? Ugh?</p>

<p>Hi Brenda. 99% sure it's a scam to get you to hand over your bank account details. Ignore it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it was a scam also... it is a screen that came up when I switched on this morning.&nbsp; It prompts you to go to the settings screen. Even if I close it, it keeps popping up.&nbsp; If I hovver my mouse over it, the window name seems to be License UI.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Edge, Chrome and Explorer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing a full security scan now using Trend.</p>
<p>

<p>Please could you post a screen shot of the warning message?&nbsp; There are legitimate and non-legitimate reasons for this kind of message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick thought - have you approached the shop you purchased from to ensure they shipped it with the correct licence?&nbsp; I've heard of laptops being shipped with a corporate licence that is tied to the retailer under a volume licence where you should have
 either a OEM or retail licence if you are a single user of a device unrelated to the shop's business.</p>

<p>Hi Brenda. Martin might be right - I hope he is. Let's see what snip you posy here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile blocking pop-ups:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Edge</strong></span>:&nbsp; Click on the three horizontal dots (top right on my PC) &gt; Settings &gt; View Advanced Settings &gt; set Block Pop-Ups to ON. (Some other useful settings there too.)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Internet Explorer:</span> </strong>
click on IE Settings (gear icon, top right) &gt; Internet Options &gt; Privacy &gt; tick the box next to Turn on Pop-up Blocker.</p>
<p>
</p><div><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Chrome:</strong></span> Click on the three vertical dots (top right on my PC) &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced (at bottom) &gt; in Privacy &amp; Security menu, click on 'Protect you and your device from dangerous sites' &gt;
 Contents settings &gt; halfway down is Popups. Move the slider so it shows blocked.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Try these and tell us when they're all blocked.</p>
<p>(Similar settings are available in other browsers too of course.)</p>
<div>Hope this helps but there's no need to be stressed!</div>
<p>
</p><p>PS Go to Settings (gear icon when you press start/Windows icon bottom left &gt; System &gt; About. Halfway down Device specifications is Product ID - if 'OEM' appears at the end, you have an OEM PC. This means that the PC manufacturer usually but also the retailer
 in some countries are empowered by Microsoft to pre-install certain App before sale.</p>

<p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for your help! I really appreciate it.&nbsp; I called the shop I bought the laptop from this morning, and according to them the licences on laptops they sell are OEM licences.&nbsp; The guy I spoke to say to says there might be a line in the registry
 that needs to be changed/deleted.&nbsp; He wanted to help me do it,&nbsp;but this is&nbsp;waayyyy above my paygrade, so I am taking the laptop in to someone who knows about these things, and won't mess it up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did block all the pop ups in the browers, etc, but the message still came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a fantastic day</p>

<p>
</p><p>"Open with" &nbsp;is present and set up as you describe. &nbsp; It does not work! &nbsp;</p>
Upon using MS Win 10 following the upgrade, I was using the technique I used all the time when working with files. &nbsp;I right click on the file, click on &nbsp; "Open with" &nbsp; and select among the list of &nbsp;applications to open the file. &nbsp;I use &nbsp; "Open with" &nbsp; in this
 manner because I do not want to use the default application to open the file. &nbsp; There are times I want to open an .jpg file in &nbsp; "paint" &nbsp; or &nbsp;"photos" &nbsp;or &nbsp; "Windows Media Player" rather that the default. &nbsp;I used this technique ever since I up graded to WIN10.
 &nbsp;Now, not only are there no choices when employing &nbsp; &nbsp; "Open with" &nbsp;but "Open with" &nbsp; &nbsp;is grey and will not work.<br />
<br />
When right clicking on a file I want to use &nbsp;“Open with” &nbsp;to open the file. &nbsp;I cannot because &nbsp;“Open with” &nbsp;is grey and not responsive. &nbsp;I can right click on the file then click on &nbsp; “Properties” &nbsp; and in the &nbsp; “General” &nbsp; tab I can click on the &nbsp; “Change .
 . .” &nbsp; &nbsp; box to reveal a window to change the application to open files.<br />
<br />
There I can see a list of applications available on my computer including Photos, MS Office, ON1 Photo Raw, Paint, Adobe Acrobat Reader, Internet Explorer, MS Word, Notepad, Perfect Expert, Presentations, Quattro Pro, Windows Media Player, Word Pad, Word Perfect
 Lighting, Word Perfect all available to open files. &nbsp;At the bottom is a &nbsp; “Look for another app n this PC” &nbsp; &nbsp;choice.<br />
<br />
I want that list to open when I right click on a file and click on “Open with”<br />
<br />
How do I reset Win 10 to achieve this?<br />

            <p>Hi Gary, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your "Open with" button is working, what we can suggest is for you to check the Registry Editor on your computer. In this way if the said folder for Open with is not available or missing, we can re-create it for the issue to be resolved. To have it
 open, you can follow the instructions below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Right-click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span>,
 then&nbsp;select </span></span><span><span><strong>Run.</strong></span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Enter
</span></span><span><span><strong>regedit</strong></span></span><span><span>in the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><strong>Open:</strong></span></span><span><span>box
 and select </span></span><span><span><strong>OK.</strong></span></span></li><li>Once you press <strong>OK</strong>, a window will pop up. Click
<strong>Yes.</strong></li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b49a73e-1c3f-44d0-84d4-4dc2d5e4bdc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b49a73e-1c3f-44d0-84d4-4dc2d5e4bdc5" /></a></p>
<p>For you to find the Open with folder, kindly go to the following folder on the left side of the Registry Editor window: HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\*\shellex\ContextMenuHandlers. If the
<strong>Open With</strong> folder is missing on the ContextMenuHandlers key, right click the ContextMenuHandlers key and select New and click Key from the menu.
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6f398ac-eb17-4bc5-8021-b58ec09461f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6f398ac-eb17-4bc5-8021-b58ec09461f5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now lets create that new key on your computer by following the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Once you're done with creating a new key, type<strong> Open With</strong> as the name for it.</li><li>On the folder of <strong>Open With</strong>, there will be a Default value on the right pane. Double click to edit the value.
</li><li>Enter the following in the “Value data” edit box on the Edit String dialog box. We recommend you copy the following text and paste it into the box. {09799AFB-AD67-11d1-ABCD-00C04FC30936}</li><li>Click OK and close the Registry Editor by going to File and clicking Exit. </li></ol>
<p>The Open with option should be available once you are done with these steps. If not, kindly restart your computer and check if the said changes has been applied.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p />

<h2>            Cannon MP280 Printer &#38; Scanner Malfunction</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been having problems with my Printer&amp;Scanner. At first,it kept saying "error B500", and the lights were blinking with the letter&amp;number P07 on it..&nbsp;So I searched the web for possible results. I found one and tried it. The method was to hold the "reset"
 button while holding the "power" on button, then let go of the reset, then press the "reset"&nbsp;four times. I tried this and the printer reconfigured. But i tried to print but it would budge, so I powered it off from the machine.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when I tried to power it up again, it didnt turn on at all.. Please help me out with this problem.</p>

"Canon" - only one "n" in the middle.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
This seems to be fairly obviously NOT a Windows (of any version or edition) issue.&nbsp; All the problems and troubleshooting you have described have been on the device itself and would not have changed whether you had a computer or not connected or if that computer
 was Windows, OS X or *nix of some sort.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You'll want to contact "Canon" (this is why I pointed out the issue with the name you gave) for assistance with their device...<br />
<a href="http://www.canon.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.canon.com/support/</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
You might even try their forums:<br />
<a href="http://forums.usa.canon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.usa.canon.com/</a><br />

Hopefully they will be able to assist you.<br />

</p><p>With only one DMP file we cannot tell if it was hardware or the stress test itself.&nbsp; What stress test were you running and why were you running it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DMP file points to Genuine Intel so I suspect you were running Prime95 and testing the CPU. If that is the case and you want us to investigate there is a full memory DMP (big file) located in C:|WINDOWS called MEMORY.DMP.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disk cleanup</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> is
 used to delete the un-wanted and un-necessary temporary files located in your PC. However you can also use Disk cleanup to delete system files on the PC, which is not recommended as it might cause system performance issues on the PC.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When performing Disk Cleanup, checking the appropriate options is necessary so you do not delete the restore points present
