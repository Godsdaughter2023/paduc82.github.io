            <p>Hey I had this problem too. What you need to do is look into your parents account and find with a page that blocks inappropriate websites. For some reason Windows is automatically blocking a lot of browsers including Chrome and others like it all you need
 to do is simply unblock those web sites.</p>

<h2>            Help I can&#39;t get my Pre-Order bonuses for Destiny 2</h2>
                    <p>My main account doesn't allow purchases so I had to make an alternate account to do so. I Pre-Ordered the game overwhelmed with excitement seeing the Cold Heart and Kill Tracker Ghost. I loaded into Destiny 2 and played my way to The Farm and I immediately went to the vault to pick up the emote and veteran emblems, however the emote was not there. I haven't completed the story and gotten to level 20 yet but since the emote wasn't there I have a strong feeling I will not be able to get Cold Heart or the Kill Tracker Ghost. If someone could please help me that would be amazing, I don't want to start off Destiny 2 feeling disappointed and cheated :/</p>

            <p>Hi Sara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 periodically checks for updates so you don’t have to. When an update is available, it’s automatically downloaded and installed – keeping your PC up to date with the latest features.
<span>The amount of time it takes to download updates can depend on a number of factors, including connection speed, network settings, and the size of the update. Make sure your PC is plugged in and connected to the Internet in order to shorten the amount of
 time it takes to download updates.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><li>To check for updates now, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update,</strong> and select
<strong>Check for updates.</strong> If Windows Update says that your PC is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you have any further query. Thank you. </p>

    <title>Is there a way to disable the new &#34;floating&#34; app placement in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meredies.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to disable the new &#34;floating&#34; app placement in windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    Ah forgive me if i can't find the right words of how to ask this question- but i recently i updated to windows 8.1. I love windows 8 and got very used to how it works inside and out. I use all the features, unlike most people who grumble and complain and
 want it to be exactly like all the other windows and seek to turn off all the new metro features. When i upgraded, i do enjoy many of the new features that came with windows 8.1, but I am having one problem.<br />
<br />
The new app switching. Before, on windows 8 &nbsp;i got so used to going into the left corner and swiping down and clicking each app just once to open it. Now when i click these apps, it "Floats" them and makes me have to click again to place it. I have tried to
 get used to it- but it's difficult since i'm running windows 8 on my laptop for work (not allowed to upgrade it to 8.1) and i'm using my main computer at home with windows 8.1. I'm finding it hard to remind myself that on this computer, i need to double click
 each app as opposed to clicking it just once on my other. I know this feature is there for being able to have three apps on the screen at once. I love that feature and have been waiting for it for ages- BUT, why would they make you decide each time it pops
 up where it needs to be placed? Silly if you ask me. I only have the need for three to be on the screen occasionally, not every single time I open more than one app. Personally, I only have two apps on the screen most of the time, and then on special occasions,
 i'll have three.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My question is, is there anyway to turn this new feature off without actually disabling the app switching all together? I know you can just click in the upper left corner to shuffle through apps without the float popping up- but it's so close to the edge of
 the screen that I often find myself accidentally moving down just a tiny bit when I do, &nbsp;which of course then brings up the app panel instead of just switching to the next app in line. I even tried shuffling using shortcut keys and it still pops it up as a
 floating app first for placement. They only gave a easy shuffling method to those who have touch screen computers- while those who don't have to deal with this slight problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If there is no work around the next update should definitely come with an option to turn this off. It is incredibly annoying and it's driving me nuts. So much so that i almost wish i could roll back to windows 8 so I can just access my apps with a single click
 again.&nbsp;

            Do you have another app snapped when you do this? The only time I have apps float is when I have an app snapped and it wants you to choose what app to take over.<br />
<br />
Like so:<br />

            Yep, I do, sorry i didn't mention that, i always have two apps running as i said above. One is skype and the other larger area i use to swap between my art program/desktop area and chrome metro for browsing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was wondering if there was a way to disable that feature, considering before i could have two apps open and use one area to shuffle through apps with no float popping up.&nbsp;

You could also right-click the app in the switcher and choose where it'll go immediately.<br />

            Ahh that would do no good since this is more of a "time saving" thing so to speak i'm dealing with. Anyway, thanks, i'll go ahead and drop this in the suggestions for future updates and just hope they eventually give the option to turn it off. Kind of
 silly, it would even be solved if they would just place the shuffling option for the app somewhere else instead of so close to the App bar itself.&nbsp;

            You could also try using alt+tab to switch between apps. The app you choose will replace the currently active app, so that bypasses choosing what app you want to replace.<br />

            Ah i personally dislike the old way of switching through apps since it pops up that annoying box in the middle of my screen, but thanks for that suggestion - i think ill just try and force myself to get used to clicking in the left corner without accidentally
 doing the gesture to bring up the app panel.<br />
Thanks for reading!

<h2>            Transfer System Certificates</h2>
                    Im trying to transfer System Certificate to open encrypted files on my old hard drive to my current computer, and I cant seem to get it to work. Ive tried taking ownership of the files and folders themselves, but because they are encrypted I cant do anything.
 So then i tried to open Certificate manager and import the old ones onto the new computer but when i search for them they show up as system files and not proper System Certificate files. Idk if that matters but after i transfer it over it still wont allow
 me to open the encrypted files.&nbsp;

<p>You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

    <title>Forza horizon 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julieedwards4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza horizon 2</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please explain to me why the extra content is no longer available for Forza 2?</p>
<p>I only bought an Xbox a few months back and found out about the forza series. I purchased all four. I have almost finished 3 and 4. I purchased most of the extra content from both. I just started 2 and come to find out I can't purchase any of the extra content.
 I wanted Storm island and the treasure map to start. Why is it not available anymore? Seems unfair that I purchased the game and can't even enjoy all of the content. They should offer that content to new comers too. Is there any way to get it? A code to redeem
 or something?</p>

            Its because the licenses for the game &amp; dlc have expired and were not renewed, so both game and dlc were delisted and no longer available for purchase.

<p>Well that sucks. I would not have purchased forza 1 and 2 if I had known I couldn't get all the content.

<p>Seems kinda stupid. They could make more money from those of us that came to the series late. Any chance they will relist it in the future?</p>

<p>Bummer. Oh well, Guess I just play the game without it and sell it. </p>
<p>So, anyone know when the second expansion for forza 4 is coming? Any word yet?</p>
<p>I already paid for the ultimate add ons, so waiting for the second one. Finished fortune island the other day, and getting bored. Hopefully soon it will be out. I know they said the first half of 2019. Well, that time is getting close, so hopefully they
 won't take too long.</p>

            Sadly, Forza Horizon 2 and its DLC were delisted from the marketplace meaning all DLC and online services have been stopped. It sucks but I guess they didnt see the point of having 2 available still if 3 and 4 are out and newer.

<p>This is why I like the old CD games u buy at the stores. I have all most all the old and new game systems. These new systems suck for this reason😒 Some one thinks it's time to end the game and u owen a digital copy of that game u love but don't have it
 downloaded before the plug is pulled. U r **** out of luck. I have dame near $200 buck in FH#2 and now I can't ever play it again because I don't have a copy I can hold in my hand. I have games and systems older then me. My dads Comidor 64 and we still kick
 but on the Bruce Lee game. I was at work and had no clue they were killing FH2 plu they just gave it as a game for gold a little while ago. I have more games like this and this is what will happen to all the games we r buying now "NOT SUPPORTING THAT GAME".
 Well when I bought the game u never said this would happen. I don't remember paying $200 for this option. Buy online owen it for ever u just can't play it anymore. When will we the gamers have enough and come togeather to stop them from robbing us??? Thats
 what this is! If this was a car we bought and paid for the car, then a few years later they take it away but I hope u have pics and found memories of your car. Yours truly MadManRamblinOn&amp;PissedOff. Don't mind me I didn't eat my wheaties today.</p>

            That is the great Problem with DLC titles with no Discs. For Example the TellTale Games have the same Problems. Games on Discs are better in my opinion.

<h2>            Storport.sys is missing or corrupted</h2>
                    Last night I was running a Windows diagnostic tool, it said there were problems with my ram, I then later decided I would run chkdsk /r and leave that running overnight, this morning I woke up to see there was mean error with one if the drives and the
 scan had to stop, so I restarted my pc but it wouldn't boot up and it said storport.sys was missing or corrupted, it won't launch in safe mode and I don't see an option to go back to a restore point, what should I do?

            It likely tried to move system files and failed or damaged then.  You can try to repair them and again check dt6ive from media command prompt  by whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html
 
If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC.  http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install

 Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html

Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
 
In the Advanced Troubleshooting options open a Command Prompt

            Storport.sys errors are generated by your IDE ATA/ATAPI Controller, that driver needs updating

Start PC, just as the manufacturers logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down

Do this twice

On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.

Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
Open Device Manager
Expand the IDE ATA/ATAPI Controller section and uninstall the driver you see there
Reboot to see if Windows should start normally and replace that driver with the basic Microsoft one . . .

If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Adva

            Thankyou all for your replies however it would appear that storport.sys is missing or corrupted may have been caused due to me not noticing a windows update was scheduled at the same time i was running chkdsk and the problem has since fixed itself, however
 i do have a question, if windows diagnostic tool tells me there are hardware issues with my ram does that mean that the ram sticks may just fail soon and that i should replace them or that its just not working as efficiently as it used to?

<h2>            Console and Monitor settings for Sharp Aquos 60 120hz LCD HDMI&#64;1080i</h2>
                    
<p>okay guys here is a good setup for the aquos. been messin around for months to find a good one. so try this out.<br />
<br />
okay go to your console display settings.<br />
1080 i<br />
extended reference levels<br />
YbPcR color settings<br />
<br />
audio can be set to WMA pro.<br />
<br />
sharp aquos settings<br />
scrren size 100%</p>
<p>color temp: cool<br />
<br />
picture mode: user<br />
<br />
brightness 60</p>
<p>contrast 80</p>
<p>color 58</p>
<p>tint 0</p>
<p>sharpness 55</p>
<p>brightness 60</p>
<p>backlight &nbsp; high</p>
<p>advanced settings:</p>
<p>dynamic contrast &nbsp; on</p>
<p>film mode &nbsp; off &nbsp;( on can cause tearing in some games)</p>
<p>noise reduction &nbsp; &nbsp; medium &nbsp;(high makes far off images super blurry)</p>
<p>MPEG noise reduction &nbsp; &nbsp;off &nbsp;(in games this causes tearing)</p>
<p>120hz lvl &nbsp; &nbsp; medium &nbsp;(high can cause moar screen tearing lol)</p>
<p>audio: &nbsp;user<br />
<br />
bass -3</p>
<p>treble -3</p>
<p>surround mode &nbsp; &nbsp;off</p>
<p>auto volume leveling (AVL) &nbsp; &nbsp;(on)</p>
<p>the rest is up to you guys. try this out and let me know if you like it an if you can come up with something better let me know.&nbsp;<br />
in your games you may have to turn your brightness setting up to compensate for the extended reference levels which is 0/0 true black (normal= 7/7 &nbsp; &nbsp;intermediate 0/7 &nbsp;extended 0/0 )&nbsp;</p>
<p>i played skyrim with these settings and armor that did not shine and reflect light before looked beautiful and looked polished. forza horizon you can see your gauges during the day with a brightness adjustment. battlefield 3 will require a screen adjustment
 and brightness adjustment. i will post more recommendations as i get bored with these lol.&nbsp;<br />
happy gaming.</p>

<p>Set the Xbox 360 to 1080p (1080i is interlaced and an LCD is a progressive type of TV. 1080p is a progressive format), Standard reference Levels (Since you did not state your TV has a Black Level setting) and RGB (games are natively shown in this format.
 Set to YCbCr for watching Netflix, etc.). Also, turn OFF anything that is an "enhancement". This includes Dynamic Contrast , Noise Reduction, and 120hz motion compensation because these ADD LAG.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>For basic picture quality settings:</p>
<p>1. Set color temp to Normal which gives red and blue color a balance between each other (do NOT know why people want Warm and some TV's "look" balanced in Warm, &nbsp;but proper calibration leads to NORMAL being the correct color temperature).</p>
<p>2. Backlight on medium or lower (backlight is the MAIN power consuming component in a TV. If you're using a Full Contrast source like &nbsp;a PC or Xbox 360, high backlight is NOT needed and setting it lower will DRASTICALLY reduce power consumption and overall
 lifespan).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Finally, WMA Pro does not work unless your in Media Center and have one of the FEW Pioneer-brand receivers that can decode it. Best leave it on PCM (for 2 channel) or Dolby Digital 5.1(for 6 channel).</p>

</p><p>I can see the latest printer drivers Dell lists for <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/dell-720/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dell 720 Color Printer </a>is <span><strong>Windows Vista, 32-bit</strong>. It is clear that Manufacturer has not claimed nor released the compatible drivers for
</span><strong>Dell 720 Color Printer </strong>with Windows 10. Hence you've experienced this issue while working with the desired printer on Windows 10.</p>

As you are able to restore the task bar to it's original size when the task bar is maximized. I would suggest you to expand and minimize the taskbar again and check.

If the issue happens, let's check the functionality in different user account.<br />

            <p>Hi Silvia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In principal the pics you remove from your Pictures folder(s) should no longer be displayed by the Pictures tile on the Start screen. But it takes time (sometimes a long time)&nbsp;for the replication (sync. if you prefer) to actually happen. This means that
 you can still see the pictures in the tile&nbsp;nn minutes/hours after you removed them from your Pictures folder(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did experience this and was very patient but after a day or two the pics I removed from my Pictures folder were still displayed by the tile. I haven't spent time trying to figure out what the real probelm was and went away... I desinstalled the Pictures
 app and reinstalled it from the Store. This fixed the problem on my side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lz.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Assassin&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Creed Games. Present to Old Titles. &#40;Xbox 360 &#38;amp&#59; Xbox One&#41;.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Everyone.. I am wondering if many of you Xbox Players still likes Assassin's Creed Series... As it is my #1 Favorite Still after I starting to dislike it because of Assassin's Creed Unity Combat Mechanics (Example, You can't counter or More easily
 Kill Enemies =(. So yeah sadly..) How about I share our History of The Assassin's Creed. Major Titles to Side Titles.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Syndicate (Will Release on October/23/2015): As far I read and watch about this game. It says it will take place in 19th Century London. (Hey, Wasn't London where Haytham Kenway killed somebody in Assassin's Creed 3 and Wasn't Edward Kenway
 live there until his death?) And also there seems to be two Main Characters. The Male: Jacob Fyre and The Female: Evie Fyre.. In the recent trailer for Assassin's Creed Syndicate, It shows that Jacob used, Some sort of Shikiri Knife?, An Throwing Knife, A
 Revolver Firearm and used some Rope from his Assassin Gauntlet (The Rope thing reminds me of Just Cause 2 Lol.). This game seems to be interesting and cool.. I also hope this game goes back similar to Assassin's Creed 1 &amp; 2.. Which it has Counter Instant Kill.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China (Later India &amp; Russia.) (China Version Released in: April/21/2015): I still haven't played The China part Yet, It is a great game? And as far I seen, It is a 2.5 World.. And since I haven't played it, I don't think either
 way there will be counter kill but oh well.. In a 2.5 World probably won't make sense to have one I would say.. Anyway in the China Version, You play as Shao Jun in 1526 China. (Hey if I remember correctly, I think this is the Assassin who met Ezio Auditore
 da Firenze when Ezio was retired of The Assassin Order and close to his Death due of Old Age.) (Later in India, You play as: Arbaaz Mir and In Russia you play as: Nikolai Orelov.) (Hey wasn't Nikolai Orelov an Ancestor to Daniel Cross The Traitor of the Assassins
 and Member of The Templar Order until his death?).</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Unity (Released in November/11/2014): Now this game is Awesome and Disappointment in the same time. But first thing first, You play as Arno Victor Dorian during in French Revolution in Late 18th Century... Now back to Awesome, The Story
 Line and such is Interesting actually and looks rather cool the way the story unfolds. And Disappointment, Because I played it and I did not like it much, Enemies are more Powerful than you, You can't easily block incoming attacks (Or Worse Can't Counter Instant
 Kill =(...) and The Firearm is useful on Weaker Enemies but Highly Skilled Enemies will Ninja Type Dodge your Firearms Attacks and no way to kill them unless you are either skilled enough with the sword or Have Max or a lot of Healing Pills because these bastards
 will kill you if you are not careful.. This is why The Counter Instant Kill would be very useful in that Situation. Also The Eagle Vision is Useless of some sort.. It has a Timed Limit to use it until it disappears and got to wait for a cooldown.. Are you
 serious! This is the worse Feature I seen so far.. But The Best Feature I have yet to try myself is the Co-op Mode.. But still this game is Disappointment but I still haven't given up on the Assassin's Creed Series as it is still my #1 Favorite (#2 is The
 Halo Series and #3: Is Farcry 3 &amp; 4 (Single Player so far).)</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Rogue (Released in November/11/2014): In this game, you play as Shay Patrick Cormac who formerly was an Member of the Assassin Brotherhood and a member of The Templar Order who reached if I am correct, Master Templar.. The game takes place
 After Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag and sometime before Assassin's Creed 3 with the year: 1752 to1760.. Okay, As far I know the game plays similar to Assassin's Creed 4 Edward Kenway, So my guess is that in this game there is Counter Attack.. But I haven't
 played this game yet and I am dying to play it as soon as possible... But first of all, Is this game a great game?</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 3 Liberation HD (Released in January/14/2014.): In this game you play as a female Aveline de Grandpre during the end of the French and Indian War.. This game plays almost exactly like Assassins Creed 3.. And I still haven't finish the story
 mode.. Which I can't wait to do so, As the story is Interesting.. The only thing I dislike about this game is where when you use your original Assassin Robes or Uniform, You already have a Level 1 Wanted Level... Which makes Free Roam a stealth world.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag (Released in November/22/2013): In this game you play as Edward James Kenway during the Golden Age of Piracy in 18th Century.. Now this game I do have it for the Xbox One, Still dislike The Multiplayer except for it's Co-op
 mode which is Wolfpack.. Now for the Single Player, This Game is awesome!! I like the fact you can carry 4 Firearms and such.. Edward sure was a Fearsome Captain! and a great member of the Assassin Brotherhood.. And the ship combat is cool as well.. I thought
 it was going to be same as Assassin's Creed 3 Ship Combat which I kinda did not like...</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 3 (October/30/2012): In This game you play as Haytham E. Kenway and Ratonhnhake:ton (Connor Kenway) during the American Revolutionary War.. Partly you play as Haytham E. Kenway while The Majority you play as Connor Kenway.. This game was
 the first to changed it's playing style after the end of Assassin's Creed Revelations.. So far This game was great but Kinda did not like The Ship Combat as I would prefer to avoid doing them as much as possible.. And Story line was awesome and Interesting
 I got to agree and This game is the end of Desmond Miles Sadly.. I hope Ubisoft somehow will attempt to either show him appear in a different game or Come back as a playable Character in a different game because He was my most Favorite Assassin and I like
 The Modern Day the most when you played as him. Also this game was the start of the awesome, Wolfpack Gamemode in the Multiplayer Feature.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Revelations (Released in November/15/2011): In this game you play as the Older Age Ezio Auditore da Firenze as he searches for Answers to his questions.. In this game was also the last of old Gameplay Style ever since Assassin's Creed 1.
 This Game was great and I do miss playing this game sometimes.. But I get confused with the controller which are the inputs because Assassin's Creed 3 and Unity are completely different and needs to be memorize.. Also in this game you play as Altair who shared
 his Last Important Moments using some strange Artifact to record his Memories.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood (November/16/2010): In this game you play as Slightly Old Ezio Auditore da Firenze and takes place in Rome Renaissance.. Now this game was the first with those Awesome Executions Combo type after Striking the Enemy enough times...
 At first when this game was released, This game was awesome and Cool where you still play as Ezio during different time. Such as one mission takes you back to Florence where The Young Ezio needed help to buried his Brothers and Father who were killed by the
 Grandmaster Templar, Rodrigo Borgia. This game was also the start of The Multiplayer Feature where you play as a Templar Member.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 2 Discovery (Released in 17/November/2009): I don't have this game as it is for different system or Mobile Gaming System.. But as far I read and Heard of it. It takes place during the events of Assassin's Creed 2 as Young Ezio Audtiore da
 Firenze..</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 2 (November/17/2009): This was the start of The Icon Assassin named: Ezio Auditore da Firenze and takes his journey during his Young age to Slightly Old age (I would say around 30 - 45 Years Old?) And ever since it was a very popular video
 game.. Many players liked The New Assassin and during his vengeance in Italy.. Including the part where he got the Hidden Gun Cannon in one of his Assassin Gauntlets.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 1 Bloodlines (Released in November/17/2009):In this game you play as Altair Ibn-La'Ahad after the events of Assassin's Creed 1.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 1 Altair's Chronicles. (Released in February/5/2008?): In this game you play as Altair Ibn-La'Ahad and takes place before Assassin's Creed 1.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed 1 (November/14/2007) This is the Golden Day of The Assassin's Creed when it was first released.. I would say this game was a gold mine for Ubisoft since a lot of players like it and spread like a virus grabbing the game brand new when possible.
 In this game you play as The Legendary Assassin named: Altair Ibn-La'Ahad during The Third Crusade and This Game was the first to introduce Desmond Miles an 2012 Assassin..</p>
<p>Well that is all The Important Video Games of Assassin's Creed Series as far I can see.. Again,Which of these games do you like the best? Or you like them all? Or You stop playing them and why?</p>

<p>I like Assassin's Creed. Wouldn't exactly call myself a fan, though.</p>
<p>I've enjoyed AC2 the most because I felt, mechanically speaking, that this is what AC1 should've been from the start. I've played all of the games in the Ezio saga, getting different levels of enjoyment out of it but none trumping AC2 as top dog. AC3 was
 surprisingly enjoyable for me. The setting, further refined mechanics, and naval combat sold it. Didn't cared much for hunting, though.</p>
<p>AC4 was a total chore for me to beat. Which is ironic, since I loved naval combat in AC3. But I don't care for pirates. Unity...it's still on my XB1 hard drive, picking up virtual dust while I tend to more interesting games on my backlog. Will I pick up
 Syndicate? Perhaps when it's on sale. </p>

<p>I played them up to number 3, and found the 3rd one very annoying.</p>
<p>Even at the start of the game i keep failing, due to being seen, and having to restart missions so far back, i just gave up.</p>
<p>I downloaded the 4th one free the other month and haven`t even played it once yet.</p>

<p>Kanaye x? I can also see you like Perfect Dark. Me too.. I used to play Perfect Dark Zero and Arcade Perfect Dark Remastered.. Anyway.. As for me with all The Major Assassin's Creed Games (Expect Rogue and Syndicate because I haven't played them yet.) I
 personally like Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Single Player a lot.. Back then when released, I used to play the game more Than Assassin's Creed 1 &amp; 2, And more than Revelations. (In Revelations is fun but a little bit annoying with those Black Armor Soldiers,
 Which are tough to kill...). After I finish with Assassin's Creed Brotherhood completely back then.. I just had fun killing random guards just for the heck of it. lol.. Good Times. As for Assassin's Creed 3, I do also enjoy hunting down Animals and often sell
 them for Money and Including Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag... And as for Syndicate I agree with you.. I either might purchase the game soon after it releases or Later some time.. I am waiting to hear for players who did play the game in the future to let
 me know There is Counter Kill... I just hope so!</p>

<p>Theowenkiller? Yeah, In those old titles, Getting spotted will result a mission failure.. To be honest I haven't seen that too much in Assassin's Creed Unity. Very often I get spotted.. But I did read that in Co-op Heist Missions in Assassin's Creed Unity
 will count as mission Failure if spotted enough times... And did you tried looking at a guide video in Youtube for Assassin's Creed 3? Don't give up Assassin! lol</p>
<p>And as for Assassin's Creed 4 Black Flag (Xbox 360). I would say just try once to see if you like or dislike it, Unless you are an Achievement Hunter.. Which I got nothing against Achievement Hunters as I am Half Achievement Hunter.. Meaning I often spend
 playing games for Fun and ingnoring some achievements... But when I am ready, I do go after the achievements when I get enough time.</p>

<p>I don`t mind stealth games when if you get seen you get the chance to fight your way out or run, but instant failure when spotted and having to restart the mission, is really annoying.</p>
<p>My game backlog is too big to waste my time playing games like that.</p>

<p>I really wish they'd find a way to ditch the Animus and the "back to the present" sequences. Nothing worse than being snapped back to your "cushy" corporate job with Abstergo when you're trying to chase down some Spanish gold ;) AC4 is my favorite, because:
 PIRATES!!</p>

<p>The best of the series so far has to have been Revelations for me, Ezio as a character is the most enjoyable to date of the series.</p>
<p>The first games story was great, as in a twist that was unexpected. The step up in gameplay to AC2 was phenomenal - I just feel at the moment the story is lacking direction, and with them planning yearly games I'm beginning to suspect Unity (still to play)
 and the London one will be my last in the series (I may recognise locations for a change).</p>
<p>If you haven't yet played Rogue, but have played black flag - you can save yourself the time with Rogue. It's almost the same game from a slightly different perspective!</p>

<p>Hey Sean2383. I have a question. Did you come into the series with Revelations as your first AC game? I've noticed a tendency in myself and other gamers to favour the game in the franchise, with which they first experienced the franchise.</p>
<p>I don't get your last sentiment. Because it basically makes no sense. If you've read one book, don't bother with another, it's only made up of the same stretched tree pulp and whatnot.</p>
<p>My opinion of Unity and its combat system is... it's much improved. If you get into a fight with a five diamond [skilled - ranked] enemy, and you are a four or five diamond Assassin. You can win it. If you get into a fight with three of them, it's doable
 but harder. If you're surrounded by them... the answer isn't to ask for a button that wins. It's to drop a smoke bomb and fight or run.</p>
<p>You have the tools to survive. Don't shoot at the nimble guys, because they can roll before your flintlock fires. Just like you can. They can't defend against a barge attack though, they usua<span>l</span><span>ly fa<span>l</span><span>l over,&nbsp;</span></span>or
 see through smoke, a flashbang, nor are they immune to poison. Don't try and barge the big guys, because they'll push you off, and floor you. But they can only block so many heavy attacks.</p>
<p>The game makes a sound when you've defeated an enemy. It's like a ping sound. Don't finish that enemy if you are surrounded by enemies, because you'll get hit. Just concentrate on making that sound with every enemy and finishing the last one with a flurry.
 Keep an eye on the icons, if you see a crosshair filling up red, roll and put some guys between you and the guy firing. Or ro<span>l</span><span>l at the shooter, and hit him before he shoots.</span></p>
<p>I stopped playing the Assassin's Creed series for its combat ages ago. I just liked the exploration, stealth elements, and some of the story elements. If you failed in stealth getting into a fight was a question of one counter and then watch something cool
 happen. Watch it. You're not involved in it. It was usually over in seconds. It got so fast in later games the animation out-paced the sound effects. Now, in Unity, and I hope in Syndicate - if the OP's opinion isn't the only feedback Ubi is hearing - &nbsp;you
 have to time parries, use tools, and get out of dodge if you're overwhelmed.</p>
<p>It's not perfect though. You can attack a guy and the fates wi<span>l<span>l</span> just have you miss for no reason. There's a game c<span>lip I up<span>loaded of it happening to me. One of the skinny guys, in the top hat, I hit him, he stumb<span>les,
 and then Arno stabs forward, misses, and I keep going. The guy who shou<span>ld have been dead in the top hat, from the stab that inexp<span>licab<span>ly and random<span>ly missed -&nbsp;</span></span></span>ends up being the on<span>ly guy to hit me in the fight.
 So I get a bit annoyed and finish everyone on the ground. I usua<span>l</span><span>ly&nbsp;<span>leave 'em ro<span>l</span><span>ling but I was a bit mad I was. Aw-white?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>Stuff&nbsp;<span>like that happens infrequent<span>ly but it happens. The game has some infrequent NPC spazzing too, but no more than say, Red Dead Redemption. I'd be&nbsp;<span>lying if I said I didn't miss the human shie<span>ld abi<span>lity though, more because
 it was coo<span>l, than any rea<span>l need for it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>-- I have played the first few&nbsp;levels of Assassin's Creed: Chronicles: China:&nbsp;Numerous Franchise Names&nbsp;Edition: Age of Ultron: Attack of the Clones 5 Collectors' HD Directors Cut</p>
<p>It's basica<span>l</span><span>ly</span>&nbsp;the Prince of Persia of old with some really clever stealth and platforming features, and the Assassin's Creed mechanics 2D-ified, and the Creed paint job artfu<span>l</span><span>ly&nbsp;</span>s<span>lapped on. It's
 good. Ezio is in it but his voice isn't the same as from the main games. It's a&nbsp;<span>litt<span>le... or a
<span>l</span>ot... off. If you have a few quid handy, <span>like p<span>latformers,</span></span>&nbsp;and this is in a sa<span>le&nbsp;</span>I recommend this game. Me thinks.&nbsp;<span><br />

<p>It's never been the same since the first game for me, I mean 2, brotherhood and revelations did improve on the series, but for me the first game was so awesome because Altair was born into being an assassin, they lived by the creed and it was engrained into
 their entire culture.</p>
<p>Ezio stumbles upon his assassin heritage which is like cool, ok I can believe that, but then it seems like every other assassin after has done the same, only in a much more unbelievable way imo. The only reason Ezio is forgivable is because he truly became
 an assassin whereas Edward for example was just a vagabond doing things for money, a pure scoundrel not worthy or the robes.</p>

                    <p>I have a surface pro that had windows 8 on it, I installed 8.1 when I purchased it, I have had no issues with windows 8,1 but as soon as I installed windows 10 , fan is constantly running and I keep getting the message low memory , when my surface pro has
 enough memory on it, Please fix it, I would revert back to windows 8.1 but I waited to long to see if these issues got fixed.</p>

            Hi John, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />Updating to Windows 10 1803, the latest feature update should resolve your issue.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:

    <title>Lost My Promotional Balance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> headlessweezle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost My Promotional Balance</h2>
                    
<p>I lost my promotional balance due to the email being sent to the wrong email address. I have tried fixing this in the past and removing the wrong email address and putting mine in, and yet all my billing/promotional offers keep getting sent to the wrong
 email. The wrong email is my parents for when I was 15 and started my Live account, but once I was older we switched it over to me. Well for some reason the parents email address kept getting the emails even though my account profile had mine. So I had a good
 Promotional balance I wanted to use on renewing my live subscription but lost track of time due to buying a house and moving. And Microsoft sent the email saying my balance was expiring soon to the parents email and went to they're spam box. It expired the
 7th of April and my parents dont check the email very often and found it yesterday the 10th in the spam folder. I contacted customer service yesterday to try and get this all figured out, so they were able to change everything in my account to my most current
 information. They did see what I was talking about that I had changed my email address yet the parents email address was still there for some reason. They were unable to help me with this Promotional balance though and directed me to here. I was hoping that
 due to the mix up of the emails on the Microsoft end, I could use this Balance to renew my Live subscription? If I had the email sent to me, I would have gotten it back on March 8th and would not have had this problem as I would have used it then and not waited
 til now. I am not looking to extend the balance for 90 days or anything, I will use it today if I can get it. Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Gold can only be purchased via credit card/Paypal or by purchasing a prepaid gold card from a store. It is not possible to use currency from your Microsoft account balance to renew gold So even if the finds are reinstated, you would not be able to use them
 for gold.</p>
<p>Generally once funds are expired, yhere is no way to get them back, but you would have to contact support and again and speak to billing to see if there is anything they can do. No one on the forums would be able to do that.</p>

            By removing with msconfig all programs from startup and adding them one-by-one, I've found that the problematic application that loads on start is ClipX.
<div>I've discovered in ClipX that accidentally I've assigned Backspace to be a hotkey for Google Search. I've canceled that assignment and Backspace was freed! :)))</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hit ctrl+shift+escape to open Task Manager. On the Applications tab, click 'new task'. Type explorer.exe and click ok. Does this start the normal desktop for you?</p>

    <title>Can I reset Windows 10 without knowing the administrator&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anzzzi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I reset Windows 10 without knowing the administrator&#39;s password and can something go wrong when reseting&#63;</h2>
                    My friend can't download programs etc. because he doesn't know the administrator's password nor the name of the administrator account. It seems like the best option would be to reset Windows 10, because we don't know a lot about computers. Is it possible
 to reset Windows 10 without knowing administrator's password? Will it allow us then to log in as an administrator? Can something go wrong while reseting? Also, if you have a better idea for solving this password problem, feel free to share.

            Hey there Anzzi! You need to click restart and press F4/F5/F6 to Enable Safe Mode, then you will be able to enter Windows 10 safe mode with default administrator. Step 3: Run command prompt as administrator, or open Computer Management, Control Panel. Then reset Windows 10 local admin password with command in computer management or in PC settings.
<br />
<br />This should fix your issues! :)

<p>
</p><p>You might have the same issue after the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to to an Out of Box restore to factory out of box state and then you set it up as if you just bought it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it came with Windows 7 or 8 and you upgraded, then you will have to restore to out of box state for 7 or 8 and then upgrade to 10 again.</p>

            Windows 10 safe mode should log you in as a default admin. At that point running cmd as an admin shouldnt need a password.

 and behold you give us lame and obsolete titles. How about seeing as most of us have the games you just give us the credit in our accounts to purchase games we don't have. It sickens me that you are so cheap in rewarding your paying subscription customers
 even on a temporary reward bonus for the run up of your new console especially when ps has been giving away aaa titles all year to its paying subscription customers, at least next month give us sum thing we actually might play to h

<p>Yeah I have to agree with the OP here, sorry. &nbsp;Obviously Microsoft is competing with Sony with the G4G promotion, but it is no where as good as PSN. &nbsp;The games are seriously outdated by as much as 7-8 years in some cases. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong it is nice that
 they are giving something to us for free but looking at the quality compared to the games being given away on PSN is just nauseating.

<h2>            Would i get the VIP Pass for F1 2012&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone</p>

<p>i was wondering if i bought F1 2012 from Xbox.com, would i get the VIP pass that comes with the game, if i bought it brand new from a retail store? Or would i have to buy that seperately for 800 Microsoft points?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Sorry Daft if I'm wrong, but here's where I got my answer from. Apologies if I'm not allowed to link to outside websites, or if I'm still mistaken.

<p>Looks like that's an exception.Normally online passes are not included with GoD.</p>
