<h2>            Secondary  monitor fails after Windows updates KB4462930 KB4480056 KB4480979</h2>
                    <p>Inspiron 3847 PC, primary&nbsp; monitor attached to HDMI&nbsp; port and has no&nbsp; problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell SE198WFP secondary display attached to VGA port stopped working properly&nbsp; after&nbsp; Windows10 update installed KB4462930 KB4480056 KB4480979. Worked for&nbsp; a few seconds after&nbsp; turned off/on. Sometimes works correctly whole day.&nbsp; Looks&nbsp; like detach+wait+attach
 makes it&nbsp; stable for&nbsp; a while. Still, Settings/Display/ Identify == works , but&nbsp; "Detect" -&nbsp; "Did not&nbsp; detect&nbsp; another&nbsp; display."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled&nbsp; device with&nbsp; "delete&nbsp; driver", disconnect monitor and rebooted. Reconnected monitor after boot, and it&nbsp; was working fine&nbsp; for&nbsp; the rest&nbsp; of&nbsp; the&nbsp; day. It is listed now as generic PnP device, the&nbsp; same as primary&nbsp; monitor. Message "Did not&nbsp;
 detect&nbsp; another&nbsp; display." is&nbsp; still&nbsp; there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp; reboot overnight the problem&nbsp; returned. I deleted device again and rebooted. So far it&nbsp; works&nbsp; and even survived control reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What&nbsp; is the explanation for such&nbsp; unusual&nbsp; behavior and&nbsp; what&nbsp; is&nbsp; the proper solution?</p>

            Hello, ikovalev my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor. Today I will be helping you with your issue. I will be inserting some steps down below that will hopefully help solve your issue.
<br />
<br />
1: Step 1 Register DLL files. <br />
<br />
================= <br />
<br />
By trying this step, we can check if the update engines are working properly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Close all instances of Internet Explorer. <br />
<br />
2. Click Start and Run, type "Regsvr32 atl.dll" (without quotes) in the Open box and click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: There is a space between regsvr32 and atl.dll <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Similarly, one by one, register the files listed below: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regsvr32 msxml3.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wuapi.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wuaueng.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wuaueng1.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wups2.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wucltui.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wups.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 wuweb.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 qmgr.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 qmgrprxy.dll <br />
<br />
Regsvr32 jscript.dll <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: If you encounter errors while registering any of these files then skip that file and continue with the next one.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, let's move on to the steps below to verify Windows Update services and temporary folders.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 2 Verify the relevant Windows Update services. <br />
<br />
========================================= <br />
<br />
1. Click Start-&gt;Run, type "services.msc" (without quotation marks) in the open box and click OK.
<br />
<br />
2. Double click the service "Automatic Updates". <br />
<br />
3. Click on the Log On tab, please ensure the option "Local System account" is selected and the option "Allow service to interact with desktop" is unchecked.
<br />
<br />
4. Check if this service has been enabled on the listed Hardware Profile. If not, please click the Enable button to enable it.
<br />
<br />
5. Click on the tab "General "; make sure the "Startup Type" is "Automatic" or "Manual". Then please click the button "Stop" under "Service Status" to stop the service.
<br />
<br />
6. Then please click the button "Start" under "Service Status" to start the service.
<br />
<br />
7. Please repeat the above steps with the other services: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Background Intelligent Transfer Service <br />
<br />
Event Log <br />
<br />
Remote Procedure Call (RPC) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Event log service is enabled on all of the hardware profiles; this service does not have an option to enable or disable on certain hardware profile.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it still does not help, let's proceed to step 3. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 3 Reload the Update temporary folders. <br />
<br />
<br />
One possible cause is that the temporary folder for Windows Update is containing corrupted files. Let's erase all the files there to get the system clean.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, Run, type: cmd and press Enter. Please run the following command in the opened window.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Net stop WuAuServ <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Click Start, Run, type: %windir% and press Enter. <br />
<br />
3. In the opened folder, rename the folder SoftwareDistribution to Sdold. <br />
<br />
4. Click Start, Run, type: cmd and press Enter. Please run the following command in the opened window.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this helped solve your issue if not please contact us again. <br />
Best Regards- Irisdiel. H

            Unfortunately, this solution did not&nbsp; work and situation become&nbsp; even worse.&nbsp; Previous method of disabling device and reattaching does not work anymore. Second monitor was coming up&nbsp; if I did "Restart" of&nbsp; PC, but&nbsp; did not&nbsp; survive hard&nbsp; reboot with power
 down. I could not&nbsp; bring it up anymore. Please advise.<br />

<p>Unfortunately it happens in other games in weird places like the start up of Peggle 2, annoyingly I've had my Xbox changed once already because of this and this one is the same. I'm thinking it might be software related and hopefully be patched :-/ I will
 record a clip of the Peggie one as well.</p>

Mister Quimby is asking for a few things, and I think your video and information will be quite beneficial to him. Head on over and and check out his post a bit lower on the page! :)</p>

<p>Thanks Miss Quinzel, also FYI its not through the headset the static noise comes through the tv sound and external speakers as well (both tried). It is intermittent on some games but most common on the games ive posted vids on.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Quickbooks has stopped working&#34; error, happens upon restoring a company file</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a new Windows 7 professional 32 bit system.&nbsp; I have Quickbooks 2008, 2009 and 2010 installed on it.&nbsp; They all worked fine until I had to restore a company file from a backup (this is how I do my client's work), I then got the message in 2010 "Quckbooks
 has stopped working, a problem caused the program to stop working correctly, windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available"</p>
<p>I called Quickbooks tech support and they told me it's a "user account" problem.&nbsp; They had me set up a new user and new file folder to hold my company files.&nbsp; This worked, but it's a hassle.&nbsp; So now I had to restore a file to my QB 2008 and the same thing
 has happened.&nbsp; I can't create new user accounts each time I restore a file.&nbsp; (I have since had to restore to the QB2010 on the new user account, and the same thing has happened again)</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do with windows 7 to fix this problem?&nbsp; I'm unable to work at this point and I'm not sure what to do next.&nbsp; I appreciate any help you can give me.</p>

<p>Can you get any clues from a recent Quicken post which had a similar error message that was being caused by .Net Framework?&nbsp; I realize they are different program but it may be worth a glance.</p>
<p>I am unable to open my Quicken 2010 Deluxe. I receive this message: "Quicken Launcher has stopped working" __<br />

<p>Have you looked at the various Security Access Permissions of the files you are writing to?&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, if your user is an Administrator, and even though access permissions say that Administrators have "Full Control" it will not allow you access to the

<h2>            &#39;Something went wrong, please try again later&#39; - Windows 10 update.</h2>
                    The download for me starts and gets to around 30% before it stops moving and says 'preparing for installation...' I then go onto the 'Get Windows 10' button and it says that my upgrade is available with a button saying 'OK, lets continue'. After I press
 this a message comes up saying that something went wrong and that I should try again later. I tried it again with my firewall turned off to see if that was preventing the update, but no result. Any help would be much appreciated, I have been trying to get
 Windows 10 for about a week now and have run into so many issues.&nbsp;

    <title>SM bus controller drivers and PCI drivers unable to install on windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonymason3  say:</h3>
<h2>            SM bus controller drivers and PCI drivers unable to install on windows 10</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, this may have been asked before. <br />
I have just built a new pc build with many many problems. However my latest saga is the trouble with the drivers for SM bus controller and PCI/ PCI acquisition and signal processing controller.
<br />
Bit of a disclaimer. I am using a gigabyte Z390 Aorus Elite mobo. I have downloaded every .exe file from the chipset menu on the gigabyte support website.However running these, the device menu still gives me this error.<br />
"Windows could not find drivers for this device"<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? I've spent ages trying to figure out the issue but every website refers me back to the gigabyte support website to download from the chipset drivers.
<br />
<br />
Many thanks if someone can think of something different

What is the version of Windows 10 installed on the computer? To check please refer to the link:

<p>
Does the device manager show any error code for SM Bus Controller?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>This issue might occur if the chipset drivers are not installed properly or the driver package is corrupted or does not have the drivers for the device, reinstalling the chipset drivers might fix
 the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest to download and install the Intel chipset utility from
<strong>Intel</strong> download site along with the SM Bus controller PCI drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Installing or updating chipset drivers may result in an unexpected system behavior, I would recommend to contact the motherboard manufacturer to get the chipset drivers installed/updated.</span></p>

            The reason for the backup being larger than the source, in my case anyway, is that by default Windows Backup makes a backup of "Files in libraries and personal folders for all users" and it also makes a complete system image -- so my user data is being
 backed up twice.

<h2>            File History Service is not accessible</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on a desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using File History to back up my data. Luckily today I checked the report and saw that no backups have been done since the 19th November. It is set to do backups every hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected 'Run Now' to force a backup and got the message 'File History Service is not accessible'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the external hard drive which holds the backups and it is up and running and I can view data on it using File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this message means nor what to do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

                    Does any one know what contributes to PFN_LIST_CORRUPT errors (blue screen) and how to resolve them? The other error that keeps occurring is IRQL_NOT_LESS THAN_OR EQUAL.

Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition.<br />
Most times it will&nbsp;crash and it will tell you what the driver is, but sometimes it will crash and won't tell you the driver.</div>
<div>Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<strong><br />
Here is the procedure:</strong><br />
Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Start</b><span>&nbsp;</span>and type in "<b>verifier</b>" (without the quotes) and press<span>&nbsp;</span><b>Enter</b><br />
Select "<b>Create</b><span>&nbsp;</span>custom settings (for code developers)" and click "<b>Next</b>"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
Select everything<span>&nbsp;</span><b>EXCEPT FOR</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Low Resource Simulation"&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>For Win 8 dont check</b><span>&nbsp;</span>Concurrency stress test, and DDI compliance checking click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
Then select all drivers<span>&nbsp;</span><b>NOT</b><span>&nbsp;</span>provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
<b>Select</b><span>&nbsp;</span>"Finish" on the next page.<br />
<b><br />
Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.</b><br />
<b>Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least 36 hours of continuous operation.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b>If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.</div>

                    <p>I have Incredimail 2 and have been using the emoticons on my emails. When I tried to use them they weren't moving or showing action. The flash has been updated and then this week I tried again and the emoticons aren't even showing on the emoticon center

<p>Wanted to thank you for the info. I used the one that went to Internet explorer in the options tab and made sure the play animations and play sounds in web pages and it worked. Everytime there is an update something always happens. I appreciate your help.
 I don't follow forums very well. This was greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3> raptor226  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse pointer &#39;None&#39; scheme not working</h2>
                    I prefer the 'None' pointer scheme, but after the latest version update I can't reset it<br />
The scheme looks like this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9d985bc-3067-41b3-849c-f2984f277632?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9d985bc-3067-41b3-849c-f2984f277632?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Hitting 'Apply' doesn't actually change it. My mouse is stuck with the Windows default scheme. Any other scheme like Inverse or Magnified works just fine, which has me more confused than anything else.<br />
Has anyone else had this issue? Is this scheme no longer functional? Please help

</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Driver incompatibility is one of the possible reasons why you're having issues with your mouse. Having said that, we recommend performing the methods below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Uninstall the mouse drivers from device manager.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> in the run option and click

</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If Method 1 doesn’t resolve the issue, you can install the latest mouse drivers from the manufacturer’s website for the mouse pointer to function.

    <title>Windows 10 Creators Update slow boot - Prefetch stopped working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richb10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators Update slow boot - Prefetch stopped working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 desktop computers (same make/model, bought on the same order), which I've recently updated from Windows 10 Anniversary Edition to the Creators Update. PC1 is primarily a non-gaming PC, PC2 is only used for playing high-end games. Boot-up times for
 both since the update have drastically increased. I also have a laptop that displays the same slow-boot behaviour, only since I updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC1, before the update the time taken from turning on the computer until I see the Windows login screen was 10 seconds - I measured this. After the update, the time taken is about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC2, before the update the time taken from turning on the computer until I see the Windows login screen was about 1 minute. After the update, the time taken is also about 3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run a defragment on both computers after the update so that there are no fragmented system files (including the registry and MFT etc). This has not affected the bootup time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With PC2, I also have had a problem for a while whereby the hard disk will be at 100% for about 10 minutes after the desktop has loaded. This led me to look into Prefetch and Superfetch, as I thought that maybe it's trying to preload Skyrim files into memory
 before I start to play, which would explain the excess disk activity. Both machines are i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM, page file disabled. I never changed any of the prefetch/superfetch options, I just researched into why I have massive hard disk activity. (After about
 10 minutes, it goes from 100% to 0% and then behaves like a normal system)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which leads me back to the long boot times after the Creators Update. I installed Auslogics DIsk Defreg Pro, because this defragmenter will use the Prefetch files to optimally lay out files on the disk. It gave me an error saying Prefetch was disabled -
 I got this error on both PCs - and found the solution of this was to look in the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management\PrefetchParameters\EnablePrefetcher) and check the file C:\Windows\Prefetch\layout.ini</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the interesting part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both registries, both Superfetch and Prefetch have a value of 3 (which <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms940847(v=winembedded.5).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN</a> says it means enabled for Apps and bootup). In&nbsp;C:\Windows\Prefetch\ , there is no layout.ini file...<em>and the timestamps of all the files in&nbsp;C:\Windows\Prefetch\ were immediately before I did the update on each computer</em>.
<strong>The Prefetch files have not been updated since I upgraded to Windows 10 Creators Update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC2, the files are all timestamped as 30 April between 11:00 and 11:23, right before I ran the update. They all still have this timestamp today (8th May) and the computer has been turned on, used for a couple of hours and turned off on each day in between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On PC1, I see exactly the same behaviour (except the files are timestamped 2nd May).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe Prefetch has been disabled, or isn't working, in the Creators Update. The registry still shows the value of 3 - so the systems are configured to use Prefetch - but the Prefetch files have not changed, no new ones have been created,
 the layout.ini file is missing, and boot times have slowed from 10 seconds to 3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm not the only person reporting slow boot-up times after installing the Creators Update - is this the reason why?</p>

<p>I think Windows only loads the data in .pf (prefetch)&nbsp;files when you launch the associated application and does not load them at boot (maybe unless the program is on startup). Prefetch&nbsp;works as a sort of cache, that is&nbsp;when you open an application, Windows
 checks the Prefetch folder, looks at the application’s .pf file (if it exists), and uses that as a guide to start preloading data that the application will use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three minutes is awfully long boot time though, have you tried performing a clean boot? Use
<em><strong>msconfig </strong></em>to disable non-Microsoft services and startup programs. A startup program or service can be one of the offenders (for example, I think Chrome also prefetches data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try also if you can reproduce the issue when starting in Safe mode. But yeah, the usual suspects for this issue are the Windows Search, Prefetch, Storage Spaces&nbsp;and BITS services.</p>

<p>Prefetch is set by default to "application and boot", so I am expecting it to prefetch at boot-time. And it used to, because until a couple of weeks ago I used to turn on my computers and get the Windows 10 login screen after about 10 seconds. I've been
 using Windows for 20 years so I'm familiar with the boot process and how long things take, and how to speed it up, and have been incredibly impressed with Windows 10 consistently fast boot time. Until the Creators Update is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't changed any of my setup since the Update which would cause it - I haven't installed any new software or done any software reconfigurations. If I go to Task Manager and look at the Startup tab, almost everything is already Disabled.</p>

<p>The problem for me was booting to the lock screen was normal, but I wasn't able to click to the log in prompt for several minutes. After a few days I figured out that clicking on the wifi icon in the bottom right corner of the screen brought up the login
 prompt immediately, while clicking on other areas of the screen required a wait of one to five minutes. Click click click click click etc. Odd.

<p>I've discovered some more on one of the desktop computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's date is 22 July 2017. The files in the Prefetch folder (27 files) were all still dated 30 April 2017, the date when I upgraded from Windows 10 Anniversary to the Creators update, all except one called "ResPriHMStaticDb.ebd" which had a date from
 a few days ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was looking at the Windows services (services.msc from the Run command), I found Superfetch was set to "Automatic" start, but that it was not running. When I clicked "Start", I got error 50. There was nothing in the Windows event log, when I look
 under the operational log for Superfetch (0 log entries).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I deleted the entire contents of the Prefetch folder, and this time the service started successfully. When I tried to open the Prefetch folder again, I got a UAC message saying I didn't have access, so I clicked to grant myself access (I'm logged on
 as Administrator), and I now have 82 files in here, all dated from the last few minutes. After a reboot and loading some more software, the number of files keeps increasing, which is good. So, it seems that something happened with the Creators upgrade to do
 with the folder permissions on&nbsp;%SystemRoot%\Prefetch which stopped Superfetch from working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this PC, I used a stopwatch tonight and it takes exactly 90 seconds from startup to get to the login screen, and exactly 150 seconds from startup to get to the Desktop. Getting Superfetch to work again hasn't changed my startup time yet (in the registry,
 both Prefetch and Superfetch are set to 3, enabled for both boot and applications), but I've only done one shutdown/startup cycle so far, so it might improve over time. Not sure if I'll ever get back to the 10 seconds it used to take to get to the login screen,
 not even if I do a full clean format and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info, disabling Windows Search form the Windows services (as I don't use it) and a number of other services that I don't use had zero impact on the startup times, although the hard disk activity shortly after the Desktop has loaded is significantly decreased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also experimented turning Fast Start-up on and off and on again, although it still took 90 seconds from shutdown to reach the login screen whether or not Fast Start-up was enabled from the Power settings (it was actually 88 seconds when Fast Start-up was
 disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add more info when I try the other desktop PC, and also in the future for the desktop PC I was working on tonight, if performance improves.</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Before I started this evening, it was 24 seconds from starting up to the login screen, and 69s from&nbsp;starting up&nbsp;to the Desktop. There were 32 items in the Prefetch folder, all dated 2 May 2017, except
 the same file as noted before, which was last modified a few days ago, and also the single file in the Prefetch\ReadyBoot folder, also last updated a couple of days ago.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I followed the same process as on my desktop PC.&nbsp;After deleting the Prefetch files, I still got error 50 when starting the Superfetch service, so I rebooted to see if that would fix it - it didn't. The&nbsp;Prefetch
 folder was still empty.</span></p>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I tried to think if there was anything else I did on the desktop PC which I hadn't noted...and yes, I had enabled the pagefile. The desktop PC has 16GB of RAM so I had disabled the pagefile long back. I enabled it this evening as
 part of reading some other fixes for slow boots. As soon as a pagefile was configured on the laptop, I was able to successfully start the Superfetch service. I already had the empty Prefetch folder open on my screen, and as soon as I started the Superfetch
 service, I pressed F5 to refresh the Prefetch folder and up popped the UAC box. Clicking Okay then let me into the folder, which was starting to populate.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>So it seems that in the Windows 10 Creators update, you need to have a pagefile configured for Superfetch to work.</strong></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">New times with Superfetch working:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Getting Superfetch working again has sped the times up a little. I do love how my laptop boots up from cold to the Windows 10 login screen in 18 seconds. My desktop PCs used to enjoy a similar time.</p>

<p>Prefetch and superfetch are performed by sysmain service, along with memory compression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that disabling the page file, disables also the memory compression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Investigating this issue, i noticed that the sysmain service did not start. Trying to manually start it, results only in it immediately exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So disabled pagefile imply also memory compression, prefetch and superfetch disabled and also whichever other feature implemented by sysmain service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to enable the pagefile and reboot (if i remember well if you don't reboot, sysmain service won't still start, probabily because of some flag in the kernel set at boot time) and see if sysmain service is started.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Glad to be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't get response from MS because i didn't ask. This is one of the first time that i use this forum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually i search with google and find tons of forums posts, often on stackoverflow, but also here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this particular case that was not necessary, because i was experimenting with pagefile, prefetch, superfetch and memory, fiddling also with the registry settings (i am an optimizer maniac, given also the low ram of my configuration) and noticed this strange
 behaviour...</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, memory compression is awesome and alone justify, for me, windows 10 upgrade. With only 3GB my old laptop almost never runs out of memory... I have trimmed unnecessary services, but also in default configuration the used memory was low: the unused
 services usually are stopped or swapped out... This is improving with time: it seems that with every version the services are becoming more clever and stop itself if not used. But in any case, sleeping processes or services see their memory compressed or swapped
 out, with a ratio of at least 3:1, with less use of the swap file, and better use of the hard disk space and bandwidth, because the swap file contains always compressed pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So an hint to who would like to disable compressed memory: don't do it. It's very useful.</p>

 the updates online as issues/corruption may occur when downloading an update.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion.<br />
Unfortunately I tried to type&nbsp;<span>/remotelogout and then sign out and quit from this computer but still I did not appear as offline.<br />
The update to the last version also did not seem to solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Anything else I could try?<br />
Thank you!</span></p>

<h2>            DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE &#40;0x0000009f&#41; Crash in Sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
I have recently experienced an issue where my desktop crashes and restarts just as it enters sleep (occurring maybe 30% of the time). Debugging shows that this is as a result of a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (bugcheckcode: 0x0000009f). Reading elsewhere suggests
 this happens due to a particular driver, so I tried updating my Nvidia, Intel wireless, and chipset drivers to no avail.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, bluescreenview and WhoCrashed only report the kernel task ntoskrnl.exe as the culprit so it has been hard to pinpoint what exactly is causing the problem.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate any advice on resolving this.<br />

<p>The crashes are caused by&nbsp;Intel® Wireless WiFi Link Driver.</p>
<p>Completely remove the current driver and install the newest version of the driver available.</p>

            Unfortunately, the issue seems to persist even after a fresh reinstall of the Intel Wireless drivers. Is it possible there is a hardware issue with the wifi card?

<p>The driver has the same timestamp, so I assume you installed the same version as was installed before.</p>
<p>Try Installing a previous version of the driver-Pretty sure you would find them on Intel's website.</p>

<p>So far, I have tried the older drivers provided by the card manufacturer (Asus) and the latest drivers from Intel. Currently on the latest version (18.33.11.2 with timestamp 10/31/2017), not sure if this is the one you see in the dumps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wireless adapter is a PCI-E card, specifically the ASUS PCE-AC55BT which uses Intel Dual Band Wireless - AC 7260.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service will not stay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pookie21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service will not stay activated&#59; Homegroup issue</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have a home network setup here, with 4 computers. &nbsp;2 desktops, and 1 laptop, and a netbook; all of which are running Win7 Pro, save the laptop which is running Win7 Ultimate. &nbsp;Its my laptop i'm having issues with.</p>
<p>I've been having sharing issues with this computer ever since i got Win7. &nbsp;It's an old Acer Travelmate 4200 with 2GB RAM, 1.66 Ghz duel core processor(i think). &nbsp;Its been through ____ and back many times, it takes a heavy beating. &nbsp;Very well used. &nbsp;Lord
 only knows the beating this thing has taken over the years, but it still running like a true blue champ, and it works brilliantly with Win7. &nbsp;Save a couple things:</p>
<p>1)Homegroup sharing doesn't work.</p>
<p>I set up a homegroup on the main desktop computer. I chose that one because it's always on. &nbsp;After setup, i went to all the other computers and did the same. &nbsp;Everything worked without a hitch, except the laptop. &nbsp;When i go to try and join a Homegroup, it
 says "There are no Homegroups available on this network" &nbsp;and only gives me the 'Create a Homegroup' option below. &nbsp;I have tried every trick in the book: TCiPv6(or whatever) is enabled, Homegroup services are activated and running, Homegroup services are not
 being blocked by the firewall, I <strong>AM </strong>part of the same workgroup as all the other computers on the network, all computers' main accounts are running as Administrators... etc. &nbsp;I can see all the computers on the network in the network list, but
 I cannot connect to my Homegroup. &nbsp;Thats my main issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2) On a related topic to number 1, i was going through some sharing options and went to go turn on Media Streaming. &nbsp;A confirmation message appeared on the next window. &nbsp;It said, Media Sharing is turned off. &nbsp;Below was a button to click to enable it. &nbsp;I
 clicked on the enable button, and it listed the computers on the network who have sharing permissions with the laptop. &nbsp;I allowed all. &nbsp;I went into Windows Media Player, went up to Share, and noticed that at the bottom it said "Turn on Media Sharing...." &nbsp;I
 thought i just did? &nbsp;I clicked on that, and the same confirmation message as above appeared, i clicked again to enable it, again it showed the list of computers with permission to share media. &nbsp;i clicked on OK. &nbsp;Went back into Windows Media Player &gt; Share,
 same thing. &nbsp;No matter how many times i enable Media Sharing, it remains off.</p>
<p>I went through Services, found Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service, set it to Automatic, and started the service. &nbsp;After about 2 seconds it turned off. &nbsp;Sometimes it gives me a message saying "The service started and then stopped unexpectedly. &nbsp;Some
 programs turn services on and off automatically..." or something along those lines. &nbsp;The point is i cant get it to stay enabled.</p>
<p>I went to UPaP Services, started it, no problem. &nbsp;DHCP Client service, started, no problem. &nbsp;SNMP Service, started, no problem. &nbsp;Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service, started, stopped. Same deal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled the WMP feature, and restarted the computer, and then reinstalled it, and restarted again. &nbsp;No effect. &nbsp;Some forums suggested i edit a regestry entry. &nbsp;I went to LOCAL_USER&gt;blah blah&gt;peer to peer&gt; blah&gt;parameters(whatever the path is, i can't
 recall), and there is no DisabeledWhatever regestry entry. &nbsp;So its not that.</p>
<p>Heres something else, whenever i open WMP on my laptop, it shows up as a media device on all other computers. &nbsp;I can even "Play to" my laptop sometimes, and other times, it fails to 'contact media server". &nbsp; AHHHH!</p>
<p>I can usually find my own solution to things. &nbsp;Im pretty computer savvy, but in this case, i've spent months sort of casually troubleshooting this issue, and the past week ive been at it for hours. &nbsp;This one has got me beat.</p>
<p>I'm pretty much open for any ideas and/ or suggestions here at any level, short of formating my comp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks anyone in advance,</p>
<p>Pookie</p>

<p>it was installed from XP, so it was a clean install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought Avast might have been the culprit, but then why would it work with all the other computers on the network that also have Avast? &nbsp;Its worth a try i suppose to uninstall it and see what happens.</p>
<p>i will also try the new user tact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can you try going into 'Memory' &gt; 'Games' &gt; 'Call of Duty: Black Ops?' There should be a game update listed, which you can try deleting. After that, try clearing your cache as well, and then load the game. You should be prompted for a game update. Let me
 know how that goes!</p>

<p>By content, i mean the purchased items, in this case it seems like a map-pack.</p>
<p>First try finding the item on your purchase history if it is not listed it is likely the gamertag was not the one used to purchase the content.</p>
<p>also...</p>
<p>-Have you changed consoles recently? The content purchased is tied to the original console on which the content was downloaded onto and to the original gamertag. If you have changed consoles recently you can bring your content licenses from your old console
 by going to xbox.com/drm </p>

<p>Hey man I think I can help you out here. First thing is it will not load fully because the game is to scratched up. Luckily for you this is a easy fix. This was happening to me so you can trust my answer is legit. Ok first off you need a hard drive. Your
 also going to need a copy of Black Ops that all the maps work on. Just borrow a friends or rent it. Next you want to install your friends or the rented Black Ops onto your hard drive. In order to do this just click "Y" and click "Install To Hard Drive" Next
 the game will install to your hard drive. Once you friends copy or rented copy is completely installed ether take it back to the store, or give it back to your friend. Now just put in your scratched up Black Ops. Now click "game library", and click &nbsp;"Call
 Of Duty Black Ops" finally click "Play From Hard Drive" Your Black Ops will now work :) (You allways will have to play it from your Hard Drive. :)
