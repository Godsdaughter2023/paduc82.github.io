<h2>            Toad for Oracle 9.7.2 and 9.5 compatiblity with windows7 OS.</h2>

    <title>Display slightly off center after installing windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> comicda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display slightly off center after installing windows 7.</h2>
                    I had windows vista and then upgraded to windows 7. I have a princeton PNP monitor that worked fine but now it is slightly off center when the final display comes up after booting. I can adjust the display to make it correct manually on the monitor but
 once the monitor powers down or sleeps it comes back on off center. It happens with all DPI settings, and all resolutions. It got better when&nbsp;I set my refresh rate to 75 from 59-60. Have Nvidia graphics&nbsp;and drivers are up to date.<br />
Any suggestions? <br />

<p>Hi comicda,</p>
<p>Follow the steps below and see if that makes your day better.</p>
<p>To center or move your desktop or picture on your digital display screen:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From the NVIDIA Control Panel Classic Navigation pane, under Display, click Change display (flat panel) scaling to open the page.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Select either one of these options, depending on which one gives you the result you want:</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Use NVIDIA scaling</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Use my display's built-in scaling</p>
<p>If your desktop or picture appears cutoff on your analog display (CRT) screen, try any one or both of these procedures:</p>
<p><strong>Procedure 1:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From the NVIDIA Control Panel Classic Navigation pane, under Display, click Change Resolution Attributes to open the page.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Move the Display resolution slider to decrease (Less) your screen resolution until your desktop/image fits your screen.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure 2:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From the NVIDIA Control Panel Classic Navigation pane, under Display, click Move CRT screen position to open the page.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Use the arrow keys on the image that appears to adjust your screen position until your desktop/image is no longer cutoff on any side.</p>
<p>If your desktop or picture appears cutoff on your TV or HDTV screen, try any one or both of these procedures:</p>
<p><strong>Procedure 1:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From the NVIDIA Control Panel Classic Navigation pane, under Video &amp; Television, click Adjust screen size and position to open the page.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Use the arrow keys on the image that appears to adjust your screen position until your desktop/image is no longer cutoff on any side.</p>
<p><strong>Procedure 2:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; From the NVIDIA Control Panel Classic Navigation pane, under Video &amp; Television, click Change television signal or HD format to open the page.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Make sure the Connector-type list is set to the correct connection for your TV or HDTV display</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The HD mode list displays various HDTV display formats and equivalent screen resolutions such as 480p (720x480 progressive), 480i (720x480 interlaced), and so on.</p>
<p>Chose a format that gives you the display result you want on your screen.</p>
<p>If that does not help then you might also want to contact the monitor manufacturer and see if they have any updates on the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks for the input but my Nvidia control panel does not give me the options you have listed.<br />
My nvidia device is a geforce 8600 GT and my monitor is a princeton vl193. My Nvidea contol panel lists the following headings<br />
under Display<br />
Change Resolution<br />
Adjust desktop color settings<br />
adjust desktop size and position<br />
rotate display<br />
set up multiple displays<br />
<br />
I see no options to adjust scaling nor any options to move CRT position.<br />
When I adjust the resolution I still always have black line down the side that never moves no matter what the rest of the display does. When I use the Nvidia control panel to move the display it just disappears under the black line. The only adjustment that
 works is on the monitor itself but the problem reoccurs everytime the monitor sleeps. I did not have this problem until I upgraded to windows 7 from Vista Home Premium<br />
I have been unable to locate any drivers for the monitor no matter where I searched.
<br />
There is a way to set up custom resolutions and refresh rates etc but i am a little nervous to mess with that as it warns me I could damage my monitor&nbsp;if I use unsupported versions.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions would be great!<br />
Thanks,<br />
Comicda</p>

            I had the same problem, and searched and searched to no avail. &nbsp;However, I finally figured it out. &nbsp;In my case, the controls on the monitor itself have an option for input: &nbsp;DVI, VGA or Auto. &nbsp;Mine was set to Auto, I decided to try changing it to VGA (which
 is how mine is connected) and it fixed the problem. &nbsp;Seems the "auto" was confusing the monitor somehow.

                    <p>On multiple Windows 7 computers, shortly after running a Windows Update, a message seen years ago by many returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Failed to connect to a Windows service - Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service (sic). &nbsp;This problem prevents standard users from logging on to the system....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I reimaged BOTH computers and the error returned (intermittenly) after running windows update.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It is very time consuming (hours) to run windows update. &nbsp;Short of re-imaging (yet again) and installing each windows update one-by-one to identify which update(s) cause the problem, why is this happening
 and how can I hopefully resolve permanently?</span></p>
<p>And just FYI... I continue to run Windows 7 because I have two old, fairly expensive applications (Steinberg Wavelab and an old Quickbooks) that will not run on Windows 7, so I run them on the
 XP Mode VM. &nbsp;So please don't say "upgrade to Win 8/10".</p>

<p>I think I just found the answer to my own question. &nbsp;This appears to be caused (at least on my computers) by Bitdefender 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a blog where BitDefender acks the issue (at least as far back as a few months ago) and says they are working on a solution. &nbsp;Reading through the blog, BitDefender offers multiple 'solutions' (edit registry, reset winsock, etc.) which seem to work
 for some users, but not all. &nbsp;(The issue is intermittent, so not easy to confirm whether any such change permanently resolves the issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution is going to be uninstall BitDefender and go back to Norton or McAfee, which I've used many years without such aggravation.</p>

            BitDefender confirmed the known issue. &nbsp;Subsequently, I uninstalled BitDefender and installed Norton Security on TWO Windows 7 computers and the problem no longer occurs. &nbsp;RESOLVED.

            Looks like a virus. I recommend the following 2 things:
<br />
<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />Perform a Windows Defender Offline Scan:

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try running these programs:
<br />MBAM free: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />Eset online scanner:  <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/</a>
<br />Adwcleaner:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

    <title>Windows 10 line-in-to speakers-out latency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seaghost5478  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 line-in-to speakers-out latency</h2>
                    <p>Greets all. I used to use my PC with windows 7 to run a native guitar processor. There is more than 50 ms of latency from when I pluck a string to when I hear it through the speakers. I've tested for DPC and that is not the issue. Downloaded all latest drivers
 (and past drivers as well) and no luck. I have an ASUS Z170 Pro (NOT gaming, I do serious work with this PC). I have 8 GB of memory and a Skylake 6700K processor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked ASUS about it and they just gave me the pat "standard, knee-jerk, get this customer ticket to go away" answer that they only approve a specific list of devices to work with their motherboards. Yup....I suppose they want to give up on the whole market
 of audio processing. I don't know if this is a Windows 10 or an ASUS issue but if anyone has something that can help, I'd appreciate it. I saw an article about a special Microsoft audio driver that can take the place of the Realtek drivers, which is supposed
 to improve the latency but it if it does, it is imperceptible. Such a delay makes this machine useless for guitar audio processing. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>High latency can be a sign of hardware performance problem.</p>
<p>May be it is worth purchasing discrete external audio card.</p>

    <title>How can I increase the frequency of &#34;shadow copies&#34; on Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maingolddragon  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I increase the frequency of &#34;shadow copies&#34; on Windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    (I believe this is the correct topic)<br />
<br />
What I want is to increase how of Windows 10 creates "shadow copies" (I am not sure if that is the correct term).<br />
I am talking about when you right click a file or folder and it has that "Previous Versions" tab. Usually, for whatever reason, no previous version show on that tab but with the program Shadow Explorer (a program I used when I still had Vista) it finds the
 previous versions.<br />
<br />
I searched a bit and I found something called "File History" but that looks like it works as a backup and I can only enable it to store the "copies" to an external drive. I do not want that. I don't want a backup.<br />
<br />
Then from "System" I found "System protection" (which sound more like a backup) but I only have 2 options there:<br />
1. Adjust the Disk Space Usage, which I from what I understand it allows me to access version further in the past<br />
2. And manually create a restore point at this very moment.<br />
<br />
For 1. I do not really care that much to go in the past, usually I want to restore a folder about 10 hours ago, so the Usage for the purposes of going further in the past seems unnecessary to me.<br />
But 2. is more like what I want. I manually created a restore point, I could not see it or access it from right clicking a file or folder and going to the Previous Versions tab, BUT I could access it from Shadow Explorer.<br />
<br />
So basically I want to do 2. automatically. I found 2 articles from howtogeek.com:<br />
*http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/change-how-often-system-restore-creates-restore-points-in-windows-vista/<br />
*http://www.howtogeek.com/56891/use-windows-7s-previous-versions-to-go-back-in-time-and-save-your-files/<br />
<br />
They are almost the same and the steps are very similar to Windows 10, but so far I have not seen any Restore Points created by either of those 2 ways.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ?

    <title>Storage Usage not correctly reflected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Storage Usage not correctly reflected</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything to remove unnecessary storage, but when always get low disk space warnings right after I have apparently deleted several GB's worth of data. It just appears to regenerate itself whenever I stop looking at it. I have been deleting
 temporary files manually since the storage section will not allow me at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also feel that the amount represented in each folder is inaccurate since when I calculate my App and Game folder storage space ( apparently 192 GB out of 235 GB avaliable). I have only 4.68 GB in my programs and files however. And if you count my Onenote
 app, then it would equal around 9 GB. So none of the data in my storage app seems to be making sense what so ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point, I moved all of my music and pictures off of my computer and freed up over 30 GB worth of data but within a week, I had started recieving low storage alerts again . I have tried running System File checker and I recieved an error message that
 the operation could not be performed. I also attempted doing DISM before but I got an error code of 112 saying that it was unable to locate the temporary file needed to run the prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to get to the bottom of the mysterious data that I cannot fathom where it is located and be able to free up my disk space so I could actually use my computer instead of being in a constant battle with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is supposed to hold 238 GB. My systems and reserved is 34.4 GB, Apps and Games 192 GB, &nbsp;Documents 5.01 MB, Pictures 870 MB, Music 3.54 GB, Video 0 GB, Mail 22 MB, One Drive 15.7 MB, Desktop 2.19 GB, Map 8.07 MB, Other Users 12 KB, Temp Files
 1.54 GB, Other 6.25 GB</p>

            You can install WinDir Stat to get a graphical representation of what's taking up the hard drive:  http://windirstat.info/download.html

I've found most often it's the paging file which virtualizes memory to extend it or Hiberfile that stores the contents of RAM so Windows can power off during Hibernate.  These are hidden files on C which you can unhide in Explorer&gt;View&gt;Options&gt;Change Folder and Search Options&gt;Unhide System Files and Hidden files.  

But I have also had problems with misreporting that did not involve actual storage space being used or broken System files causing the misreporting.  Something else was responsible which I never isolated and was only resolved by reinstalling.  

I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            How do I add money to my Xbox account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I want to know how to put money on my account. I currently have £3.40 on there, and want to add £11.60 so I can sign up to Xbox Live for three months, and use that £3.40 as part of it. My card details are all up to date. A straight link to where I can do
 this would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place for this post, apologies if it isn't.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks, M</p>

<p>Thank you both for your help.</p>
<p>You know, I originally had to buy some points, as I wanted the Red Dead Redemption extra content (in hindsight I should really have bought the game of the year edition). So I dutifully entered my card details, bought the content and had 400 or so points
 left over. Then I was informed that the points system was ending, and that my points were being converted back to money (the money I had used to buy them in the first place). Now I apparently only have a set amount of time to use My Money, before it disappears
 forever.</p>
<p>I have used a Windows-based PC for eighteen years now, and I have at absolute best a love hate relationship with Microsoft (at absolute best). Their optical USB trackball is a great bit of kit (I have been using the same one for sixteen years now), so obviously
 they chose to discontinue it.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am rambling and in danger of ranting. Again, thank you.</p>

<p>Again, OWEN is on the ball and is correct. Only the converted money will expire, not any credit you added after that. Don't worry about the ranting, that's all I ever do. I'm fluent in rant-language :P</p>

    <title>Cortana keeps launching Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frungi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana keeps launching Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>Edge isn't working properly: it launches. Windows 10 lets me set a default browser. Cortana lets me do web searches. My default web browser lets me do web searches. Cortana opens web searches in Edge, which is not my default browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted to use Edge, I would set it as my default, or I would explicitly open it. If I never do these things, that's because I prefer to use something else, and I don't care whether it interfaces better with Cortana. Is there any way to make Cortana
 respect my choice of default programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've read, this issue was caused by an April 2016 update to Windows 10. It doesn't seem to have been fixed, but I'm hoping there's at least a workaround, other than simply not initiating web searches from Cortana; it's handy to just tap the Windows
 key and search.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Somehow, this question wound up with a fairly nonsensical subject line written by someone who doesn’t speak English, rather than the one I had originally typed in. I have remedied this.</p>

<p>This is false. Cortana launches Edge regardless of the default browser setting. And this is behavior that some of us wish could be changed, since some of us like to use Cortana but do not like to use Edge.</p>

<p>It doesn't. The reward has already been sent to people who completed it. I completed it, but did not receive my reward. So, I'll ask again, how do I get my reward?</p>

<p>This reply didn't age well. Are you going to actually do something about this? I still have no reward. It is now November, and I'm still without my promised reward. Because of this, and the
<strong>(Mod Removed-Profanity)</strong> help you have given me, I cancelled my game pass subscription.</p>

            Hi Johan,
<div>Thank you for posting the issue in Microsoft Community Forum.</div>
<div>We will help you resolve the issue.</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</div>
<div>2. Is your computer connected to domain network?</div>
<div>3. How&nbsp;are you&nbsp;trying to create image backup?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few steps which you can follow.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1:</div>
<div>Check if the service start up type is automatic.<br />
<br />
a. Press Windows key + R&nbsp;and type <strong>services.msc</strong> and go to services window.<br />
b. Check if the start up type for Volume shadow service is automatic, if not then change it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2:<br />
You may perform check disk and check if the issue persists. </div>
<div>a. Press Windows Key + C to open the Charms bar.<br />
b. Now click Settings and then PC Settings.<br />
c. Now click General and then click Restart Now under Advanced Startup.<br />
d. Now Click Troubleshoot.<br />
e. Now click Advanced options and select Command Prompt.<br />
f. Type Chkdsk /r and hit Enter.</div>
<div>Disclaimer: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 3:</div>
<div>Here we would suggest you to go for a sfcscan on your computer to check file integrity.<br />
<br />
a. Move the mouse to the right hand corner of the screen to get the charms bar.<br />
b. Type command prompt. Right click on Command Prompt and select Run as Administrator.<br />
c. Type Sfc /scannow in the command prompt and press enter.<br />
d. Wait till the process completes, restart the computer and check.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 4:<br />
Now when you try to perform backup, we recommend that you may try disabling the security software temporarily on the computer and perform a backup, make sure to enable the security software back on the computer.<br />
<div>NOTE: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as
 soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this resolves the issue. If issue persists, you can write back to us and we will be happy to assist you further</div>
<div><br />

            I too just started having this issue.&nbsp; I have never had any problem burning a regular system image about every 6 months, until Windows 8 updated to 8.1.&nbsp; I too think this is a problem at Microsoft's end, not the user end.&nbsp; I am not running anything different
 on my computer now than I had the very first time I burned an image to my WD external HDD.&nbsp; I will try your steps mentioned and let everyone know if I have any luck.

    <title>Saints Row The Third is a step backwards. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> green grenades  say:</h3>
<h2>            Saints Row The Third is a step backwards. </h2>
                    
<p>This game is truly disappointing. Saints Row 2 was amazing and I was expecting something similar to that but even bigger and better. Why they went down the road they did is beyond me. First off the customization is minimal. You can't layer clothing, what
 little their is to choose from, tattoos are limited and you can't place them where ever you want. Vehicle customization is minimal as well, and I can't back this up but it almost seems as though there are less vehicles in this one than in 2. Exploration is
 another huge thing they took away from this game, their is nothing to explore that will actually make an impression on you. Saints Row 2 had caves, islands, bunnies coming up from the ocean, the pyramid, buildings you could enter, a college, a roman arena,
 a prison, etc. They decided to minimize this as well. I can enter my hideouts and maybe a few other buildings but that is it. There are also not as many side missions to do or should I say as many fun ones. Which of course is just an opinion. The story also
 isn't very compelling and neither are the enemy leaders. Honestly I don't have any clue as to what is going on, there are limited cut scenes and on top of that the cut scenes are a lot shorter then the ones in 2. Spoiler coming up. There is one scene where
 Shaundi says that she will pay back the luchadores for what they did at Gats funeral, I had no clue that Gat had died until she said that, or that their was a funeral, unless some how I missed a cut scene somewhere. I am just so disappointed with this game.
 It is fun yes but it is no where near as good as 2. It is also sad seeing people defend this game to the death, and the reason why it makes me sad is Volition will listen to those people and think it is okay to dumb down games. I will put my time into it and
 keep playing it and enjoy it while I can but I just think Volition dropped the ball on this one.</p>

<p>I do agree with some of what you say. As for the spoiler part you said, yes, they did talk about it a little in a cut scene but but not really that much. I like the game. I am not very judgmental over video games, so I am really enjoying this. I think it's
 way better than 2!</p>

<p>While I do miss the little things they took out, such as the dynamic day/night cycle, with everything they added they still took two steps forward. Those decisions were probably made because of the game engine but I hope they put everything back in for Saints
 Row 4. lol and yeah, it does feel like some cutscenes are missing.</p>

<p>When I first started playing SR3, I definitely thought it was better than SR2. However the more I think about it and the more I keep playing it, the more I'm leaning in favor of SR2 now.<br />
<br />
SR3 has improved in some areas like driving, no longer requiring respect to do missions, the new upgrade feature is a nice addition, and the humor/absurdity of it all is still there. However SR3 definitely suffers in the story department... SR2 was over the
 top but the story held together nicely and made some sense. This game seems to be missing some cutscenes (they better not release it as DLC...) and feels rushed. It's like the writers opted to raise the craziness of it all and left the story behind.<br />
<br />
Another, albeit minor, complaint I have with the game is that the new cockney accent is way too gruff and serious. The new VA can't seem to decide if he's English or Australian... The cockney accent in Sr2 was goofy and funny, this time around not so much...<br />
<br />
SR3 could of really been a complete experience, but they definitely dropped the ball on this one. Hopefully in SR4 they will focus on improving the story while upping the absurdity of it all. Also, the graphics engine needs a lot of work... It still struggles
 to keep things smooth and things are always streaming in. I hope they wait and release SR4 on the next Xbox.</p>

<p>Their r more cars in this game.</p>
<p>I do wish more activites were in this game such as fight club or Fuzz and the medic one was cool because of the shock paddles.</p>
<p>I think this game is better than 2 but they should have had more cut scenes and allowed u to choose both endings so that SR4 would have a more clear cut story.</p>

<p>There are at this time three confirmed DLC coming for Saints Row The Third, first coming in January next year. Check the downloadable content section in the main menu, and then check the Season Pass section. You can prepay for it now by purchasing the pass,
 as well as get the Nyte Blayde pack as well.</p>

<p>I completely agree with you. I was actually just talking about this with a friend of mine. I do enjoy this game and I am having a lot of fun but it pales in comparison to SR2. I am a huge fan of this series and I'm sad that this wasn't how I expected it
 to be. I've waited for this game since I finished the second one years ago and it's just disappointing.</p>
<p>The story is weak, I didn't really even understand what was going on much. The characters I don't even care about, it's a much shorter game,I hate how the activities work now, the map seems tiny for me (but I'm assuming because I don't have HD) the info
 bubble that pops up all the time annoys the hell out of me. There's nothing cool to explore, (the caves, the mall, the roman arena etc.)
</p>
<p>Nothing too fancy for customizing your character, hair still sucks for females, not many new cool cars. I mean it seems to me all they really did was put a new name, change the look a bit of everything, and add in more wow factor. And they took away a lot
 that I really enjoyed for SR2. I hate how they took away the option to redo missions later on from the newspaper or whatever you had in your crib. And how they completely overlooked Johnny dying! WTH was that?! OMG and don't even get me started on that ridiculous
 ending..</p>
<p>I hope if they make a SR4 it won't be as disappointing as this one was to me. </p>

<h2>            Power Cycling Once a Day...</h2>
                    
<p>My wife bought me an Xbox One for my birthday in March. &nbsp;And since activating it, I've had to power cycle approximately once a day. &nbsp;Some days as many as four times. &nbsp;Is this normal? &nbsp;Are other people experiencing this level of Xbox One instability? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, it's a game that kicks me back to home when I'm trying to load it. &nbsp;Other times it has been my pins not loading so I can't access the store. &nbsp;And one time, I rented "The Hobbit" on Xbox Video...and the system told me that my rental had expired within
 minutes of my renting the movie</p>
<p>Should I be demanding that Microsoft send me a replacement?</p>

<p>You shouldn't be experiencing these problems, sorry to hear about the issues..</p>
<p>My suggestion to you since I just got my XBOX ONE a bit ago and encountered these problems is to do a cold restart:</p>
<p>Power down your console, then unplug the power cable from the back of the Xbox One. &nbsp;Wait for two minutes, then plug the power cable back into the back of the Xbox One, and monitor the power brick, waiting for it to cycle from a white light to an orange
 light, and then turn the power on. &nbsp;This will perform a cold restart of the system,</p>
<p>If that doesn't work I suggest (If you have nothing to lose) factory restore and then do another cold restart..</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and am generally very pleased.&nbsp; However, I had the ability in Windows 7 (using Windows Media Player) to play all my VOB files from my hard drive (backups of all our family's DVDs).&nbsp; When I go to play those same files
 in WMP in Windows 10, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried K-Lite, Shark007, and a couple others, but none allow me to play the VOB files in WMP.&nbsp; I very much would like to continue to use WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix to this problem?&nbsp; Or is this related to the general removal of native DVD playing in Windows 10?&nbsp; Very frustrating - all my family's DVDs are on the hard drive in VOB format, and we play them over our network.&nbsp; It seemed that WMP's network
 streaming was excellent, but now I don't have that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions out there?</p>

            <p>I also used to play VOB files on Windows Media Player in Windows 7.&nbsp; I think I played them on WMP in Windows 10 up until just a few days ago (or am I getting senile?).&nbsp; Anyway, I also tried using various codecs and nothing worked.&nbsp; I tried loading them in
 the new Windows DVD Player by choosing the file and then open with/choose another app.&nbsp; However, the Windows DVD Player isn't listed, I can't find it by searching, and when I right click Windows DVD Player in the all apps menu, the "Open File Location" option
 isn't even there. &nbsp; When I just open the Windows DVD player, it just tells me "To Play Something, insert a dvd".&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no file open option etc.&nbsp; So, I cannot figure out how to use the Windows DVD player to open a VOB file that I copied from a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft support through their chat line, and I couldn't get any sort of intelligible answer from him.&nbsp; He kept giving vague answers that looked like they were copied from issues that had nothing to do with my question.&nbsp; After about 40 minutes
 of gibberish, I finally gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if anyone has any idea how to play a VOB file in Windows 10 on Microsoft Windows Media Player or Microsoft DVD Player, please post a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting you reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that, i<span>f we need to play VOB with Windows Media Player, we should download a codec like k-lite codec from the free-codec website to upgrade our media player, which will allow Windows Media Player 9, 11 to playback many new types
 of file formats, including VOB.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information is helpful.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>That's what I actually did with Windows 7 - but it seems that the K-Lite codec pack doesn't get it done with the WMP that's included in Windows 10. &nbsp;I installed that and couldn't get the VOB folders to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone out there had success with K-Lite? &nbsp;How did you configure it?</p>

<p>11.&nbsp;<strong>Q: I currently play my DVDs from a file backup, does the Windows DVD Player app support this?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, the app currently only plays DVD movies on optical discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also I can't get vlc or mpc to recognize the audio track.</p>

            <p>I followed the link for "Getting the Windows DVD Player app" and I think there's a problem.</p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10, about a month ago, from Windows 7 Home Premium. I have Windows Media Player installed. I have 'not' received the update that's supposed to add this DVD Player. I checked for updates and nothing came up. Seems to me something's broken.
 Any other way to download this?</p>

            I'm interested in the solution to this as I have the same problem. Windows 7 played .VOB files fine. Windows 10 wont !<br />
