<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista
 Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.&nbsp; Make sure you make a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to identify the corrupt files (yes, I know it's a HUGE listing).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Now try System Restore again.&nbsp; <span>
Try a System Restore to a point in time <strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
</span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>Paint 3D Crashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peddidle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paint 3D Crashes</h2>
                    I'm using a new Dell computer, and every time I try to use Paint 3D, it crashes. This is 100% of the time. Sometimes it crashes before I draw a line. Other times I can draw a few lines before it crashes. I have never made it past using the program for
 more than 10 seconds before it has crashed. I get the pop-up that says 'Paint 3D needs to close.' It's often followed by the BSOD. I have reset it already, which didn't help at all. It crashes regardless whether I'm using the mouse or the pen. While I'm not
 entirely positive Paint 3D is the problem, it does seem to be the ONLY program I' having issues with. I'm at a loss as to where to start with troubleshooting it.

            Hi, Peddidle,
<br />
<br />1. Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall/Reinstall the app
<br />
<br />3. Re-register Microsoft Store apps
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select PowerShell Admin
<br />Copy/paste the following into the window then press Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Reboot and retry the app.

            Hi PE.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Reset Paint 3D at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Paint 3D &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset. 
<br />
<br />If problems persist then re-register the App from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of these help then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Smittychat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Already did everything there. Didn't fix anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The Uninstall button is grayed out for Paint 3D. The best I can do is reset it, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tried this. Didn't work. Paint 3D still crashes the same as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts, but ultimately did not help solve the issue even a little bit.</p>

<p>Thank you for the uninstall instructions. I was able to uninstall/reinstall successfully. Paint 3D functions better, though not entirely the way it should. It no longer freezes my computer or causes error messages or require my PC be rebooted when it crashes.
 It crashes the first time I use it, but once it crashes, I can reopen it and use it just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to be having some graphics driver issues or something. I have occasionally received the BSOD error VIDEO_DXGKRNL_FATAL_ERROR and another one (I forgot to take a picture of the other error, so I don't remember what it was now--it might have had 'graphics'
 in the error). Also, I had been able to play Sims4 and then suddenly started getting an error saying that it was unable to open because of my video card. I have a dedicated Nvidia GeForce MX150&nbsp; card and am wondering if the driver might need to be reinstalled.
 When I tried updating it, it said it's already up to date. When I look at the properties via Device Manager, it says the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Provider: NVIDIA</p>
<p>Driver Date: 6/24/2018</p>
<p>Driver Version: 24.21.13.9836</p>
<p>Digital Signer: Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Roll Back Driver option is grayed out, which makes me wonder if it hasn't been updated since the driver date of 6/24/18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The quick way to fix it is to change your DPI scaling to 100%, apply and restart your computer. &nbsp;Do whatever you need to do, then go back and move it back to 150% (or wherever you had it before).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change your DPI scaling, right-click your wallpaper and go to resolution. Ignore the first page and click "Make text and other items larger or smaller" (it's a blue link of text).</p>

    <title>How to prevent Defrag from re-enabling itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hastor34  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent Defrag from re-enabling itself</h2>
                    <p>I normally keep defrag/optimization set on a schedule for my internal hard drives - one SSD, one standard. I have the other drives disabled under 'choose drives' and I've also disabled 'defrag new drives automatically'.</p>
<p>However, a few times a year I'll see my other drives having lots of activity, and check just to find out that everything that was unchecked is now checked, it is defragging all drives as well as new ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a multi-drive storage device (Drobo) that handles all this itself, and the 'file system' it reports to Windows is basically virtual, and doesn't represent the actual layout of data on the drives. Defrag is known to cause issues on Drobo devices, and
 they warn against running defrag. So far I haven't seen it cause any issues, but this is 27TB of my data that I have in a Drobo specifically for redundancy (one drive can die without losing anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure out what turns it back on, but that's very invasive and possibly destructive. Any idea why Windows does this, or if something else could be doing it, such as Dell or ESET antivirus software (the only thing I really have installed that is related
 to the system as a whole and does any drive scanning/checking)?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have <strong>Windows 10 Home</strong> on my laptop, and I changed the ownership of the entire C: drive and

<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this ?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may modify the ownership of the drives on your computer for specific users for security purposes to access its permissions. However, this option is unable to revert back to its default setup. If you run into a problem with other users on your PC, you
 may just add the <strong>Administrator</strong> and they must use the administrator account to access its permission. To do this, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>File Explorer</strong>, and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the<strong> C: </strong>drive and select <strong>Properties</strong> &gt;
<strong>Security</strong> tab and click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button.</li><li>On the <strong>Advanced Security Settings for Windows (C:)</strong> window, click the
<strong>Change</strong> button for the <strong>Owner</strong>, type <strong>Administrator</strong> on the
<strong>Enter the object name to select</strong> section, and then click <strong>
Check Names</strong>. This will allow all administrator accounts.<br />
</li><li>Once you’re done, click <strong>OK &gt; Apply</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.</li><li>After completing the steps, click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes, and then check if these steps resolved your concern.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated about your concern for additional assistance.</p>

            Hi,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This error message: An unexpected I/O error has occurred. Status: (<b>0Xc00000e9</b>) is a hardware error pertaining to your system’s BIOS.&nbsp; Basically it is telling you that the computer is not able to reliably communicate with the hard drive.&nbsp;We can try
 a few steps and check if it works: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>If you have Windows Vista DVD, I would suggest you to run the <b>Start up Repair Tool</b> from Windows Recovery using Windows Vista disk and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-Vista</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;<b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Also run the SFC (System File checker) Scan in Windows Recovery mode.</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Command prompt from Windows Recovery Mode</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <b>C:</b> and press enter. On <b>C:\</b> prompt type <b>cd windows\system32\</b> and press enter.
</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <b>sfc /scannow</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to rebuilt BCD. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the Windows Vista or Windows Vista installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.
</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press a key when you are prompted. </p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click
<b>Next</b>. </p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>Repair your computer</b>. </p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click <b>
Next</b>. </p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <b>System Recovery Options</b> dialog box, click <b>Command Prompt</b>.
</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <b>Bootrec.exe</b>, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type<b> bootrec /RebuildBcd </b>, and press Enter<b>.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -
<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode)
<br />
is to CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it -
<br />
then on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is
<br />
reached by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />

Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss
<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just
<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these
<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />

<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the
<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get
<br />
there.<br />

You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore
<br />
it only has to be bootable).<br />

<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation
<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or
<br />
three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own

In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have
<br />
to reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions.
<br />
You will need to know your Product Code.<br />

Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type <br />
parenthesis or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />

<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />

<h2>            Downloaded a zipped file&#47;folder would not delete, name too long.</h2>
                    I downloaded a zipped file/folder from a trusted site I always go to. I unzipped the file (music mp3's) with success and added them to my itunes. When I tried to drag the music file to my ipod, itunes says it's location could not be found. So I went and
 checked on the folder which I unzipped and all these other files with weird characters shows up. It took 145GB space in my external hardrive (thank goodess). Now I can not rename or delete any of the files or the folder itself. I've tried some removal tools
 but it didn't work or when I try to download them, my anti-virus software flags me. I need a way to get rid of the folder. Money is tight, so it would help if it's a freeware. OR better yet a way to deleted it without having to download any software. I've
 tried deleting it in safe mod and DOS. No success. Tried Unlocker and D something software too.

<p>It sounds like you got a corrupted Zip file, which can do some pretty funky stuff even without being viral.&nbsp; Either that, or just as likely a possibility, your hard drive may have bad sectors on it, which could also produce some bizarre results.&nbsp; The fact
 that the location could no longer&nbsp;be found is a possible indicator of file system errors.</p>
<p>I recommend running CheckDisk to check for errors first.&nbsp; Yes, it is time consuming, but if there
<em>are</em> errors, finding them now and fixing them will save you from much more headache later on.&nbsp; Be sure you have a backup copy of your important data before running CheckDisk.&nbsp; While it is not likely, there is&nbsp;always a potential for data loss when running
 any utility to repair errors in the file system.&nbsp; When you are ready, right-click on the drive in question, click on
<strong>Properties</strong>, and on the <strong>Tools</strong> tab, click <strong>
Check Now</strong>.&nbsp; Then choose one of the following (each one is more rigorous and therefore more time consuming than the one before):</p>
<ul>
<li>To run Chkdsk in read-only mode, click <strong>Start</strong>. </li><li>To run Chkdsk by using the <strong>/f</strong> parameter, select the <strong>
Automatically fix file system errors</strong> check box and then click <strong>Start</strong>.
</li><li>To run Chkdsk by using the <strong>/r</strong> parameter, select the <strong>
Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong> check box and then click <strong>
Start</strong>. </li></ul>
<p>Lorien offers a couple good points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you have ownership and full permissions on all the files/folders? </li><li>You may need to enable the Hidden Administrator Account.&nbsp; Because of its potential for disaster if used improperly, before you resort to this level (unless you already have), try the DOS method below.
</li></ol>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the exact error you get if you try to delete or rename the files? </li><li>I am assuming there is a considerable amount of other data on the drive, so you can't simply reformat it.&nbsp; Correct?
</li><li>How steady are your feet when you're walking through DOS? </li></ol>
<p>Suggestions:</p>
<p>First and foremost, create a Restore Point before tackling this - especially if you need to try the DOS method, and even more critical if you need to use the Admin Account.</p>
<p>Depending on the error:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have not already done so, make sure you are the "Owner" of the files/folders.&nbsp;&nbsp;See Lorien's instructions for that.&nbsp; If it's an Access Denied error, taking ownership and giving yourself full permissions
</li><li>If that is the case, try permanently deleting it instead of recycling: right-click the file and hold down the shift key as you click on delete.<br />
If that is not the case, or if it still says the name is too long, try the DOS method below.&nbsp; Make sure Process Explorer is running (see the next step).
</li><li>If the error says the file is open in another program, even though it isn't, it may be Windows Explorer itself that has a hold of it.&nbsp; When I run into&nbsp; that problem, I use this method.&nbsp;
</li><li>If you don't already have Process Explorer installed, I recommend it.&nbsp; It's free, and it's from Microsoft - and let's face it, how many times do you hear those two things in the same sentence?&nbsp; Go to Microsoft.com/sysinternals and download it.&nbsp; There's
 no installation - just unzip it to a convenient place (I keep all my sysinternal tools in a folder of their own, rather than pooling them with other Microsoft programs).&nbsp; It has such a small footprint that you can add a shortcut for Process Explorer to your
 Startup folder, and leave it running, and not even notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
* Start Process Explorer.&nbsp; The Find menu only has one entry - Find Handle or Dll.&nbsp; Click that and type in the name (or copy and paste) of one of the files/folders you can't delete.&nbsp; It should give you a result if a process really does have a handle on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
* If it's anything other than Explorer.exe, you need to determine if it's safe to kill the process without causing instability.&nbsp; Usually if it's any process that is a child of Explorer, it's probably safe to kill it.&nbsp; If that is the case, you&nbsp;may then be able
 to delete the file.&nbsp; Judging from your original post, I doubt it is that easy.&nbsp; </li><li>Next step - and here's where it can get sticky - is to take Windows Explorer out of the equation.&nbsp; It can be an ill-behaved pest when it wants to.
</li><li>Start an Administrator command prompt.&nbsp; Quickest way&nbsp;with Process Explorer running, under the File menu, select&nbsp;Run as Administrator, and type in "cmd" and press enter.&nbsp;
</li><li>Once the command prompt is up, go back to Process Explorer, find explorer.exe, right click on it and select Kill Process.&nbsp;
 later, you may not be able to see them.&nbsp; Also note that while Explorer is not running, your Start Menu and Taskbar are not available.&nbsp; That's why it's important to have Process Explorer running while Explorer isn't.
</li><li>The DOS Method:&nbsp; OK, if you know your way around DOS, great - I don't want to belittle you by telling you stuff you already know.&nbsp; But... I also don't want to simply assume you know, and have you wind up guessing.&nbsp;
</li><li>I do assume you know a little about it, since you said you tried deleting them in DOS.&nbsp; I also assume from your question that there is a common parent folder, and you want to delete everything that is in it.&nbsp; Navigate to the parent of&nbsp;that common&nbsp;folder.&nbsp;
 THIS DELETE&nbsp;IS NOT REVERSIBLE - There is no Recycle Bin in DOS mode.&nbsp; Make doubly sure that you are in the right directory, and that you want to delete everything in the folder you will specify and all its child folders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes?&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; DOS doesn't like to let
 you delete files with the Hidden, System, or Read-Only attributes set.&nbsp; Fortunately, there's a much easier way around that than there was back in the Dark Ages when DOS was the OS of choice, and Windows was just a program you ran from within DOS, not the other
 way around, like it is now.&nbsp; Type in (without quotes, not case-sensitive) "RMDIR /S
<em>foldername</em>" where <em>foldername </em>is the name of the directory you want to remove, and press Enter.&nbsp; The /S parameter removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself.&nbsp; It is used to remove an entire
 directory tree.&nbsp; It will ask you Y/N.&nbsp; It will not ask again - all files and folders, regardless of their attributes, will be deleted.&nbsp; Again, NOT REVERSIBLE.&nbsp; The file system normally limits you to 256 characters for a file's full path name (all the subdirectories
 and backslashes&nbsp;all the way to the file extension - 259 counting the drive letter, colon, and initial backslash).&nbsp; Using this Administrator command prompt, without Explorer running, the&nbsp;RMDIR command as shown here
</li><li>If still not successful, the next step would be to enable the Hidden Administrator Account.&nbsp; To restart Explorer, with the command prompt still open, type "explorer" and press Enter.&nbsp; Keep the command prompt open - that will save you a couple steps in activating
 the Admin Account.&nbsp; Once you've activated it, log out of your own account, and back in under the Administrator.
</li><li>Again, I emphasize that this account should only be used when necessary, and should be disabled at all other times.
</li><li>Once logged in, go back and retry the steps, beginning with starting an Administrator mode command prompt, starting&nbsp;Process Explorer and killing Windows Explorer, then running the RMDIR command again.
</li></ul>
<p>If you have made it to this point without success, you could try attaching the drive to another computer if one is available, and repeating the steps there.&nbsp; Apart from that, the commercial file deletion program suggested by Lorien would also be my next
 recommendation.</p>
<p>May fortune go with you.</p>

<p>You've already tried Unlocker which would have been my first recommendation.&nbsp; I know of no other free folder deletion programs (especially geared to name too long). If Unlocker doesn't work, neither will any delete utilitly within Vista (because Unlocker
 is better at it than Vista).</p>
<p>The following commercial product ($19 I think) says that it specifically deletes folders with names that are too long.
<a href="http://www.abtollc.com/Folder-Delete.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.abtollc.com/Folder-Delete.aspx</a>.&nbsp; I suspect this will do the trick but of course I can't be sure so trying it is a risk that it will not solve the problem despite spending money on it.</p>
<p>Your problem with the folder may be a permissions problem.&nbsp; Make sure you have Full Rights permissions and take ownership (and perhaps the parent folders as well).&nbsp; Be sure to check the Advnaced properties for Special permissions that limit rights or inherit
 permissions from parent folders - you may need to delete them if you already have full rights on the main screen.&nbsp; Here are the procedures:</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read
 only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp; You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop
 this except protect the folder with a password using a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></span></a></span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></span></span><span><br />
<br />
I have no other suggestions at this point.&nbsp; What is the EXACT and complete file path of this folder?&nbsp; Depending on where it is, we may be able to create a new user profile (treat your current one as if it is corrupt) and traansfer all the data EXCEPT this folder
 to the new profile.&nbsp; Then delete the old provile if it lets us despite that folder - it might or it might not (I'm not sure).&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>To try this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You could also try going into an elevated command prompt:
<span>
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.&nbsp; From there type Cd&nbsp;a space and then type in the fulll path name to the folder in question (if it even shows up).&nbsp; Once in the folder
 type del *.* and see what happens.&nbsp; It may give you the same error message or it may delete. Once the contents are deleted type cd.. and then type del &lt;foldername&gt; (yes I know it's long) and enter. This may delete the folder.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>hello,</p>
<p>i completed a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit&nbsp;and everything went smoothly until i started adding the lenovo t61p specific drivers.&nbsp; I am receiving the following error in the event viewer:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver \Driver\WUDFRd failed to load for the device USB\VID_0483&amp;PID_2016\5&amp;295bd535&amp;0&amp;2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after much&nbsp;googling, i find that the usb&nbsp;device is a fingerprint reader.&nbsp; removing the fingerprint reader drivers removes the error from the event viewer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the AuthenTec TouchChip Fingerprint Coprocessor is using driver v1.5.0.289.&nbsp; their website says that the error is a problem with Microsoft.&nbsp; see this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.authentec.com/KnowledgeBase/KBview/tabid/843/ArticleId/443/WUDFRd-failed-to-load-for-the-device.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.authentec.com/KnowledgeBase/KBview/tabid/843/ArticleId/443/WUDFRd-failed-to-load-for-the-device.aspx</a>,
 or search their Knowledge Base for <span>"WUDFRd failed to load for the device".&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>i see that other answers&nbsp;forum members are having similar issues, but they have yet to find a solution.&nbsp; could someone in Microsoft provide an update&nbsp;for a&nbsp;fix?</span></p>

            yea! After two years I found a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;I installed an older version of the Lenovo fp sw and it fixed the warning on 2 t60's win 7 sp1.&nbsp; I have been running it for about 3 weeks and the warning is gone on both pc's.&nbsp;sooo download and install IN1FGP08WW1.exe.&nbsp;
 this is Lenovo's fp sw from UTEK and it has the driver to clear the warning.&nbsp; BUT it is not as secure as the current Lenovo fp sw.&nbsp; apparently it was discontinued when authentic bought UTEK because of this.&nbsp; from what I understand if someone has physical access
 to your pc they can decifer your windows pw from the registry.&nbsp; this is not a big deal for me.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 stuck on white circle at startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfredud  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 stuck on white circle at startup</h2>
                    <p>For the last few months my windows 10 fails to upgrade. It will get stuck in a loop for awhile before getting to the login screen. That's a different issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this, others have recommended deleting profiles from the registry. I must have deleted the wrong one because after a restart I get stuck at the blue start screen with the spinning circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can ctrl+alt+del to get to the power button. Apparently holding shift while using that to restart while continuing to hold it would get you to options. I cannot get that to work. I have a wireless keyboard so maybe that's why.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read so many posts and nothing works. If anyone can tell me how to get into safe mode I would greatly appreciate it. I backed up the registry as well. Very stuck here.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Not Charging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Not Charging</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I recently upgraded my Dell laptop to a Windows 10. Since then, it has not been charging. The power cord is plugged in, and the black rectangle in the middle of it has a green light, but its still not charging. My laptop is currently on 3% battery.
 Whenever I unplug the charger, my laptop turns off. When I click the battery icon in the bottom right corner of the screen, it has the charger icon next to it, but it still says not charging. If I hover over the icon with my mouse, it says 3% available (plugged
 in, not charging). I don't think the problem is in my power cord. I think it has something to do with my laptop or the battery in my laptop. Any suggestions?</p>

            I'm really sorry, but it didn't work. When I press my power button for 10 seconds, is it supposed to make a sound or something, because nothing happened when I held it.

<h2>            Hard Drives not Showing up in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just installed 2 hard drives in my Windows 10 PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The C drive is an SSD and is working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also an additional 2 drives including a 240GB SSD and a 1TB HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm aware neither of these are showing up in disk management:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b3b4188-ea6f-4e63-aed5-9dc99730f424?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b3b4188-ea6f-4e63-aed5-9dc99730f424?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only drive that I can right click on is the C Drive.</p>
<p>I've checked for driver updates and run the Windows Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is a custom built PC that I have just set up. There are no issues aside from the problem with the drives. All drives are connected via SATA and SATA Power cables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated here because I'm at a complete loss.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi SurestPond95392,
<br />
<br />Right click that Unallocatee space, choose 'New Simple Volume'
<br />
<br />Accept NTFS as the file System and when asked to assign a drive letter, accept the default
<br />
<br />What that completes, you should be able to use that drive again form File Explorer
<br />
<br />With regards to the 240GB SSD, check the connections on that to the motherboard and power unit
<br />
<br />if not, unplug that SSD and start your PC
<br />
<br />Then **** your PC down and Connect it up again and see if Disc Management can then see it . . .       
        </p>

<h3> iitny  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB4088875 Issue</h2>
                    <p>After releasing the KB4088875 update to the computers we manage we had 4 computers that we found so far that have no network connection. Performing a rollback does get these computers functioning properly, but I found it odd that it not only caused windows
 to not connect to the network but it also causes our&nbsp;Intel vPro to be inaccessible&nbsp;from the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All our computers are running Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>Various models all from HP</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is anyone else seeing this issue?</p>

    <title>Problems with Windows 10 &#38; Family Safety - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mommax3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Windows 10 &#38; Family Safety</h2>
                    <p>No activity reporting for my son on his laptop, running Windows 10 &amp; Edge. Activity reporting working fine for all kids' accounts when they use desktop running Windows 8 &amp; any browser (IE, Firfox, Chrome).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed, uninstalled &amp; reinstalled son's account &amp; problem persists. I've removed family safety data from laptop as suggested by Microsoft engineer, no change. I've been patient &amp; waited for the activity reporting to "catch up" as suggested by another
 Microsoft engineer. Problem persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been MONTHS &amp; I only have problems tracking from Windows 10. We intentionally switched to use Edge so the tracking would work. We don't even have other browsers installed on my son's computer. BUT.. The desktop that still runs Windiws 8 does report
 my son's &amp; daughters' activity on that computer with any browser they use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Windows 10 problem. I HATE windows 10 &amp; wish I NEVER upgraded (oh.. &amp; NONE of the solutions offered have made any difference).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a loyal Microsoft user since I switched over from DOS eons ago. But APPLE is looking pretty sweet right now!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>CAN ANYONE HELP??? &nbsp;Or should I trade in the Windows laptop for a Chromebook or Mac Air?????</p>

<ul>
<li>Sync&nbsp;the settings on both the Family Safety website &amp; on&nbsp;the local computer (via the "Manage settings in Family Safety website" link in the Family Safety on Control Panel).<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Mommax3,</p>
<p>I'm sorry that you had such a poor support experience so far. The most common cause of this issue in Windows 10 is that your child's account needs to be re-verified on their device. You can do this by having your child sign in to their device, going to Settings
 &gt; Accounts, and following the prompts to verify the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>
        </p>
