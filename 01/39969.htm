 and would you know it they came right on.</em>&nbsp;Once I get the speakers working they&nbsp; don't fail.&nbsp; Shut the system down for the night almost every morning I have a mute x in the lower right corner.&nbsp; Click on it and it says no speakers or headphones are pluggerd
 in.&nbsp; I think it is in the shut down or start up .

            Hi Joshua,<br />
<br />
The N and KN editions include the same functionality as Windows 10 editions, except for Windows Media Player and related technologies. We recommend downloading the
<strong>Media Feature Pack for N and KN versions of Windows 10 </strong>to install Windows Media player. Click this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>to download Media Feature Pack.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community where you can find all the answers related to Windows!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description provided, it looks like you get the file not found when the computer starts up. However, we need some more information about this issue to assist you better. Please help me answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How are you trying to run “scanregw.exe<b><span>”?</span></b></p>
<p>2. Why do you want to run the Windows Registry Checker tool?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Setup runs the <strong>Windows Registry Checker</strong> tool to verify the integrity of the existing registry before it performs an upgrade. If it detects registry damage, it tries to fix it automatically.</p>
<p><br />
The protected-mode version of the<strong> Windows Registry Checker tool (Scanregw.exe)</strong> can create a backup of the system files and scan the registry for invalid entries. If invalid entries are detected, it refers to the real-mode version of the Windows
 Registry Checker tool (Scanreg.exe) for a resolution.<br />
<br />
You can configure Windows Registry Checker with a Scanreg.ini file. Settings that you can configure include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Enabling or disabling the tool</p>
<p>b. The number of backups maintained (no more than five is recommended)</p>
<p>c. The location of the backup folder</p>
<p>d. Settings to add additional files to the backup set</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps which would help to fix this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to run the Windows Registry Checker tool using a command prompt:</p>
<p>a. Click <b>Start</b>, type “<b>cmd”</b> in the start search box.</p>
<p>b. Right click on “<b>cmd”</b> and select “<b>run as administrator”.</b></p>
<p>c. Copy or type </p>
<p><b><span>scanreg.exe /backup</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are some descriptions of switches that can be used with the </span>
Windows Registry Checker tool<span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The following table lists each command-line switch and its description:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Switch<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Description</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>/autoscan <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Automatically scans the registry and backs it up</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>without displaying any prompts if there is no</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>backup for that date.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>/opt<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The /opt command-line switch causes the</span></p>

<span>
<p><br />
The Registry Scan Results dialog box appears only when you use the Scanregw.exe command without any command-line switches. If no registry errors are found when you run Scanregw.exe, you are prompted to create a backup copy of your current registry.<br />
<br />
The "/comment=&lt;text&gt;" switch can be used by itself or with the /backup switch. For example, you can type either of the following lines at a command prompt:<br />
<br />
</p>
</span><b><span>scanreg.exe "/comment=this is a registry backup" </span></b><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><b><span>scanreg.exe /backup "/comment=this is a registry backup"</span></b><span><br />
<br />
The first command line starts the Registry Checker tool graphical user interface (GUI) and prompts you to create a registry backup. The second command line creates a backup copy of your registry and adds your comment without starting the Registry Checker tool
 GUI.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

It means that it's not there. I should know, I have the same problem right now.<br />
<br />
Apparently Microsoft has pulled the plug on scanreg.exe and scanregw.exe. They have discontinued it since Windows Vista (or maybe even since XP, they don't say on their Knowledge Base website). And you are on Windows 7, right?<br />
<br />
The only question that remains is what's the alternative to it in Vista or 7, or in Windows 8? That's what
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/what-is-the-equivalent-of-scanregexe-in-windows/b8587207-463a-4c7f-a226-a7ed927085e1">
I would like to know</a>.<br />
<br />

It's funny how Microsoft has removed the Scanreg tool which was actually the only tool capable of making a true backup and restore of the Windows registry. And yet, they are
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
still telling people</a> to use the export and import options of Regedit as a way to "backup and restore" the registry! That's crazy talk! It's exactly this that brought me here today! You can see my other post
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/how-do-i-backup-and-restore-the-registry-in-vista/109ad810-2681-4cbd-8fe7-f27caea82962">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
<b>Don't ever use import and export in Regedit!</b> <b>It will kill your system!</b><br />
<br />
This is exactly what I have done 2 days ago. I exported all the root keys and hives using Export option in Regedit. It produced a massive file that's over 450 MB in size. One day later, in order to revert back the changes I have made the other day, I opened
 up Regedit and then the option Import and opened the 450 MB file. The progress bar showed up and at the end of the import I got a warning type of message (red icon with an x) telling me that not everything was imported.<br />
<br />
So I tried doing it in safe mode. I got the same message. I tried doing it in safe mode with command prompt and the Reg command. I got a new message. I booted back into Windows in normal mode. I had no sound! Windows Audio service didn't run. It depends on
 Windows Audio Endpoint Builder, RPC and Multimedia Class Scheduler. They were all running except for Endpoint Builder. I couldn't get it to start at all. I tried removing the dependency in registry. It didn't do anything. I tried running the sfc /scannow command
 and it failed and is now stuck with a pending repair that won't go away.<br />
<br />
This is why I am here today. I will never again in my life use Import and Export options of Regedit. Regardless of what Microsoft and other companies and tutorials and guides are saying. Windows registry changes all the time! And the Import option works by
 merging, so it doesn't really do a "restore" of the registry. It only kills it. By providing instructions to make keys and hives that have changes or that are no longer there, while also replacing (overwriting) the others that are already there. Exporting
 works fine, but what good is it if the import can make a system (and it's user) cry?!<br />
<br />
So from this day forward I will never use Import or Export option of Regedit, and I will advise others not to use it. This is not a backup and restore, like it used to be with the Scanreg tool. The old Windows systems had a different format for Reg files also,
 and it was a different architecture, I know. But to use Regedit as a replacement? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
There needs to be a way to backup current registry "state" and restore it if needed, but I think Microsoft has yet to come up with a tool for that. And Regedit is not it. And they should know better, and stop giving possibly dangerous instructions on their
 Microsoft Support website to new users, instructions that can possibly kill a system and force people to re-install Windows. I'm probably facing a re-install myself. I will try a repair install first, before I do a clean install.<br />

<p>With 45 years of software and hardware design, I KNOW that the registry gets corrupted by boot up operations and malware.&nbsp; By chance, I tried to put in the beta Win 10.&nbsp; After 2 hours it would not install.&nbsp; I clicked on remove installation.&nbsp; When the system
 returned to W 8.1, EVERY PROBLEM WAS FIXED and error messages disappeared.&nbsp; My 3 year old Toshiba laptop ran faster and better then my new ASUS.&nbsp; I am sure that this was caused by the uninstall putting in a new (clean?) registry back.&nbsp; But I asked for an opinion
 on this but got nothing from Microsoft (as usual).&nbsp; It is terrible when things can be repaired but no one cares.&nbsp; This is evident with the removal of scanregw.exe from Win 8 and 8.1</p>

don't have scanregw.exe on my pc windows says file not found
<p>or it is a dumb computer answer it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows 7 Enterprise doesn't have it either, I google and I got to this forum of Microsoft, and It didn't have a correct answer (?) What is this Forum for then? an empty Museum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really believe what someone wrote above, Microsoft might silently remove scanreg (maybe following Macintosh idea: don't let user do anything and mess up with the SysOp, IDK). &nbsp;The result? many thrid party offering 'install' a version of the scanreg (??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find nothing related in the 3 first pages of google search, I gave up. &nbsp; : /</p>

<p>I have to run scanreg.exe&nbsp; to check and fix registry&nbsp; issues. But when I open cmd as administrator and enter the command "scanreg.exe /fix" it displays "scanreg.exe is not recognized as an internal or external command,<br />

            <p>I guess the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "expert" does not know that there is no scanreg.exe or scanregw.exe in Windows 7 and that also tells us that the alleged "expert" has not tried their own advice and ideas to "check if it helps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder how these Microsoft responders get to be designated as "experts".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those registry scanning programs were only offered in the following versions of Windows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition</li><li>Microsoft Windows 98 Standard Edition (and their dev kit)<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>That means you will not find them on any Windows 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer alleged "expert" not know that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you should do instead is start a new question/topic/thread of your own describing the Windows 7 issues(s) and system problem symptoms you are having and why you think some registry scanning program is going to fix things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then somebody that actually knows how Windows works will help you resolve the issue.</p>

I would suggest you to perform clean boot and then try to uninstall and re-install the game.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps mentioned in the following article.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <span>
“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting” </span>
to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t update Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My pc is having some stability problems. Using a Seagate tool I have verified that the hard drives don't have problems. I have used sfc/scannow, which reports that some system files are corrupt, but it cannot fix them. It does not say what then to do.</p>
<p>I was told to run an update/repair of Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool, but it fails with the message "This tool can't update your PC. The language or edition of the version of Windows that is currently installed on your PC isn't supported by this
 tool."</p>
<p>I find this weird.</p>
<p>My pc is a standard Intel NUC with 8 GB RAM.</p>
<p>My Windows version is 10 Pro English, fully updated to version 1803, OS build 17134.137.</p>
<p>I have no language packs installed - it's only plain English.</p>
<p>The only special thing is that the computer has no keyboard and screen connected, as it acts as a server. I am using RDP to operate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? I would prefer to be able to run the update using the MCT, as I would really like to save myself for the trouble of reinstalling everything from scratch. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi Kim.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the record, I've worked as a professional application programmer for 38 years, som I'm not exactly a newbie in this business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thorough answer. I have followed nearly all advices closely, except when it comes to more or less clean installs.</p>
<p>I'm still seeing sfc reporting corrupt system files, but I don't see any ways to repair them. The store that it compares the files against seems ok. The MCT still refuses to run an update of my Windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems that I'm having relates to creating and extracting various kinds of zip files - a procedure I use for extra backup purposes. The files may be rather big - from 1 to 55 GB. I have used WinZip version 9.0 for many years, and it has been very reliable,
 but unfortunately it doesn't support Unicode file names. In one case I saw a CRC error in a zipped file, and I decided that it was time to upgrade. I tried the newest versions of WinZip, 7Zip, Zipware, and even Windows' own compression, but they alle give
 some kind of problems, including sporadic CRC errors. Most weirdly, Windows itself refuses to extract a zip file that it has created itself... :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I have used SeaTools to check the drives (both the installed hybrid disc/SSD drive and a USB hard drive), but no problems were found. Most of the data on the disk is a 300 GB copy of what I have on my laptop pc, and it all compares 100 %. Hence
 there is absolutely no sign of failing disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps a new, clean install is necessary. Not nice. Especially not since it was a 100 % clean install from the beginning - there was nothing installed on the pc when I bought it - not even a disk ;-) And since it has acted as a backup server, almost no
 software has been installed and run on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can provide any more help, I would ask you to concentrate on the question why the Media Creation Tool refuses to run on my pc. Thanks in advance!</p>

            It explains in the Performance Checklist I gave you in Step 10 how to repair broken System Files by running SFC up to three separate times, confirming the image it draws from is correct or else repairing it first, then if it still cannot repair the files in 3 separate attempts, do a Repair Install:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows...</a>

<p>Thanks, but this is apparently an unusually difficult case.</p>
<p>I re-installed Windows in-place using the ISO file, but the first time I used Zipware the was as shown :-(</p>
<p>Now I am i doubt whether even a clean re-install will help. Perhaps Zipware has been haunted...<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aca9eac9-06fa-4460-a295-44ed2ab85ad8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aca9eac9-06fa-4460-a295-44ed2ab85ad8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running a new sfc to see whether it still reports corrupt system files.</p>

            Better to mount the ISO by clicking on it, then right clicking Setup to Run as Admin.  
<br />
<br />However if nothing else helps I could Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>I did run the ISO as Admin.</p>
<p>SFC no longer reports corrupt system files, so I'm not sure if I believe that a clean install will do any better.</p>
<p>Perhaps Zipware is just as much crap as a lot of other software.</p>

<p>Sorry, I may not have made myself clear. Of course I didn't zip the ISO file.</p>
<p>After I had run the re-install using the ISO file exactly as described I tested whether my Zipware problems had disappeared by zipping, testing, and unzipping a pile of data that has nothing to do with Windows or the ISO file.</p>
<p>Unfortunately still problems with zip files - as shown. Both when using Zipware, 7-Zip, and WinZip v22. Only old WinZip 9 seems reasonably stable.</p>

            Got it.  I thought you were unzipping the ISO using zipware.  
<br />
<br />I use 7Zip and have never had a problem.  But I haven't tried it with Unicode so maybe that's a question to ask at TechNet of the IT pros there at our sister forums:  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-...</a>

<p>Thanks, I may try that. AFAIK Zipware uses the same engine as 7-Zip, and I have also seen problems with that one.</p>
<p>However, the pc has frozen completely or rebooted without reason 3-4 times, so it's definitely time to a clean install.</p>
<p>And a new pc if that doesn't help :-(</p>

<h2>            Windows 7, 32bit, ATI Radeon 7200 Series video board driver.</h2>
                    
<p>Traversing from Windows XP 32bit to Windows 7 32bit my ATI Radeon 7200 video board went from 1280x1024 to 1024x768. I reviewed the drivers on each system and found that under XP I had a Radeon driver but under Windows 7 it is a Microsoft driver. Anyone find
 a Windows 7, 32bit Radeon 7200 driver that will run at 1280x1024?<br />
<br />
Thanks, Tod</p>

            The latest driver for the Radeon 7200 is the 6.11 <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/radeon-prer300-xp.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/Pages/radeon-prer300-xp.aspx</a>&nbsp;and was for XP. There are no drivers for either Vista or Windows 7.<br />

You need a new graphics card.

<p>To me they are bad. &nbsp;Use to like the series but do not any more. &nbsp;Played the game tonight with my son and every match was messed up. &nbsp;We would leave only to be put in another. &nbsp;Last match there was a guy with unlimited grenade launcher ammo. &nbsp;He was just
 lobbing it onto people from across the map. &nbsp;And then he killed me with a missile strike that hit outside the building I was in. &nbsp;I was on the other side of the building at that.</p>
<p>This is not to mention the other horrible gameplay elements. &nbsp;One of which is the lack of polish. &nbsp;When I get a kill with a scar-h by turning around and hitting the other player with one bullet in the azz that is bad. &nbsp;So many things that needed some work.
 &nbsp;And Black OPS is no better.</p>

<p>no, every COD past 3 (which includes COD4) has been subpar to both COD 2 and 3. &nbsp;COD 4 was average at best, and didnt do anything new. &nbsp;Its popular because it went into the modern era in a time when WWII games were on the market, and only had Halo 3 to compete
 with. &nbsp;Plus it was a game that was easy to pick up and do well in. &nbsp;Its not deserving of all the hype it got, nor was it revolutionary in anyway nor did it raise the FPS bar at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, each and every COD game has been like that. &nbsp;Same engine, same graphics, same OP perks and computers, only difference is that it started to go downhill, and fast. &nbsp;WaW was decent, similar to COD 4, but had a lot of problems that made it unplayable.
 &nbsp;MW 2 had even more and saw how many hackers and modders, and brought out the worst in the community. &nbsp;BO is following, they did improve a few things from MW 2, but using the same engine for the 4th time in a row has made the gameplay old and stale. &nbsp;MW 3
 will no doubt be more of the repetitive shovelware. &nbsp;Not to mention all of the other bugs, glitches, and broken parts of the game that havent been fixed since COD 4 or even before.</p>

<p>Wow kramer. When you talk about what game is better, it's only on opinion, right? &nbsp;In my opinion they have been getting better, so that makes what you are saying about what is going down hill not a fact. Just checking to see if you understand this. &nbsp;I wasn't
 going to let you troll me out of this dive of a forum. You can get people to troll me all you like. But the fact of the matter is I am here to talk about a new game that is about to come out, and all you do (imo) is trash it, yet I am the unwelcome one here.
 &nbsp;We get you don't like the game. Go tell them that in the bf forum oh wait no one is over there..</p>

<p>Everything I say about which game is better is opinion, however I can offer facts about whats broken within COD, whats being improved on in BF, and can judge MW 3 off the fact that every COD since 4 has used the same engine, and has the same problems. &nbsp;And
 I dont get people to troll you. &nbsp;If anything youre the one trolling. &nbsp;People "attack" you because you provoke them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>See unlike you, some of us have been playing COD since the PS2 days, and we have something to compare it to, while most compare each and every COD game to either COD 4, or their first COD game after than.&nbsp; Me, and many others have seen the ups and downs
 of the series.&nbsp; Many of the things in COD now, and been implemented in 4, arent new.&nbsp; A lot of them were from COD 3, which implemented them better.&nbsp; Want an example, host migration.&nbsp; BO host migration is terrible.&nbsp; Host can just dashboard and the lobby closes.&nbsp;
 Its an annoyance, and interrupts the game.&nbsp; Now, in COD 3, host migration was worked almost flawlessly.&nbsp; Everyone as technically the host, but it had to have some person be the one that started the lobby, picked the map and game mode.&nbsp; Now if he left, or dashboarded,
 the lobby wouldnt close, nor would the game stop, the game would keep going, and someone new was found in an instant.&nbsp; Now, which sounds better the former or the latter?</p>

<p>Just because you have played them since way back whenever, it doesn't give you the right to put people down who enjoy is &nbsp;game and what it has evolved into today. &nbsp; And to sit there and tell anyone who will reply to you about how long you been with cod,
 what you think of it now, and what you think of the people who play it today, is kind of Dbaggy, IMO. And that is cause you rinse and repeat your message. I speak for the human race when I say "we get it"</p>

            I was having the same issue when trying to upgrade to 10 from a USB. Try doing the upgrade through Windows Update and see if that helps. &nbsp;I tried every suggestion I could find online regarding that same error and nothing worked. &nbsp;I tried reinstalling maybe
 10 times and gave up. &nbsp;I let Windows Update do the upgrade and it worked the first time flawlessly.

            Ditto, not helpful at all. All I ever get is a cursor-less black screen mid upgrade. Then when I restart the computer it reverts back to Windows 7.

            I too am having this issue. Trying to update a Dell Latitude E4300 laptop [currently running Windows 7 home 64bit] using a Win 10 ISO created using the media creator tool 2 weeks ago. Running only Windows Defender as anti-virus and no peripherals connected.

            <p>Hello, having this same issue on a HP 2000 Notebook. Called Microsoft several times with no resolve and given a new case ID#. Attempted to utilize the Microsoft Media Creation Tool as instructed to update and/or fix issues. Still no resolve. Finally given
 an error code message saying, ""We could not install Windows 10. We've set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 10. 0xC1900101-0x30017 The installation failed in the FIRST_BOOT phase with an error during BOOT operation".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Made some attempts to figure out why this continues to occur. Have not found a resolution as of yet. Microsoft said contact the manufacturer then call back...due to the laptop being an older model the updates continue to render necessary operability drivers
 useless causing the system to become unstable in operability once certain updates have installed on completion. This is not good on Windows 10 as y laptop works fine if it's not on Windows 10. However, due to the free upgraded version of Windows 10, one cannot
 turn off auto-updates nor revert back to Windows 7 due to being forced to do a fresh install and losing everything on my laptop because it would not boot at all after a patch update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can honestly say, I am really mad with Bill Gates for this foolishness because this is one of my work laptops that now partially functions and will shut down and go into a blue screen whenever it feels like it, not to mention sometimes it just loads to
 a black screen and just gets stuck sitting there forcing me to reset the entire laptop.</p>

<p>I have the same issue, I have tried everything that has been posted here and everywhere else about getting Windows Update 1709 to install and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep ending up with these messages -</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Stopcode: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"0xC1900101 - 0x30017 The installation failed in the first_boot phase with and error during boot operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I am back to version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Windows Update goes and downloads the whole damn thing all over again, it's like your programmers are fans of Groundhog Day or something. How much data is being used by this endless re-downloading of an update that doesn't update!! I only have a limited
 amount of data per month and this thing has had like 30 plus attempts already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done your clean boots and your Windows Update Assistants your Command Prompt scans your deleting of previous downloads and renaming things to 'old' and your bootable USB's... which I might add when I try to install from the bootable USB as per the
 instructions on your website it then goes on to say "The upgrade option isn't available if you start your computer using Windows installation media" !!?&nbsp; So I then go into Windows and try to run it from the USB ... HOURS later I get the same error messages
 as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my Event Viewer for error messages, there were lots of errors saying 'DCOM got error "1503" attempting to start the service Bluetooth Device Monitor with arguments "Unavailable". It then goes on to say "Faulting Application name: devmonsrv.exe
 Exception Code: 0xc0000005"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the problem? What is it and how do I fix it? Will Windows Update work when this is fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway I switched Bluetooth back on (which I had switched off cause I don't really use it) and 'removed' all devices that had previously used it... didn't help! Didn't stop the Bluetooth error messages in Event Viewer either...!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in Event Viewer is one warning about 'HP Client Services' but it doesn't say what it is other than "Unknown service request received."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And several warnings about "CVHSVC.EXE client virtualization handler" ... Should I be enabling Virtualization Technology in the BIOS? Or is this an unrelated thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Event Viewer/setup there is lots of these "Windows Update could not be installed because of error 2149842967" but searching that term takes me back to the error messages I have at the top of this rant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no choice now but to switch off Windows Update (another Command Prompt thing!). You do realise that ordinary people use your software? Not Microsoft Certified Programmers! How can you release a major update that causes so many issues that people can't
 fix? Or are you trying to enforce mass redundancy or something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would welcome any suggestion that works, please don't say Windows Update Troubleshooter....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

<h2>            Recording Skype calls whilst playing video</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am recording some Skype calls and I am hoping to record responses to a video that they will be watching from the same device as the call. Is there a way/programme to record the person's voice so it is clean audio?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Aisha
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Skype itself can record both the audio and video. I have done Skype interviews and the interviewer used Skype. Ultimately, it depends on the Mic quality.
<br />
<br />When you record a video, it is saved to your Video folder as a MP4 file.
<br />
<br />You can use the free VLC Player to extract the audio from it.
<br />
<br />See steps:

<br />You can use Group Policy to block automatic updates. This ensures updates are downloaded/installed only when you want them:

            You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select “Run as Administrator”

            Hi Dillon.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can set Active hours in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />But many are resorting to turning off automatic Updates by setting a Metered Connection: <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you can turn them back on when you want to install Updates for a day or two.
<br />
<br />There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
<span>You can also try to run program in compatibility mode. Use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually,
 use the individual program's Compatibility tab.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If changing the settings does not fix the problem, go to the program manufacturer's website to see if there is an update for the program.<br />

    <title>Using a program to open email attachments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickherrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a program to open email attachments</h2>
                    Every once in awhile, when I receive a email attachment, and I try to open the attachment, I get the message "windows can't open the file". When I try and look at whats available to possibly open the file, I'm frankly confused. I just don't know what procedure
 or program I should use. I don't recognize or use any of the programs that windows list's to use. Can someone help and explain how I can open a email that evidently needs something extra to open and view? I only get that message pertaining to opening a email
 some times, not all the time. Thank you

<p>The reason you only get the message some of the time is that you get different kinds of attachments. File types are identified by their extension--the 3 or 4 characters at the end of their file name, after the dot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open an attachment, you have an appropriate program installed for that type of file. So, here are a few examples:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A .doc or .docx file requires Microsoft Word, or some compatible program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; An .xls or .xlsx file requires Microsoft Excel, or some compatible program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A .wpd file requires WordPerfect or some compatible program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A .pdf file requires a pdf reader, (of which there are several).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at least some of the time, you apparently get attachments for which you don't have an appropriate program installed. Tell us the extensions of those attachment's names, and I or someone else here can tell you what program you need to install to open it.</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your reply. Being I am not well versed in computer knowledge I will do my best to explain my situation. First, the answer your question, the attachment I couldn't open had d.doc at the end. I really didn't see a file name other than it said
 agenda. And, agenda was the content that was in the attachment. Was or is the content that is in the attachment the file name?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to give you more possible email attachments I couldn't open but, I tend to delete those emails after awhile and being frustrated at how to figure out how do create a program to do so. I try to keep as few as programs as possible in my computer
 as to not slow it down. If in fact that can slow it down? When I see all the options that can be used, (a program to open attachments) I just don't know which one to pick frankly. Didn't know by looking at the end of the attachment wording I could maybe associate
 what program to obtain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, now that I know at least one attachment had d.doc, and it was initiated by Microsoft Word, I guess that is a place to start. Can you please help me and explain how I get Microsoft Word to work, Ken? I appreciate your help and patience, Thank you.
</p>

<p>You're welcome. Glad to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the attachment's file name ended in .doc, it's a Microsoft Word file. The reason you couldn't open it is that you presumably don't have Word installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't *get* Word to work unless you have it installed.&nbsp; It doesn't come with Windows; you have to buy it, either by itself or as part of Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to spend the money for Word (and you probably shouldn't, just to open a few attachments), there are several programs that are largely compatible with it that you could use to open the attachments. Two good choices, both free, are LibreOffice
 (https://www.libreoffice.org) and OpenOffice (https://www.openoffice.org/). </p>
<p>
</p><p>You say "I would like to give you more possible email attachments I couldn't open but, I tend to delete those emails after awhile and being frustrated at how to figure out how do create a program to do so." Post back in the future when you get those attachments,
 and I or someone else here will help you with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also say "I try to keep as few as programs as possible in my computer as to not slow it down. If in fact that can slow it down? " No, what you have *installed* won't slow the computer down. What you have *running* may slow it down, but even that isn't
 always true.</p>

 you Ken for your reply. You'll have to bear with me on my screen shots as I seldom use them and therefore they may look weird? But, the first screen shot is the box that appears when I try and open the attachment. I click open. I then get the second box and
 I show the screen shot of it. You can see the options I am given. </a></p>

 open the attachments that were sent with it. </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I do agree with you Ken, that as little as I use Word, I shouldn't have to pay for it. So, if I do in fact have to pay for Word to open email attachments and there are alternatives that require no fee, I will employ those free alternatives.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking at the screen shots Ken, and being I receive them via email, which alternative do you suggest? I certainly do appreciate your help and hopefully patience, Ken. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>You're welcome. Glad to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your screen shots are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The popup window is telling you that there is no program installed that it knows can open .doc files. So Windows doesn't know what to open them with, and is asking you to tell it what program to use. Since you don't have an appropriate program installed,
 you don't have a good answer to that question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you download and install LibreOffice (https://www.libreoffice.org). When you&nbsp; install it, it will get associated with .doc files, so when you click on a .doc attachment, it should automatically open so you can view the attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have problems after installing it, post back to explain them. And if you get other kinds of attachments you can't open. post back identifying what their extension is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware that although Libre Office can open (and also to be used to create, if you want or need to) .doc files. it is not 100% compatible with Microsoft Word. However its incompatibilities are few, and they are usually minor. So there's a good chance you'll
 never run into any of its incompatibilities. Although I don't personally use it, many people find it perfectly satisfactory.</p>

<p>The following is probably more information than you need to know, but ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Ken explained, files that end with .doc are Microsoft Word files.&nbsp; More specifically, they are files in the format used by Microsoft Word 97 through Microsoft Word 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with Word 2007, Microsoft changed the default format for Word files and used the file name extension .docx (although newer versions of Word can still view, edit, and create files in the old .doc format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft used to provide -- for free -- a small program that could open and view .doc files.&nbsp; This was called the Microsoft Word Viewer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Microsoft decided to "retire" this program last November.&nbsp; See
</p>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/891090/how-to-obtain-the-latest-word-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/891090/how-to-obtain-the-latest-word-viewer</a>
<p>
</p><p>You can still obtain a copy of the last version of Microsoft Word Viewer from third-party sites:&nbsp;
<a href="https://filehippo.com/download_word_viewer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://filehippo.com/download_word_viewer/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If all you are interested in is viewing and printing -- rather than editing or creating -- .doc files, you may want to use Word Viewer rather than either LibreOffice or OpenOffice.&nbsp; Word Viewer is a much smaller program than these other programs, which actually
 are "suites" incorporating equivalents to Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and other MS Office applications.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get attachments that are in the newer Word format (.docx), you'll also need to download and install the "Compatibility Pack," also free from Microsoft,
<strong>but only available directly from Microsoft until sometime next month</strong>:&nbsp;

<p>See LemP's reply also. Yes, the Word Viewer is another choice and I neglected to mention it. But I still recommend LibreOffice instead of it, for two reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It's compatible not only with Word files, but, because it's a suite, also with Excel files, etc. Even if you're not getting any Excel attachments now, you may get some at some time in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You may not be interested in creating or editing such files now, but who knows what tomorrow ill bring. It should be of value to have some something installed that lets you do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just in the interest of being more complete, I'll mention still another alternative. Corel WordPerfect is a third-party word processor that is also highly (but not perfectly) compatible with Word. Even though it's much less popular than Word, I personally&nbsp;
 greatly prefer it to Microsoft Word, and that's what I use. It's not free and has to be bought, so my guess is that you won't want to buy it, and just for attachments, you'd prefer something that's free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are undoubtedly other third-party programs that are compatible and would work for you, but&nbsp; none come to mind. If you add Lem's recommendation to mine, I think we've covered all the major alternatives.</p>

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your reply. I see there are options. I chose to use your recommendation, https://www.libreoffice.org. I will see how it performs when opening an email attachment going forward. It now may be also that I will need to create a text summary
 for other email clients using Word. Not sure how that will work out, as I haven't done something like that before.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Will I be able to use libreoffice to create, or write a letter format email attachment? Thank you for your help, Ken.</p>

<p>Bom, não sei o que ta acontecendo com o meu Xbox....minha internet funciona perfeitamente no meu computador, quando eu ligo o Xbox ele conecta em segundos na LIVE, mas quando tento jogar o Multiplayer do Call of Duty MW 2, não da! Eu entro no modo Team Deathmatch
 e ele simplesmente fica procurando e procurando e procurando uma sala e nunca acha nada ! Se tiver sorte depois de vários minutos, quase horas procurando, ele entra numa que praticamente não funciona! É muito estranho, porque quando peço para os meus amigos
 me chamarem para a sala deles, eles me chamam e eu consigo jogar normalmente, mas quando eu procuro uma sala não tem jeito de achar, o que pode ser? Por favor me ajudeeem!!!!</p>

<strong>Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapter.</strong></p>
<p>According to Network and Sharing centre as well as device manager both devices are enabled and working properly. I can connect to my home network (ADSL) via wifi but when I open a browser any page (even that used to interface with the router[10.0.0.2]) spends
 30 seconds or so loading and then returns 'this webpage is not available'. I have tested this in Chrome as well as IE.</p>
<ul>
<li>The network icon in the tray says I am connected to my home network and have internet access.</li><li>I attempted to connect to the same network via LAN cable, I achieved limited connectivity and otherwise the same results as with Wifi.</li><li>All other devices function perfectly using this network.</li><li>I even created a mobile Wifi hotspot with my phone, that too got limited connectivity.</li><li>I have also uninstalled and re-installed the drivers of both devices repeadtedly and disabled and enabled each several times.
</li><li>I have forgotten the network and re-entered the passkey.</li><li>I have run anti-virus scans, no result(AVG 2014).</li><li>I have power-cycled the machine numerous times.</li><li>I have also run ipconfig /all via cmd, everything seems fine.</li><li>All to no effect.</li></ul>
<p>The only strange thing is that the wireless indicator light is orange not blue as it should be. However nowhere does it state that the device is disabled, pressing Fn + f3 (the shortcut to enable/disable wireless) has no effect(I attempted doing this using
 an on screen keyboard, still had no effect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>

            <p>With regard to any <strong>changes</strong> made, I am not entirely sure... I may have
<strong>up</strong><strong>dated from 8 to 8.1(Windows)</strong>, although I am not sure with which version it came. Otherwise no changes beyond software installation etc.</p>
<p>Also I must state that when connected to the Wifi via the wireless adapter, <strong>
I do not have limited connectivity</strong>, simply no real connection(although all status indicators say I do), as I said, page loads for 30 secs then displays 'this webpage is not available'.</p>
<p>I attempted the <strong>first method</strong> provided with the result: <em>problem with the adapter or access point(not fixed)</em> as well as
<em>Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource is not responding(detected).</em></p>
<p>With regard to the <strong>second method</strong>: I did as said with the properties of the wireless adapter, to no effect(same results).</p>
<p>Also the wifi indicator light on the front of the laptop is still orange.</p>

<p>It is free, for those who already bought Pinball FX (the first one). It was offered this way 'cause Pinball FX2 is just an updated version of the first game letting you bring the pinball tables you had in Pinball FX1, sorta. Still totally worth the price
 though as its one of the best pinball games out there and it has lots of different tables you can play on (provided you D/L'd the expansion tables) IMO.</p>

                    I understand if I change the motherboard or maybe the hard disk that Windows 10 will not re-activate the free upgrade. But will the same happen if I upgrade the processor?

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you replacing the processor?</p>
<p>Are you replacing the motherboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you make any meaningful changes like change your hard drive or graphic cards to your device, then you will have to activate Windows 10 by phone activation method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the License key will be integrated to the motherboard, if you replace your motherboard to the new one, you will have to activate previous version on Windows i.e. Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1, if it is a genuine copy along with the activation key, and
 then upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the method below to activate Windows 10 by phone activation method.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open run command by pressing

    <title>Windows 10 1803 update no sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uncle cornflakes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1803 update no sound</h2>
                    <p>So after updating my computer to Win10 Version 1803 Build 17134.137, I no longer have sound.&nbsp;<br />
I am currently running a SoundBlaster X AE-5 soundcard. Device Manager and everything on the computer says everything is working properly, but hardware seems to disagree.
</p>
<p>Tested headphones on a known good device. Works. Tested sound card on a known good, yet older device that's still running the old 1709 version (I use this as a diagnostics machine) , and it works. So no hardware issues.<br />
I return everything to the primary machine and uninstall and reinstall the drivers with the most up-to date driver (driver release was 25JUNE2018) and anything associated with the sound card. Restart the computer a few times. Nothing<br />
Recheck device manager. Found "Device not migrated" with the following information,<br />
</p>
<div>Device SWD\MMDEVAPI\{0.0.0.00000000}.{abda93c9-9882-487e-a1f2-b918bc84bba3} was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.</div>

<p>Last Device Instance Id: SWD\MMDEVAPI\{0.0.1.00000000}.{8b416ead-4fbd-4bc5-8e49-cf096de923f9}<br />

Location Path: <br />
Migration Rank: 0xF00000000000F120<br />
Present: false<br />
Status: 0xC0000719</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opened the Command prompt and ran a sfc /scannow, after it was done, I restarted my computer and still nothing.</p>
</div>
<p>I am at a loss right now. Please help, I'm desperate.</p>

    <title>blue screen, stop code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ariachiodo  say:</h3>
<h2>            blue screen, stop code</h2>
                    My laptop keeps restarting with a blue screen. Stop code: critical structure corruption (which is BSOD error code 0x00000109), and it says what failed: tcpip.sys. The lifewire site said it means a kernel code or data corruption. Anyone know how to fix
 this? I have not added any hardware or downloaded anything recently that I can think of, and everything's up to date.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Aria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why this error may occur. It might be caused by memory corruption, damaged hard drive, corrupted system files, driver conflicts, virus or other security threats, corrupted Windows registry entries, or corrupted device drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to resolve the issue, we suggest that you follow the troubleshooting steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. It contains a guided walkthrough on how to fix blue screen errors in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</p>

            Also, it&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            Thanks, I went through these steps, and nothing seemed to make a difference, until I restarted in safe mode, and the blue screen has not happened in safe mode. I now need further instructions of what to do in safe mode. I am unable to get online on my
 laptopn in safe mode (even though I did select safe mode with network), so I need next instructions for troubleshooting in safe mode without online access.&nbsp;

            Hi thx for answering.
<div><br />
<div>Yes about a year ago I increased my RAM by 4GB so now its 8GB of RAM.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've already removed one stick and it still just shuts down by itself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No error message pops up I have to manually go to event viewer and look at the problem itself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>here's the&nbsp;latest&nbsp;one.Just happened a few hours ago.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."</div>

            <p><span>Here are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system
 errors and warnings, even if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving application problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting
 the earlier errors can resolve later ones.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution.
 Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes
 System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side
 of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to
 click a second time to see the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the
 Details tab and check the box before XML View. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports
 that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports.
 Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on
 the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>
