    <title>Issues while installing Apple Updates. System Error The program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues while installing Apple Updates. System Error  The program can&#39;t start because MSVCR80.dll is missing from your computer. &#34;</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original Title:I'm a computer beginner, could someone explain/direct me?&nbsp; Much thanks, Mark</u></strong></p>
<p>Recently I got a normal Apple Update to I-tunes. &nbsp;Have done a few before, never with a problem. &nbsp;This time, it seemed all was fine, then at the end (when expecting a "successfully installed" message, I received &nbsp;an error box with this: APS Daemon.exe - System
 Error &nbsp;The program can't start because MSVCR80.dll is missing from your computer. &nbsp;Try re-installing the program to fix this problem." &nbsp;Well, since nothing else seemed to working (or helping) and my music files were backed up, I uninstalled I-Tunes successfully,
 then attempted to re-install. &nbsp;I had to download the install from Apple, which was fine. Once again, everything seemed to be going smoothly, the installation, etc. until it got to the point when it said "Starting Services." &nbsp;Then, as before - everything stopped
 and up popped the exact same APS Daemon.exe - System Error box (with the same message) referencing MSVCR80.dll again, saying it is missing and to try re-installing the program. &nbsp;So as of now, I'm not sure exactly what this means (I know, I know) or if it's
 something someone like I could fix (or even try), or if I should just run it down to my local computer shop? &nbsp; Never had any problems with updates from Apple or Windows before this one.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox One Cons - Controller is the Worst - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pr0asis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Cons - Controller is the Worst</h2>
                    
<p>I was one of the very few people who was actually very excited for the XB1 before it came out, so many xbox fans were crying about it and saying this and that, but I was on my toes waiting for the day I get my hands on one. I finally got one and set it up,
 unfortunately I've found many more cons than I have pros, and this upsets me dearly especially since I'm a loyal Microsoft consumer and have been a fan to the xbox since the original came out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>. The GUI is hard to navigate, I literally had to look online on how to find certain things such as how to delete installed games, how to view achievements and much more to name. Of course you get used to it, which is why I let this one slide.</p>
<p>. The games and apps reserve a lot of space making one believe that the memory is eaten up quickly, and it does, Halo 5 is 60GB... in 2 days I've had more than half of my 1TB memory saying it's gone from the xbox menu from less than 5 games.</p>
<p>. Achievements from a 360 version of a game doesn't pass on to the XB1 version, meaning you have to do all the achievements again. Whilst it means more achievements, the majority of people who actually care about achievements 'achievement hunters' such as
 myself don't like repeating achievements, especially ones which took us hours to try to get.</p>
<p>Now I could keep going with this but what I really want to get down to is the most unforgivable problem I currently know, the controllers... Now you've heard it time and time again, the controllers are too sensitive, the analogue sticks are too loose, and
 it's been said by thousands and perhaps thought by millions. Many people have gotten used to it, but unfortunately we all have a specific game play style, some of us are NEVER going to get used to it because not only does it feel like our fingers are flying
 all over the place in comparison to 'real' xbox controllers, but also because we will always have in our minds that we cannot play with that lose feeling and so we never will (On the 360 I would always have low sensitivity setting in the game ON TOP of the
 weighted feel of the sticks), I'm a sniper lover on my FPS games so you can see why I'm upset, but even when using a spray and pray weapon I find it hard to shoot straight, even when setting it on the lowest sensitivity in the game. Nothing helps. And it ***
 me off, and MANY others off still after having the XB1 for over a year.</p>
<p>I've seen, heard, and personally asked customer support about the new elite console which apparently offers customisation of the controllers, but what really *** me off, AGAIN, is that in order to play the Xbox the way it should be intended in the first
 place, I have to pay more money on top of the $600 I paid for my console, just to get a new controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm extremely dissapointed in Microsoft. And so are many others, I even know some loyal xbox fans who moved on to the PS4 because of the controllers alone. I even hear that's why wannabe hacker groups attack Microsoft servers. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Is it always an requirement to say you've been a loyal fan for so and so years before criticising it? &nbsp;then finish by saying you have moved to the Playstation? Always find that an odd way to open with these kind of posts.
</p>
<p>But anyway, deleting games isn't that difficult, and I find the UI easy to navigate. The controller I love, I didn't think they could improve on the 360 controller but they have, and I've dropped it so many times I'm surprised it still works.

<p><span><span>lol... I stopped reading after I saw the word "loyal". I figured since there's no such thing as loyalty in retail, then the "problem" that followed was likely fiction as well.<br />

<p><span><span>Customers aren't loyal... they're either satisfied enough to keep buying a product and do just that, or they are not... and they go off and buy another manufacturer's offering.<br />

<p>my only complaint about the controller was that it felt cheap with the panels that flex if you squeeze them, but i was using my day one controller everyday for almost 2 years before i got my elite controller, and my day one controller still works perfectly
 with almost no signs of wear, with the 360, i was going through about 1 controller a year, thumb sticks wearing through and snapping, becoming very loose, bumpers not clicking anymore and so on.</p>
<p>other than that, navigating the dashboard just takes some time to figure out, just like anything else when dealing with technology, upgrading to a new version of Windows, moving from Windows to iSO, iSO to Android, trying to find the hazard lights button
 in a new cars....</p>
<p>it is what it is, being disappointed in a multi-billion dollar company is just wasted energy,

<p>Firstly I have never owned a PS4 in my life, and will never move on to the Sony, as I said I'm a loyal customer, meaning I buy the company brand products regularly, that if someone put up a poll asking to vote on Sony or Microsoft, that I would choose Microsoft
 without a second thought, with pride. You obviously don't understand common used words examples amongst customers and businessmen alike, wold u prefR me to yoos noob lango 4 u 2 understand?</p>
<p>You say that you the 'problem' that follows will most likely be fiction, and yet you completely misunderstand me in the few words you actually decided to read, therefore shouldn't someone think that you're a presumptuous tale-tell yourself eh'</p>
<p>For those of you who are confused, this post, and many others which begin from a customer with 'problem with features' are obviously opinion based posts, just like how many articles you read called 'top 10 best games' are based on opinion. I know that many
 people think that the Xbox one controller is a dream come true, that it adjusts well to their hands, but my point is that the Xbox has always been known for having weighted sticks, so by changing one small feature of the controller, they change the way someone
 plays, they completely forget that some people play games not only for the brand or story, but also for the feel. I never got into Sony because my thumbs would always fall off the rounded grips when I was sweaty, that never happened with the Xbox 360 or the
 Xbox Original. </p>
<p>The whole feel to the XB1 controller not including the sticks is unusual, and I'm sure I'll get used to it eventually, but I know for a fact that I will never get used to the sensitivity because back before the 360 came out, my sticks became loose EXACTLY
 the same as they feel for the XB1, and I would play halo 2 and other games pretty much every day for 4 years, I never got used to the sensitivity of that damned controller...</p>
<p>"If you want loyalty get a dog." This made me laugh, but also grunt, dogs are not loyal they're actually quite the opposite, they're dangerous, disgusting, unloyal creatures...want proof (<a href="http://www.whyihatedogs.com/ten-reasons-why-i-hate-dogs/comment-page-1/#comment-117578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.whyihatedogs.com/.../comment-page-1</a>)
 take a gander at all the comments on this site, everyone there has given proof time and time again as to why it's a 'fact' as to what I just said about dogs. If you're too lazy to do so then that's your own damned fault.</p>

<p>Well, I believe there are bad dogs out there, certainly, and not always because of a bad owner (although that's the case most of the time). Some dogs could be bad because of their inherit genetic traits - it simply wasn't bred out of them like many others.
 I know this, because of personal experience - not from a dog, but from a kitten of all things. You'd think that a kitten would be the nicest thing in the world, but alas' it's not true. My grandmother, who many knew as the nicest person they ever met, got
 a newborn kitten. This cute little thing turned out to be a monster - it scratched and bit at her and her legs time and time again and made her bleed frequently. Eventually it got so bad, we had to take the little thing to the vet and put it down for her own
 safety.</p>
<p>In the end, what's really important to remember is that it's still an animal, and animals can be unpredictable - just like us people.</p>
<p>On topic though, I find it rather quite laughable that the OP calls one of the best controllers around (by public opinion no less) 1 of the worst. :P</p>

                    When ever&nbsp;I&nbsp;plug in a HDMI cable to may laptop it will instantly shut down and is unable to reboot until the cable has been unplugged. i only purchased the laptop 4 months ago which when checking to see if anything was faulty the HDMI output was working
 fine; now it wont work. When looking on device manager i could not find a driver for the port (is there meant to be one) and i've tried to updating drivers but still the same problem.

            There is usually no driver listed for the HDMI driver.&nbsp; HDMI is a "high-end" video output and it is usually controlled by the video card.<br />

Try a different HDMI cable. &nbsp; Try a different TV.<br />
<br />
If the HDMI port still shuts down the laptop, you might need to take it to a service center.&nbsp; This could be a \ hardware problem.

    <title>Connecting a Lenovo USB monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jedin2331  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting a Lenovo USB monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to troubleshoot to get my external usb Lenovo monitor to work on my desktop, which seems to have stopped working right after I upgraded to Windows 10. Before on Windows 7, I was able to right click the monitor's display icon in the notification
 area and once I've hit "extend to", I'm able to extend my desktop. However, I can't seem to find this on Windows 10 and am not sure how I could go about fixing this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great if someone knew and could share tips on this issue. Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Authentication</h2>

Check this page for more details on FIM, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee652374.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
I recommend that you visit Microsoft Corp, and ask them about your<br />
issue, because, as far as I know, this shouldn’t be causing any issues, <br />
on your client side, since you aren’t connected to Microsoft Corp. </p>
<p>I hope this helps...<br />
<br />
If you need any further assistance, <br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.<br />

Have a nice day...<br />

            <p>Thank you or your reply. At this point, since I am no longer working or loging into Microsoft domain&nbsp;all I am trying to do is bypass the Windows 7 authentication setup and just login as a local administrator. Do you know of a fast way of doing that? I tried
 re-installing windows 7 but that did not help. If you have any ideas, you're welcome to email me at

<h2>            Windows Phone 10 Skype Install</h2>
                    So, I just upgraded my phone to Windows 10 because Skype stopped working for the older version.<br />
<br />
Once the update finished, I opened up the Skype app and it says "Get it now" So I click that and it takes me to the store, but the store says that I already have it installed. So I'm not able to use skype, any ideas?

            Same problem here. Just did a hard reset of my Lumia 950XL and I get Skype telling me to "get it now" then when I click that the store tells me to open the app, which takes me back to "get it now". Useless!

<p>Thanks for the mail and sorry to hear you’re having trouble. Unfortunately we weren’t involved in this promotion so there’s not much we can do directly from here, but we have raised it with the Xbox team and they’ve advised that if you still haven’t received your Xbox message with the Mercenary Pack code, you should head back to Xbox Support (at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/support/contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com</a>&nbsp;or on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/xboxsupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>) and they’ll be able to resolve it for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps and you get your code soon if you haven’t already!</p>
<p>So, who is going to sort this out?</p>

    <title>xBox 360 controller and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linkobee  say:</h3>
<h2>            xBox 360 controller and Windows 10</h2>
                    I just purchased an HP Omen with Windows 10. I've been assured that my xBox controller should work with it, and several games I use can only be used with a controller. My controller is USB&nbsp; and did not automatically install. I've searched everywhere for
 the driver, but I can only find one for Windows 7 which is not compatible with Windows 10 (I was assured by an MS rep that Windows 10 is fully backward compatible).&nbsp; When I use the compatible test, and go to find more information, I'm told to go to the manufacturer's
 website... which is also Microsoft...&nbsp;Please help! Where can I find the correct&nbsp; driver?

    <title>Windows performance index can not be obtained&#58;. The processor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob van rongen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows performance index can not be obtained&#58;. The processor performance can not be measured.</h2>
                    I put a new graphicscard (videocard) in my computer and wanted to see how the performance index had improved.&nbsp;
<div>However halfway the determination I get an errormessage : Windows performance index can not be obtained:. The processor performance can not be measured.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The result is I get no performance index&nbsp;</div>
<div>(the original message was in dutch, I translated it somehow.</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Have you tried to rerun the Performance Index? It needs a certain amount of data to perform its calculations and right after changing your GPU, it may not have had enough time to gather the data it needs to do the calculations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try, literally, playing some games, running table and charts, anything that'll generate graphics performance so Windows can generate the data it needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you fare.</p>

            I did rerun the performance index a lot of times, to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;(after removing system tweakings from ashampoo winoptimizer, and restoring standard system settings. )
<div>Your suggestions about playing games seem a good idea, I will try to play some.
<div>The graphics I often use is: &nbsp;Video editing with Pinnacle Studio 16. But I do not know if this adresses te videocard suffuciently. Also converting YouTube video's I use often. (for my hobby: astronomy)
<div>I must mention that just before I installed the new videocard I also tried to run the Performance index and then also I got the previously mentioned error message.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>Yes, it is important to know you had the same message show up before you changed video cards...it removes the video card as the culprit!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I hate to ask this, but as its on the same page as the Performance Index is, I must ask:&nbsp; is your copy of Windows activated? Or (potentially) worse, has it become deactivated? To check this go to Control Panel | System, and scroll down to the bottom
 of the page. Does it show that your copy is activated (it'll state those words and have the Genuine Microsoft sticker in the opposite corner)? Just a stray thought as I see people post questions on this site that "Windows no longer activated...Please Help";
 thought it worth checking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            My Wiundows 7 Professional, service pack 1 operating system is activated indeed: Product-id: 00371-OEM-9045377-47425 and the sticker is in the opposite corner.&nbsp;
<div>Ofcourse I know this because I did build the computer myself, the C: disk is an ssd disk. The computer is dual boot. The data HD is 2TB in 4 partitions The other operating system is Windows 8 also legitimate and also on a seperate ssd disk. . I mainly
 use Windows 7&nbsp;</div>
<div>Apart from the Performance Index problem I have second problem; There are 5 updates which always fail to install, these are: KB2778344; KB2807986: KB2790113; KB27906555; and KB2791765. All other updates install correct, only these 5 do not install, which
 means that when I close my computer, it is always tried to install those updates without success. And I have to wait !!! Therefore I used windowsupdate.diag.cab Without any success.</div>
<div>I have a system report made by Ashampoo Winoptimize 10 which I cannot &nbsp;include because attachments are impossibele here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;I tried Windows6.1KB947821-v26-x64.msu and MicrosoftFixit, but maybe those were for the update problem, I do not remember. (That's why I mention the update problem here.)</div>
<div>I must say that apart from the mentioned 2 problems Windows 7 works very fine and satisfactory</div>

            <p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>Well, it was worth checking about the activation issue. Glad that's not a problem. As to the update problem, let me suggest that you change your settings from automatic to manual, e.g., automatically check for updates, but download and install them manually,
 and any restart that may be required also be done manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel, Windows Update; then in the left hand column is a list of possible actions, select "Change settings". In the window that opens change the configuration from automatic actions to manual. You can always change it back later if you want,
 but I prefer to have Windows search automatically, but I control (manually decide) what and when to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will save you the hassle at shutdown, and I've found that on some particularly difficult installs doing them manually makes it easier to get them accepted by the machine. A case in point, I was trying to install an update that had failed numerous times,
 but doing it manually, the update loaded on the second attempt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of WinOptimizer, have you checked it for blocking the performance meter? I know it turns off some Windows functions without asking first (CD burning is a case in point), so you might want to check there for the cause. I in fact used to use WinOptimizer,
 but uninstalled it for that very reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if either of these two suggestions help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            1) The update problem is not over, but I do not have to wait for the &nbsp;unsuccessfull installing when I end my windows session. Why these 5 updates do not install is a riddle for me. I put of my Norton, also without succes. Also I tried to install them one
 by one, also unsuccesful.
<div>2) The performance index</div>
<div>I uninstalled Winoptimizer 10 and also a program named Winutilities. Moreover in Uniblue Speedup my pc I put off something that protects the processor against too much work.</div>
<div>But nothing helps. The performance index cannot be determined because the processor cannot be evaluated. It is a fourfold AMD processor, could the processor itself be the cause?</div>
<div>Thanks for your continuing advice</div>

            <p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>Well we make small progress. As to your quad core&nbsp;processor, that is not the problem - I also have a quad core AMD processor and my Performance Index works fine. Another program notorious for playing havoc with machine performance is Norton. Personally,
 I got rid of Norton ages ago for that very reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets keep working on this.</p>

            Sir,
<div>I can live without the performance index and I will not uninstall Norton.</div>
<div>I can see the workings of Norton here, because on a brandnew computer of a friend of mine also the performanceindex cannot be obtained. And a 60 day version of Norton is on the installation disc of the motherboard.</div>
<div>So here ends my work on the performance index problem.</div>
<div>My video card works fine, I can now export my video's with all codecs available, mp4, divx etc., This was not the case with my old video card. only avi was possible then. &nbsp;Remarkably export still does not succeed with the wmv codec, here the export process
 ends always halfway in an error, but I can convert the video later. I have no intention to solve this problem.</div>
<div>Norton gives good protection and I keep it.</div>
<div>I thank you for your efforts to help me.</div>
<div>I appreciate this very much.</div>
<div>It is far beyond what I expected when entering this forum.</div>

            how about just taking it off accross the whole operating system? I think it is super annoying as well. nobody writes with capitalized letters anymore, and i don´t think it is microsoft´s business to correct it.

            <p>Well the problem still persists, I have 3 dump files from just today. Not sure if I didn't remove the driver correctly, or if it is another one. Also I have been having problems with firefox lately, it crashes shortly after I run it or during the middle
 of doing something. Not sure if that has anything to do with the driver. Here are the dump files.

    <title>Where I find the correct SHA1 checksum for the Windows 8 Pro Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dimbulb_23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where I find the correct SHA1 checksum for the Windows 8 Pro Upgrade ISO&#63;</h2>
                    I ordered the Win 8 Pro upgrade online. &nbsp;(not a preview but the new product on 10/26/12.) &nbsp;I downloaded and burned the ISO file for the English version of the Windows 8 ISO. &nbsp;I'm assuming 64 bit. This proceeded without incident. &nbsp;I started the upgrade
 onto a Windows 7 SP1 PC 64bit &nbsp;but it failed during the Installing Windows 8 phase at 72% complete with the error "Windows 8 installation has failed". &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I restarted the upgrade and it failed at exactly the same spot (72%) and the same cryptic error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I contacted the Microsoft Store and they assisted me in going through the download process a 2nd time. &nbsp;The resulting 2nd ISO file was precisely the same size BUT it had a different SHA1 checksum! &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I attempted the upgrade again using the new DVD burned from the 2nd ISO file and it failed at exactly the same stage of the upgrade ( 72%).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So did I get two corrupted downloads/burns? &nbsp; I have no way of telling because all I know is they have different checksums.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Maybe they're both wrong or maybe the issue is something else entirely.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But first things first. &nbsp; How do I determine if my ISO file is correct? &nbsp;</div>
<div>What is the SHA1 checksum of an uncorrupted ISO file? &nbsp; &nbsp;Where is the information online?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.slavasoft.com/hashcalc/index.htm</u></a></p>
<p>For Windows .ISO file just place check marks in the SHA1 and CRC32 boxes.</p>
<p>In the main HashCalc Window the 'Data format' box located in the upper left should be set to "File"</p>
<p>In the 'Data' field click on the ... box located in the upper right and then click 'Cancel' if you get an 'Insert Disk' window pop up.</p>
<p>After you click 'cancel' you should see a 'Find' window. Use this to navigate to the folder where your .ISO file is stored and click on the file.</p>
<p>You should now see the .ISO file you clicked on listed in the 'File name' box located near the bottom of the 'Find' window.</p>
<p>Now click the 'Open' button. The Data field should now show the directory/folder path and the name of the .ISO file you selected.</p>
<p>With only the SHA1 and CRC32 boxes checked (Do not place check marks in any other boxes as this can slow down the time it take to calculate the values) click the 'Calculate' button located at the bottom of the main HashCalc window.
</p>
<p>It will take anywhere from 30 to 60 seconds for the calculation to complete and the SHA1 and CRC32 data values to be displayed.</p>
<p>The reported values are not case sensitive, so a lower case 'a' is the same as an upper case 'A' as far as the results are concerned and should match what I have posted.</p>

            <p>When you booted into Windows for the very first time, Windows prompted you for an account name &amp; password. This account was automatically created with administrative privileges. You should use this account now to reset the password for the problem account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you damaged this account while resetting its password then you need to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.</li><li>Boot the machine with your System Repair CD.</li><li>Press a key when prompted to boot from the CD.</li><li>Select "Repair PC" from the menu.</li><li>Select "Repair" when prompted.</li><li>Select System Restore when prompted.</li><li>Set Windows back to a point before you changed the password.</li><li>Plan ahead a little and create, test and document a spare admin account, same as you have a spare house key for emergencies. Having a single admin account is high-risk stuff, as you probably realise by now.<br />

            If you use Office Outlook, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Mail &gt; Tracking.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you use some other mail client or web service, the tracking option might not exist.&nbsp; You can assume that a message that hasn't been bounced back by the recipient's mail server has
 been received, but there is no way of knowing whether a message has actually been read.&nbsp; Office Outlook can tell you if the message has been displayed, but that's still no guarantee that it's been read.

<h2>            High Data Usage &#40;Due to Windows Update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have had to disable BITS, Delivery Optimization and Windows Update services for the past couple of months due to extreme data usage. It averages to 75-100GBs daily, with puts me way past my 1TB/month cap. I manually turn them on this week to update Windows
 thinking two months should be enough time for a fix, but even after the update I still get the same data usage. So I still have them off just to make sure, but am I missing something? Does Microsoft really not have a fix for this yet?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I use Ethernet, not WiFi, and yes, have verified with GlassWire that it is a Host Process, and has to due with Windows Update (or else I would keep getting high data usage with the services disabled)</p>

<p>Did mine in about an hour and a half, and it worked perfectly from the get-go. And my computer was 9 years old in March.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your computer is only 2 years old, unsupported hardware isn't an issue. That means you screwed up somewhere. Maybe lots of 'wheres.' There's a name for people who screw up their computers:
<em>Normal</em>. So don't stress it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what you can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Show your computer to a professional. You'll get value for your money if they also explain to you what went wrong, so it won't happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a clean install - that means starting over from scratch. There are several ways to do this:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A&nbsp;<em>factory reset</em> reverts your computer to exactly the way it was when it left the factory, and it's quick and easy. For a computer that's just two years old, a factory reset is probably your best bet.</li><li>You can also do what Microsoft calls a reset, which isn't the same as a factory reset. In Microsoft's reset you get a fresh copy of Windows - only. You'll have to re-install all your software separately.</li><li>And you can do a clean install on your own, from Microsoft's own Media Creation Tool.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can try <em>this</em> generic repair procedure or <em>that</em> generic repair procedure, and keep on doing that with the hope that eventually something will work, and won't cause more trouble in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, of course, you can restore a backup, but if you had a backup to restore then you wouldn't be here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My recommendation - what I would do - is the factory reset. It's quick and it re installs everything. All you'll have to do is update your computer, and if you do that immediately after the factory reset has completed you should have no troubles.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 1803 has since been succeeded by Windows 10 1809. I would try installing the newer Windows 1809 release manually.
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update/617a37da-8fc0-4f33-a3eb-59fe9082f925">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />

<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br /> Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?

<br />	12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10

<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:

<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thats it, the Windows 10 1809 is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1809 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.

            Hi John, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>I would still try the troubleshooter for Windows Update, I have PCs as old as 2006 performing updates just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you might not realize is that you should have at least a few gigabytes left on the drive you want to install to and that according to others here you might want to return some folders to their default locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also do not forget to BACKUP all important data or make an image to restore from and you may wish to do a CLEAN INSTALL.</p>

            I have some Windows 7 Hp Elite Machines that I want to upgrade to Windows 10. They are three years old. I don't have the option of buying new ones or doing a clean install. I must retain all of the apps and files. I am in a networked environment in a public
 library. I am upgrading to Win 10 version 1803 via a DVD because I had major problems with version 1809. I also have version 1903 burned to a disk. I keep getting the message that Windows 10 can't tell if the computer is ready to upgrade. I ran Windows updates
 and still got the same message. I will try a few other things, like uninstalling Malwarebytes, and see if that works, but I wonder if you have any other advice. Thank you.<br />
