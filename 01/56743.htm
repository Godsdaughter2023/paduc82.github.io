<p>I can't seem to get anywhere playing this game as I keep getting bumped off when I spawn. I know I am pretty cr*p at most games but after my Black Ops grounding I thought I might be better than I am doing at present.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;there are no modders/hackers in this game then I shall persevere, like I did with Black Ops, but if anyone knows of any cheats lurking about then I will steer clear like I am having to do with most of my other COD games</p>

<p>try another game mode as well. sometimes your team does get pushed right back and you become easy targets for a bit of spawn killing !</p>

<p>..........Hence why IMO Team Battle/Battle is a better gametype. When some of these hardcore Poisson Spawn Campers play team battle they can't cope with the fact that they have to work out where the enemy are coming from. I mean can you imagine that, the
 enemy not spawning in the same place? Their precious low score but extremely satisfying High K/D ratio has been totally bombed out. Don't even mention the possibility of a Battle. Heaven forbid them getting shot in the back.</p>
<p>War &amp; CTF are great games but the sides need to be even and fair. Whereas Team Battle you could (and often do) have 8 vs 16 player games without it making an advantage to the larger team.</p>
<p>So to the people who play the imaginary gametye that is "Team Battle within a CTF" - I say come to TeamBattle/Battle to test your over inflated skills with the best.</p>

<p>There's no reason not to spawn camp in CTF. </p>
<p>Spawn camp &gt; score flags &gt; win. Seems legit IMO.</p>
<p>But that's the reason it's better to play against good players in CTF &amp; War, it makes the teams even, and less chance of spawn camping, but if one team gets SC, then suppose they could be the inferior team. Not gonna' sit back and let them escape their base
 now. :)</p>
<p>I can't count how many times i've joined a game on CTF Dam, my team are getting spawn camped and i'm the only player to attempt a breakout, while all the rest of the team are still sitting in the base getting killed over and over!</p>
<p>Spawn camping happens on TB aswell, as you know only too well with that score. ;) Especially Rouen, Dam &amp; L'Ormes.</p>

<h2>            ASUS Dvd Video Won&#39;t Work &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    So I put a DvD into my drive to watch on ASUS DvD and when I launch it I just hear sound and no videos come up. I have tried multiple different ways to fix this problem but all have been unsuccessful. Nothing pops up saying that this video can't be played,
 it just plays audio and nothing else. I also have a similar problem trying to watch YouTube on the Microsoft Edge Browser, where only audio will play and no video.

<h3> charlesskripka  say:</h3>
<h2>            backup error code 0x81000024</h2>
                    <p>My Asus X555LA laptop cannot do successful backups with File History because "The system cannot find the path specified" to my Western Digital &nbsp;3T My Passport Ultra external hard drive, skipping files but completing the backup and then posting the error
 code, 0x810000024. &nbsp;This was no mean feat and was achieved only after much weeping and knashing of teeth. since it had taken me 15 full days working into the wee hours of the night to get to the point where File History system would even recognize the drive
 and run the backup. &nbsp;Paradoxically, Disk Manager recognized the external drive immediately on installation, &nbsp;Running Chkdsk on both the external and the internal disks. &nbsp;The partition table of the external drive was converted from MBR to GPT with Gptgen. Early
 on, an error message reported the drive was write-protected, which cleared easily with Diskpart and a registry edit. &nbsp;No usable information is available on the web that I can locate concerning the backup Error Code, 0x81000024--Now, I have admit that I am
 stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that these are frequent problems with both this and earlier operating systems as well as this external hard drive and its predecessors. &nbsp;I found threads dating back for a decade, discussing these same problems. &nbsp;I have done many Google searches
 and read many pertinent computer forum threads authored by myriads of enraged, frustrated, and newly cynical end users with varying degrees of knowledge who have had varying degrees of success solving these and other much similar catastrophes with several
 different approaches. &nbsp;Many of these individuals initially thought the problem(s) had been solved after lengthy machine down times, only to see recurrences at irregular intervals . &nbsp; This leads me to believe that there is more than one bug in both the operating
 systems and the external hard drives involved</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for information on Error Code. 0x81000024 how to correct its cause, however, an over-all solution would be VERY much appreciated. &nbsp;In reality, I would pose this as question to the experts at Microsoft, and a;so as a topic for discussion with
 any one who is interested. &nbsp;If I am lucky, someone will have solved it already.</p>

            <p>Hi Subash,
</p>
<p><span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community where you can find the answers related to Windows.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Based on the description provided, it looks like you are facing an issue with network controller, this issue might occur due to network drives are missing or corrupted.
</span></p>
<p><br />
Error Code 28: <span>The drivers for this device are not installed.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
A yellow exclamation point next to a device in Device Manager means that Windows has identified a problem of some kind with that device.

<h2>            Manual eject not working.</h2>
                    I have a disc stuck in my Xbox 1 x and the bluray disc won't eject when pressing the eject button (it makes a repetitive whirring like noise then stops) and inserting a straightened paper clip when the console is off into the left hole to manually eject
 it is not doing anything. I know that the paper clip hits something solid before finding the actual hole after wiggling a bit, I've gotten past the solid part. It's not going down to 2 inches ( a bit more than an inch is how far it goes before it hits something
 else) fully but does that matter? Is there any way to get the disc out by this point besides hurting the disc drive or taking apart the Xbox?

<p>
</p><p><span>I'm sorry to hear the manual eject hole by the disc tray is not popping the disc out slightly for you to grab it. I'm not sure if you have to push inside of the hole at an angle, but if you've given it a few tries already with no success, I recommend
 contacting customer support to help you set up a repair order and notate that there is a disc stuck in the console.</span></p>

<h2>            Compare files in two folders with different sub-directory names and structure</h2>
                    Hello, I randomly copied and also moved some of my images to a different folder for making a video. How do I know which files were moved so as to copy them back to the source. The problem is both the source and destination folder have different sub directory
 structures within and softwares like scootersoftware, totalcommander couldn't help because of this (or am i using them wrong?). I just want all the names of files and their locations that aren't present in source but present in destination directory.

<p>
</p><p>Accessing the Recent Documents can help us resolve your issue. This is helpful whenever you worked with a file and forgot the exact location. Since it's a user specific History, you'll find the list of files, folders and other places which recently accessed
 under every particular user profile folder.&nbsp; Here are the steps on how you can view it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click Windows Explorer.</li><li>Select Sort by.</li><li>Click Date Modified. </li></ol>
<p>You'll see the list of places visited recently and can easily find out which folder or place was accessed at what time and date. Let us know if you need further assistance.
</p>
<p>

<p>If you like racers, Test Drive Ferrari Legends is out next week, mind you I've heard/read that it might be delayed by a week, still trying to find out!&nbsp; Spec Ops The Line is out next week also, just a rental for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Inversion was due out next week aswell but that's been put back untill July 13th, I did like the look of this but heard the campaign is VERY short!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Skyrim DLC aswell, can't wait for this even though I can't see any game at the moment dragging me away from Dragons Dogma, I know I've banged on about it over the last few days but I really can't express enough how good it is, just my opinion of course ;)</p>

<h2>            SafeDisc retail DRM does not work on Windows 10 and is disabled by default when the KB3086255 update is installed</h2>
                    <p>Making me have problems with the game "Battlefield Vietnam" to be precise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Quoted from the pc gaming wiki on BF:Vietnam: <em>"SafeDisc retail DRM does not work on Windows 10 and is disabled by default on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1 when the KB3086255 update is installed."</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talking with a support agent (before us disconnecting due to me forgetting about it), they wanted to check my machine and the update with it? Odd and they wanted to control my computer which I found very weird.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to this update (which has been since vista), you can not launch the game battlefield vietnam or play it due to the DRM not being able to detect if there is a disc or not. Yes there are work arounds like No-CD cracks but I just was hoping microsoft could
 fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: This also stops games like Age of empires 2 from running as well</p>

<p><em>"I just was hoping it was a fixable issue from microsoft"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Abandon all hope. MS created the issue intentionally. Updating the driver does not suit their business model (or having Defender</p>
<p>double down on checking the file for malware).</p>
<p>They could have left it up to the user to take a chance on this driver that has never been attacked, , and made an allowance to
</p>
<p>disable DRM Blocking, but choose not to.</p>
<p>- I'm just happy that people cracked the DRM years ago and made noCD fixes long before MS introduced DRM Blocking.
</p>
<p>As I mentioned, I've used noCD's since I first started gaming on PC because I reckon using the disc is a hassle, but I still reckon</p>
<p>MS were rude and selfish to create this issue and then call Win10 'the best gaming Windows ever' .</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing weird about Compatibility mode not working. DRM Blocking prevents the secdrv.sys file on the disc from invoking,</p>
<p>which also stops the game from launching because the disc check fails. This is why a noCD fix works. The noCD hack tricks the</p>
<p>game into thinking the disc check has completed.</p>
<p>Not all, but most games that are blocked pop up a 'run as admin' error. This is only because MS didn't have the courtesy to create</p>
<p>an appropriate error message when the secdrv.sys driver gets blocked, so Windows tosses out what it thinks is corrects.</p>
<p>The issue has absolutely nothing to do with running as admin, or using a Compatibility option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>" MS just want to make people pay to download these old games again" makes no sense,"</em></p>
<p>Obviously not with games that are not still being sold on line, but there are plenty of disc based games that used SafeDisk that
</p>
<p>are being flogged by MS through their online store, which not coincidentally is built into Win10.</p>
<p>MS even go so far as to recommend only using their store (which is also pushed by many on these forums) as it is 'safe'.
</p>
<p>Implication being Steam, and all the other legitimate online retailers sell games at risk of malware contamination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There was another person posting regarding BF-1942 just last week who reckons he and some friends were able to play the game until
</p>
<p>recently, but he has not been able to launch the game recently. How they were able to do so I have no idea as the game
</p>
<p>stopped working for me several version updates back.</p>
<p>I was of the impression the reason BF-1942 stopped working on my machines is due to GameSpy and Punkbuster.</p>
<p>I even reinstalled it on two machines using Nvidia, Intel HD and AMD graphics to verify if it would work on one of the three gpu's.</p>
<p>No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked what he or his friends had done to make the game work prior to his current issue, but he didn't respond.</p>
<p>I have a suspicion he and his friends may be using downloads from one of the 'abandonware'&nbsp; sites which offer free copies of</p>
<p>games that the publishers are no longer selling. These, as with any game from an online retailer, would have the SafeDisk DRM removed.</p>

            Not much at all, you just install it on the new computer.&nbsp; Likely it will activate without hassle, but if it complains that it's already in use, it will provide you a 1-800 number to activate. It's an automated system that asks you to type your code into
 the phone, but if you stay on the line it will send you to an agent. Let them know it's not really in use anywhere else and they will kindly reset the activation count for you (you need not provide any personal details, product activation is not
<em>registration</em>).

<p>Thank you for the prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The functionality of Night light depends on your PC's display adapter driver. If the display adapter isn't compatible with the Creators Update, there's a chance that the feature is greyed out. To help you resolve the issue, we recommend uninstalling your
 display adapter driver from the <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> then install it again.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Start</strong> menu.</li><li>Search for <strong>Device</strong> <strong>Manager</strong> then press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong>Display</strong> <strong>adapters</strong> then select your display adapter driver.</li><li>Right-click the device and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>If available, you can check the <strong>Delete the driver software from this device</strong> and then click the
<strong>Uninstall</strong> button.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li><li>Let <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/c4a6d3df-d0d4-42b6-0018-ca48577f9909/update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update</a></strong> reinstall your display adapter driver or you can visit the device
 manufacturer's support page to download the latest driver.</li></ol>
<p>Please respond back with the results.</p>

<h2>            System fails to start, when external hard drive is connected on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Drive D: is not working property...</p>
<p>Yesterday I had an issue that I couldn't start up my computer, It would 'stop' at Asus motherboard screen(Asking me to press F2 or DEL)<br />
and the computer wouldn't respond to my commands, and everything would crash. I tried restarting the motherboard and it didn't work, but afterward I removed the D: Driver to test, and it actually worked. The computer started normally, but then the driver wouldn't
 be there, even if I put the wire back to the driver(Toshiba MK5076GSX), it wouldn't appear as connected, giving me that error:
<a href="http://goo.gl/BpfuWk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">goo.gl/BpfuWk</a>.</p>
<p>So what happens is, when I start up I have to remove the drive for the windows to load, and when I put it back, the drive doesn't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to fix it, and I've searched a lot online to see if anything could help, but nothing worked&nbsp;or wasn't the same problem as mine...</p>

            <p>Hello Akino,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We realize your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description, I suspect that the problem lies with the Hard disk which you're trying to connect. To confirm the same, suggest you to try connecting the same drive on different computer to see if it makes any difference in this situation. This will
 give us the clue on the root cause. If the problem still appears then it clearly indicates that the problem lies with the external hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it wet to guide you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 News App videos out of sync</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble watching videos in the Windows 10 News App.</p>
<p>The app video sometimes&nbsp;loses portions of the audio; the audio and video seem to be sometimes out of sync, one running before or after the other, or sometimes repeating in a loop. This happens a lot, but not all the time.</p>
<p>I wonder if others are having the same problems?</p>
<p>I have this happening on at least two computers that are up to date with updates. No viruses found.</p>
<p>What's going on here -- Microsoft I'd like some answers!</p>

            <p>I was forced to recover the system, since the browsers became so slow.</p>
<p>But even after reinstalling the system, and getting all the updates, there still seems to be a problem.</p>
<p>For some reason the News app videos can't seem to find the Internet cache. </p>
<p>In fact, I think the system itself is having problems with the Internet cache.</p>
<p>In the system window for the Internet cache, it still&nbsp;doesn't seem to put up a path for the cache, like my other Windows 10 systems do. When I tried to change the cache location -- it put up a path and allowed me to set the cache memory limit. But when I
 rebooted the system and went back to the window, the path was missing again, and the allocation of memory was zero!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my browsers are still slow, and the News App still can't seem to find the cache!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your continuing help Ramesh Kumar!</p>
<p>I ran the scan after the update I mention below,&nbsp;but found no corrupt files.</p>
<p>I had previously downloaded the latest updates&nbsp;including the overall update for Windows 10.</p>
<p>When I went to reboot my computer, I experienced a Blue Screen, with the ERROR:</p>
<p>"Critical Process Died".</p>
<p>But the computer did restart normally after this.</p>
<p>Still, videos won't run at all,&nbsp;in the News App. </p>
<p>The problem seems to be with the place where Temporary Internet files are stored.</p>
<p>The system can't seem to find that place, and therefore allocates no space on disc for temporary Internet files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the&nbsp;Settings/Internet Properties/General/Website Data Settings window, the window shows no path for Temporary Internet Files. Also, if I try to allocate more than 8mb, a dialog box comes up saying that I can only allocate between 8 and 8 megabytes
 for Temporary Internet File Disk space.</p>
<p>But the Disk Space To Use box always shows zero! So I cannot change the Disk space allocation for these files. The result is that the browsers run very slowly, because they are not saving data&nbsp;on disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery I performed&nbsp;did nothing to change this problem. I fear I will just have to erase everything, and reinstall from scratch, having to reinstall all the programs that I now have on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other computers are also not running the News app videos properly (they lose audio, and hang up), but the problem does not seem to be disc space allocation -- they show the path, and have the full 250mb allocation. And the browser run OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My owns thoughts are that the people supplying the News app videos are not making them correctly-- except for the commercials -- they always run right! I think the problem with the News app is outside Microsoft! But something is wrong with the path to the
 Temporary Internet Files. It may have something to do with signing in with a Microsoft account instead of a computer account (that's what I was doing with the primary computer above). The path may not be able to use the @ character in the Email user name,
 so it assigns something else, and the path can't be found. But this is&nbsp;only speculation. I began using a regular computer user account, but it is still having problems, so there may be additional factors involved. So that's where I am now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>

<h3> crashoveride318  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 crashes while trying to upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    I am attempting to upgrade my current Windows 7 installation using the upgrade reservation, however, I had purchased a defective video card that I was attempting to install (and have since given up on and returned) and now I am experiencing some type of
 system file corruption that causes Windows Explorer to crash randomly which in turn crashes my entire machine. I would like to perform a clean install of Windows 10 to alleviate the issue I am having with Explorer, but I have found no way to be able to activate
 a Windows 10 clean install without first going through the upgrade process (which I can't complete due to system crashes). Is there anything that can be done? I know that the SFC tool exists on Windows 7, but it can no longer be invoked like it used to be
 on older versions of Windows when it first appeared. Help please.

<p>
</p><p>Am not MS but I am an experienced desktop support person so hoping I can help a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would totally agree with you that running System File Checker is the best course of action to verify the integrity of your system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to run it by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and press R</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove anything currently in Run and type sfc /scannow and press Enter, you should see 'beginning system scan, this may take some time'</p>

            <p>My son tried to upgrade from windows 7 to windows 10 via the windows free update to windows 10 that kept coming up on his screen. But when he did it has somehow crashed his entire lap top. There is absolutely no response apart from a message that says cannot
 find operating system. Remove all devices that contain an operating system and try again. But we have tried everything including hard reset and recovery keys such as f11. But it keeps coming up with the same message that it cannot find operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that the upgrade from windows 7 to 10 has failed and either wiped the operating files or corrupted some of them. We can see the hard drive in the bios but thats about it. Is there anyway where we can retrieve his files by a recovery of some sort.
 I may have to purchase a recovery disc as he didn't create one. I feel that this is Microsoft's fault as it only happened when trying to upgrade to the new windows 10.<br />

            <p>You could try downloading the Windows 7 installation iso from Microsoft on another computer and burn the image to disc, then boot from that disc on the affected computer and choose the "Repair your computer" option. This may wprk to get you back into Windows
 7. You can get started with this page <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-recoveryhttp://" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have another Windows 7 computer running the same version (eg. Home Premium), you could use the options shown
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/create-a-system-repair-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to create a system repair disc, then boot the affected computer from that.</p>

            As fate would have it, immediately after posting this issue, I tried to perform the upgrade again from the GWX app, and lo and behold, it was able to complete without explorer crashing. So now I am fully upgraded to Windows 10 with nary a major issue.
 After the upgrade completed, I did purchase and install a different video card (this one worked) after downloading the most current drivers for it from the Nvidia website (Windows 10 WHQL certified no less). So for the moment all is good. I am still at a loss
 as to why my computer was giving me trouble in the first place, and I never got to running SFC with the /scannow option.<br />

<p>After you installed the program, go to its installation folder, and go to the 32/64 bit folder (depend on your system), and run DPInst.exe as administrator. It will install the driver, and after that, it will work.</p>

<h2>            Blu-Ray control issues</h2>
                    Ok so am I the only one who thinks the controls for the xbox ones blu ray player are stupid? First off I hate how you can't use voice controls with it and the button layout on the controller is ridiculous! X is play/pause, A does nothing, and the fast
 forward/rewind system is retarded how to bring it out of fast forward you need to press the rewind button however many times you hit fast forward, you can't just press A or X. And right now I'm watching bad grandpa and fast forward and rewind are blocked,
 when I press them a red circle with a dash through it appears in the top right. Infact the only buttons that do work are play/pause, skip forward/back, and B brings up the onscreen controls but they don't let me rewind either. I don't get any better results
 with my smart glass either, whoever set up the blu ray controls on the X1 is retarded! This isn't the first movie I've had these issues with. Listen up Microsoft, make it so you can use the kinect with blu-ray movies and set up the con

<p>Nah, no voice controls with blu ray. Those commands work with Netflix, amazon, and xbox video but it's strangely absent from the blu ray player. Throw in a blu ray and check it out, check out how dumb the controls are too. They could be sooo much better.</p>

            <p>The blu-ray controls are shockingly bad.&nbsp; There's no mechanism to discover what the control is.&nbsp; This is UX 101.&nbsp; Any video game there is does a better job of letting you know what each button will do.&nbsp;</p>

            Unfortunately not, there’s no Mail app folder where you can move .eml files over to.
<br />Supposedly all mail within an account will be downloaded after the account has been added but this will not happen if you have mail under Storage folders within WLMail as these are offline folders only.
<br />What I had to do is move any saved emails from the storage folders to a newly created folder under one of my account within Live Mail &amp; then move the emails to it &amp; then they appeared once the same account was synced under the Mail app.
<br />Windows Essentials is still available:
