<h2>            W 10 Defender says &#34;This Website Reported Unsafe&#34;, but it&#39;s not</h2>
                    Hello; a website I've gone to often, www.karensbakery.com , has recently been flagged in RED by Defender SmartScreen, says "This Website Reported Unsafe, threats to your computer.....", and you cannot proceed. When I called them to tell them, they said
 no problem there, many others can access it. It seems only my pc with WIN 10 &amp; Edge is showing that. How do I check why I'm being blocked by Defender Smartscreen? No other website has ever shown that, so it's not Edge. Appreciate any help, thanks. Steve F.

            Hi Steven,
<br />
<br />You can try clearing the browsing history in Edge, if that doesn't help. Try the solution from IMACIAS on this thread <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/forum/all/how-do-i-get-microsoft-edge-to-stop-blocking-a/cc7c00c7-269c-46ef-86ef-e493a04ef7a9?page=2">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/forum/...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.
<br />
<br />-Tamara

<p>hi Steve lets fix this first i found on edge its working fine not blocked this is what you should do update windows in settings and go windows defender click virus and threat protection and scroll down and select protection updates.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0dae733-f681-489f-95ca-0936dcf168d4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d0dae733-f681-489f-95ca-0936dcf168d4?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>I forgot to tell you that microsoft has a new version of microsoft edge which is faster than the new edge on edge insider website. you can also reset or repair by going to settings -apps -search edge -click options and you get a few options to fix edge</p>

            Tamara, Update: fyi, I went to the Thread again and followed IMACIAS advice. Under Misc., display mixed content as he said, I had Prompt &amp; changed to Enable, to always display non-secure websites without blocking ..... did
<em>not</em> work, website still blocked! Just wanted you to know I've tried everything, I seem to be the only one blocked, very weird! Never had this happen with years of Edge browsing. Hoping for more help, thanks again. Steve

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 family. I would be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">From the description provided, I understand that Windows 10 cannot be installed using Windows Update or using an ISO file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to consider the following situations and check if it helps to identify the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Possible Faulty RAM</span></p>
<p>A common problem which can result in the 0xc0000005 error during Windows 7 installation is faulty RAM. You should run a memory diagnostic test to make sure all your ram is stable:</p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Type Windows Memory Diagnostic in search bar and click it</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the Windows Memory Diagnostic window, select the first option which is recommended. As a result, your system will restart right away and will check for problems.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
After the computer has restarted, you will see that the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool will be checking for memory problems. This diagnosis might take several minutes. Once the process has been completed, the system will restart and will open in normal condition.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If the error occurs again, simply replace your memory modules. And that's it. In this manner, you can easily resolve the blue screen error of memory management.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.</span><strong> </strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Bad Sectors or Corrupt Hard Drive</span></p>
<p>If you have tried formatting your PC’s hard drive,&nbsp;and your RAM passed the diagnostics, then you could have bad sectors on your hard drive.</p>
<p>Try getting to the Windows recovery console and<strong> perform a force of the chkdsk command (chkdsk C: /f)</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further assistance, please do let us know and we would be happy to help you further.</span></p>

    <title>Playing iPhone Games on a Surface Tablet--Can It be Done&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c-meiers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing iPhone Games on a Surface Tablet--Can It be Done&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro i5 Model 1796 Tablet.&nbsp; My brother has an iPhone, with both the "Pokémon Go" and "Harry Potter: Wizards Unite" games. I would really love to play both games (especially Harry Potter) on my Tablet.&nbsp;
<span>At the moment, he and I are sharing his phone to play the game, but </span>
<span>At the moment, he and I are sharing his phone to play the game, but </span>
he does not actually live in my state, and is only visiting.&nbsp; When he goes home, the games go with him.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are my questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Every time I look for answers as to how to put the games on my Surface, the internet keeps coming back with answers for desktop computers, or laptops--things that can't be moved from where they are sitting.&nbsp; I can carry my Tablet around anywhere, so
 I don't need a "GPS fix" or anything like that--especially since that might get me kicked out of the games.&nbsp; I just need to be able to get the games onto the Tablet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Is there a way to do it?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Ideally, I want to play with my own character and account, rather than borrowing my brother's phone all the time, but if I have to do it another way, I noticed that there is a way to sync a phone to my Tablet.&nbsp; If I synced my brother's phone, could I
 then play the game using his account...without draining his battery power, or upsetting a game he was playing?&nbsp; (Say he wanted to play Pokémon Go, and I wanted to play Wizards Unite.&nbsp; Could we play both games simultaneously, or would that not be possible with
 a synced phone?)&nbsp; And if the phone the Tablet was synced to, went to another state, would that mess things up?&nbsp; For that matter, if my brother's pictures appeared on my Tablet, due to the sync, could I erase them from my Tablet WITHOUT erasing them from his
 phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to anyone who answers.&nbsp;</p>

That said, neither of the games you mention are available<br />for Windows. There are utilities like Bluestacks that let you install Android<br />apps on a computer, but I do NOT recommend you try this unless you know what you<br />are doing and have the skills to trouble shoot issues that installing an<br />interface for Android games on a PC when something goes wrong. </p>

<p>To be totally honest before you asked this question (and I decided to look into the idea of an iOS emulator) I didn't think there was an iOS emulator for the PC, apparently there is, but as I say I know nothing about the subject !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to a web resource, I suggest checking it out thoroughly before installing. As Barb points out, installing and maintaining emulators can be tricky, because Apple and Android are constantly putting out updates that can break your emulator install.
 Fortunately Windows has gotten much better at isolating applications that makes running these low level emulators much less risky.</p>

 In fact, we’re not sure if there’s any on the market at all. If you’ve heard of a ‘real’ emulator for iOS, please let us know in the comments. We apologize for the misunderstanding once again.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 not able to log in. Account is hacked</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys, </p>
<p>With my PC, someone has hacked it and kept the Microsoft Account password, which is not mine, and I don't know the password or username, hence I am unable to log in to windows. As I switch ON my PC, the windows 10 asks the password which I don't know and
 never set it. </p>
<p>Earlier, there was no password and it use to take me straight to the windows. Now it asks the password, does any one knows how to reset the password to log into windows 10. or any idea how can I reset?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have upgraded my computer from windows 7 to windows 10. During the setup I never setup any Microsoft account to sign in into windows.</p>
<p>All of the sudden next day when I switched ON my computer it had a password and username. Through which I am unable to log in my windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I do have Microsoft Account which I never used on that computer. During the setup I left with no password required to log in. (But now it is asking me a password - which I don't know and I am trying to reset it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Microsoft account is absolutely not hacked but .. someone has hacked my computer and did password setup, which I am not able to reset it because its not my Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if this is what you are looking for.</p>

            Hi Beach251 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Apps, find Skype in the list of installed Apps, select that and choose Uninstall
<br />
<br />
<br />If Skype does not appear in that list:
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Go to Programs and Features, find Skype in the list and uninstall from there . . .

<h2>            Why Windows 10 persistently showing update menu...&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Dell XPS 8700 Windows 10 Home machine constantly shows "Update and shut down" and "Update and restart" when clicking on the Start, Power menu (see picture below). &nbsp;Despite shutting down and restarting the PC many times the "Update..." menu still shows
 up. &nbsp;Is this normal?</p>
<p>Any help to resolve this issue is greatly appreciated.</p>

            Sadly, and it's been this way for a while, if you don't select "update and restart" or "update and shut down", you will see this. By selecting ONLY "shut down" or "restart", you will see this until the updates are complete.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help and response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my case, I select both update but nothing seems to happen. &nbsp;I don't see any message showing that the os is updating. &nbsp;In other word, cliking on these update has the same effect as clicking on shut down and restart. &nbsp;Upon next restart or turn on, they
 are still there and it has been like this for several month now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 05/18/2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of the blue, it's working now. &nbsp;No idea what's going on.<br />

    <title>Solved Missing Bluetooth in Windows 10 Settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaptk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solved Missing Bluetooth in Windows 10 Settings</h2>
                    SOLUTION: I have a Lenovo Yoga 710. This morning after logging into Windows 10, my bluetooth mouse stopped working. I looked in the Action Center and in the Windows 10 Settings and could no longer find "Bluetooth". I did extensive research, including watching
 YouTube videos and no solution worked. I believe the combination of the 3 steps below solved the problem.&nbsp;<br />
1. &nbsp;In Services turned the BlueTooth support from manual to automatic, stopped and started the service. (Bluetooth still missing)<br />
2. In Device Manager uninstalled the Bluetooth driver. Rebooted and then reinstalled the Bluetooth driver allowing Windows to find the driver. (Bluetooth still missing)<br />
3. Turned on Bluetooth Speaker - detected hardware. Anwser "YES" to turn on. (BLUETOOTH NOW AVAILABLE IN ACTION ITEMS AND SETTINGS) Mouse and Speaker now works.

<h2>            Download stuck in Queued, solution doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work</h2>
                    Alright, so I got my Xbox one two days ago, and yesterday I decided to get battlefield 4. The stores were closed so I got a digital download, started downloading and it progressed slowly up to around 44%, then it said "installation stopped" I resumed it
 and it kept going to 55% an at that time I had already gone back to bed. When I woke up at 3:00 AM to check the download, it was at queued. Tried to resume, nothing happened. So I though "well I'll just look for a solution, don't have o post this" but the
 only solution I've found is one where you disconnect your internet then install and that wouldn't work for me because I have the digital download, but I still tried it and now my install is at 2% This is really getting frustrating TL;DR battlefield 4 stuck
 at queued, turning internet off doesn't help.

    <title>How to disable the automatic tilt correction of the Surface Pro Pen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable the automatic tilt correction of the Surface Pro Pen</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT (2018-09-03): This question is still relevant. Since the fix of August 8th, there are apparently remaining issues with the tilt correction creating an intermittent offset.
</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0</a></p>
<p><strong>Please quickly provide a way to disable tilt correction, or even tilt sensitivity altogether, to alleviate the issue for the time being.</strong></p>
<p>EDIT (2018-08-30): This question is no longer relevant. The original issue with the tilt correction was fixed by Microsoft on August 8th, 2018.</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0</a>(Note:
 the term "parallax offset" was inappropriate - I should have written "tilt offset")</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With the new Surface Pen introduced with the Surface Pro 2017, Microsoft engineers have introduced a new system to compensate the "parallax offset", that is the difference of location between the tip of the pen and where the ink appears on the screen.</p>
<p>Before, this compensation was done by manually calibrating the pen, i.e. asking the user to hold the pen and tap some reference points on the screen. The measured offsets were stored and then used to shift the location of the ink on the screen so that it
 appears as close as possible to the tip of the pen. It was not perfect but very acceptable. In fact, previous Surface Pro models came pre-calibrated, so that they would suit most people without ever having to calibrate the pen manually.</p>
<p>Now, the compensation is done automatically in real time. By measuring the tilt of the pen, thanks to the new tilt sensor, the expected offset between the tip of the pen and the pen signal is calculated and the corresponding compensation is applied, so that
 the ink is displayed right below the tip of the pen. This system is much more precise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the current implementation suffers from a bug or hardware issue that frequently and randomly turns off the automatic parallax correction whenever a hand is in contact with the screen, making the pen very difficult if not impossible to use.
 This issue has been reported here by more than 2500 people:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpronew-surfdrivers/surface-pro-intermittent-pen-inaccuracy-when-hand/28ef8566-0003-4c68-a964-6c2562423eb0</a></p>
<p>After 2 months, a Microsoft agent replied that the root cause of this issue was identified and that a solution would be provided in a future Windows update. It has been 10 months since that reply, and Microsoft has not provided any fix, nor any update on
 the situation. It appears that Microsoft is unable to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, most users would be much happier to simply disable that faulty automatic parallax correction. It sounds like a common-sense solution to disable a feature that causes trouble when that feature is not essential. In fact, the Surface Studio
 does not support this automatic parallax correction (since it does not support tilt), and the new Surface Pen just works fine on the Surface Studio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: <strong>how to disable the automatic parallax correction on the Surface Pro 2017?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling each of the Human Interface Devices in the device manager but none of them disabled the automatic parallax correction. I would like Microsoft to provide detailed instructions on how to do it, or if it cannot be done manually, provide a
 software or patch that can do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: this question is not about solving the issue discussed in "Surface Pro - intermittent pen inaccuracy when hand is on the screen". It is just about a way to disable the automatic parallax correction.)</p>

            Microsoft, I am still not happy even if this was feature by itself was implemented. The issue is with the device itself as it doesn't happen to the surface book 13.5 in. This is just work around even if this option becomes available, but whatever. One
 year and no answers or fix. And whenever I talk with a representative, theyre like "yes we have confirmed the issue", and technichians are working for a fix that will be released next month or something. And that next month never show up.

<p>If you have already redeemed the membership code from your card&nbsp;try removing the account from the console, doing a hard restart, hold the power button for 10 seconds while the system is on, and then re-adding the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise contact xbox support to check out you billing:&nbsp;(800) 469-9269 if you're in the US/Canada or http://support.xbox.com/contact-us&nbsp;

            Hi ETECH7401
<br />
<br />Activation issues after clean installing Windows is generally because the Edition (Home, Pro . . . etc.) that is installed, does not match the Edition Previously installed on that PC
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />Is the correct Edition reported there?
<br />
<br />
<br />When you say you used a Recovery drive form another PC, is that just a Windows 10 Installation Media or an actual recovery made on the other PC

I'd suggest you visit Samsung driver download support, download and install the drivers for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists or if there are no drivers for Windows 7, please contact <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Death in the Family need access to Microsoft Account Locked Computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artemis8.geo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Death in the Family need access to Microsoft Account Locked Computer</h2>
                    <p>Recently a death has rocked our little world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was a friend and his family is struggling through all the processes and pain that comes with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One such problem is my friends personal laptop. &nbsp;This laptop is currently locked with his Microsoft Account(here in MSA). &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I'm wondering what can be done. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to poor records we CANNOT use the standard method password reset. &nbsp;Knowledge of security questions, previous emails, and even email usage (i can't remember the questions, who was a contact recently emailed etc) are unavailable to us as it was a registered
 MS account using an external email address and therefore no correspondence even exists in their box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, IF the laptop was locked with a standard account, (no other users exist on the computer) we'd have no problem as there are many methods to madness in that respect (i.e &nbsp;local account reset).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But alas here we are with a MSA Locked computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have contacted Microsoft in this matter and have hit a brick wall. &nbsp;We once were even told to "wait for the son to come home." &nbsp;Please remember they are dead. &nbsp;Imagine hearing that about your deceased son/friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were directed to "Next of Kin process." &nbsp;But this only deals with data Microsoft is in control of, namley Skydrive and Email. &nbsp;NONE of which were used or used sparingly. &nbsp;But due to the fact that the MSAccount is now in full control of that data they
 probably should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the family needs is access, access to the personal data of the deceased on the laptop that Microsoft chose to admin encrypt with their MSA information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It boggles my mind that a company could create such a solution (Tying Local Admin Accounts to Online profiles) that they did not foresee this to be a PROBLEM.</p>
<p><br />
The purpose for this question to the community is to raise awareness. &nbsp;There needs to be a better solution. &nbsp;This family is not going balk at providing documentation, or going through processes needed to reset the account (outside the norm). &nbsp;They are however
 currently stuck with no solutions present to them. &nbsp;My friend didn't create this situation, Microsoft did with the account linking.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If this happened to a company MSA (admin) account they'd be out progress, money and time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awareness, and getting this memo on an executives desk. &nbsp;THAT is the purpose of this, please upvote, like, dislike, report as abuse and AGREE that a solution needs to be there for those that have this thrust upon them. &nbsp;A blind eye with the FURTHER integration
 of Windows 10 to online profiles creates even more of a NEED for extraneous solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also be contacting Microsoft directly, if possible to help get this noticed. &nbsp;As we cannot be the first to find ourselves in this situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and your patience in reading the long post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in memory of David,</p>
<p>Levi</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't work for Microsoft; we are mainly volunteers here and can not change Microsoft Policy in this matter.</p>
<p>As you say, you have to work with Microsoft directly to bring in changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as you must appreciate, we are very sorry for&nbsp;the loss, but we can not give advice here on how to "crack" Passwords</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft forbids any assistance being given in these Forums to help you bypass or "crack" lost or forgotten Passwords.</em></p>
<p>Here is the Microsoft Information outlining that Policy:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/keeping-passwords-secure-microsoft-policy-on/39f56ef0-5d68-41ad-9daa-6e6019c25d37"><span style="color: rgba(155, 79, 150, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/keeping-passwords-secure-microsoft-policy-on/39f56ef0-5d68-41ad-9daa-6e6019c25d37</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the reasons for that Policy is that anyone can come online and say anything they wish to&nbsp;and gain access to another person's computer.</p>
<p>We are not saying that you are&nbsp;doing that, but our hands are tied by the Microsoft Policy upon risk of being banned from here it we violate that Policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>__________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has outlined steps to follow for your particular circumstances, but unfortunately&nbsp;as you already know they&nbsp;will not divulge Passwords.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The only suggestion is&nbsp;for contact to be made with a local Computer Repair Shop with all the relevant information of ownership, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They may or may not assist.</p>

            Microsoft will not respond to whatever email account is being bandied about as part of the "next of kin" process. Been trying for over 6 weeks. Still no response. So spare yourselves the additional heartache. As indicated above, Microsoft purports to offer
 security for users but once you die...your computer and all data on it ARE locked/gone/beyond reach...and Microsoft doesn't care. They say they are "protecting" your privacy...even the courts recognize that as the executor or next of kin, that is my job. Microsoft
 doesn't care. Spare me the "you could be a bad guy" argument. There are ways of verifying, not foolproof I agree, but Microsoft won't even pretend to try to verify. The banks, the credit card companies have all accepted evidence my father has passed away.
 Microsoft won't even acknowledge my emails. The link above takes you to the same tired site saying contact msrecord @ Microsoft. com...don't bother. NO one answers those emails. It's a scam. Don't waste your time. If you find someo

</p><p>This has the added benefit of being normally a much better install than the factory install, especially if one chooses the Reset saving only files instead of any Factory recovery option that is present.&nbsp;

            <p>Microsoft will not give you access to a deceased person's computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They will give you access to their data on their email account (Outlook.com). but not the Computer.</p>
<p>That is why I gave advice in my original reply here on what to do to get access to the Computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I already posted the information about Microsoft's Policy for Passwords:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft forbids any assistance being given in these Forums to help you bypass or "crack" lost or forgotten Passwords.</em></p>
<p>Here is the Microsoft Information outlining that Policy:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/keeping-passwords-secure-microsoft-policy-on/39f56ef0-5d68-41ad-9daa-6e6019c25d37"><span style="color: rgba(155, 79, 150, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/keeping-passwords-secure-microsoft-policy-on/39f56ef0-5d68-41ad-9daa-6e6019c25d37</span></a></p>
<p>

            <p>In my case we have two issues: first we want to get his email data so we can ensure any/all issues relating to his estate are resolved including notifying friends/associates of his passing. Second we need access to his computer, which is locked with his
 email password. I understand these are two separate issues. And I understand we have to accept that his computer is now just a big paperweight (a new, expensive paperweight). And the computer companies are celebrating his death because they get to sell us
 a new computer we can access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I take exception to the response saying Microsoft will give access to email data:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying for six weeks to get that data. Other threads on this site say to email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and they will tell you what they need then they will send you a disk of email data. It's a lie. Been waiting six weeks. Sent four emails. Nothing.
 Not a word a hint or a suggestion of how one goes about getting access to a loved one's email data. Not even the courtesy of "we're busy" or a "wrong email" response. Nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stand by my statement that Microsoft will NOT allow access to a deceased relative's email, in any format, regardless of what is on these forums.&nbsp;If anyone has managed to get Microsoft to give them access to a deceased relative's email account data, congrats.
 Maybe you could share how you managed that accomplishment because nothing has been successful for me.&nbsp;</p>

            A question for those in this thread who think that MS should be at the ready to provide access to the private information of deceased people:&nbsp; Understanding that there are many different laws internationally that deal with this sort of thing, and there
 are over one <em>billion</em> Windows installations worldwide, and approximately 155,000 people die every day, what sort of economically responsible infrastructure do you envision that would facilitate the information being released?<br />

            <p>I've frankly never heard of and wouldn't expect any email provider to give access upon someone's death unless a judge ordered it as part of probate which would then be up to the caprices of serving a court order to someone who would have access (good luck).&nbsp;
 I would expect any relative of mine to either have left a trail to find their password or wouldn't expect to be able to access their email at all.&nbsp; This should be something each person considers about whether they even want relatives or others to access this
 private information after their death, so that they either make arrangements in advance or it is lost and sealed as assumed is their wish.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the PC, I've already said it can be reset or recovered to start service as good as new, even better actually since the factory install is half as good as what a Reset or Reinstall from boot media will do absent the factory recovery image being imposed.&nbsp;
 This has nothing to do with the previous owner's private data but is like the consideration of other private property (a car, house, etc) that gets passed along under a will or normal disposition.&nbsp; One does not lose access to a car or house just because these
 are missing the keys, nor a PC just because the password is lost.&nbsp; If it becomes your legal property you can Reset or Reinstall.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my personal view and doesn't represent anything other than seeing other similar circumstances and how they have been adjudged to be best handled for years in Forums by practice and rules. One firm rule has always been that we cannot help crack a
 password&nbsp; because it would make it too convenient to crack.&nbsp; But assuming the property changes hands legally we've always been allowed to suggest Reinstall or Reset.&nbsp;

            <p>Your point is valid, many people have private details in their email and on their computer they don't want their loved ones to find. And aside from the nightmare of trying to identify creditors in this electronic world (I have several debts that only exist
 in the emailed invoices), we aren't talking a house or a car. Those are physical assets. Computers, and even phones have become so much more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this age of digital everything there are few printed photos, no negatives, no hand written cards or letters. Our lives seem to exist only in the bits and bytes on our computers and phones. There can and should be some way of recovering those details.
 This experience has made me reconsider all things digital. If I were to die tomorrow, then my family would not be able to retrieve the 20+ years of family history research I have done. They would not be able to retrieve the dozens and dozens of family photos
 that now only exist in digital format and that I would want to pass along. They would not have contact with the distant relatives I never knew existed and who I only communicate with by email. All because I practice good security and don't share my password.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>So as Greg says, think about what's on your computer and phone. If you don't want it shared, delete it or lock it up in a file or on a cloud or some place private. If there are things you want to share with your loved ones, if you should die tomorrow....how
 will they know? Whatever steps you take...remember they need to be kept current. Change your password, change your plan. Every 30-90 days...for the rest of your life. I'm kind of missing the old days. :(</p>

    <title>windows 10 windows media player video thumbnail problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc3d4  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 windows media player video thumbnail problem</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 which is an upgrade from 8.1 on my dell computer.&nbsp; I chose windows media player as its default media player.&nbsp; my file view is navigation pane so I can easily see the file when I point/click on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no problem when&nbsp;playing the
 file.&nbsp;The&nbsp; problem I am encountering that annoys me &nbsp;is when I point the mouse on every video file, the same thumbnail image is&nbsp;showing&nbsp;in the navigation pane. This is not the same in windows 7 &nbsp;where when u point&nbsp;the mouse on a file it shows the real thumbnail
 image&nbsp; in the pane. i also checked others video files on their computer running windows 10 and they don't have the thumbnail image problem. I also checked the usb inserted in my computer with video files and had&nbsp;same thumbnail problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;How can i solve this
 problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try clearing the thumbnail cache. Use these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open File Explorer, and click This PC</li><li>Select the system drive (usually, C:\)</li><li>From the Manage tab at the top, click "Cleanup". (This launches Disk Cleanup for C:\ drive.)</li><li>Enable the check box for "<strong>Thumbnails</strong>", and uncheck all other items in the list.</li><li>Click OK</li><li>When Disk Cleanup prompt you with the message "Are you sure you want to permanently delete these files?", click the "<strong>Delete Files</strong>" button.</li><li>Restart Windows and let Windows regenerate fresh set of thumbnail cache as required.</li></ol>

            <p>Thank you Ramesh for your suggestion. After restarting I tried pointing 1 video file after another and found the same problem but 1 file&nbsp;got its real thumbnail. I&nbsp;compared it to the other video files. my video files are&nbsp;wmv and mp4 only. I went to the properties
 of the file and&nbsp;&nbsp;tried changing the other one which says OPENS WITH: WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER to MOVIES AND TV. That cured all the other video files which have same thumbnails, but their default is movies and tv video player not windows media anymore. If I go
 on default and choose windows media player it goes back to the same thumbnail problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wmv files have the same thumbnails while the mp4s which can be opened to movies and tv have their own thumbnail. Though i&nbsp;preferred window media because I can immediately
 play the video in the navigation panel, I think I have to just switch to&nbsp;MOVIES AND TV as the default &nbsp;:)

<p>
</p><p>This is interesting. If you can generate a&nbsp;<a href="http://pretentiousname.com/miscsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>FileTypeDiag</strong></a>&nbsp;report (2 reports, actually) for the affected file type (.WMV). One report with WMP set as default
 for .WMV, and another one after setting Movies &amp;TV as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may .zip the logs (contains nothing but file type association details), and upload to your OneDrive account or somewhere. I'll check the logs to see which preview handlers loaded on both occasions.</p>

            <p>I just checked here (Windows 10 x64 1511/10586.164) and found that the problem is with Windows Media Player's Rich Preview Handler. If this handler is disabled, the Preview pane refreshes the image correctly, but you lose the ability to "play" that video
 from the Preview pane. I mean, the control bar won't appear under the preview image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if the WMP Preview Handler is enabled (default), the preview image fails to update, but you can still play the video from the preview pane. Hope this gets fixed in future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the REG files to enable and disable the handler.</p>

            <p>So; what happened? It has been over a year, with multiple incremental updates - and, this issue persist?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was hoping by this time, issue would have been resolved - come on Microsoft! Either enable preview on your "Groove" player through Windows Explorer, or fix your half-chick work in the panel! How much longer is this going to persist?</p>
