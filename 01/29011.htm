    <title>How to install Windows 10 OS onto Laptop with Linux OS - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to install Windows 10 OS onto Laptop with Linux OS</h2>
                    How do I install the Windows 10 Home OS onto a laptop with a Linux OS. I was concerned and before I placed the order for the Windows 10 OS Download I was ensured by Microsoft support chat there would be no problems if followed the links. I followed the
 links but the Linux OS doesn't seem to recognize the Windows auto run or set up files. Is there a process for this installment.

    <title>Achievements Not Unlocking Since August Update&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drjekyll uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievements Not Unlocking Since August Update&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.<br />
I noticed on the 15th of this month that despite completing the single player of '<em>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</em>' 100% I didn't receive any achievements.<br />
So I did a little snooping online and it seemed like other people were complaining about the same thing so I just put it down to it being a problem with the game and hoped it would rectify itself in time.</p>
<p>However two nights ago I was playing '<em>Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments</em>' and I completed the first chapter. No achievement!<br />
So my problem isn't localised to just Tomb Raider.<br />
<br />
I have since followed the advice from Support regarding the Power Cycle and deleting my profile but it still hasn't fixed the issue. I know this because after implementing their advice I tested everything by completed a simple Achievement in '<em>Sleeping Dogs:
 Definitive Edition</em>'... still no achievement!</p>
<p>Unlike other people in this forum complaining about their Achievements not unlocking, gamers who's system shows that they have unlocked the Achievement but it hasn't 'popped' onscreen, my Xbox One isn't even showing the Achievement as unlocked... it's still
 greyed out onscreen.</p>
<p>There may be more but following are all Achievements that I have definitely done and should have unlocked but haven't been:-<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</strong></span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Inconceivable</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The Professional</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lethal</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No Stone Left Unturned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A Survivor Is Born</td>
<td>75</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments</strong></span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Aye, Aye, Captain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</span></strong></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Tourist&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>Now after looking through my Achievements online I can see that the last one that was successfully acknowledged and recorded was on the 29th of July, the day before the latest Xbox System update. That can't be a coincidence?!</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to resolve this correctly? And why aren't Microsoft admitting that this issue exists? They seem to be quite dismissive of it.</p>

<p>If they don't work try a factory reset of your console,don't worry,you can now reset it without deleting all your installed content now.</p>
<p>If that still doesn't work then you need to fill out the survey in section 3 of the page I linked.</p>

    <title>How do I fix the sound on my laptop as there is no sound&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 24ggirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix the sound on my laptop as there is no sound&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Gateway Laptop model # MX6440 and have contacted Gateway for support and they tell me that they can only offer very limited support. They have made suggestions on how to fix it from their site, but that doesn't seem to help very much at all. I can't
 seem to find what it is that they are talking about, and everytime I contact them back and let them know I don't know where to look, all they do is give me that same answers over, and over, and over again.</p>
<p>I am running Windows XP.</p>
<p>I have used the Sound Troubleshooter on my laptop&nbsp;and the last thing that it suggested was to use the recovery disk that came with it to try and put the drivers back on there that should fix the problem I'm having, but it didn't work at all either.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter also suggested that I try and update the audio driver which didn't work at all.</p>
<p>The troubleshooter also suggested that I try and roll back the driver to last known good one that worked, but there was no known last good one that showed up at all.</p>
<p>I did these steps via the Device Manager Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I tried using the Microsoft Fix It Center, but it couldn't help at all either.</p>
<p>A word of note here that may help you to help me a little further: The Windows Sounds seem to be working fine, because when I have something to save for instance,&nbsp;on a&nbsp;Word Pad, I get the tone indicating so.&nbsp;The Windows Start Up Sound can't be heard and
 the same for Shutting Down the laptop can't be heard either as well.</p>
<p>I can't use the Volume Control on the Keyboard to turn the Sound up or down either.</p>
<p>When I try to use the Windows Media Player, it tells me that Windows Media Player cannot play the file because there is a problem with your sound device. There might not be a sound device installed on your computer, it might be in use by another program,
 or it might not be functioning properly.</p>
<p>When I try and play videos online that I know for sure have Sound in them, there is no Sound at all that I can hear.</p>
<p>I have actually gone into the Sounds and Audio Devices&nbsp;icon from the Control Panel and when I check the
Volume, Audio, and Voice Tabs, they are all grayed out inside there&nbsp;for some reason or another. This only leaves me to believe that somehow or another, that part of my laptop&nbsp;has gotten corrupted somehow or another, but don't know how.</p>
<p>Aside from having to re-do the operating system from scratch from the recovery CD to fix this problem that I'm having,&nbsp;as I don't have the time to do so and just need some sort of&nbsp;fix for the Audio drivers part, do you happen to have a fix
 that will clear up the problem I'm having with just the sound only with some kind of Audio Driver download&nbsp;to try and re-install the Audio Driver?</p>
<p>Please let me know if there are other Troubleshooting steps that can be performed that you may know of to resolve this issue that I'm having with my Sound.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may uninstall and reinstall the sound drivers from device manger and check if the issue still persists.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to uninstall the device:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<b>Run</b>, type <b>devmgmt.msc</b> and press <b>enter</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <b>sound</b> device</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right click</b> on the devices respectively and select
<b>uninstall</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Also place a check mark beside the option “<b>delete driver files for the device</b>”</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>That;s what I was saying earlier, I don't know where to find the drivers in their site as it's complicated. I've tried, but don't know which one it is or they are. I don't even know how to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;the name of the driver I even have. How do I find the&nbsp;name of

            <p>Do you have an answer to my last response to you? Please read it.</p>
<p>I haven't made any changes that I know of.</p>
<p>In the&nbsp;Device Manager&nbsp;that you wanted me to go to, to check the Sound Device to uninstall it, I don't know which one to do, and if I did, I tried to do all of them, and I don't get an option at all to uninstall any of them, nor
<strong>delete driver files for the device </strong>like you wanted me too as well also.</p>
<p>The only 3 optons I get for all 3 of them when I Right Click them are Update Driver, Scan for Hardware Changes, and Properties.</p>
<p>Please still bear in mind that I'm running Windows XP if that helps any.</p>
<p>I did also refer the article mentioned below for more information on sound issues:</p>

<h2>            Back up fails, task scheduler fails due to going back to windows 7 after downloading Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Well here I am just one of the ones who downloaded Windows 10 and found it horrible so went back to Windows 7 within the given time frame.&nbsp; Did not look at DELL to see, yep, my system: XPS 8300 will not work with Windows 10.&nbsp; DELL will not make new drivers
 for this system.&nbsp; So, now I cannot use the backup I get an error that the partition is missing or corrupt.&nbsp; I went to Administrative Tools, Computer Management, Disk Management and everything there says my system is healthy.&nbsp; If it is then why is this everything
 the Task Scheduler can do list a million error messages why it won't work.&nbsp; What am I to do?&nbsp; Should I take this crippled computer to a pro to get it back to where it should be a good working Windows 7 machine?&nbsp; Is it even possible a&nbsp;profession can fix this?&nbsp;
 I used Dell Data Safe Backup and made three System Recovery Disks way back in 2012.&nbsp; Can I use these without losing all my data?&nbsp; Data Safe Backup notice says to use them.&nbsp; I am so confused and at my wits end.&nbsp; Does someone have a simple step by step solution
 for a novice PC idiot.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that backup and task scheduler both fail and I will be happy to answer your query. Before you backup your data, its important that we make Windows 7 function stable without any issues since this could be due to system files missing/corruption.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, at first,&nbsp;I would suggest you to run System File Checker tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, type <span>Command Prompt</span> or <span>
cmd</span> in the <strong>Search</strong> box, right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:
</p>
<p>
</p><div><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></div>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>

            <p><strong><em>Win10 back to Win7</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a “Custom” install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit versions) KB3083710 and KB3102810 in advance, and store on a USB stick,&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; When you search for the&nbsp; 64 bit version of these KB’s specify 64 bit.&nbsp; The 32 bit versions do not say which version they
 are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3083710 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3102810 and restart.</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a
 precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you&nbsp;do <em><strong>not</strong> </em>want Windows 10 and wish to prevent it from being installed on your computer, follow this exactly as laid out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have followed the procedure below, and set Windows update to <em><strong>NEVER</strong></em>, once a month, start Windows Update manually, check for updates.&nbsp; When you get the list of “important” updates, right-click and choose
<strong>hide</strong> on EVERY update in the Windows grouping that does not describe itself as Security.&nbsp; Allow the Malicious software removal tool or any C++ updates.&nbsp; Do not use ANY optional updates or place a checkmark in any unchecked updates.&nbsp; Proceed
 to update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month,&nbsp;about 2 days after the 2nd Tuesday, they receive an email from me advising to manually start WU and then hide every update except for ones specifically
 labeled Security.&nbsp; In other words, only security updates will be applied.&nbsp; In all of 2015 and since, there was not a single update that&nbsp; improved Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may feel uncomfortable with the setting — NEVER.&nbsp; Well you needn’t be.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It should NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control
 and the responsibility of updating of Windows and Office.</p>

</p><p>Sorry to be so inept but should I just hit yes when that box comes up with typing in the sfc/scannow command?</p>

            The task scheduler is corrupt.&nbsp; So I don't think I would be able to use the Task Scheduler.&nbsp; I backed up my files using a WD external hard drive.&nbsp; I may have made a mistake as I also backed up my OS which doesn't appear to be too healthy.

<h2>            My Media Player keeps making copies of all the songs in the library.</h2>
                    Everytime I open Windows Media Player for my music I find that there are multiple copies of every song in my library. I have tried to delete the extra copies but they keep coming back with even more copies and then I get a message that says that media
 player cannot play a song because it can't find the file. Apparently when I delete some of the extra copies the file needed to play the song is deleted, I think. Why do I get so many copies of each song and it keeps progressing so that I can have 5 copies
 or more. Each time I delete songs and I go back I find even more copies. Now my library is all fouled up and music I have paid for and downloaded is lost and so is the money I had spent. What is going on?

<p>Sounds like a corrupted media library, so I suggest that you reset it. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
<div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi4.social.answers.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fresources%2fimages%2ftrans.gif%3fcver%3d2.13.0068.4" /></div>
- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt. Check if the issue still occurs.

            Have you installed the software for the touchpad? You may be able to get it from the HP site or from the actual manufacture of the pad's site.<br />

<h2>            Unsupported video type or invalid file path message</h2>
                    Good Day Group,...for a few days now when I try to download or even play a video on Youtube Downloader Professional, a 3rd party app that I downloaded from Windows Store, I keep getting an error message that says: unsupported video type or invalid file
 path. &nbsp;On 1/25/17 update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based systems (KB3211320 was successfully installed on my Dell Laptop. I don't know if this has anything to do with this error message I keep getting but it seems that's when the problem started.
 What can I do to fix this problem? Your feedback is greatly appreciated and thank you very much.&nbsp;

            Im having the exact same issue (hence how&nbsp;I stumbled upon this forum). I am also using Windows 10 on my RCA Cambio tablet that I just got for Christmas. I also am using the windows defender that came factory installed. It started with the music downloader
 "best mp3 downloader" and yes i tried uninstalling and reinstalling it several times. I also have had this issue with Simple mp3, one music download, and many others (i've probably installed and uninstalled 20 different downloaders including several youtube
 downloaders due to mainly this issue). I even get this message a lot with links that dont even include a video!! I also installed the windows update around the same time period mentioned. It seems highly unlikely that between the similarities in the issues
 we are encountering and the fact its not just one or two apps, that it is an issue in the app itself but more likely that it is in the update. I have also had several other issues since updating that are unrelated to this issue....by

            My problem has gone away and the bad part of this is that I don't know why this problem " magically" disappeared. I seriously don't know why. I know this posting is of no use at all but that's what happened. Good luck.

<br />
<b>1)Do u&nbsp; have a third party security software installed? </b><br />
This could be due to that... What are the different virus scans you are already having.. There may be third party firewall or security product which is interfering the windows firewall.. Disable one by one your security scanners and try to up the windows firewall<br />
<br />
<b>(2)</b>If you don't have such firewall product installed,&nbsp; this could be due to malware or some other problem...<br />
<br />
If you have an antivirus solution, up date its definitions, and do a full system scan..
<br />
<br />
If you dont have a antivirus solution or your one is not working, use one of the recommended tools

<h2>            Chromium won&#39;t work after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    So, after upgrading to&nbsp;Windows 10, Chromium isn't working for me anymore. It worked just fine with Windows 8 before I updated. Now, instead of going to the websites I want to use, it shows an error message saying "This webpage is not available," and in
 the details tab, says to either check my internet router, or allow Chromium to access the network in my firewall/antivirus. I checked the router and it's not the problem, and I have no idea how to do the firewall/antivirus thing.&nbsp;Help, please!

            <p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that chromium is not working after upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There a few programs which would not work as expected due to compatibility issues. Run the program compatibility troubleshooter and let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a) Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type “<span><strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e) Click on “<span><strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run as Administrator</em></strong></span>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f) Click “<strong><em><span>Next</span></em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not get general installation errors, then I would suggest you to reinstall the program and check if it works or else, reinstall the programs in compatibility mode.
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Right click on the downloaded executable (.exe) file.</span></li><li><span>Click on<strong><span>Properties</span></strong> and&nbsp;then select <strong>
<span>Compatibility</span></strong> tab.</span></li><li><span>Tick mark the option <strong><span>Run this program in Compatibility mode for:</span></strong> and then select
<strong><span>Windows&nbsp;8 </span></strong><span><em>(or any compatible OS version)</em></span>&nbsp;from the drop down menu.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click <strong><span>OK</span></strong> and install the program.</span></li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>I've been using SMS relay through the Skype app on my Windows phone to send and receive text messages for about 4 months. I'm going to give Android a try, so I came here to see if it will support the SMS relay feature. I hope Microsoft is able to add this
 functionality soon.</p>

</p><p>This answer is pretty frustrating. When did MS make the decision to go from "Yes, coming to Android soon" from way back in Nov 2016 to letting it be up to a vote on the MS answer forums? Every great step MS has done in the past 3-4 years gets tripped up
 with stupid and inconsistent crap like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not relly like that i think off :)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Just look at companyes Google has buy up there work togater close and make the service integreate nicely with echo other and in there products.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After you check the company microsoft has buy is like a war beetween the companyes even if skype owns by microsoft is dosent feel like Skype has ben a big part of other Microsoft products is feels like they dosent talking to each other, one office part just
 go one way and another company they buy go another way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is like more like civil war between different departments even if its own by the same company.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Every company one company buy is a good way get&nbsp;conversation with echo other and try make them go in the same direction :)<br />
<br />
Is not meant one company go one&nbsp;conversation and next company they buy another&nbsp;conversation is like is still diffrens company but owns frome the same company.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Google has ben doing a bettre jobb in the departments to have&nbsp;conversation and make them go in a direction some work with echo other.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft has start to get some controll over skype now and take advance frome Skype inbo other service, is start feel like they have a plan and go to same direction and goals but that is far way all companyes microsoft has buy doing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>is allways good way to know what one do and what next do :)<br />
<br />
Like this post Allen B talked like he did not even know that skype blog post had comfirm SMS relay for android, was confirmed for like 2 years ago soon.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And when not one employers know what next employers do its just make like&nbsp;A married couple who do not talk to each other as that relationship will last forever.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Menu and task bar become unresponsive &#43; more issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vacho rehanyan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Menu and task bar become unresponsive &#43; more issues.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a major issue on my laptop. After booting up my laptop, 1-8 hours later the menu no longer opens up, cortana does not work, volume buttons show change in volume but no difference in actually sound/ volume mutes itself and doesn't work, brightness
 can't be changed (either through the settings or shortcuts) and a few other issues. This was somewhat tolerable (mostly because a simple restart fixed the issue temporarily) &nbsp;and I expected a fix sooner or later, but today after booting up in the morning I
 got a message "Critical Error: Menu and cortana aren't working, we will try to fix" and it asked me to log out and log back in. I did this 3 times and yet it still didn't fix the issue. I did a restarted and booted through safeboot, this seems to have fixed
 it, but I am 99.9% sure it will become a nuisance in a few days or so again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I contacted Answer Desk and they did not give me any useful information, the only thing they told me to do is a windows 10 reset which would delete all of my programs. I am extremely frustrated at how unpolished and buggy the "flagship" OS of Microsoft
 is! It is unacceptable for someone to get so many issues! I would usually respond to such cases in modestly but this is completely infuriating! I demand a fix without affiliating my files or programs, I do not have the nerves needed to reinstall all of my
 ancient programs. After installing a program on a disk, I throw the disk away, I never keep them. I do not want to scurry through the internet to find a cracked/pirated version only to see that the new windows 10 anti-piracy system locks it out. And to add
 insult to injury it seems I am not the only one with this issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Shame on you Microsoft.</p>

I tried the fix someone used hitting the windows key and R, I get to powershell, it says to right click on the powershell icon and it will allow you to go to administrator to fix the problem. When I right click NOTHING happens it just sits there, so I am stuck.
 Anyone else experience that issue?

            For the first month everything worked great after updating my Windows 8 machine to Win 10.&nbsp; This week though I noticed my system tray icons became unresponsive and when I click my Start Menu button I too now get the dreaded popup prompt "Critical Error",
 "Your Start menu isn't working.&nbsp; We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in" with a "Sign out now" button within the prompt.&nbsp; After clicking the button to sign out now, upon signing in it just loops back into the Critical Error when I try again and again
 and again.&nbsp; I read this in my search to remedy my situation... :
<p>It’s a known issue in Build 10130 that sometimes causes the icons in the system tray to not launch the flyout that they are supposed to. Sometimes if you try for several times it starts working automatically.</p>
<p>If you still face the problem then try the following:</p>
<p>From the Start menu, search for <strong>task manager.</strong></p>
<p>Select <strong>Task Manager</strong> from the results.</p>
<p>Tap or click the <strong>Processes</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Under <strong>Background processes</strong>, select <strong>System Settings Broker</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>End Task.<br />
<br />
</strong>....but alas, I never found a process called System Settings Broker within my background processes so I'm stuck as well.&nbsp; With all of the updates these companies send out it amazes me that this stupid popup prompt doesn't have another button to report
 this "CRITICAL ERROR" to Microsoft for an update to be released for a remedy.&nbsp; It's a CRITICAL FREAKING ERROR yet Microsoft didn't feel the need to have it reported to them and instead puts it on their customers, you and I, to spend our own time hunting for
 a way to figure out a remedy for ourselves.<strong><br />
<br />
Agreed, shame on you Microsoft!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

            I fixed it by going to Ctl-Alt-Del, going to the Task List, then going to Windows Explorer and doing a reset on that app. All is well now.

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 Multiple Disc support&#63;</h2>
                    So, I've never actually paid any attention to WMP 11. But as of late, I acquired some albums (already in digital format) and let WMP 11 handle the "sorting" stuff<br />
<br />
Usually, they're in single albums, so WMP 11 said "no prob" to me, but when it comes to an album with multiple discs, WMP 11 said "what in the world are those?"<br />
<br />
Basically, what happened was, the songs are in the same album alright (for example: Album 1). But when I opened the album; instead of, say, more albums in sight, WMP 11 displayed all the songs in the same list, causing them to stack each other like this:<br />
<br />
1. Song 1 disc 1<br />
1. Song 1 disc 2<br />
1. Song 1 disc 3<br />
2. song 2 disc 1<br />
2. song 2 disc 2<br />
2. song 2 disc 3<br />
......<br />
<br />
and so on, and that makes me crazy, since I like my&nbsp;albums in "albums" instead of "playlists".<br />
<br />
In the ID3 tag, it's clear the&nbsp;album was "Album 1 Disc 1", "Album 1 Disc 2" and "Album 1 Disc 3" on the respective songs (seen, ironically, with WMP 11's Advanced Tag Editor), but WMP 11 simply put them in one simple album.
<br />
<br />
Since I can't do anything at all, I deleted them from my library, moved the Disc 2 and Disc 3 files to outside my personal folders, scanned again, and manually added "[Disc 1]" label on the album (from the Albums library, I edited the album name). Then I put
 the Disc 2 files back, re-scanned, manually added "[Disc 2]" label, and repeated the same process with the Disc 3 files<br />
<br />
While logically it's all cool, it feels weird and annoying to see one album separated into three "albums".<br />
<br />
Is it possible to have WMP 11 display them in one album but still in different discs?<br />
<br />
I recognized that there's the "original album" field under the "album" field, but what does it do? Will it group the albums like I wanted? I tried to use the "original albums" field on some songs but it doesn't seem to have&nbsp;cause effect

<p><span>Hi Raestloz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the forums.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s happening here is that it’s treating each disk as one album.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You will have to manually edit each disk info if you want to group them into one album.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Clicking on the album button will just rearrange your albums order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps explain it, sorry for the inconvenience.

    <title>2 windows 8 problems. Need help. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbymayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 windows 8 problems. Need help.</h2>
                    At Christmas I got an HP laptop that included windows 8. I had some fun with it. I left it on one night to convert some videos to another format, but in the morning the screen was flickering. I turned it off then turned it back on and it was working fine.
 But that afternoon, it got stuck in a loop where it looped between the start screen and the desktop. I eventually managed to get it into safe mode and tried to activate the refresh so I won't lose my files. But that's when I ran into another obstacle. I got
 an error that said.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There was a problem</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Restart your PC to try again</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It looks like something didn't load correctly. Restarting might fix the problem.nIf this happens more than once, you might also be able to find help by searching online for the error code.</div>
<div>Error Code: 80070490</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched the Internet for solutions but all solutions I found involved using a windows DVD which I don't have. Can anyone help me solve these problems?</div>

    <title>Skype App has no phone connectivity whatsoever - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype App has no phone connectivity whatsoever</h2>
                    MS forced me to use the app. The app is useless! There is not even an option to autostart with win in the settings, like MS does not want ppl to use it?!<br />
Phone connectivity does not work. I cannot enter a phone number, skype test call does not connect.
<br />
It also forgets my visibility settings. WTH? <br />
Total disappointment!<br />
I must try Discord.<br />
<br />
win10/64, skype ver. 12.1807.264.0&nbsp;<br />

Have a nice day,<br />

<p>Hi, Hans</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is true that there's no option to automatically launch Skype when you start your Windows device. And it is a known behavior of the app that when you leave it idle for some time or you minimize or close&nbsp;it, your status will automatically become inactive
 or offline. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate your calling issue, I am requesting for the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please&nbsp;try to connect with&nbsp;different Internet connection source and let me know if you'll encounter the same problem.</li><li>Do you have any malware software installed on your device? If you have, please disable it and monitor if the issue will progress.</li><li>What happens when you attempt to type a phone number?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the workaround to install the exe binary. It works fine now, as I'm used to skype working. See my other posts.<br />
If I try to enter a phone number in the app nothing happens, the cursor does not change, the app does not accept the input from its own keyboard.<br />
<br />
Your skype app is not even fit to be called a Beta release, yet you force it on your paying customers! An utter disgrace!<br />
<br />

    <title>Boot manager missing, recovery discs not recognized, OEM install so no - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Boot manager missing, recovery discs not recognized, OEM install so no install discs</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc suddenly booted with the message "Boot manager missing. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to restart."</p>
<p>I've tried to use as many online resources as possible but nothing has worked. I'm at my wit's end...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access BIOS, but nothing else [no advanced menu, command key prompt, no safe boot, no F3 recovery partition access]</p>
<p>PC Details:</p>
<p>MSi CR500 Model MS 1683</p>
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>I reset BIOS to load first from CD/DVD, and then put in the 1st and then 2nd Recovery DVDs that I had made soon after purchase.</p>
<p>It reads the 1st recovery DVD, but after prompting for the 2nd one, it just hangs [for hours!] as if there was nothing burned to it - the recovery process just freezes at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Almost all of the solutions I've found highlight using the original install discs [not included, just a OEM preinstalled Windows 7], or a recovery disc, of which the second of two seems to flounder and not allow any recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my product key, as it is labeled on the bottom of my pc.</p>
<p>I have an older&nbsp;Sony Vaio with Vista Home Basic SP2 and DVD that I can use to connect to the internet, download and burn DVDs to solve this problem if helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to use my product key to download something to the older Vista to recover the Win 7 pc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jonathan</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jonathan,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I would have you download Windows 7 tool from the following link and recover the computer.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you created Windows 7 USB/DVD, follow the methods provided in the link and see if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
