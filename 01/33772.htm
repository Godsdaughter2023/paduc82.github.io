<h2>            video rmvb and browsers</h2>
                    Dear all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For all I've seen so far it seams that it is impossible to play .rmvb files in surface RT.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also no other browsers are allowed... Is Microsoft becoming like Apple and doesn't allow compatibility and competition... it's a shame...<br />
I bought a Surface RT but I'm thinking about getting rid of it because it doesn't do simple things that i can have with any android tablet...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't believe this is the way... but what do I know...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If any one know how can I get to play .rmvb or install a different browser I would be most appreciated other wise I'm selling my surface.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;for the&nbsp;answer but, none of the players in the store play rmvb. Not even the paying ones.</p>
<p>Second there are sites like (<a href="http://www.wareztuga.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.wareztuga.tv</a>) to watch online movies and series that don't work with IE.</p>
<p>Finally to have the full experience of any device you should be able to try different softwares... if a company doesn't have the software should allow users to use other softwares other wise it os better to change OS.</p>
<p>One apple in the market its enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The site you mention tries to install other software. Not sure if it uses that other software to play the video, but if that is the case it doesn't really matter which browser you are using, you can't install any software that's not from the windows store.

<h2>            Unable to connect WD External HD My Book Essential Model number&#58; WDBACW0010HBK</h2>
                    <p><strong><u><em>Original title: I have a WD External HD My Book Essential Model number: WDBACW0010HBK
</em></u></strong></p>
<p>I have recently bought an External Hard Drive from Western Digital. To make a long story short 2 things are wrong.
<br />
The first is that it's not registering under the drive I initially assigned it. It was originally signed up as drive E and now it comes up as drive K. I just recently changed it to Z and it's stayed on that drive so far. Secondly which is the most annoying
 is that it no longer registers for any longer then 30 seconds. It connects then it disconnects constantly. I tried to pull the files off but I only got half of them and now it's so bad that it doesn't connect long enough to do anything. Anyways I tried to
 upgrade the firmware, it doesn't connect to the external HD long enough to update. I tried another computer it continued to have the same issues. Changing the Paths to something that wouldn't conflict with other drives. Tried different usb ports, turned off
 the firewalls and anti virus programs that slowed it down. I can't think of anything else cuz I've been at this for 5 hours straight but I'm sure I did more.
<br />
The basic problem is that it reads, everything is still on the EHD but It keeps connecting and disconnecting. I can get 1 file out every once in a while but nothing to big or else it disconnects in the middle of the transfer.

            Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I would highly suggest trying a new cable if it is not too much to obtain a new one. I agree that the fact that this happens on multiple computers means there must be a fault somewhere on the drive itself. I would contact the manufacturer to make sure
 you get the correct cable.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            SSD failed, Data mostly on separate drive etc, just need to get a few documents and profiles from backup</h2>
                    <div>
<p>These questions are not as complicated as they look. It's just that they won't make sense without a full explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I can explain this right, but about a month ago my 4.3 year old SSD failed utterly. About&nbsp;a week after I had done the upgrade to&nbsp;Windows 10. I later found out that this is about the whole life span for SSDs of that generation.&nbsp;I had almost all
 my data on a completely separate drive, and good backups, and install media for all the programs that I use, so it wasn't the crisis is could have been.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I lost a few documents in the My Documents folder that I hadn't transferred to the G drive, and more importantly I lost the user folders on several of my browsers and email clients. I just recently learned that you can move My Documents to the data drive,
 but I had tried to move all those profiles to the data drive, but evidently some of them moved back.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I just remembered that I had done a WindowsImageBackup in the middle of Sep and put it on an external hard drive. And I think that probably everything I want will be on there. If I had any idea of how to find it.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The thing is I don't know if you can go fishing in the backup for files, or if you have to install the whole thing? Since I don't want any of the executables, but only the data parts, it seems like it should be easy. And if you do have to restore the whole
 thing can I restore it to a new blank drive (bigger than the old), get the data and profiles I want then delete the whole thing?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>I have a new unused HDD that I am going to be using for something else and I could let it restore into that if it will give me that choice. Then I could get the stuff I want, and delete the rest, and then use the drive for it's original purpose.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>But I've read some horror stories on the internet about people who were trying to do that and ended up overwriting their new active drive unintentionally. Though they were looking for programs, instead of data and I saw some references to "they were given
 a choice to salvage the data at some point", but they wanted the programs, and in some cases the OS to be back and active, so this wouldn't work for them, but it would be perfect for me, if that is right. If you are offered that choice?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>The main image file is 52.6gigs so I think it probably is very complete. It's saved on an external hard drive. It's in a folder 2015SepWindowsImageBackup\Name-of-Computer\Backup 2015-09-13 114720, but I don't know how much of that is a default name and how
 much I created? The files are mainly .vhdx or .xml and there are 14 of them in the main folder, but only one big one.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>
<p>If I put the other blank drive in my tower, and try to restore the back up to it, Let's say drive I, will that be possible with out messing up my new C: drive?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Anyway if you can give me some guidance as to what is and is not possible that would be great.</div>



<div>
<p>I have my new active drive and data drive all up and running fine. Did a clean install of Windows 10 Home 64bit and it's great. I just want those data files and the profiles to go with my browsers and email clients. And I know they are there,or I think they
 are there. Anyway I've read 50 to a 100 pages on this subject or close, and can't find anybody who seems to know if this is possible or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any assistance,<br />
Michael</p>

            <p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>A system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your
 computer if your hard disk or computer ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it's a complete restoration—you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced
 with the contents of the system image. <br />
Although this type of backup includes your personal files, we recommend that you back up your files regularly using Windows Backup so that you can restore individual files and folders as needed. When you set up Windows Backup, you can let Windows choose what
 to back up, which will include a system image, or you can select the items that you want to back up and whether you want to include a system image.
</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer contains several drives or partitions, you can create a system image that includes all of them by following the steps in Back up your programs, system settings, and files.<br />
When you restore your computer from a system image, it's a complete restoration. You can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your programs, system settings, and files are replaced with those on the system image.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to take a backup using system image.</span></p>

            <p>As I said, my issue is not as complicated as it looks, if anybody has the time, patience and is willing to read the long first question, I think it's pretty answerable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've gathered. Really the only way for me to get those few files (and I don't really have to have them, it would just be nice) would be for me to put my old Windows 7 Home 64bit on my new 2&nbsp;Terabyte drive, after physically disconnecting my data
 drive and new active drive so they can't be affected, and connecting the new 2 Terabyte drive like I'm starting over. Then "recovering" from my system image by attaching the USB hard drive that has the image on it. Once I've done that I should be able to see
 all my files and copy what I want back to the same USB hard drive or a thumb drive or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I can format over the new 2 Terabyte drive to get it ready for the use I actually bought it for, recovering some files that were accidentally erased by a quick format during another computer build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of the answer above seems to be trying to tell me how to create a system image. Which I already know how to do and have done. Which tells me that the Microsoft Support Engineer doesn't understand what I'm asking. Whether this is because I didn't explain
 it clearly enough or some other reason, I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how to change the Boot order in BIOS, and that really wasn't part of my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asking the question, hoping there was some way to avoid the elaborate procedure I outlined above to get those few files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is, by the way why I don't use the regular windows backup utility. It backs up the drive in a way which is makes it impossible to just get a folder back or a group of files. It's and all or nothing solution which is probably great in some circumstances
 but would never be helpful to me. I usually back up by making copies of my Data Drive to another USB connected external drive, then copying those things I didn't get off the active drive, like browser and email client profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily most of my needed data files were not affected when I had the catastrophic SSD hard drive failure. All my working data files, my music, my pictures were safe on the separate data file and in any case backed up weekly to an external drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only recently learned that you can move those profiles and indeed your whole user profile to a different drive, like my data drive and am still figuring that out. If I had done that before the catastrophic SSD failure, I wouldn't be contemplating this
 elaborate procedure to get them back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just hoping maybe there was another way.</p>

            <p>fwiw </p>
<p>If you have used windows backup to make a system image you can browse that system image with file manager and recover any file or folder in it - move / copy /paste whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Disk Management, go&nbsp;to the menu item&nbsp; &nbsp;Action,&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;choose&nbsp;&nbsp; Attach VHD.</p>
<p>Browse to and select&nbsp;the larger usually filename.VHDX </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will then see this in your Disk Management window in the lower section as a new drive.</p>
<p>Right click it while in Disk Management and choose&nbsp;&nbsp; Change Drive Letter ..&nbsp; assign it a drive letter and&nbsp;it should then&nbsp;be seen in file explorer and will function just like a normal&nbsp;removable drive would.&nbsp;&nbsp; Browse to and grab what files and folders you
 might&nbsp;need&nbsp;-&nbsp;right click and&nbsp;eject&nbsp;the portable drive&nbsp;when finished moving stuff around.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>And it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With just a few keystrokes 'Mike P' got me into my backup and I was able to save my Firefox, Chrome, and Thunderbird Profiles; My Documents (there wasn't much in it, but a few files that I hadn't transferred to the Data Drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After ~50 people and posts gave me the line "You can't get just a few files out of the image, you have to restore the whole active drive, then you can get them"; it turns out that you CAN get just a few files from a whole image backup, and it's not even
 really hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really glad that I had made that image backup about 10 days before my SSD cratered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process was not without a few minor unexpected anomalies. Like when I got down to the User folder, at first it said it was empty. And I don't know if it prompted me, or if I guessed, or what, but I had to set up folder sharing on the User folder, and
 then, after a scary delay, the folders started appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to go down to my main user, to AppData, and to the different folders I needed, and copy and save them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for some reason, the Bookmarks.html file was missing out of my Firefox profiles, but there were recent backups in the cleverly labelled 'bookmarkbackups' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who knows,</p>
<p>Anyway it all worked out without the major machinations that I was afraid would be necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Major props and thanks to Mike P. He may be the only person in the world that was aware of this procedure. But now we have it posted for everybody to see.</p>

<h2>            Account hacked Gamer score change what do I do.</h2>
                    
<p>About a month or two ago I noticed someone got on my 360 because of the message that pops up about someone on another console on my account and I having been no where and no body knows my password and stuff so I changed my password and thought I got hacked.
 I took off my credit card and noticed my gamer score when from 80000 (or close to in maybe more or a little less) to 140000 ( or close to or maybe more or a little less). I added everything up and it added up to around 115000 Gamerscore so I didn't understand
 and some of the games I never even played or owned so I was confused. so I know got hacked. But then things got worst and know it said I only have 10000, all I want is my 80000 it took me a long time to get that much and I don't know how I will get that much
 again, for a long time.</p>

<h2>            Cannot delete application shortcut from desktop</h2>
                    I installed a program a few days ago (DraftSight 2017 in case it means anything) and part of the install process automatically added a shortcut to the desktop.&nbsp; Now, I can't delete it.&nbsp; I've tried dragging it to the recycle bin, right clicking and "delete",
 selecting it and hitting the "delete" key all with no success.&nbsp; It does not throw an error, it just simply does nothing.&nbsp; I've restarted the computer several times since I've started fighting with this.&nbsp; Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks!

<p>I don't think the fact that the drive was originally used on a Mac should be the reason for the issue. Especially if you've formatted the drive already.

            Hi Coral
<br />
<br />Go to Settings (gear icon on your Start Menu) - Update and Security - Windows Security
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access and check to see if you can use Turbo Tax
<br />
<br />If so, from there, you can add Turbo Tax to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent them from being blocked 
<br />
<br />Please do not leave Controlled Folder Access turned off permanently       
        </p>

<h2>            Is it illegal to customize game files</h2>
                    
<p>Its an offline game. What I want to do is just get a skin thats already in the game and copy it and change it with another file. So what i'm doing is just having two different characters but with the same skin.</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 Core experience</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>WINDOWS 10 Core experience</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Compare to old build the option to drag modern UI is removed. Currently it is included only 2 option minimize and maximize. Like to have
<strong>drag mode(resize) option&nbsp;</strong>also</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Option to <strong>hide </strong>Left navigation for files/apps on modern UI</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Option to have simple UI instead of tiles UIfor kids choice to change the UI like the<strong> Next Lock screen app
</strong>UI which is cool to start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for UI that is comfortable for children's, kids who spend more time on Games not on monitoring tiles updates etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Seamless integration of daily apps to switch between&nbsp;Daily apps include onedrive, photos, facebook, music, video, fresh paint, outlook (autosave of attachments in onedrive), skype, maps, office, store, xbox&nbsp;from browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Tablet experience for IE should do operations with gestures rather than clicks. Example while going to back pages,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Fat finger more tab space&nbsp;to open new tab and need some animation to look for all tabs in one gesture and switch</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) When I am in Tablet mode with modern UI full screen - opening a browser, office, file explorer is going back to windows mode which is not feeling good</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) In tablet mode search box when it expands - overlapped with desktop icons</p>
<p>
</p><p>9) Need stable improvements for skype app which takes lot of time to open</p>
<p>
</p><p>10) Photo app is struck with - checking this device for photos and photos are loading very slow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall feedback is more options are added for preview which is very helpful&nbsp;- but need to improve to be&nbsp;<strong>fast, faster&nbsp;</strong>(joke made from friend - why pc struggles to search in one desktop while web search is fast where it searches entire world),&nbsp;
<strong>smoothness, seamless integration in browser experience as I spend most of my time.</strong></p>

    <title>Regedit import issue error &#34;contains carriage return - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avant-guvnor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Regedit import issue error &#34;contains carriage return characters.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp;PC&nbsp;running a Windows 7 64-bit OS. I have successfully exported a registry key to a .reg file&nbsp;with regedit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I try to import this&nbsp;registry key using regedit, it does not import as it&nbsp;contains carriage return characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug or a known problem with regedit? Please advise. TIA.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Using regedit, I&nbsp;exported the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Illustrate registry key, which is specific to an application. The export works OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However any key (or subkey)&nbsp;that contains a registry value of type REG_SZ, whose data contains a&nbsp;carriage return character is exported correctly but is not imported. This behaviour is consistent for any key I export/import, not just the key mentioned above
 in answer 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; My entire registry is backed up daily using Acronis backup software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I did not make any changes to my computer before importing the registry file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, I still face this issue and I believe it is an issue with regedit in all versions of Windows where an exported&nbsp;registry value of type REG_SZ that contains a carriage return character cannot be imported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no error message, using regedit to&nbsp;export a&nbsp;registry value of type REG_SZ that contains a carriage return character DOES NOT import using regedit. It is that simple. Try it on your own PC.</p>

            This started for me out of the blue. &nbsp;A new computer. &nbsp;New Mouse. &nbsp;Flash drive. &nbsp;I can't find any real assistance, tried reading through forums, answers don't fix for others and so probably not for me. &nbsp;tried some. &nbsp;It's not a corrupted file, I'm pretty
 sure. &nbsp;It clears up if I unplug, reboot. &nbsp;The devices work, then just stop after a little while of use.

<h2>            humming or buzzing while in standby&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox one is in the "instant on" standby mode. It was in this state all night last night. I came downstairs this morning, and I can hear an audible hum from the xbox one. It is not loud, but I can hear it across the room. Any suggestions on how to fix
 this?</p>

<p>Hey MegaDiesALot,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late response and about the issue. Is it disrupting your gaming or is it just noisy? Does this happen when you are using a disk?<br />

<p>Firstly make sure you are running update Anti-Virus and check Security Center and make sure Windows Firewall is on.</p>
<p>Then run full system scan with:</p>
<p><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a></p>
<p>And remove all threats, then change your email password and security question and then ask people in your contact list to mark this person as Junk or Spam. If you hav email you may also try to report it to support of your email provider.</p>

    <title>Will not connect to Xbox Live when playing Xbox 360 games on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluecanuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will not connect to Xbox Live when playing Xbox 360 games on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Until recently we have been able to connect to Xbox Live while playing 360 games on Xbox One. This has been useful for saving our progress on the Microsoft Cloud. A couple of weeks ago my 5 year old started his Lego Star Wars Complete on the Xbox One and
 it stated during the opening screen that we were "Disconnected from Xbox Live". This means that he can not load his progress and must start from scratch. We are still able to play COD and other Xbox One games Live but as soon as we put in the 360 game we get
 the same error message. All the current solutions appear to be designed for the 360 console but I need a solution for the 360 not connecting on the Xbox One console. Any thought? Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the problem and solution in another form. Sounds like a common problem these days. All credit for solution is to BindiRoy1974 - THANKS!:</p>
<p>I GOT IT I GOT IT its now up and running,</p>
<p>Try this</p>
<p>#1 do a system restore , choose system restore keep games and apps. This will send you back to the very first time when you are setting up your console!</p>
<p>#2 type in email address of profile you are using</p>
<p>#3 put in your password</p>
<p># 4 &nbsp;just put in your time zone and other stuff like your setting up console then you will go to dash board try again with a 360 game. BAM it fired up gears of war 3</p>

<p><br />
Hello </p>
<p>With Docking Station you can connect all the cables for printer, Keyboard&nbsp;and mouse, charging adapter directly to the docking station.</p>
<p>So&nbsp;when ever you are using a laptop&nbsp;you have to just dock the laptop on the docking station and no need to re connect all the cables again.</p>
<p>This will help when you are frequently moving with the laptop.</p>
<p>Docking station will save your Time , apart from other feature&nbsp;it has to offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I started receiving the BSOD stop code 0x00000024 (0x00190203, 0x86D64310, 0xc0000102, 0x00000000) yesterday.&nbsp; I'm up to the challenge of trying to fix this on my own but need some help and was wondering if there is anyone that knows what I need to do
 or can help with some step-by-step instructions.&nbsp; I'm assuming I need to reinstall the OS (which is XP) but I'm not even sure.<br />

            That error usually indicates a problem in your NT File System (NTFS).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You need to start by running a chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; from the XP Recovery Console, but you are first going to have to get into the XP Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
Note that the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" idea to try Last Known Good Configuration is unlikely to help since that is not what LKGC does, that is not what it does and that is not what it is for, but you can sure try it if you want to.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Assuming that the afflicted system has a working CD/DVD drive and assuming that you have no genuine bootable XP installation CD, and assuming that you have a working system, you can create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required).<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

<h2>            Stuck in Other User login</h2>
                    I have recently reset my Windows 10 PC to remove everything apart from windows. I did this because my computer would not get past the " Windows cannot start properly and needs to restart" After many attempts i managed to get to the login screen with no
 windows setup whatsoever but I 'm stuck at the "Other User" log in screen. I didn't have any other accounts on my computer before resetting apart from my own and it did not take me through the windows setup process. Please help!
