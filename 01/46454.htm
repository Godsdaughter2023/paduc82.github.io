<h2>            Netflix stutter</h2>
                    
<p>Since the most recent system update I have had problems with video stutter on the netflix app. &nbsp;I have already replaced all my hdmi cables, coax cables for cable box and router, ethernet cat6 cable and wall splitters and the stutter problem has not gone
 away. This problem doesn't happen on live tv or other streaming apps. I have tried hard reset of the xbox, resetting router, reinstalling netflix app with no fix. Netflix has become almost unwatchable. Anyone else have this issue or know of a fix? &nbsp;I have
 noticed in forums this seems to be an issue that has appeared on more than one occasion in xbox ones life cycle. Please help.</p>

            <p>Hey StagierBubble83!</p>
<p>Since you mentioned Netflix is the only streaming service that this occurs with, let's start by making sure Netflix is the only app that is open. To ensure this, navigate to the Xbox One Home screen and close any apps that are listed under the primary 'Home' tile (the bigger tile with the currently opened app).</p>
<p>To close apps, highlight any of the 4 tiles listed on the Home screen under the primary tile, press the menu button on your Xbox One controller, and select 'Quit'. Alternatively, you can hold the power button until the console has fully powered down, power the console back up, and launch Netflix first.</p>
<p>Give both of those methods a shot and let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>Failed to connect to a Windows Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpmarsh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed to connect to a Windows Service</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Motorola SBG6580 Modem with 3 Desktops and a TV wired connections and 3 Laptops and other devices wireless. All the computers are Win 7 and the desktops are all 64 bit. I recently started getting this message on my son's desktop upon booting;
 Failed to connect to a Windows service. Windows cannot connect to the Group Policy Client Service. This results in Local area connection does not have a valid IP configuration. In the event log there is&nbsp; DHCP-Client event ID 1001 listed that corresponds to
 the rebooting of the computer. The text for this when you double click it is: Your computer was not assigned an ddress from the network (by the DHCP Server) for the Network Card with network address 0x00044B17E9B9. The following error occured: 0x79. Your computer
 will continue to try and obtain an address on it's own from the network address (DHCP) server.&nbsp; All other comps and devices connected through this modem work perfectly fine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help I can get on this will be appreciated. Please let me know what other info is needed.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for taking the time to respond.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I guess I should have said that I had already tried troubleshooters (believe me if it was THAT simple I wouldn't be here!) but I figured couldn't hurt and did it again to no avail. Likewise turning off the AV is no help either. I have run System restore
 and restored to the oldest point and that doesn't help.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My son was going to try something with windows firewall last night and found that it is not on and we can not activate it' the links under system security for the firewall do NOT work all others do!? Also if i try to get there from Control Panel /System
 and Security/ Administrative Tools / Windows Firewall with Advanced Security I get : "There was an error opening Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in."<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have run TDSS killer, Superantispyware and Malwarebytes and found no threats (though i don't have the latest definitions for Superantispyware and Malwarebytes.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to avoid a clean install if possible so if you have any other thoughts please pass them on. Thanks again. Oh and in answer to have I made changes prior to the issue, I had updated Windows ( Some 50+ updates( My son is terrible at doing that))
 and I had Installed and used Slim Drivers.<br />

            A couple of things...<br />
What are "Slim Drivers"?<br />
Have you power cycled the Modem (since that is what is serving up DHCP addresses)?<br />
Have a look at this site for some good information and instructions re: malware (you do state that you ran some apps, but did you do it in safe mode?)<br />
<a href="http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide/</a><br />

Hope this helps.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SlimDrivers is a Free program that checks and updates drivers on your computer when you run it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes i have power cycled the modem, twice this morning in fact.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp; I didn't run those apps in safe mode but I will now since i downloaded updated definitions for them also. Also ran Sophos Virus Removal Tool (not in safe mode =( ).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just ran System File Checker and am trying Tweaking.com Windows Repair tool at the moment (for firewall issue).<br />

            Be very careful using 3rd party driver programs and any tweaking programs as they are usually snake oil and can do more harm than good.<br />
<br />
IMO you should do the virus/malware check in safe mode first.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SlimDrivers Free is a CNET download with a 4star editor &amp; user rating which I installed on my own computer (the 1 I'm using for this) 2 months ago and have had no problems with it. Tweaking.com is a program recommended in another post on this forum
 by Brian M&lt; for the Firewall issue i seem to have but it didn't work.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that an AC Cobra in your profile pic. (eyes aren't what they used to be and that's a small image)?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh and I am rescanning now in safe mode.<br />

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I ran all the applicable steps from selectrealsecurity.com (couldn't do any of the online stuff obviously). The only thing of note is that when running the "reset.bat" file that they tell you to use I got (under windows IP configuration) "An error
 occurred while releasing interface local area connection: The system cannot find the file specified.", and again for "renewing the interface" same message. Other than that there's no Virus,malware or spyware. Lookin more and more like a clean install i guess.Let
 me know if there's anything else you think of.<br />

            <p>I FOUND SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM!</p>
<p>The crash of your computer during Windows Updates has caused that !</p>
<p>I had this issue on my laptop since November, and it really bugged me.&nbsp; I sifted through the event log and found the pattern of events that preceded the issue, and, probably, caused it.<br />
<br />
In short, the pattern is as follows: Windows updates run automatically as scheduled, and when reboot is initiated after the updates are finished, the computer crashes (probably during reboot sequence).&nbsp; When it boots up, it reports that the last shutdown was
 unexpected, and the issue begins to occur.<br />
<br />
I spent 2 days trying to dig out a solution from the Internet, to no avail, until I came across
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/list-services-running-under-svchostexe-process/#advanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>.&nbsp; It doesn't say anything about this particular problem, but it gives more information about SVCHOST process that starts many services, including Group Policy Client.&nbsp; It looks like during reboot a vital registry settings were lost during crash
 and Group Policy Client "don't know" how to start.&nbsp; Let me explain:<br />
<br />
There are two places to look in the registry:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</strong> this path should contain
<strong>gpsvc </strong>key (a folder), which is responsible for service parameters and configuration.&nbsp; I found that the key was intact, so, you do not touch anything here - just check that the key exists.</li><li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SVCHOST</strong> This is the most important path you should look into, as it must contain the keys and values referred in the key #1.&nbsp; Below are descriptions what must be present there.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>There must be Multi-String value called <strong>GPSvcGroup</strong>. My laptop was missing it.&nbsp; So, you should create multi-string value named
<strong>GPSvcGroup </strong>and assign it value <strong>GPSvc</strong>.</li><li>Next, you must create a key (a folder) and name it <strong>GPSvcGroup</strong> - this key normally should be there, but, again, it was missin on my laptop.</li><li>Then open newly-created <strong>GPSvcGroup </strong>folder and create 2 DWORD values:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>First called <strong>AuthenticationCapabilities </strong>and you must give it a value of 0x00003020 (or 12320 in decimal)</li><li>Second is called <strong>CoInitializeSecurityParam </strong>and it must have value of 1.</li></ol>
<p>Once you complete all steps above, reboot the computer and the problem will be fixed.</p>
<p>Video walkthrough for those who are not very technical is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/4m5KEmckWK4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youtu.be/4m5KEmckWK4</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/4m5KEmckWK4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/4m5KEmckWK4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
</p>
<p>I am so relieved I was able to fix it, and hope this will help others with the similar issue.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting.
<span>&nbsp;</span>From your issue description, I understand that you are unable to install HP LJ 3052, printer as it says drivers are not digitally signed.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you with this.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From where did you download the drivers (Is from HP website or from any download center)?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:

<p><span>After downloading the file, right click on it and select run as administrator and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: T</span></b><span>urn OFF
 the Digital signature and try to install the application.</span></p>

<p><span>This will disable the Digital Signature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Digital signatures are used to help verify file authenticity. A digital signature is an electronic security
 mark that can be added to files. It allows you to verify the publisher of a file and helps verify that the file has not changed since it was digitally signed. If the file does not have a valid digital signature, there is no way for you to be sure that the
 file is actually from the source it claims to be from, or that it has not been tampered with (possibly by a virus) since it was published. It's safer to avoid opening the file unless you know for certain who created it and whether the contents are safe to
 open. Even a valid digital signature does not verify that the contents of the file are harmless. You must decide if you should trust the contents of the file based on the identity of the publisher and where you are downloading the file from.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may have to contact the manufacturer to check if the firmware update is a valid update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To turn Digital signature on, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b>cmd”</b> on the Start screen.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click on it and select “<b>Run as administrator”.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Command prompt type in the command “Bcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks OFF” without the quotes.</span></p>
<p><span>This will enable the Digital Signature.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The driver is original, It was download from the link from Method 1.</p>
<p>I did the Method 1 and HP print and scan now well. </p>
<p>Earlier, Windows 8 also find HP 3052&nbsp;in the LAN and install It correctlly. I was surprised how&nbsp;HP was found by "searching in the LAN"&nbsp;and installed quickly too. But I need HP to scan also. Now by USB conection HP scans well.
</p>
<p>I tried to install MSI USB StarCam Clip webcam&nbsp;with nointegritychecks ON but It didn't work.</p>
<p>Webcam is not so important.&nbsp;&nbsp;The next&nbsp;device is Pinnacle caprure card. I hope It will works.</p>
<p>Thanks for advice, It washelpful&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Informa&#38;&#35;231&#59;&#38;&#35;245&#59;es Erradas ou inexistentes em complementos de jogos no Marketplace. Erros na compra de jogos.</h2>
                    
<p>Boa noite, </p>
<p>Estou desconte com a falta de informação dos complementos do jogos vendidos no mercado de jogos.
</p>
<p>Por exemplo: Modern Warfare 2 Resurge Pack, Nao tem as informações do conteudo do pacote, nao sei o que vem e para que serve. Desse geito nao vou comprar algo que nao sei o que é. Nao quero comprar gato por lebre, portanto espero que sejam atualizado todas
 as descriçoes e conteudo dos pacotes vendidos. </p>
<p>Outra coisa, veio no meu HD do xbox 250 GB 2 jogos de demonstração, Dentro do jogo existe um link para comprar o jogo e liberar o jogo completo e adivinha o que acontece quando clico la;
</p>
<p>Erro do mercado de jogos, operação indisponivel e aparece uma sequencia de codigo numerico e nao consigo comprar nada, esta a 2 dias seguidos esse erro.</p>
<p>Estava procurando na lista de jogos&nbsp;arcade o jogo do South Park Tower Defence e nao tem para comprar na live brasil.
</p>
<p>Ate quando vamos ter uma live incompleta e com varios erros. Muitos jogos que compramos do EUA nem estão cadastrados aqui na live Brasil&nbsp;para abaixar os complementos dos jogos.</p>
<p>E muitas coisas de propaganda eu vejo traduzido para portugues de portugal de vez de Portugues Brasileiro. Porque a nossa live está assim tao pobre?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 forma clara sobre o produto que está sendo adiquirindo, acredito que não há desculpa da descrição não estar disponível.</p>

<p>the issue started about 10 days ago.</p>
<p>no changes in software of hardware.</p>
<p>using WIndows 7.</p>
<p>step 1. clear cache folder. went to user\userA\desktop and there are no TIVO items there</p>
<p>went to C:\programfiles\TIVO\desktop\ and found cache.dll dated 5/17/2010 and deleted it</p>
<p>program would not start</p>
<p>step 2. uninstall reinstall. went to control panel - programs &amp; features - choice of change/repair chose change then uninstalled all.</p>
<p>reinstalled software. same result. popup starts, then another popup that says "cannot start TIVO desktop element not found".</p>
<p>switch to userB, click on desktop icon and TIVO starts. got a message there that a new version was available. clicked OK and it began an installation. new installation stopped with message "insatllation ended prematurely because an error occurred." went
 back to the icon and TIVO started OK.</p>
<p>switch back to userA, click on desktop icon and popup says "cannot start TIVO desktop element not found."</p>
<p>went back to programs &amp; features - choice of change/repair chose repair this time. appeared to be making changes then stopped with message "fatal error during&nbsp;insatllation"</p>
<p>reinstall software was downloaded from TIVO latest 2.8.1 files.</p>
<p>ran this by TIVO and they said it was a Windows problem.</p>

            thank you for those suggestions. some of them go back to 2003 and none refer to WIndows 7 so even to try to work around the fixes is not easy. each of those tips had a similar thread. they said to empty the cache folder and all would be well. going to
 userA, the one that does not work, the cache folder is empty already and it doesnt work. going to userB the cache folder had 50 files but it works. looking for something that is WIndows 7 related. anyway I still have the problem.

            <p>I am setting up a system (Windows7)&nbsp;that will have multiple users.&nbsp; Tivo Desktop only seems able to play for the user that installed it.&nbsp; I am guessing that Tivo&nbsp;modifies the settings in the C:\Isers\username folder and not in a common area.&nbsp; The solution
 would be to simply move those settings to a common area that all users would default to.&nbsp; Problem is I have no idea what to move and if they should be moved to the C:\Users\Default or the C:\Users\DefaultUser folder, or to some other location.&nbsp; Anyone already

<p><strong>Hi</strong></p>
<p><strong>I just upgraded from XP to Win 7 and it is not recognizing my SATA hard drive in device manager. It still shows me ATA. I tried updating the drivers from the Dell site but Windows says my drivers are up to date. Any clues ?</strong></p>

            If the SATA hard drive is detected and running in ATA modem, this means that the BIOS setting for the SATA control is set to IDE mode.&nbsp; This is to permit the install of Windows that can not use the SATA native modes.&nbsp; XP is one version of Windows that
 did not understand the SATA native mode.&nbsp; A lot of PCs were set to "IDE mode" so that most XP installs will work directly without the adding a drive via the &lt;F6&gt; prompt. If the Windows is working, I think it could safe to assume that all is correct.<br />

            Where should I look in Device manager ?
<div><br />
<div>Should I look under "Disk Drives"?&nbsp;</div>
<div>This option says "FUJITSU MHW......FFS G2
<strong>ATA Device</strong>"</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should I look under "IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers"</div>
<div>This option says "Standard AHCI 1.0 <strong>
Serial ATA Controller</strong>"</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think it should be the 1st one above, but what do you say?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a background .... the computer came pre loaded with vista which recognized SATA. I downgraded it to XP which did not recognize SATA and I had to do some hack stuff for the SATA thing to work. After clean instal of Win 7 not sure what has happened.&nbsp;</div>

What make and model Dell do you have? Have you contacted Dell to see if this is a known issue with your model PC?

            Dell Vostro 1400. I dont think this is an issue with the PC itself. Please note the "background" stated above. Also which option should I be looking at above in the device manager ?

            If the Windows 7 is showing the SATA drives as ATA, then your PC's BIOS has the SATA ports set to IDE compatibility modem (for XP.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You will need to change this BIOS settings to SATA 'native' mode instead of 'IDE' mode that XP requires.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, this may cause the installed Windows 7 to no longer boot.<br />

 there is a problem with the 32 bit section.&nbsp;No voices are listed from the drop down at all in the 32 bit sapi.cpl.If I run sfc /scannow it comes up with no problems.&nbsp;If I press the settings button on that tab I get the following error :</p>

            Well, i.m surprised you're even trying 32bit version in a 64bit enviroment when the 64 bit version of the text to speech works.
<div><br />
<div>Your reasoning is wierd. Personally i'stick with what works. You've answered your own question really.</div>

<br />
My caps lock and num lock keys lights won't light up when I turn caps or num lock on, I have recently contacted Microsoft technical support they told me to contact my manufacture which is HP and it's a laptop, they did't really give me much support so I am
 here no asking you people how to fix this.<br />

            Hello Marco818,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post.&nbsp; Microsoft was right about putting you in contact with your manufacturer.&nbsp; The keyboard is going to fall under hardware, thus only they can fix it or diagnose what's wrong.&nbsp; It could be something as simple as a loose power cable or
 burned out bulb.&nbsp; Either way, that would fall under HP's support.<br />
<br />

<br />Sure talking about C: not any other drive like a Phantom one?
<br />To better understand the state,
<br />Post a Screenshot of disk management.
<br />Open Disk Management by typing in diskmgmt.msc in Run Dialog box.
<br />Get a Screenshot and paste back in next reply:

            You can execute following to gain space on your computer
<br />
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Type Storage in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Storage &gt; Click Change how we free up space &gt; Down below there is button Clean now under Free up space now which you should press
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Type Disk Cleanup in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Disk Cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Analyze disk space
<br />You should analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one but my personal favorite is WinDirStat.
<br />
<br />TreeSize Freeware version - <a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />WinDirStat (Released under GPL license) - <a href="https://windirstat.net/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windirstat.net/download.html</a>
<br />
<br />4. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />5. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

            Hi Rizky, Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .
<br />

    <title>Deleted Folders Reappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustincabeal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted Folders Reappearing</h2>
                    <p>I was moving folders around between hard drives and decided to move the download folder location to a drive that would receive the most downloads. I didn't have the space I needed at the time since files were still being transferred and ended up having to
 cancel the move. Later when everything was done transferring I moved the download folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, at random because&nbsp;I've tried several things to make it happen and none have worked, two files continue to reappear. They're empty folders because they've already been moved to the new drive. I've tried deleting them obviously and changing the permissions
 of the folders. Both the ones that one stay deleted and the download folder. I even tried transferring the download back to default and not transferring anything with it and they still appear. Any help would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Well, I thought the folder troubleshooter had worked, but it didn't. One of the two folders showed back up several hours later and then the second shortly after that. I'll probably try a fresh restart of the computer since I can't find anything else
 that's working.</p>

<p>Actually, I figured out the issue. It was SyncToy, for whatever reason the hidden files were making the folders reappear whenever I accessed the location I had moved the folder to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the other things tried where an issue or helped. I check my computer every day for updates. The folder troubleshooter only checked the recycle bin and while I had an issue there it wasn't what I was dealing with. Hopefully, this helps someone else.
 Check the hidden folders because my goodness it can be maddening deleting something over and over and all the solutions don't seem to help.</p>

<h2>            Get Windows 10 now tells me that my CPU is not supported</h2>

            <p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you for the graphics display column to read. It was very interesting to read, but unfortunately it didn't help me at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did, and I believe that it helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I turned off my system, and did a cold boot, and did a F9 to check my system. That let me to a PC-Check to see how my computer was running. The Processor, Memory, and HD,&nbsp; all came up great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b767c25b-50f4-4a37-8c7a-b3c84822d724" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I went into Windows, and went to the Resource and Performance Monitor to do a test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was telling me that old files were still stuck in my system from LogMeIn that was causing an error to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error was:</p>
<p>ROOT\LEGACY_LMIINFO\0000</p>
<p>and there were 3 files in the Device Manager still loading every time I booted up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I deleted the files, ran the Resource and Performance Monitor to do a test again, and it was clear!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was my result this time:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69c8d8fe-ee49-4062-9f5e-c106733a2cd5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So hopefully, when Get Windows 10 checks my computer again, it will find a clean computer this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank-you for your previous help,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 with my Lenovo H505 model computer (I do not know all the specs), and every time I try to open a .exe file, a message pops up. The message is in a normal looking window with the .exe path at the top, and the error message
 (A device attached to the system is not functioning.) at the bottom. This is the only thing that happens, and I don't even know what it means. I&nbsp;just can't&nbsp;open .exe files (I at least&nbsp;haven't found anything else&nbsp;affected by it).&nbsp;I have no external hardware
 attached to my computer, so is it internal? I've made no progress with it. I'm stuck. I had no problems with it in Windows 8.1, but I recently did a clean on my computer, so I can't recover to Windows 8.1 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, if anyone has had a similar problem that they've fixed or just knows how to fix this, I really need your help.</p>

<h2>            no audio jack on NUC5i5RYH running w10</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">w10 running on NUC5i5RYK - installed drivers downloaded from Intel support site, including the "Realtek HIgh Definition Audio Driver for Intel NUC kits" version 6.0.1.7982 Release Date 1/7/2017<br />
<br />
i encounter <strong>Device HDAUDIO</strong><strong>\FUNC_01&amp;VEN_10EC&amp;DEV_0283&amp;SUBSYS_80862057&amp;REV_1000\4&amp;19d8f49d&amp;0&amp;0001 requires further installation&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;requires further installation in [Realtek High Definition Audio Properties].&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i have uninstalled/reboot/installed/downloaded this audio driver, but W10 states that speakers (earphones) are not plugged into the NUC's audio jack when they are.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
NUC emits sound via BT - and I can confirm the audio jack itself functions as it did when running Ubuntu.<br />
<br />
I brace myself for suggestions of troubleshooting, which I have already undertaken countless times - but hit me with your best shot.<br />

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />This might be a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

            Hello FNQer, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />Check under sound, video &amp; game controllers within Device manager &amp; choose Realtek &amp; update those drivers as well.
<br />
<br />You can also download the Intel driver update utility which will update the drivers.

            installed W10 Version 1607....installed chipset driver first, then rebooted, installed video driver, then rebooted, installed sound driver, then rebooted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
alas, W10 still states that there is no speakers connected - when it was connected, then plugged different speakers, headphones....<br />
<br />
i was about to install Linux on another SSD and run it on this NUC, just to confirm again that the audio jack works and to get sound emitted from this NUC....<br />
<br />
i heard there was a new build W10 released today (?)....but where do I go from here?

<p>this is how the other older posts ended.....<br />
<br />
obviously, people are making troubleshooting suggestions not based on personal experience.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are posts here in this community and elsewhere on the internet - where just like this one, the post dies without any practical (happy) outcome.&nbsp; my audio issue has been reported from years back, and despite these years there is still no readily available
 solution either from the product manufacture or operating system.<br />
<br />
the music stopped in this musical chairs, and I am stuck with a product which doesn't work as it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am also referring this audio driver matter to Intel - I wouldn't even call them unhelpful, as they have yet to respond to my question.<br />
<br />
It seems everyone - particularly Micro$oft and Intel - have just simply given up trying to provide a troubleshooting suggestion which works, hoping that I would go away.</p>

 my computer to run slower and slower untill eventually i have to reset it again.&nbsp; Is their any way that I can stop it from taking up so much space? Windows installs all the old out of date updates then it installs all the new up to date updates cant i just

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. First, t<span style="font-style: italic">he term "memory" is used to refer to the place where the computer holds the program and data it is working with at the moment. It's normally random access memory (RAM), but that can be extended with the page or
 swap file on the hard disk. The word "memory" is never used to refer to the space on a drive (whether that's a hard drive, diskette, CD, DVD, or thumb drive). Space on a disk drive is normally called "storage" or simply "disk space."
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Calling disk space "memory" isn't so much wrong as just unconventional. In a sense, disk space is, of course, memory, but the important thing to realize is that the word is never used that way, and if you do so, you do it
 at the risk of seriously confusing your audience. </span></p>
<p>2. Resetting the computer back to factory settings because of performance issues (or almost any other kind of problem) is almost always a mistake. Besides being a lot of work, if you do it without finding out what's causing you the problem, you are likely
 to repeat whatever you did that caused the problem, &nbsp;and soon find yourself back in the same situation. And if you have done this five times, that's apparently what's been happening to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Normally a computer does not run slower because disk space decreases. There is likely some other reason for your loss of speed (malware infection?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. You can't install Windowsu pdates anywhere but on the drive where Windows is installed: C:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.An 80GB hard drive is very small these days, and a 19GB partition for Windows is also small. There are various things you can do to savesome &nbsp;disk space, but they are all temporary measures, and you will soon find yourself back in the same situation. The
 only real solution to your problem is to get a bigger drive. Fortiunately they are very inexpensive these days; you can buy a 500GB drive for around $50 US.</p>

            Hi YesPlease2019
<br />
<br />If you are a gamer or you encode video, being unable to update that driver will seriously affect your system, otherwise your resolution may be off slightly, but other than that, there would be little or no visible reduction in performance . . 
<br />
<br />Try installing this device driver:

<h2>            How do I get Microsoft Ultimate Word Games to sync with the cloud</h2>
                    <p>I asked about this before , but the answer given doesn't make sense to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It appears that the answerer is saying that each device can only be associated with one Microsoft account. Is that true?</p>
</li><li>
<p>If the previous answer is "yes", how do I go about changing that assignment?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Does this mean that I have to create a new account for everything, or can I leave the current account alone and use the new account strictly for one program and easily switch between the two?</p>
</li><li>
<p>I keep trying to create a new account, but the system always seems to glom onto my existing account, whether I use my HotMail email (which my existing account uses) or my&nbsp;
</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>Gmail account. I can’t create a new account. How do I do that, once and for all?</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is there any way to either repair or delete a profile?</p>
</li><li>
<p>I get caught in a loop of sorts when I try to log into the new account, and the password I just created doesn't work. What's wrong? (Operator error is unlikely since I wrote down the new password and then copied it into the system.)</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I believe that at the moment headsets can only be used if they plug in directly to the controller, or through the Xbox headset adapter, which is jack to USB which goes into the controller.
</p>
<p>This means that the headset you use may not currently work on the Xbox One. </p>

                    So this is basically my last ditch effort as I've tried multiple times asking help with Microsoft and EA directly (which the game's publisher). I have the PC video game Black and White 2 which is about 10 years old. I've installed it and played it before
 totally fine on Windows 7 and 8.1, but when I had upgraded to Windows 10 the game is now failing to launch. I have tried starting it in administrator mode with every compatibility mode there is and still nothing happens at all when I attempt to start up the
 game. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game many times but that hasn't done anything either. I'm not seeing anything out of the&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;under the Windows&nbsp;Event&nbsp;Viewer either. I really don't know where else to go for help as I've gotten pretty much no
 help relevant to my problem. If any of you guys know of some kind of work around or something in which to help me get this dumb game started, I'd be really grateful. Thanks.

                    This message only displays at startup (resarts or normal start up) and just closing it lets everything work (seemingly) fine.

            <p>Assuming that when you close the message your computer runs fine, there is probably something in the startup routine looking for that file. When I updated my AVG virus scanner, they had a free trial of a utility that scans your computer and corrects errors
 such as something poining at a lolocation that no longer exists (since you removed the infected file).&nbsp; I think that is how I fixed the issue on my computer, but I'm not sure what it was.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Surface pro 4&#58; since last firmware update, complete freeze many times a day</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a couple of weeks back (after the last firmware update)&nbsp;my surface just freezes and a forced restart is the only way to fix it. This happens like 5 times a day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>it doesn't seem to have any pattern except the fact that it happens at a moment when I'm not active with it. Like getting a coffee, coming back and its frozen... It does seem to only happen when it's on battery (the level of charging does not seem to matter)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day it happend in the middle of a meeting where I was taking notes. Turned to speak to a colleague and look back and the surface is frozen. lost a number of important notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for me a complete deal breaker and I really hope someone&nbsp;has a fix for this. my surface is a i7 8gb 256.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asa&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>Okay my surface just froze. So apparently the last update doesn't fix the issue !<br />
THIS IS SO ANNOYING, PLEASE MICROSOFT DO SOMETHING ! (for real) </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I made the anniversary update and since then I have no problems anymore. But I couldn't agree more. This is so completely not acceptable. I paid like more the 1700 euro for my surface. And what you are experiencing is really painful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't install the anniversary update the do. Before that update I had more issues. like the whole store and all windows app were broken. I've tried every advice on internet but nothing helpt. Was indeed ready to throw my surface out the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily now I'm happy again :)</p>
