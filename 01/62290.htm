<h2>            Windows 10 Pro&#58; Desktop and taskbar won&#39;t load on startup.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I've never had any major issues with Windows 10 Pro which required asking in the community.</p>
<p>But today, something terrible is happening!</p>
<p>The desktop and taskbar just won't load up. The boot time seemed normal as usual, but after typing in the password, the welcome message seemed to stick there for quite a while. Earlier I was taken into the desktop right away after typing in the correct password.
 But to my horror after waiting for some time with the welcome message, I was taken to a blank desktop (without any icons) and a taskbar which just wouldn't load its stuff. I know that taskbar might take a while to show everything up properly but, this time
 it just won't do anything. Of course I first tried to do a right click &gt; refresh as everyone would do for the first time, but any form of clicks won't work. Also if I take the cursor over the taskbar, it would show the blue processing wheel sign. I locked
 it by pressing windows + L and shut it down from there (clicks seem to work fine while in lockscreen), and again turned it on after a while. No luck... The same thing keeps happening on and on, no matter how many times I turned off and on. I dived a bit deeper
 and rebooted into safe mode, but the same thing happens there too, in safe mode, to my disbelief. Although... It felt like windows was trying hard to load things up but something was hindering it from doing so. Later I also managed to open task manager, only
 to see that the CPU and disk usages were 100%. Not to mention, everything is so laggy and freezy at this point. Even opening and closing task manager would take minutes. From task manager, I tried to disable everything from startup, thinking that a program
 might be the culprit, but no luck again. Then from the task manager, I ended the explorer.exe task and ran it again as a new task, but that didn't do the job either.</p>
<p>This was everything I could from my side. Everything (including cursor movement) is super duper laggy which makes it almost impossible to even open the start menu. After leaving my laptop open for some time, I noticed that some pinned programs started appearing
 on the taskbar but they were gone instantly followed by a black screen and the same old faulty taskbar again. Note: Desktop icons never ever appeared, not even for an instant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is something which happened yesterday that might have caused the issue (I'm not sure though):</p>
<p>The laptop was plugged in and charging well until I removed the pin and it went crazy. It just froze (partially) and became un-responsive to clicks and buttons presses. I somehow managed to shut it down, but I think it wasn't a proper shut down after all.
 I think it shouldn't be a software issue because everything was going fine until yesterday's shut down and today's turning on.</p>
<p>I badly need help!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so very much in advance, for acknowledging my issue and helping me to solve it.</p>

            Hi ListenToPANDA 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Are you by chance in tablet mode? Press Windows Key+A to open Action Center &gt; See if tablet mode is on? If yes, click it and it will turn grey.
<br />
<br />Please let me know the results to advise you further on this issue, if needed.

<p>Hello Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the fast reply. Unfortunately, it doesn't respond to Windows Key + A. At this time, everything is so laggy. One more thing: I clicked on the start button and after a minute (it's so laggy), it displayed the start menu. The start menu shows signs
 of a reset. Like, the way I arranged the tiles in the start menu, they are not like that anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I am able to boot into safe mode normally and also I can log in with the password. But the issues which happen in normal mode, happen in safe mode as well. Let me try the rest steps and tell you how they go.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi ListenToPANDA, most likely you are in a Temporary Profile, caused by a Windows Update
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around 
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times in a row, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see a user folder that look like yours? 
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.) 
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time 
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

<p>Hey Dave. Thanks a lot for the advice. I'll try it as soon as possible and report back. So you said "before I try anything", but I already tried system restore and startup repair as recommended by Vijay. But, none of them solved the issue. I hope that won't
 affect your method.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>From the explorer.exe error message I got, I googled and found out that an I/O error is usually related to HDD issues.</p>
<p>When I open command prompt from the advanced restart menu, I see an X: drive instead of a C: drive. What could that mean? Is it time to visit a service centre?</p>

<h2>            Eraser is intermittent on Surface Pen 4 &#47; Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I am on my third Surface Pen (2 x 3's first one failed and when the warranty replacement stopped working I had to buy a 4 at my cost). &nbsp;It worked excellent for a while but now it intermittently will not erase in One Note (I really only use the Metro app).
 &nbsp;When trying to erase i usually get the same cursor on the screen I get with the pen tip. &nbsp;Sometimes it erases, most of the time it will not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating so I thought I would try to post here. &nbsp;Yes I have installed all updates and cannot see anything to adjust in settings or in the Surface App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This (the Surface) is such a good piece of hardware but I do continue to have "buggy" issues that really frustrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help</p>

<p>There is a fan page that has the story in chronological order including the DLCs.</p>
<p>List goes in order from top to bottom. Items marked with ^ are stories narrated by the NPCs in the past tense after the events happened, and that with + were actually never happened but nonetheless form a Vault Hunters' legendarium.

            Correct. All of them are great games, but you can tell Pre-sequel was done by a different studio. It was done by 2K Australia, which shut down.

    <title>Change Tile Size on Start Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopher brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Tile Size on Start Screen</h2>
                    <p>I know how to reduce the tile size from a double wide to a single square tile. The question I have is how can I shrink all the tiles smaller so that I can see more tiles on the screen. I've noticed that when I restart my Surface, all the tiles are smaller
 on the start screen and I can see much more of them. It's like the resolution is higher or something like that. But after opening a few apps, the start screen goes back to normal. Has anyone else noticed this? Does anyone know how to make all the tiles permanently
 smaller so there are more tiles visible on the start screen?</p>

            Hi Christopher,
<div><br />
<div>You can pinch to zoom, which allows you to see more icons. If you fully zoom out, you can also use this mode to easily Name your Groups or re-order them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pinch means that you pinch your thumb and forefinger together or move them apart on the touch screen of your Surface tablet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For more information, please read:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/rearrange-tiles-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rearranging tiles on Start</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!<br />
David</div>

            I already know how to pinch and zoom. I'm referring to having slightly smaller tiles all the time to fit more on the screen. If I could, I would post a picture of my start screen after restarting so you know what I'm talking about.

            It doesn't make sense. I just restarted my Surface and the tiles are normal (3 rows). I'm pretty sure that I saw it do 4 or 5 rows after a restart yesterday. Ultimately I would like to see 4 or 5 rows on the start screen so that I wouldn't have to scroll
 as much.

            You can post a picture of your smart screen, just hold the windows key and press the volume up button. The screen will dim and a screenshot will be in your pictures folder.

            <p>Hi everyone, I had the same situation this morning (4 rows of tiles instead of 3) and I kinda liked it. But then I flipped the screen to portrait and when I flipped it back to landscape the screen came back to 3 rows.
</p>
<p>It would be cool to be able to set the number of rows manually. If anyone knows how, please drop a message here</p>

            Yes, after the updates today was the first time I have seen it. Like the others, it changed back to 3 rows after moving away and coming back to start screen. I also agree, the 4 rows was very nice.&nbsp;

<br />
you are right, it has happened to me .. AND I LOVED IT... I had at least 4 rows.. everything was smaller.. exactly how you said... as if it had higher resolution... but then it disappeared!<br />

<p>I went through some fun with EA's customer support, but if you already have an Origin ID, you need to use the computer-based Origin client to attach the ID to your Live account. You have to go to the "add friends" menu and go through the Xbox Live link-up
 workflow (you know, because that is intuitive). There's absolutely no way to do this via EA's or Origin's websites.</p>
<p>For someone like me, who doesn't (and would never) use the filth that is Origin on my computer, this wasn't worth it and I just entered a new ID in the field when signing on to multiplayer on the Xbox. I feel really bad for DICE, creating a pretty good game
 and having EA stuff Origin into it.</p>

<p>This is the dumbest thing I've ever had to face when dealing with a new game. It has a email address I forgot I had from 9 years ago. And when I put my ID in say it's in use to someone else. NO SH*T I am the other person trying to make the worlds merge so
 I can play online. EA games please go away and burn Origin before you go.</p>

<p>lol ...good luck guys on getting honest customer support with either XBL or EA (origin) ....I had a recent issue where an error message wouldn't let me play, EA/Origin said my email was no longer valid on BF4's main menu ...when I entered a new alternate
 email I often use it said something about the same email (which it clearly wasn't) ...in the end it turned out to be a glitch that righted itself the next day or two, prior to that though I contacted EA/Origin support online and they told me to contact XBL
 and XBL told me to contact EA/Origin ...both said it was the others fault and therefore "not their responsibility" ...if Texas Roadhouse cooked my dinner like this ...I'd be getting a free meal</p>

            Hi Saif
<br />
<br />I am sorry, that drive will not be recoverable, it has failed . . .
<br />
<br />You will find lots of 'fixes' on the Internet, none of those will work, they are a waste of time, I am sorry, but that is the truth . . 
<br />
<br />USB Pen Drives are a great way to transfer files between PC's, they are not meant as permanent storage, because they are very volatile and can fail at any time . . .

Is there any option for you to right-click on the program's Shortcut, or .exe, and take the "Run as Administrator" option?<br />

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to clarify what the previous Community Forum Moderator suggested. Once you follow the steps that he provided, you will need to click on
<strong>Get Assistance</strong>, <span>and then follow the instructions in <strong>
Quick Assist.</strong></span><span>The 6-digit code will be provided by the one who will assist you. He/She should choose
<strong>Give assistance</strong> instead to be able to get the 6-digit code.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You will request assistance from a helper (either a friend or Microsoft Support). Both start Quick Assist and the helper sends a security code to the person who needs help. The person who needs help enters the code and gives permission to the helper,
 who is then able to take control of that person’s computer and provide assistance over the remote connection.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do let us know if you have further concerns.</span></p>

<p>Dear Rey</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern but as I am on old guy trying to sort out a problem with high CPU usage caused by svchost local service (no network) (3) I became flustered and didn't comprehend the meaning of quick assist as in 3rd party help.&nbsp; It isn't what
 I wanted as I thought it meant help from Microsoft itself.&nbsp; I won't trouble you any further but thanks again and Happy New Year to you</p>

    <title>Skype Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normanrose2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Updates</h2>
                    <p>We run latest Skype on a PC, Win 7 Pro, latest version. We also run Libre Office 5.4 on the PC. Whenever Skype updates, it uninstalls Libre Office completely, including the Help files too. It's as if LibO was never installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea why this happens? Other than LibO and MS Office are competitors? :-} It's very frustrating. Happens every time Skype updates. I keep a LibO Install icon on the desktop now, it happens so often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is there a way to stop Skype from updating? The old version did everything we needed long ago.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>WMP 12 Allow Internet Access cannot be enabled - a bug&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> autarctk  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP 12 Allow Internet Access cannot be enabled - a bug&#63;</h2>
                    I've been having trouble with two of my computers, both running Windows 7 Professional edition. Windows Media Player 12 has an option to stream media over the internet, an option called "allow access to home media..." I have correctly linked both computers
 to a Windows Live ID, as directed. <br />
<br />
The problem occurs when I try to enable the option to "allow access to home media." Normally, you would select this option, and (assuming you've already linked a Live ID), then you would get a UAC prompt, and then a confirmation that internet access is now
 enabled. Now, instead, there are not one but&nbsp;two UAC prompts, and the option is never enabled. Very frustrating. Both prompts come from wmpconfig.exe with the option -RMESharingOn. Both apparently fail, but with no error message. Is this a bug or perhaps something
 is blocking the action? All other streaming options can be enabled. <br />
<br />
One last thing to note: I've had this problem for some time on a desktop build that had the professional edition installed from the start. My laptop originally had the Home Premium edition of Windows 7, and never had this problem. I recently&nbsp;clean installed
 up&nbsp;to professional, and the problem exists on it as well. Perhaps it is tied to the professional edition?<br />
<br />
Thanks ahead of time for your help,<br />

<p>Okay, I just figured out my problem.&nbsp; Previously, I had set the "Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service" to disabled to reduce overhead because I wasn't using it.&nbsp; All I had to do was re-enable it, and voila, Internet streaming can now be enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start -&gt; type "services.msc" -&gt; enter </li><li>Scroll down and find "Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service"</li><li>Right-click on it -&gt; Properties </li><li>Change the startup type to "Automatic (Delayed)" </li><li>Click on the button to "Start" the service </li><li>Click Okay </li></ul>
<p>After doing this, I now get the confirmation dialog when trying to enable Internet Streaming in WMP.</p>
<p>It seems to me like this should be considered a lack-of-proper-feedback bug.&nbsp; WMP should check to see if the service is running when a user tries to enable Internet Sharing and give an error message if it is not (or even better, give the user the option
 to enable it without having to use services.msc).</p>

<h3> camden narzt  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to display windows version as watermark on desktop &#40;the way windows 7 beta does&#41;</h2>
                    I have been scouring the internet for a while now (since the Windows 7 beta released) because I love how the OS version is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the screen, it's clear and specific, and I wanted to do that with all the OS's on my
 computer, so I turned to google for help and all I could find was how to do this with XP, which while appreciated (I already knew about tweak UI) didn't help with VISTA which seems impervious to being shown off, I kinda want people to see which version of
 vista I use because I never have any problems that aren't my own fault. <br />
<br />
I really really don't want to simply add the text to every wallpaper I am ever going to use, not to mention that text in pictures tends to scale badly.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Home Display language missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wongbrian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Home Display language missing</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My PC is on Windows 10 Home and my language pack downloading has some issues. In the picture, you can see that the UK English is missing the display languages symbol and is not on the menu for selecting display language. I've tried to uninstall and reinstall
 the language and change it from Lpksetup. Then on the bottom you can see that US is overriding other languages but when i go to advanced, US wasn't overriding other languages so i set UK to override but it stills says that.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e02b4c41-c010-4bea-8dd9-0696ff99b885?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e02b4c41-c010-4bea-8dd9-0696ff99b885?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I live in HK and windows keep adding keyboards like English(Hong Kong SAR) US keyboard and&nbsp;English(Hong Kong SAR) UK keyboard that doesn't show up in the languages tab. I managed to get rid of the UK one by using Lpksetup but the other one is still here
 and Lpkstup doesn't delete it. Please help me find a solution!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d776fd5-f27e-4c16-b555-4c3e5d68cdfe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d776fd5-f27e-4c16-b555-4c3e5d68cdfe?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi wongbrian, there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10. Microsoft are aware of this issue and hopefully are working on a patch . . . 
<br />
<br />For the moment, please try this workaround to set your preferred input language:
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Run this command to get a list of installed languages on your PC 
<br />
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />Note down the LanguageTag of your preferred language 
<br />
<br />If say, your preferred language is US English, run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />Then run this command to set the order of installed input languages 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC       
        </p>

    <title>Skype will not open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> veronicajfrost  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype will not open</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to use Skype so clicked on it to open it. Nothing happened other than the Skype bar at the top of the screen appeared. The only word appearing in the bar was Skype - the only option available in it was Quit. I couldn't open a window to view
 my contacts or make a call or for any other reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dragged it into the trash, deleted the trash, restarted the MacBook Pro and downloaded the newest version for mac. I installed it but the same problem occurred. I looked at the item in the Applications folder and even though i had only just (on 22/12/18)
 downloaded and installed this version, the installation date said 17/11/17, which must have been the last time i installed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions as to how i can fix this problem? I'm overseas and would like to be able to call home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>Have you eject the disk of old Skype? If not, Skype old version will be opened when you open Skype from dock icon. To eject the disk of old Skype, open finder &gt; under devices, right click on all Skype icon and click on Eject. Then, try to open the new downloaded
 Skype and check if it will work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows Vista.&nbsp; I have read that Microsoft sent a security&nbsp;update&nbsp;patch&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop AutoRun working on Windows Vista.&nbsp; I tried to reverse this using their Fix but it did not seem to help.</p>

<p>There was obviously something fundamentally wrong with the laptop, although it will be interesting to see if&nbsp;AjutoPlay still works when all of the Microsoft updates have been reinstalled!</p>

    <title>Problem with &#34;consider replacing your battery&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stijnvanrijkel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with &#34;consider replacing your battery&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So my problem only started this morning, when i left my laptop for five minutes. I guess it was at about 50% power then (see further on in the post), but it surely wasn't in need of recharging as quickly as possible. When i came back my laptop had shut down
 and upon pressing the power button wouldn't power up. So i plugged it in and powered it up normally ("didn't shut down properly" message appeared, i was like "No ****, Sherlock").
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So next thing i know is that it showed the "consider replacing your battery" icon and that it showed my battery was at about 2%. At this i kindof freaked out. I let it charge to about 30 % (and this went rather quickly IMO, but i can't be sure about that
 since i'm probably seeing problems everywhere right now) and then unplugged it. The red cross dissapeared and a new icon (white cross in red circle) started blinking above the meter saying the same message. Plugged in again, unplugged again and miraculously
 it was gone, AND(!) the meter said i had 67% remaining, not the 30% before i did this "plugging trick".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normal use ensued (unplugged), but at near exactly 50% the laptop shut down again, no warning given. I panic, try to reboot, doesn't work, plug it in, boots up, and it says the exact same message, with about 2% battery. This has happened 4 times in a row
 now, i've been trying to browse the internet and try to find solutions but i can't seem to find any others than "buy a new battery", which is not really an option at the moment, and "type this in CMD, see what happens", which i don't understand how to do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i think happens is that somehow my battery was not fully charged, but it read too much. So when it actually runs out the meter says there should be 50% remaining. I think this because on trying to reboot the power button doesn't work unless plugged
 in, which i take to mean that the battery has to be factually empty. So upon booting plugged in it somehow shows the actual level (2%). Upon doing th "unplug-plug-unplug" trick it somehow causes the false read on the battery's level (an offset adds to the
 readig somehow, with me about 50%). When this false(!) level reaches 100% it tells the laptop (with the ASUS USBCHARGER+ program, i guess) to stop charging (even though the battery is only partially charged at this point). So when the actual level drops to
 zero it can't give warnings because the measurement is false. So it just shuts down.
</p>
<p>Again this is what i think happens, question is: WHY? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i'm trying as i'm typing this is, let it shutdown "weirdly", plug it in but ignore the message and let this charge to full. After that i do the "plugging" trick to get rid of the error message, and hope this charged it fully. If anyone has any suggestions
 for me, i'd greatly appreciate it. My exams have just started and i don't want this problem to interfere, as i have a lot of notes on my laptop (already made a back-up on USB, but i still need a laptop to read them). Thanks in advance! -s PS: Laptop info:
 Asus X5QS, intel core i7 (2.00GHz), Nvidia GeForce 555M (2GB), etc. Feel free to ask more if needed to solve ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[EDIT]:&nbsp;20 minutes after 100% and battery test starting i'm at 81%.</p>
<p>[EDIT2]: at 52% i had 57 minutes remaining, and a few seconds later it shut down again. Same scenario as before, 2% and the red cross over the meter. I'm getting tired of this shenanigans.</p>

Okay so this thing kept happening to me and i found out how to do the "cmd - powercfg-energy" thing to run an energy consumption diagnostic test. Apparently the battery only charges 37% of it's capacity (on last charge).  



I've been reading a little and get that apparently 40% is the boundary after which you get this error. Now what i don't understand is that this happened so suddenly. Yesterday everything was still fine and i could see the battery going down to about 7 % before i plugged it in, and everything chaged up as it should, everything worked fine. This morning i get this weird stuff.  


Now, ok, if my battery is really dying i'll get a new one, but it's weird that it happened so suddenly. Especially with the battery level indicator, why the **** is it not showing the actual level of it? I could honestly live with it truthfully saying "you only have 10 % remaining", but instead it now says "you got plenty, about 60%" and i dno't plug it in and thereby lose all my work when it reach

            <p>I am terribly sorry for posting this a s a reply, but otherwise people reading thi might get the timeline screwed up.
<br />
<br />
When i got up this morning i booted up my laptop, which wasn't plugged in, and it showed that there was 39% remaining, a value which i somehow couldn't reach yesterday. So i used it until it got to 11% which is when it gives the warning to plug in, and i did.
 Everything seems to be working fine right now, so i guess my problem has solved itself somehow. Might just have been a bug.<br />
<br />
What is strange however is that this happenedovernight, without me actually doing anything different. Still, if someone has more information on this, i'd be very eager to hear it.</p>

            Have you tried powering off and on (the monitor)? Another thing to check would be for updated video drivers.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have a new system that never logged into Skype for Business before when he had the picture set of his daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I logged in yesterday there was no picture for his account, just the default silhouette, but today I logged in and his account has the old picture of his young daughter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He did not change his settings and set that picture as his profile picture again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the picture coming from?&nbsp; He would like it removed completely due to the professional nature of his job role now.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Install the KB2919355 Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days ago I received windows updates and was able to install all except the&nbsp;KB2919355. I tried twice installing this update, but failed. After the restart for completion of of update this update&nbsp;works until it reaches 30% after that it stops working
 and a message comes that says that your compute has turned into a problem and we're fixing it. But the auto fixing which starts with
<span>
<span>
autorepair</span>&nbsp;and diagnostics but never succeeds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all three attempts, I have to opt for the advance startup option and then boot in the
<span>
<span>
safemode</span> with networking, which take like 12 minutes to to undo the update that was not succeeded. &nbsp;Please suggest what to do. I have read that this update is crucial for the future security updates and I am afraid that I may not be able to install it.
 &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Arif,<br />
<br />
1. Which antivirus program is installed on the computer?<br />
2. What is the exact and complete error message you get when you install KB2919355?<br />
3. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
This issue might occur due to corrupt Windows Update components.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if you are able to install the updates. Follow the methods mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run the Windows Update troubleshooter:
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer once after running the troubleshooter. Check if it fixes the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to download and install the update manually and see if that helps from the following links:<br />

            <p>I have exactly same problem as M_Arif. </p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those 3 methods helps to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using HP ProBook 450 with no third party antivirus software only Windows Defender. I have installed Microsoft Office 2013 and Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you notice that the installation step finished without errors. The problem occurs after hitting the Reboot button. It shows Configuring updates do not turn off your computer until exactly 30% then suddenly reboots and I have to repair windows using previous
 system restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Update History the update is shown with status Pending Restart and error code&nbsp;80242014.</p>
<p>In Event Viewer I can see critical event with ID 41 and source Kernel-Power which says:&nbsp;The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this additional information will help to resolve the problem.</p>

            <span>Hi Arif/Peter,<br />
<br />
The issue could also be due to some third party programs causing the issue. I would suggest you to disable all the antivirus and firewall programs, perform clean boot, download and install the update from download center.<br />

<br />
Note: Follow <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable

</p><p>with all due respect - it seems that <strong><em>the attacks we should be the most concerned about

    <title>How can I recover data from a RAW drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zadion  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I recover data from a RAW drive&#63;</h2>
                    Approximately a month ago my laptop's primary INTERNAL (emphasis on this because every question I've found so far is on external) hard drive became corrupted. Completely randomly, with no signs of imminent failure, my computer crashed and it refused to
 boot windows. I ended up getting a new drive (which I am using now), but the problem is that I never did a back up on my corrupt drive. I have a lot of important files on there, including irretrievable personal files, that I am desperate to get back. I just
 bought a SATA to USB converter so I can hook my failed drive up to a USB port (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16812232002&amp;cm_re=ide%2fsata_to_usb-_-12-232-002-_-Product this is what I bought if it'll help any). My drive is recognized,
 but when I try to open it from my computer it tells me. "You need to format the drive F before you can access it." When I go into Disk Management, it says the drive is RAW (how it was converted from NTFS to RAW is beyond me). I'm currently downloading a program
 called Recover My Files in hopes it'll work, but I fear I will not be able to recover anything without spending 70 dollars I do not have to purchase it. So my questions are.....<br />
<br />
- What is the success rate of Recover My Files? Is it worth spending 70 dollars to try it, if I manage to acquire that money?<br />
- Is there any way to access the RAW drive without some sort of recovery program like that? Or is there a program with a less steep price?<br />
- Will I encounter any other issues in attempting to recover information from the drive?<br />
- What could've possibly corrupted it and turned the drive to RAW when I didn't even shut off my computer? (I came back to the computer with some kind of jumbled up staticy, unreadable screen when it first happened, and when I restarted I couldn't get into
 it.)<br />
<br />
Much thanks to anyone who can possibly help me.<br />

<span>Hi Zadion,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try using a third party program or service to recover the data from the hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may use your favorite search engine to search for a third party recovery tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Note:&nbsp;Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
