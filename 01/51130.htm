<h2>            Audio output not working after sleep in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have problem with audio output not working after my PC resumes from sleep. After resuming, speakers do work, but there's no sound from audio output jack. I am forced to restart my PC to use headphones.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have observed that whenever this happens, the volume icon in the taskbar tray disappears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling audio drivers and re-installing them. But nothing works (except restarting PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My windows PC is updated with all latest cumulative updates. All hardware drivers are also up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest methods to get it working.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. May we ask you to uninstall all speakers (Audio Inputs and Outputs&gt; Speakers) and uninstall the drivers as well (Sound, video, and game controllers). After uninstalling the speakers and audio drivers, restart your PC and check.
 We understand that you have tried uninstalling the audio drivers, but we ask if you can perform it again with the inclusion of the speakers.
</p>

 it. </p>

            <p>ohk, so the issue remains as it is, because the hardware manufacturer will blame windows 10, and microsoft will blame the hardware manufacturer...so i guess I should leave it!

            <p>Thank you for the reply. With the latest Creators update for Windows 10, there's a chance that the audio driver from Realtek is not yet compatible with the new update. So we suggest checking with Realtek and the PC manufacturer if they have an updated driver
 that will work with the current Windows update. </p>

    <title>Creative Audigy 2 fails update install on Windows 7. Interactive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lilyakka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creative Audigy 2 fails update install on Windows 7.  Interactive window station required</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 7 Professional and wanted to update my driver to the latest one from Creative that has Windows 7 support.&nbsp; Their installer uninstalls the old driver and reboots the machine, it then progresses to install the new driver (which
 never really installs).&nbsp; If I manually try to install it via device manager I get the error of "an interactive window station is required".&nbsp; I've searched all over the web for a solution to this and all I can seem to find is "Reinstall Windows".&nbsp; That is an
 awfully drastic approach to something that seems so trivial especially a plug and play driver installation.&nbsp; Anyone know how to fix this problem??<br />
<br />
Windows update also fails to install the device, and there is no restore point to go back to.<br />

            It looks like I may have found a solution. Once you have dowloaded the driver update from creative, right click on TRobleshoot compatibility and select the fix. It should offer to run in Windows XP SP2 compatibility mode. Re-run the setup and it should
 work.

    <title>Problema audio&#58; appena collego le cuffie l&#39;audio sparisce - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cristianlorenzi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema audio&#58; appena collego le cuffie l&#39;audio sparisce</h2>
                    <p>Ho un problema con Windows 8, sin da quando l'ho installato come upgrade da Windows 7.</p>
<p>Sostanzialmente, se sto ascoltando Itunes con le casse del pc, e collego lo spinotto delle cuffie, l'audio sparisce e nella scheda "impostazioni" compare la croce sull'altoparlante con la dicitura "nessun altoparlante". Ora, lo stesso accade se sono su youtube
 o se sto guardando filmati con Vlc.</p>
<p>Il problema si presenta solamente se collego le cuffie dopo aver già avviato l'audio o il video, non si presenta se io connetto le cuffie prima di aprire qualsiasi programma di riproduzione multimediale.
</p>
<p>Poi, quando si presenta il problema, l'unica soluzione è riavviare, senza cuffie inserite, ed inserirle appena aperto Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il computer è un Toshiba Satellite&nbsp;L755 13u, acquistato nel 2012. Il driver della scheda video è Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
Qualcuno ha una soluzione per me? Windows 8 per il resto va benissimo, ma sto aspettando da troppo tempo che arrivi un aggiornamento a coprire questo bug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grazie mille</p>

<h2>            Latest Windows Update has killed my hard drive. Disc is corrupted and unreadable.</h2>
                    Latest Windows Update has killed my hard drive. Update did not install properly. When rebooting would go through a cycle telling me it was configuring updates three times and then finally allow log on screen to load. Tried system restore and went back
 before the update. When I powered off it downloaded and installed the update again. Same thing happened with the configuring updates on loading. So I did another system restore to get rid of the update. I left it on the log on screen while I had to go out.
 About an hour later I get home to see a message that Windows couldn't start because the drive is not accessible. I booted from the disc and tried start up repair, nothing. Tried system restore and it can't find any info on the disc. Sees the disc, knows there
 is a windows installation, but reads partition as 0MB. I have even tried pulling the drive and placing it in another computer to try and retrieve all my data. Can't access the drive, get message "The file or directory is corrupted a

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The update was probably incidental to the drive failure which was probably going to happen on what<br />
ever was the next intense disk access. Would likely have happened on&nbsp;a download, even saving a large<br />
file, using disk cleanup or a disk defrag. <br />
<br />
If you can't access the drive by putting it into another computer its likely not accessible without professional<br />
help. Check with your local real computer shop (one that does in house servicing and not leeks and peeks<br />
at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the System Maker's Support. Professional Recovery Services may<br />
be able to recover you data though it is expensive.<br />
<br />
Try these in the original computer :<br />
<br />
Boot from a Windows 7 Installation or Repair Disk and use the Command Prompt. Enter<br />
each command and ENTER after each.<br />
<br />
bootrec /fixmbr<br />
<br />
bootrec /fixboot<br />
<br />
bootrec /scanos<br />
<br />
bootrec /rebuildbcd<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you regain access you may need to run chkdsk from the Command Prompt of the boot disk.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r</p>

<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />

            <p>MVP'er you're missing the point. "Windows updates" killed this mans drive. Smart drive reads bad!</p>
<p>Same thing happened to my client, twice! We replaced the drive the first time after a corrupted Windows update killed the hard drive. One week later and this 64 bit Toshiba system receives a Windows update that browns out the smart drive sectors of the laptops
 hard drive. </p>
<p>Own up buddy! </p>
<p>Your proud company has a rogue update that is killing hard drives!</p>

            Why didn't&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;remove this patch if they new they were&nbsp;corrupting&nbsp;the C: drives this is an old issue that I now have to deal with, I find this to be&nbsp;irresponsible&nbsp;I can't even get on to my home page or install windows 7 to "fix" this problem. Also
 as a student I didn't have the funds to back up all my important files so thank you&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp; you ruined my computer and i have to go out and get it&nbsp;fixed.&nbsp;

            &nbsp; I have lost two drives to this problem. I took the first one as just bad luck and timing but put in a new drive, reloaded windows 7 and after updates another unusable hard drive. Please! I have been a IT&nbsp;professional&nbsp;for many years and blame faulty hardware.
 These were both high end Seagate drives. I am sorry but I cant believe that is just dumb luck!

If your mother in law dies and your car has a flat tyre on the same day, did your mother in law cause the puncture? It's the same with an automatic update (or with any software, for that): It could damage the disk's file system but it cannot possible "kill"
 the disk itself. The two events are as coincidental as the passing away of your mother in law and the flat tyre.

<h2>            Why can&#39;t Microsoft Fix the Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>why can't you make the Surface Pro 3 and Windows 8.1 a reliable development/business environment? I'm sick of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a developer (have been for 25+ years) and a business owner who relies you Windows and Windows hardware. I have had recurring issues with my I7-based Surface Pro 3 (top of the line, huh?) since the day I got it. It loves to freeze up while sleeping and
 shut down during sleep, as well. I see many such messages in the system logs with NO indication as to why! And when I restart, I see lots of timeout and error/warning messages from the OS, as well. Why can't your system start up without such issues:</p>

<p>
</p><p>AND MANY MANY MORE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot reply on your hardware or software and I'm sick of it. Your support is non-existent for this system. It is NOT acceptable to give no technical information but to start your "support" calls and emails with "do a refresh or reinstall Windows." Hogwash!
 I have had such problems from my first days of using your hardware/software and I have spent countless hours configuring/installing software (most of it from Microsoft) to make my system WORK so I can do my business! Does anybody give a damn about what's really
 going on? Nobody has ever asked for crash dumps or gotten on the phone with me to debug this, remotely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lots of information that nobody at Microsoft seems to want or care about.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get support for the hardware/software I paid a lot of money for and that is losing me money every day it does not work?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really sick of this....</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and consider it questionable that MS reacts with a private message instead of posting a solution here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pro 3 is brand new and all updates including todays firmware update are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess it's time to return the device, it is much too expensive for such a mess.</p>

<p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>why can't you make the Surface Pro 3 and Windows 8.1 a reliable development/business environment? I'm sick of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a developer (have been for 25+ years) and a business owner who relies you Windows and Windows hardware. I have had recurring issues with my I7-based Surface Pro 3 (top of the line, huh?) since the day I got it. It loves to freeze up while sleeping and
 shut down during sleep, as well. I see many such messages in the system logs with NO indication as to why! And when I restart, I see lots of timeout and error/warning messages from the OS, as well. Why can't your system start up without such issues:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I cannot reply on your hardware or software and I'm sick of it. Your support is non-existent for this system. It is NOT acceptable to give no technical information but to start your "support" calls and emails with "do a refresh or reinstall Windows." Hogwash!
 I have had such problems from my first days of using your hardware/software and I have spent countless hours configuring/installing software (most of it from Microsoft) to make my system WORK so I can do my business! Does anybody give a damn about what's really
 going on? Nobody has ever asked for crash dumps or gotten on the phone with me to debug this, remotely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lots of information that nobody at Microsoft seems to want or care about.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to get support for the hardware/software I paid a lot of money for and that is losing me money every day it does not work?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really sick of this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you get anywhere with MS on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have bout 40 of these SP3's so far 8 are now bricks - they cooked themselves, and now wont get past bios screen, they are being returned but we also have another 15 that blue screen/get stuck at bios on a regular basis (at least once but can be 2-3 times
 a day) and most of those will sit there cooking with the fan on full blast even just at the login screen. So out of the 40 over half have serious faults from day one. The rest are still in their boxes for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These devices are key to our strategy for remote working/workstation refresh. Come on MS sort this mess out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Essentially, no, MS has not seemed to care about actually understanding these issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>They got to me, privately, so we could exchange some detailed information but that's it. I gave them what they wanted and they went away. No suggestions (except to refresh/reinstall Windows) and no desire for my copious system log files that I offered to
 send. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be no real support from MS on such issues. And if there is, I cannot find it (I always end up back here through their various links).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say that things have not crashed even once since last week's firmware update. Not sure I've run long enough to have confidence that's really a fix, but that's a data point for now.

            <p>Things are back to "normal": Crashing every few days. I've sent private messages to MS but they never respond. Nobody seems to care. The errors, now, are bugcheck issues with their own internals (when I check the dumps).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get "warranty support" as they feel that you should pay to get such help as they don't supply support for the entire hardware warranty period. I'm close to paying to see if they can actually help, but I have no proof they a) care or b) are competent
 enough to help. Here's the latest dump (repeatable... it will do this while sleeping in the middle of the night):</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest debugging shows it's a Windows driver/system issue (from "ntkrnlmp.exe" which is Microsoft):</p>

<h2>            Cortana and mic troubles</h2>
                    I just got my laptop and i decided to try Cortana but when I click on the mic it brings her up for a short while and then crashes. I tried going to settings and clicking set up mic but as soon as I click it, it says detecting problem and won't let me.
 I have skyped some people and my mic has worked fine I just don't understand what is happening

            Since you just got the laptop, the first thing I would do is make sure all the latest updates have been installed. 
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Scroll down to Cortana
<br />Right click Cortana
<br />Click More
<br />Click App settings
<br />Click Terminate
<br />Restart your computer then launch Cortana again
<br />
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Restart the Cortana Process in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list of processes, select Cortana then click End Task.
<br />
<br />Restart Windows 10 then see if it starts working.
<br />
<br />Reinstall Cortana
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />At the command Prompt, type then following the hit Enter.
<br />Exit Powershell the restart
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Recording tab
<br />Right click your Microphone

    <title>Results of a filename search giving unrelated results along with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Results of a filename search giving unrelated results along with correct results</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I have a large number of photos that I use to display as Windows background (4,000+). Each pic has the filename form of an example:&nbsp; 0288aC_Hong_1243350.jpg. The only thing that changes from filename to filename within a group of more than 2 pics of
 the same subject is the "a", which may span from a to m, for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When I do a search in File Explorer, I get the grouping I want, but I also get 2 or three pics with filenames not even close to the target sequence filename.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Using the above example, when I put in "0288". What the query returns is:</p>
<p>"0288aC_Hong"</p>
<p>"0288bC_Hong"</p>
<p>"0288cC_Hong"</p>
<p>"0857aC_Yafang"&nbsp; &lt;--- This filename doesn't even come close to "pattern-matching" the target character sequence. The leading 0 matches, but there are no further matches except for the 8 and then "C_". Those are the only 3 char hits. It doesn't seem to fit
 a "wildcard search" either or I would get a lot more returns that were not valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; What am I missing here? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The 8.3 file name probably contains the string "0288". You can find out with this Console command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dir &nbsp;/x &nbsp;0857*.*</p>

<p>Hello Frederik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thank you for your reply. Here are the locations of both files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>E:\Asian_ladies\0288aC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>E:\Asian_ladies\0857aC_Yafang.JPG</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the command window (what we used to see with DOS, I get the following when I do a DIR followed by: &nbsp;E:\Asian_ladies\0288*.*</p>
<p>
</p><p>E:\Asian_ladies\0288aC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>E:\Asian_ladies\0288bC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>E:\Asian_ladies\0288cC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I get the following if I do a DIR followed by&nbsp;E:\Asian_ladies\0857*.*</p>
<p>
</p><p>E:\Asian_ladies\0857aC_Yafang.JPG</p>
<p>E:\Asian_ladies\0857bC_Yafang.JPG</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I use the File Explorer to display the 0288 files ONLY, I get the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0288aC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>0288bC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>0288cC_Hong.JPG</p>
<p>0857aC_Yafang.JPG</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I don't get&nbsp;0857bC_Yafang.JPG listed with the 0288 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now just to prove to myself that I am not crazy, I did the same process with another numbered file that resides in the same E:\Asian_ladies directory.</p>
<p>I did a dir e:\asian_ladies\0048*.* &nbsp; I got what one would expect:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0048aC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0048bC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0048cC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0048dC_Yixuan</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I searched for the same files using the File Explorer I got the following list:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0048aC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0048bC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0048cC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0048dC_Yixuan</p>
<p>0683eC_Pei_1238525</p>
<p>0456aC_Hongni</p>
<p>0086cX_Asian</p>
<p>0404bC_Danlei</p>
<p>0614aP_Mel</p>
<p>0537aL_Kim</p>
<p>0657aP_Necy</p>
<p>0781fA_Tatya</p>
<p>0871cA_Tatya &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Note: It displayed 2 files from this series just "f" and "a".</p>
<p>0785aP_Thelma</p>
<p>0484gC_Jie(Boe)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long example but this one illustrates the "problem" at a deeper level than I expected...at least I think it does. By the way, the order typed in here is the same order that they were displayed in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would understand if I typed the&nbsp;0048aC_Yixuan and got that... plus any other file that started with&nbsp;0048aC_Yixuan as if I typed&nbsp;<strong>0048aC_Yixuan*.*&nbsp;
</strong>But NOT with seemingly random file names suddenly appearing. I am thinking it is a bug in the File Explorer program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a retired computer tech. I have a degree in computer programming, however I haven't worked as a programmer. That is my background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is about it unless you have more questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the assist!!</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well I have tried the syntax every way I can think of. I either get a syntax error or I just get the two 0857 files returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wasting your time with this. I was just curious as to how the files that I wasn't requesting kept appearing. It really isn't important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried the help files and got an error that the help files aren't installed. When I tried to install them, I got another error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did put the /x switch in the command line. Here's what I put in:</p>
<p>dir E:\Asian_ladies\0857*.*&nbsp; /x</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it returned was the two 0857 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>When you use the /x switch then you will see both the "long" file names and also the so-called 8.3 names. The 8.3 file names frequently contain unexpected strings that get picked up by the search function. Here is a typical example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>03.07.2017 &nbsp;18:47 &nbsp; &nbsp;5 &nbsp;THFB3D~1.TXT This is a long file name 1235 with a few numbers 890.txt&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Andrew
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />I would consider downgrading to an earlier version of Windows 10, if you are currently running Windows 10 1809:
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi Andrew
<br />
<br />The error you are getting is related to the ATI Radeon graphics card device driver on your system
<br />
<br />An older device driver, rather than a new driver will most likely be more compatible with your Nitro . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

<h2>            Is full version of Mmore Goatz edition available on xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I recently downloaded Goat Simulator on xbox 360 for my son and he loves it. &nbsp;So today I tried downloading the Mmore Goatz edition and it seems like all that is available is trial version. &nbsp;When you click on 'unlock full game' it basically just pops up a
 box that says cancel with no option to download anything more. &nbsp;The 5 minute trial game works just fine but then there seems to be no full game download available after that. &nbsp;Is this a glitch? &nbsp;Is the full download for mmore goatz not available on xbox 360?
 &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Alright! I have the final answer here.</p>
<p>As I've stated before, the Demo and DLC for Mmore Goatz Edition should no longer be available. This is because of a request from the publisher, Double Eleven. The separate DLC, Goatz and Goat MMO, will be made available for Xbox 360, however we do not have a time frame for when that will be released.</p>
<p>Because of this, we have concluded that reaching out to Double Eleven to find out if they have a timeline is the best course of action (that link is an email because their support page seems to be down). They may be able to give you a better idea on when the DLC will be released. However, you can also simply keep an eye out on the Marketplace for when that content is available.</p>
<p>Again, I'd like to thank you for your patience while we sorted this out. If you have any further questions, do not hesitate to reach out to us! :)</p>

<h2>            Taptiles opens and closes</h2>
                    <p>Ever since upgrading Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, TapTiles will not launch.&nbsp; When you try to open the game, it opens to the splash screen for a few seconds then closes again.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it again (rebooting between the uninstall
 and reinstall), but it makes no difference.&nbsp; The game still crashes immediately after opening.&nbsp; I had no problem with the game whatsoever in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The recent Windows 10 Anniversary update also made no difference. I have also tried the Microsoft Store
 apps troubleshooter, but it did not resolve the problem either.</p>

            That forum offers no help for this problem.&nbsp; It is a Windows 10 issue since it was caused by the Windows 10 upgrade, and the app comes from the Windows store.&nbsp; Microsoft created the problem, so they should help to resolve it..

            Don't hold your breath! This is an on-going problem that neither Microsoft nor Xbox want to take responsibility for. I have been round the houses several times since I updated to Windows 10 - no one has an answer but so far, after several weeks and a couple
 of Microsoft updates the problem has disappeared --- until the next time!

 who can spot and rectify this ongoing irritation!

    <title>Online games run slowly while laptop is plugged in, but better on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjmcolorado  say:</h3>
<h2>            Online games run slowly while laptop is plugged in, but better on battery</h2>
                    <p>First off, I recently purchased a replacement battery for my laptop (not branded), and I hadn't had a functioning battery for over a year, I simply used my laptop on power with no battery installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I purchased this battery I noticed something strange (but not completely unheard of after searching online). When the laptop is plugged in AND has the battery installed, the performance of online games is very stuttered and laggy (imagine a pause
 every 1/2 second). When running on purely battery power, the online games work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see a drop in performance of my computer in general, it mainly appears during online games. This may be just due to the intensity of the online games I play (Heroes of the Storm, Team Fortress 2, other Steam games), or it could be due to something
 in relation to the network connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for an answer to this in many forums, but nothing has helped. Here is what I have tried/confirmed so far, and other information that may be of use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-This is not related to "Power management" settings, I am well-aware of advanced power management settings and adjusted plugged in, and battery power to be the same in all aspects, and even created an entirely new setting to see if the old ones were corrupt
 with no success.</p>
<p>-The problem occurs&nbsp; and disappears instantly - when I plug in the computer the lag occurs as soon as the laptop realizes it is plugged in, and returns to good performance when unplugged</p>
<p>-The problem&nbsp;does not occur. when the battery is at 100% charge AND plugged in (the power is bypassing the battery at that time).</p>
<p>-I don't think this is a bad AC adapter, since it runs fine without the battery, and does charge the battery, even during heavy use.</p>
<p>-My laptop is an ASUS K53E-B1, 2.3 gHz Intel i5, with 6GB RAM running Windows&nbsp;10,&nbsp;was running windows 7 with the same problem. Updating to windows 10 did not change the problem (it is about 5 years old now).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I have now updated my BIOS to the most current version available on ASUS's website.
</p>
<p>Sadly, no change in this problem. It seems that there may be a miscommunication happening when power is being routed into the battery AND into the system, seemingly in relation to network connection, as I have no problems offline.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any other simple suggestions to try I will be grateful, but otherwise I am somewhat at a loss.</p>
<p>This problem isn't a huge deal, as I can workaround it, so if no fix is found it is not the end of the world. Thanks for any help!</p>

    <title>Where to buy a new AC power cord&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where to buy a new AC power cord&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As you know an Xbox One's power supply is comprised of 2 parts - a power cord that get plugged into a socket, and the actual power brick. I recently lost the cord (but still have the brick with me), and the Microsoft store doesn't seem to be selling those
 components separately (I don't have the money to afford another power brick). Is there anywhere I can buy another standalone AC power cord? Thanks!!</p>

<p>Simular style Old PC/Monitor cord like that would be hard to find. Might check Ebay for an Xbox One Power cord OP but other than that. I've no idea.

<p>I had to buy a spare power supply from my xbox one after it went out. I used it while MS fixed my original. You'd probably be able to buy one of those and switch the cord out if it is the same. I got my from amazon.</p>

<h2>            Homegroup fail after replacing modem</h2>
                    I had a modem die and replaced. Homegroup then quit working. ie: says its there but does not work. 12 laptops, 2 desktops. 1 desktop says it sees a homegroup but does not let me join or see any details. The other desktop says it sees a homegroup but gives
 an error upon trying to join. One laptop which the othe machines says created the homegroup and is the one to join says the same thing. It does not recognise that it is the creator of the homegroup. The last laptop gives me a homegroup join number but it does
 not work on any of my machines. I just get an error code. Help!

            <p>Thanks Sharief! Still no go though! I have tried the homegroup troubleshooter before. On one it detects no issues as it states it is in a homegroup. Yet it is not. On another it says to put in the homegroup password yet i cannot get any of the machines in
 my network to give me one. It also states the "laptop1" user name "me" set up a homegroup. On said laptop it also states that same information, yet i am logged in under my username to that laptop.
</p>
<p>On yet another it states that i need to "Sycronize your computer clock with your local standard time". I checked all my machines and all are the right time. I checked in the BIOS as well. This one also shows me the options to leave the homegroup, change
 settings and view the homegroup password, yet none of them work. I just get the little thinking mouse and no information.</p>
<p>I also tried your ping idea, yes it pings. It says 4/4. </p>
<p>Homegroup was working perfect until the moden/router replacement. Then I stared having errors so then I just selected leave homegroup thinking i would just join again. Then it wouldnt let me join or said I was in one.......</p>

            <p>I finally got my Homegroup up and running! It still seems a little glitchy but I do have a homegroup. Here is what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>Followed the instructions on this web page, I found lots of settings needed changing,</li><li>http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-cannot-connect-to-homegroup/</li><li>The laptop which I&nbsp;created the Homegroup I could not get to drop or leave the homegroup, and it would not join either, so I&nbsp;am in the process of reloading windows on&nbsp;it and am starting over with it. (Upgrade to Pro while I am at it!)</li><li>Also, my routers date was wrong. I changed it with high hopes and still no go.</li><li>At least all my others can now create and join a homegroup.</li><li>There is one section in the article in the above link that my laptop which I originally created my homegroup that I could not find a fix for and may have been the problem. It is in the section, "Connect to the same Network."
</li><li>You were to run IPCONFIG in command and see these type of numbers - 192.168.0.x as an example.</li><li>My laptop did <strong>not</strong> show those numbers, just a long set of numbers and letters. The article did not show a fix for this.
</li></ul>
<p>Here is the problems I am having now, even though I am in a homegroup it is telling me no other homegroup computers are available even though I know they are. All display the same password! I will work on this when time permits.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 64 bit - Change USER&#47;folder name and system path for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roscoe james  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 64 bit - Change USER&#47;folder name and system path for user</h2>
                    <p>I'm not even sure if I'm asking the correct question or not. I'm running a current generation Dell XPS 15 W 8.1 64 bit. During setup I created my initial user incorrectly and the path for my folders on this specific machine is now wrong. I have two other
 W 8.1 machines plush my W 10 test machine, all with the exact same user and user folder path. Here's what happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll say my name is Fred Flintstone and all my machines are setup as Fred user and fred user folder and path. With this machine I mistakenly entered FredFlintstone user. i.e. fredflinstone user folder and path. I've changed the user to Fred but the subsequent
 user folder and system path doesn't change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have routines I use on all my machines that are hardwired for path and this is a real inconvenience. So I'd like to change the user folder location and path to fred. Searching the registry I've discovered about 10 different locations where fredflintstone
 appears. But I find it difficult to believe it could be as simple as finding and editing every path appearance in the registry. Or that the machine would even still work after.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought creating a new admin account properly setup could be the answer. Two issues. The system will not let me use the same
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** I use as my real user account when that email is already assigned to another account. Meaning I can't use Fred's account because Fred is using it. So I can use another account to setup the new account.
 Then I can move files around, into the new account. And make sure all my application use assignments are available. Then, I would assume, I could delete the old account. Is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And once I delete the old account can I connect my new account to Fred's email account to get access to OneDrive and O 365? What happens with my Office 2013 install that comes from my Office 365 connection that's working right now through the current fredflintstone
 account that I'll be killing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there some other way to do this which hasn't occurred to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>RJ</p>

            <p><span>I have finally resolved my issue. I’m going to put the steps down here I determined work properly in my particular case. Step one of Microsoft’s solution (disconnecting your existing account) works
 and was an option I wasn’t familiar with. I’ll include that. And I’ll also include and edited version of Microsoft’s step 2.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>While I am a programmer I am not a Windows anything super user. Maybe a little more intuitive than some and I don’t recommend this procedure for a complete novice. But if you follow the steps carefully
 you will be able to carry out the change.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>To restate the goal. To rename the windows User file path. That means that when you click on your My Documents folder those files are kept in a certain place (file path). And you may have a need for
 a specific file path. The user file path is built on the device name. The device name is created when you first set the machine up and give two pieces of data (that are not be confused). The Display Name (follow my example – Fred Flinstone) and the device
 name. I wanted Fred’s device to be named Fred. Which would make the file path name C:\users\fred\documents for My Documents folder.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Due to poor indications or carelessness on my part at the create screen during my laptop’s initialization I got it wrong. I ended up with \fredflintsone\ in my user path. Which didn’t work with several
 routines I run across four machines I own and use that all run W8.1. It needed fixing. And apparently this happens occasionally and good answers are hard to find. Which is why I’m creating this. A mixture of Microsoft’s solutions and the result of several
 attempts and investigation of my own.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Here in this scenario, you will have to create a Local Account first and delete the old account. Once after deleting the old account, you may convert the Local Account to Microsoft

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Step 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Disconnect the Microsoft Account and

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">For those of you that may not understand what local account means on a W8.1 machine means (I didn’t get it at first). That simply means the account
 is no longer associated with the email address you use when logging in. Through that email account your machine connects to OneDrive, your computers settings that are saved in the cloud, maybe your Office 365 account, and a host of other very useful services
 included in W8.1. To me this is like the ‘cloud safe mode’. It means that what you’re doing to your machine will not be saved as some permanent configuration change to your system and it frees up that email address so you can connect it to the new account.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

 path name came back with \fred_000\. Which was as bad as my \fredflintstone\ path name. What works is creating another non-connected account (very important).</span></span></p>

<span>Here’s where I made the mistake in my original setup. You get the Add the User information panel. First field is User name. My Windows experience goes back to 3.1 and I’ve owned and operated every Windows OpSys
 since. I don’t feel like pulling my last XP Pro machine out but I’m fairly certain the User Name they request is what used to be known as the device name. In that field put the name you want to appear in your \users\ file path. Not what logic tells you is
 either the user name associated with your email account you’ll later be connecting to this user. And not the Display Name you want to appear on your W8.1 modern interface screen. Right here is where you put the device name you want to appear in your file path.</span></p>

<span>Provide the two passwords and one password hint. When you click next you’ve created the user.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click Finish and the user appears below the +Add an account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on the new user and select Edit.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the dropdown below the user select Administrator.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click OK.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Reboot.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3:</span></strong><span> Login with new user. When the login screen comes up it will default to your original Admin
 account. Click the arrow beside the PW capture box to see all users for this machine. Select your new local account and enter using the PW you created. Once inside go to My Documents and check your path. You’ll have to navigate to something and, as I recall,
 the only thing in your Documents folder is your Dowloads folder. Go there. Click in the navigation bar in File Explorer and that will bring up and highlight the real path. If it’s what you want, then on to step 4. If not then logout, reboot, go back in as
 your original user, delete the newly made Local user account. DO NOT DELETE THE ORIGIANL ACCOUNT THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE CLOUD. And repeat the process until you have what you want. Actually, Step 2 is pretty simple and worked the first time for me.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 4:</span></strong><span> Now that you have an account with the correct users\path\ set and ready to go on local
 you want to grab the files and folders from your old or original account and put them into the new account. In Microsoft’s response there are detailed instructions for what they suggest. Given I’m not a Super User I decided to shy away from that. First, File
 Explorer did not have all the options they mentioned. Second, I have enough experience with Windows OS, users, and devices to know that everything has a fingerprint and if I don’t know exactly which files are positively unique to a user (and non-recyclable)
 and which ones may be copied and recycled, I could lose a lot of work and have to start again. So here’s how I did it.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If not logged in as the new user, do so. You can probably do this from either user but my instructions will be based on the location – new administration user you created.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open File Explorer and in the left sidebar find This PC. &gt; Below that you’ll see a list of places (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.). At the bottom you’ll see your OS (Operating System) drive. In most cases
 this will be C:</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click and you’ll see a list of your program, app, and Windows folders. One of those folder is named
<strong>Users.</strong> </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Double click and you’ll see Default, Public, and a folder for each user on the machine. Find the folder for the original connected account and open that.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>This is the point where Microsoft instructions were to setup the File Explorer for special viewing and grab all folders (copy all) BUT a few specific files, copy, and paste directly to the new user’s user folder.
 You’ll find their instructions uptop and feel free. I skipped that.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>First, you’ll find OneDrive in that user folder. If you want to copy that you may but you can also leave it and just let the drive background download later.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You’ll see the same for any Office 365 OneDrive accounts you may have connected. I have three. Same advice.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go through and grab Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, Desktop, Favorites, any other odd folder you may have installed. Copy, paste to new user. Replace existing folders or files unless, for some reason, they
 come up in use.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>IMPORTANT </span></strong><span>– If you have any macro specific or otherwise customized Word templates, root those out of the template folder on the old user and
 copy them to the template folder of the new user. You may actually have to log into the old user to get those.
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>That may or may not take a while. When finished, Step 5</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Step 5: Right now it still may not look like your desktop. Now we connect the new account and let it sync. Go to PC Settings again (found off the gear settings icon).
 Navigate to Accounts. Your account will appear. And just below the name will be a blue link. Connect. Click that, provide the email account that you removed from the original Administrator/User account. It will want the PW, a hint, and, as I recall, will ask
 you to provide a Display Name. The name that appears with your photo or avatar on the W8.1 modern interface page. Complete the connect process and I recommend one last reboot back into the new account that is now connected to your cloud and other Microsoft
 Services.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What you lose. In my case I had to create all my e-mail accounts once more in Outlook. The system will download settings from the cloud in accordance with how had that
 feature setup for the original account. Means, if you turned off syncing it won’t find much. But most are synced and it will find your desktop wallpaper, your splash screen for login. You moved your bookmarks. Those are there. But, for example, I need to go
 to my old user and export my FTP users, paths, and PWs. It got most my PWs from the cloud but, keep in mind, it may not. I had to rebuild my Modern Tile interface. All my programs were there because I never install a program and limit it to any one user. But
 if you do, you may have to reinstall. It found all my Microsoft service PWs. Did ask me to confirm a few. And you always have the option of trying out Microsoft’s steps above. Maybe you’ll have better results than expected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bottom line – I got my user path back. And I’ll leave the old account for a week or two just in case I missed something on the file copy. When I’m sure everything is
 working I’ll get rid of it.</span></span></p>
