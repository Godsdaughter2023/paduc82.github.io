<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble streaming your Xbox One Console to your Windows 10 PC. I recommend you fully power down and reset all equipment involved (Xbox One, Laptop, Router/modem)
 with them unplugged from the power source for at least 5 minutes before connecting the network equipment first. If you continue to have issues you can also review this support article:

<h2>            settings wont open</h2>
                    I am beyond frustrated. &nbsp;The worst mistake I could have made was the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;I have tried all of the ideas that have been suggested and none work. &nbsp;I just want to do the upgrade to fix this problem but it will not let me. &nbsp;Is there any way
 to do it manually?

            Hi MercedesMarioneaux 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To find Skype Name / Skype ID / Skype Address
<br />
<br />Click on your profile picture in top left corner &gt; In the resultant screen, click on Skype profile and you will have Skype Name which is also called Skype ID or Skype Address
<br />This may be in the form of live:abcdefgh
<br />OR
<br />Click on 3 dots on top &gt; Settings &gt; Account &amp; Profile &gt; On right side, you will have Skype Name
<br />OR
<br />Another way to get Skype Name / ID is to type following command in any chat and Enter. One of the fields is Skypename: in the output
<br />/dumpmsnp
<br />(The output will be displayed to you only. The contact whose window did you entered this in will neither see the command nor the output)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Multiple Skype numbers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthurmnyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Skype numbers</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 Skype numbers for 3 different countries US, UK, Brazil) under the same account.<br />
The first one is the US number that can be&nbsp;considered the primary number and is the one automatically used when making outside calls.</p>
<p>Question #1: How do I switch&nbsp;to a second number&nbsp;to make calls from that number, say the UK number.</p>
<p>Question #2: Is it possible to record different voicemail messages for each Skype number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. Any additional help will also be deeply appreciated</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 ISSUE - LAPTOP BECOMES COMPLETELY UNRESPONSIVE</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Windows 10 this weekend, each day that I have come home from work and get on my laptop, nothing will open.&nbsp; I have all my quick launch programs on the taskbar and none of them respond.&nbsp; I can't even reboot the machine from the power
 button icon!&nbsp; I eventually have to just turn it off manually with the machine's power button on the side and restart it.&nbsp; It's like it goes into a permanent sleep mode and refuses to wake up.&nbsp; I am not very techno savvy, so any help needs to be in layman's
 terms.

            I tried most of your suggestions with no success, got fed up and went back to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Now the Adobe flash plugin crashes on almost every single page when online, and I can't do the things I need to do.&nbsp; So I thought I would give Windows 10 another
 try, but can't get the prompt back to do the upgrade.&nbsp; It always says "download in progress. W10 is downloading in the background, we'll let you know when you can start the upgrade".&nbsp; This is the 3rd day and I'm still seeing the same thing!&nbsp; So now nothing
 is working properly.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Update messed up my sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> euniqe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update messed up my sound</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my Windows 10 installation; "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1809" on 10/3/19.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ever since then, my sound card has been playing up. I have been running the same card on the same motherboard, with the same settings, on the same installation of Windows 10 literally since Windows 10 was made available to the public. It was in fact running
 on windows 8.1 before that, and Windows 8 before that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound card is a SoundBlaster Recon3D PCIe. The motherboard is an ASUS P8Z77V-LX. CPU is an Intel I7-3770, Windows 10 is installed on an SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, up until this update the sound has been completely fine. No problems with anything. However, I noticed after the update that the sound will vary between being completely normal at one time, and then all of a sudden without warning the output
 starts distorting/buzzing continuously. This distorting/buzzing also goes away after a while for seemingly no apparent reason.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I deleted the sound card driver, deleted all other audio drivers and restarted the computer and reinstalled the SoundBlaster driver and software. Whilst this eliminated the buzzing/distorting, it created a new issue - the speaker channels (left, right, rear-left,
 rear-right, center, sub) would randomize themselves for no apparent reason whilst playing audio through any source. All of a sudden left channel would switch to right, then disappear entirely or any other combination. I right-clicked the speaker icon in the
 taskbar, selected "troubleshoot audio" and found out that the "enable audio enhancements" box had been selected in the speaker properties (see image link&nbsp;https://imgur.com/a/pgktQGh). I de-selected this box, and lo and behold the channel-swapping problem was
 fixed, but the buzzing/distorting returned.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now as I mentioned I have never had a problem with any audio up to this point. It should also be mentioned that plugging headphones into the headphone port on the front of the case of my computer that uses the high-definition audio output of the motherboard,
 also presents the buzzing/distorting. It happened at exactly the same time the Windows 10 update occurred, which makes it extremely unlikely and/or coincidental for a hardware error to have simultaneously occurred.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I can think of to rectify this situation, and nothing has worked. I am desperate for a fix, as I want to believe this is hanlon's razor; that Windows 10 software engineers aren't in fact forcing me to buy new hardware in the hope that
 will work and instead have made a mistake and the latest update simply has some broken code that isn't playing well with my admittedly antique hardware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            Hi euniqe 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Unless Asus has come out with a new driver in the last few months you may need to rollback the update.
<br />Feature updates are really upgrades of Windows 10.
<br />So what worked in previous versions may not work in newer versions, i know that sucks but that is what Microsoft has been doing.
<br />So Vendors like Asus have to keep up with hardware drivers which some don't even bother on systems that are older than 3 years.
<br />Did you check Asus site to see if the newer drivers for your model?
<br />Start there.

<p>Thank you for your reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have checked the ASUS website, I dont think they have upgraded the sound driver for a long time and for that fact neither has Creative for the SoundBlaster card. I don't really expect them to update drivers for every product for every feature update
 of Windows 10 to be honest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I roll back Windows Update, won't that prevent me from installing future Windows 10 security updates and the like?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my Windows 10 installation; "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1809" on 10/3/19.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ever since then, my sound card has been playing up. I have been running the same card on the same motherboard, with the same settings, on the same installation of Windows 10 literally since Windows 10 was made available to the public. It was in fact running
 on windows 8.1 before that, and Windows 8 before that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound card is a SoundBlaster Recon3D PCIe. The motherboard is an ASUS P8Z77V-LX. CPU is an Intel I7-3770, Windows 10 is installed on an SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned, up until this update the sound has been completely fine. No problems with anything. However, I noticed after the update that the sound will vary between being completely normal at one time, and then all of a sudden without warning the output
 starts distorting/buzzing continuously. This distorting/buzzing also goes away after a while for seemingly no apparent reason.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I deleted the sound card driver, deleted all other audio drivers and restarted the computer and reinstalled the SoundBlaster driver and software. Whilst this eliminated the buzzing/distorting, it created a new issue - the speaker channels (left, right, rear-left,
 rear-right, center, sub) would randomize themselves for no apparent reason whilst playing audio through any source. All of a sudden left channel would switch to right, then disappear entirely or any other combination. I right-clicked the speaker icon in the
 taskbar, selected "troubleshoot audio" and found out that the "enable audio enhancements" box had been selected in the speaker properties (see image link&nbsp;https://imgur.com/a/pgktQGh). I de-selected this box, and lo and behold the channel-swapping problem was
 fixed, but the buzzing/distorting returned.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now as I mentioned I have never had a problem with any audio up to this point. It should also be mentioned that plugging headphones into the headphone port on the front of the case of my computer that uses the high-definition audio output of the motherboard,
 also presents the buzzing/distorting. It happened at exactly the same time the Windows 10 update occurred, which makes it extremely unlikely and/or coincidental for a hardware error to have simultaneously occurred.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried everything I can think of to rectify this situation, and nothing has worked. I am desperate for a fix, as I want to believe this is hanlon's razor; that Windows 10 software engineers aren't in fact forcing me to buy new hardware in the hope that
 will work and instead have made a mistake and the latest update simply has some broken code that isn't playing well with my admittedly antique hardware.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            You can pause them after you rollback.
<br />Go to start - settings - update and security - advanced - feature updates.
<br />Pause for 365 days.

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is unfortunate that no options have worked to pass that message and I will be happy to answer your query. Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What action did you try to perform with Windows 7 recovery disc?</li><li>As you start the PC, do you see the manufacturer's logo?</li><li>Are you able to reach the sign-in page?</li><li>When exactly do you receive the error?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Which security software is installed in the computer?</li><li>Have you connected any external devices (except mouse and keyboard in case it is desktop)?</li></ul>
<p>This issue could occur when you use the automatic logon feature. Let's try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are able to boot to desktop, you can request for and download Hotfix 379793 at
<strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2615701/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">KB2615701</span></a></strong> and apply it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If step 1 does not work as if you are not able to boot to desktop, we need to run Startup repair booting the PC from the CD. In order to boot the PC from CD, you need to change the boot priority in BIOS. And to do so, I would recommend
 contacting the manufacturer to seek help making changes in BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span>
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp; </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To run Startup repair:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “<strong><span>Install now</span></strong>”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.&nbsp;Click on <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.&nbsp;On the next page click on <strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e.&nbsp;Now click on <strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f.&nbsp;Click on <strong><span>Startup repair </span></strong>and follow the on screen instructions.
<strong><br />
<br />
</strong>Also refer to:&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">What are the system recovery options in Windows&nbsp;7?</span></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Perform System Restore using Windows 7 recovery CD</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “<strong><span>Install now</span></strong>”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.&nbsp;Click on <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.&nbsp;On the next page click on <strong><span>Advanced Options</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">e.&nbsp;Now click on <strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">f.&nbsp;Click on <strong><span>System Restore </span></strong>and follow the on screen instructions.
<strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span>
When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you have installed after that date are removed.<br />
<br />
</span>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>reset surface with usb but device will not boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kkm123  say:</h3>
<h2>            reset surface with usb but device will not boot</h2>
                    <p>HELP! My SurfacePro will not boot up and after much research and lots of attempts to recover Windows from within the device I downloaded a recovery file directly from Microsoft. When first trying to reset under Troubleshoot option I get a message that says
 "The media inserted is not valid." So I cancel out of that screen and on the Choose an option screen Use a device appears. When I choose that a screen showing the usb appears. I choose that and it just loops back to theRecovery screen saying "your pc needs
 to be repaired" The operating system couldnt be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors or contains errors.</p>
<p>The error is listed as MBAMSwissArmy.sys</p>
<p>I have already done a scan and various other things from comant prompt as per help forums I have read.</p>
<p>Please Help! I have all the documents I need backed up from Surface. I just want the thing to boot up again, I will gladly start from scratch.</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you're unable to reset your Surface device using the USB recovery drive. Please check the steps below on how you can reset your Surface device.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that your Surface is turned off and plugged in, and then insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button.</li><li>When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</li><li>When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Recover </strong>from a drive. If prompted for a recovery key, select<strong> Skip this drive</strong> at the bottom of the screen.</li><li>Select the target operating system you need to reset. (This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.)</li><li>Choose either<strong> Just remove my files </strong>or <strong>Fully clean the drive</strong>.
<br />
The option to clean the drive is more secure but takes much longer. For example, if you’re recycling your Surface, you should clean the drive. If you’re keeping your Surface, you just need to remove your files.</li><li>Select <strong>Recover</strong>. Surface restarts and displays the Surface logo while the reset process continues. This can take several minutes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you can’t boot from your USB recovery drive or don’t see the Recover from a drive option, you may need to configure the boot order so the USB drive is the first option. See
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/how-to-use-the-bios-uefi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I use the BIOS/UEFI?</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/how-to-use-the-bios-uefi-with-surface-book-and-surface-pro-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Using Surface UEFI on Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book.</a></p>
<p><br />
Also, make sure that the USB recovery drive is formatted to FAT32, your USB recovery drive is configured correctly, and that the recovery image is the correct one for your model of Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the recommended steps on how to reset your Surface device.

            <p><span>Hi Edith,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that your left speaker crackles. I will try to help you with this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which Windows operating system are you using?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If your computer is having problems playing sound, try using the Playing Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem.
 It checks for common problems with your volume settings, your sound card or driver, and your speakers or headphones.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>For steps refer to the article below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Show Disabled devices and Set speaker as default</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Perform the task mentioned below to set speaker as default:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Go to Start and click on control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3. In the new windows click on the tab “Playback" and right click in the window and click on Show Disabled devices.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>4. Now check if Speaker is listed there and right click on it and choose enable.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>5. Highlight that speaker and click on "Set as Default"</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Method 3.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Let us completely uninstall the sound card and its drivers and then check.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Here is how:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Type Device Manager in the search box and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Browse to the "Sound, video and game controllers" and choose the sound card from the drop down menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3. Right click on the sound card and choose uninstall. Also place a check mark on the "Delete driver software
 for this device".</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>4. Click ok to continue uninstalling this device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>5. Restart the computer and let windows install this software automatically and then verify if it works.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>This should also fix the Windows Media Player issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>You are also recommended to check the computer manufacturer's website if t hey have any audio drivers available. If there are no drivers
 available there as well then you may consider installing the other drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Print a network configuration page using the printer's front panel controls.&nbsp; See your User Guide for details.&nbsp; Some more recent HP printers have very sketchy User Guides (if you have the Deskjet 3000 J310, this means you) and it is difficult to see how
 -- or if -- you can print a network configuration page.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What you want to do is (a) determine the IP address that is currently configured in the printer and potentially re-configure it to an IP address of your selection.&nbsp; You may need to dig around in the printer's help system on your computer.&nbsp; You may be able to
 access the printer's configuration utility using your Internet browser or you may have to connect the printer to the computer via USB and use the printer's installation CD.<br />
<br />
Once you know what the printer's IP address is (and, preferably, how to change it), then ...<br />
<br />
On your computer --<br />
<ul>
<li>Click Start &gt; Printers and Faxes</li><li>Right-click the icon for your printer and select Properties</li><li>Click the Ports tab</li><li>Being careful to NOT click in the list of ports (where you might accidentally change something), click the Configure Port button</li><li>Compare the IP address in the box "Printer name or IP address"</li><li>If the IP address in the box is not the same as the one you determined for the printer, make it so.</li><li>OK your way out and you should be able to print.</li></ul>
<br />
Now ... if the above solved your problem, you might want to know why and probably would like to know how to keep it from happening again.&nbsp; The "why" is that usually your wireless router automatically sets the printer's IP address.&nbsp; If you turn off the printer,
 there is no guarantee that the router will assign the same IP address when you turn it back on, especially if other devices have been connected to your router in the meantime.&nbsp; There are two methods to deal with this.<br />
<br />
One, you can check the box on the "Configure Ports" tab that says "Always print to this device, even if its IP address changes."&nbsp; This is a feature that HP printer drivers have, but in my experience, it's unreliable.&nbsp; It probably works best if you change the
 box's contents from the actual IP address to the printer's "Host Name."&nbsp; This is something you should be able to find in the printer's configuration utility accessed through your web browser.&nbsp; It is NOT the "Port Name" which is shown on the "Port Configuration"
 tab in the box above the IP address.<br />
<br />
Two, you can change the way that the printer gets its IP address from the usual default (Automatic) to Manual, otherwise known as a Static IP address.&nbsp; If you do this, you will need to pick an IP address that is in the same subnet as your router (this means
 that the first 3 of the 4 sets of numbers in the IP address must be the same).&nbsp; For example, if the IP address assigned to your printer is 192.168.1.105, then any IP address that you select for use as a static IP address for this printer must begin with 192.168.1.&nbsp;
 The last part can be any number from 2 through254 EXCEPT that it can't be a number that router might assign to something else.&nbsp; You find this bit from your router's configuration utility.&nbsp; Or, if your printer was automatically assigned an address with the
 last part like 100, 101, 102, 103, etc., you will be pretty safe if you choose a number very far away but still within the range (e.g., 25, 50, 200).<br />

            <p>Hello,
  </p>
<p>From the FAQ on Vault Credits:
  </p>
<p><b>I claimed Rewards Credits from the vault. When will I receive them?</b>
  </p>
<p><b>If you claim Rewards Credits from the MyVIP Vault, they should appear as pending in your account within 96 hours. Once they are pending in your account, the normal deposit process kicks in. Generally if you have over 5,000 Rewards Credits pending in your account in the first half of any given month, that amount will be converted to your local currency and deposited into your Microsoft account on or around the 30th of that same month. If the Credits show as pending in the second half of the month, that amount will be deposited into your Microsoft account on or around the 15th of the next month.</b>
  </p>
<p><b>Please note you need at least 5,000 Rewards Credits pending to automatically trigger a deposit, though you can request a deposit for the next scheduled date as long as you have 1,000 Credits pending. Also, if you have ongoing issues with us depositing into your account, such as your account not matching up with your billing location, you might want to consider choosing a different prize from the vault, as we won’t be able to deliver your Rewards Credits until the deposit issue is resolved.</b></p><p>Regarding your previous deposit on October 25th, you can see a complete history of your Credit and deposit events from the MyStatement on the MyRewards page. You can then use the dates listed for your deposits to see their deposit as currency from your commerce page at (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com/</a>), where they will be listed as a refund with a negative amount.</p>
