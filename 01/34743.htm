<h2>            Achievements Locked</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a reoccuring issue with my achievements. Originally I owned an Xbox 360 and played more than half of the titles for this system. Originally I’d contacted Xbox to resolve this and I had to recover my account, after doing so every achievement was
 lost including my tenure. Small but still a frustrating ordeal. More recently I had completed Mass Effect Andromeda. Now this was half online and half offline. I have the game reinstalled on a mew Xbox One S. However after loading on the cloud save I’m at
 the end game and the achievements are still locked. On the previous Xbox I had; once I had a stable internet connecton I contacted Xbox Live support once again referring to the same issue on this gen and they’d prompted me to wait 72 hours. With no results
 I am somewhat conflicted. Can I please get clarification? Thanks!</p>

Unfortunately I’ve attempted every standard procedure. I believe this is beyond a troubleshoot, I’ve made a brief attempt to contact them, They never made contact.

<p>There is a glitch occurring where people are having their rank reset to level 1 and all of their ribbons and medal progress wiped. The method below (courtesy of&nbsp;Thievius Sisko from epic forum) will mitigate the problem as well as create a backup of your

<p>If you haven’t already heard, there is a glitch occurring where people are having their rank reset to level 1 and all of their ribbons and medal progress wiped. I have personally been rank reset, but had a backup of my player data and so was able to get
 everything back. It can be devastating to lose all your medals and rank that you worked hard for, so I highly recommend that EVERYONE makes a backup of their data following the instructions in this thread. I have compiled all the information that I have about
 this issue in this post. So apologies in advance, but this is going to be a LONG post (China will want their wall back). I don't work for Epic, so this isn't official in any way. It's just my personal research on the subject. I know that this a really long
 post, but most of the information below is really important. <br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>PLEASE NOTE: </b></span><br />
From now on, all backup information will have a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<br />
MOST IMPORTANTLY, there is no way to undo a rank reset once your data has been wiped. So that is why it is very important for everyone to make a backup of their data. Backups will restore your data in the event of a reset, so
<b>PLEASE READ AND FOLLOW THE BACKUP AND RECOVERY INSTRUCTIONS CORRECTLY!</b><br />

<span><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE ON CLOUD STORAGE BACKUPS:</span><br />
</span></b></span><br />
It has now been confirmed by several people that have been rank reset that their cloud backups were effective in restoring their data (HUGE thanks to Hell, You're Back Kim, xN A R U T Ox I, and now Jill for confirming this for me!). If you are not already aware,
 cloud storage is an online storage system that is available to everyone with an xbox live gold subscription. I would therefore recommend that everyone without a USB or memory card backup to make one on cloud storage. (If you have not used cloud storage before
 and don't know how, all the instructions you will need are in the cloud storage backup video later in this post.) Even if you have a USB or memory card to use for a backup, it never hurts to have a second backup on the cloud as well. There have been a couple
 of posts made recently which claimed that cloud storage backups didn't work, however the people who made those posts had failed to follow the backup and recovery instructions properly. When all the instructions are followed exactly then ALL backups, whether
 they are on a USB memory card or the cloud, WILL restore your data in the event of a reset.<br />

<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Rank Resets:</span></b></span><br />
Rank resets occur due to a corruption of your "player data" file in your Gears of War 3 save file. Your player data file contains all of your rank, ribbons, medals and unlocks, and ALL of these are lost during a reset. You usually won't know that your player
 data file has been corrupted until you boot up the game and press start at the main menu and see that you are now rank 1. Unfortunately, it has become clear that once you have pressed start at the main menu, ALL of your data will be gone. This is because your
 corrupted player data file will also wipe your server data when you press start at the main menu. Once this has happened, there is NO way to recover your data unless you made a backup beforehand.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Campaign Resets:</span></b></span><br />
There is a slightly less common type of reset which can occur that involves the loss of your collectibles, campaign progress, and achievement progress. I assume this involves the corruption of the "campaign saves" file instead of the player data file which
 causes a rank reset. I have termed this different type of reset a "campaign reset", and although it is less common than a rank reset it can be avoided in the same way. Backing up your data will create copies of both your player data file and campaign saves
 file, and the campign saves file can be used to recover your data in the event of a campaign reset.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>How best to avoid resets:</b></span></span><br />
It had previously been said that if you hadn't played any matches you would be able to restore your data. Unfortunately, this is now known to be untrue. The information in your player data file is all backed up to the Microsoft servers. However once your player
 data file has become corrupted, the next time you press start at the main menu it will wipe your server data, and everything will be gone forever. So it is very important that you either keep a current backup, or be VERY careful with your player data.
<br />
<br />
There are MANY ways that you can be reset. Some of the most common are listed in the section called "How/When Resets Happen" near the end of this post. Some of them are impossible to avoid, such as freezing or disconnecting during loading screens. These situations
 can lead to corruption of your player data file, and loss of your data. So, if you encounter a situation that you think might have corrupted your player data then you can do one of two things.<br />
<br />
1. DELETE YOUR PLAYER DATA FILE from your Gears of War 3 save before you next start up the game. Then when you start up the game, it will download all your information straight from the servers and create a new player data file for you. Doing this means there
 is <b>no way</b> your server data can be overwritten. Obviously you should only do this while connected to Xbox Live, as the game will need to download your data.<br />
<br />
2. START UP THE GAME WHILE OFFLINE and check whether you are rank 1. If you are, then return to the dashboard and delete your corrupted player data. You can then start the game normally, and it will download your data from the servers. If you are not reset,
 it is still recommended that you return to the dashboard before signing into Xbox Live and continue playing.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">If your game freezes then EJECT YOUR DISK TRAY!!!</span></span></b><br />
Turning your Xbox off when your game freezes is one of the common situations in which your player data can become corrupted and lead to a reset. It has been found however, that EJECTING YOUR DISK TRAY in the event of your Xbox freezing will return you to the
 dashboard and prevent your data from becoming corrupted. If you eject the disk tray and you are still frozen and you must turn your Xbox off, then you should do one of the above two steps. Many thanks to IrishLocust for making a thread about this and bringing
 it to my attention. You can check out his thread <b><a href="http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/869722-UPDATED-if-your-game-freezes%21-follow-this-step-to-avoid-rank-reset%21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">here.</span></a></b><br />

<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>IF YOU HAVE JUST BEEN RESET AND DON'T HAVE A BACKUP:</span></span></span></b><br />
<br />
If you have just discovered that you are reset to level 1 and you don't have a backup, then unfortunately it is most likely that your data will be already gone. However, you can try deleting your "player data" file from your Gears of War 3 save file, and recovering
 your gamertag to see if your data comes back. This only works for a VERY small amount of people. The only other way you could recover your data is if you have played Gears 3 on another console. If so, then there should be another player data file on there
 that you could use to replace your corrupted one.<br />

<span><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">HOW TO BACK UP YOUR DATA:</span></span></b></span><br />
<br />
I have made a tutorial video showing exactly how to make a backup of your player data and campaign saves files. The video shows how to do a backup using the cloud, however the exact same method can be used to make a USB or memory card backup. If you have access
 to a USB or memory card then feel free to use one instead of, or as well as the cloud. You can never have too many backups!
<b>PLEASE read the following information before watching the video.</b><br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">1.</span></b> Once you have followed the instructions in the video to make your backup files, do not continue playing from your backup drive. This is because player data files become corrupted while you are USING them. So if you
 continue to play after making your backup, your backup files could become corrupted without you knowing. Then when you need them to recover your rank they won't work, and your data will be lost. This has already happened to a couple of people, so you should
 only use your backup drive when you are updating your backup or recovering your rank. The key is to use the backup file as little as possible to prevent any data loss.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">2.</span></b> If you would like to use a USB as your backup drive, you can use any USB drive to backup your data but it will need to be formatted first for use with the Xbox. Formatting will wipe anything that is currently stored
 on the USB. I have also been told that some older USB drives are unable to be formatted and are therefore incompatible. To format your USB drive for use simply plug it into your Xbox, then go into your system settings and then storage. Click on the USB drive
 and choose "configure now". There is some more info about USB compatibility and formatting
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-360/how-to/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">3.</span></b> Many people have made comments suggesting that the cloud will sync backup player data stored there with your player data on your hard drive. So that, if your player data on your hard drive was corrupted then the
 backup data in the cloud would sync and be corrupted too. This is <b>incorrect</b> however. The cloud ONLY syncs with the local cache that it uses on your hard drive, and not with any of your game saves. They are completely independent. Cloud backups function
 exactly like a USB or memory card backup, except that they are stored online.<br />

<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><span>HOW TO UPDATE YOUR BACKUP:</span></b></span></span><br />
<br />
To update your backup simply load up the game and select your backup location (cloud/USB/memory card) instead of your hard drive and then play
<b>ONE</b> game of anything. This will update your backup player data file with all your new data. Then you can dashboard and load the game back up normally. As stated above, you should not continue playing on your backup drive for more than one game, as then
 you risk corruption of your backup file.<br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)"><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b><br />
HOW TO USE YOUR BACKUP IF YOU GET RESET:</b></span></span></span><br />
<br />
If you get reset you should perform the following steps to restore your data:<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">1.</span></b> Go into your System Settings, Storage, and then into your Gears of War 3 save on your Hard Drive (or wherever you store your main set of Gears 3 saves)<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">2.</span></b> Delete the corrupted "player data" file from there. This is the file that caused your rank reset, so you want to delete it.<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">3.</span></b> Load up the game and select your backup drive instead of your hard drive (so select the cloud/USB/memory card that your backup data is stored on) when it asks for a storage device. All your data from your backup
 file should appear.<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">4.</span></b> Play one game of anything and then return to the party lobby. This will restore your data on the servers.<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">5.</span></b> Go back to the dashboard, and then load up the game from your Hard Drive.
<b>Do not skip this step</b> and try to switch storage devices while in game. This can lead to data corruption. Always return to the dashboard first.<br />
<b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">6.</span></b> After you load up the game and select your Hard Drive, play one more game of anything. This will create a new player data file on your hard drive from the server data that you just restored.<br />
<br />
Then you are all done.<br />

<br />
I was a level 89 when my rank got reset. But I had a backup file and recovered everything including my skins and dlc characters, everything. Here's how to do it:<br />
<br />
You have to have a Usb drive or a Memory Card (doesn't matter what size), or you can use the cloud.<br />
Plug the usb drive into your xbox 360.<br />
Go to "System Settings" and select "A" button,<br />
Move down to memory and select "A" button,<br />
Select the xbox's Hdd and select "A" button,<br />
Click on "Games",<br />
Move down to Gears of War 3 file and click "A' button,<br />
There's all your skins, characters, player data and campaign saves.<br />
*Note - You can't copy or move your "player data file", or campaign saves yet. I'll tell you how in a minute..<br />
You can copy any dlc skins and characters by selecting the Item you want to backup and click the "A" button..<br />
It will give your 3 choices, 1) Copy 2) Move 3) Delete, "CHOOSE COPY"!!!<br />
It will now ask you where you want to save the item, choose the usb drive you just plugged in (or memory card).<br />
DONE!!! It's that simple!! It is now saved and safe.<br />
Do this for each item you want to backup.<br />
"Do not choose "Move" or it will move your file to the usb and you'll have to select that as your hdd everytime you play gears.<br />
Always choose "Copy".<br />
<br />
<b>How to copy the "player data file".</b> Really simple.<br />
<br />
Boot up Gears, select your Usb drive/memory card/cloud that you just saved everything to (<b>instead</b> of whatever storage device you usually use) and "play" 1 game of anything. This causes the game the create a new player data file and set of campaign saves
 for you on the storage device by downloading them from the servers. When you're done playing, Go to the Dashboard and your "player data file" is now copied onto your backup drive and you are now done completely backing up all your gears files.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>How to recover if you get reset:</b></span><br />
<br />
If you get your rank reset or loose an item, just plug in your Usb drive/memory card and boot up Gears and when it ask you to select the Hdd to save to, select your backup drive and everything will be back to what you saved on the backup. All your rank, medals
 and ribbons will be back!!! Play 1 game of anything again and when you're done, go back to Gears main screen and change your storage device back to the Xbox 360's Hdd (storage device) and when it downloads the content, you will have all your items and rank
 back on your xbox's hdd again and you have successfully recovered all your stuff.<br />
<br />
Highly Reccomended:<br />
<br />
After you finish playing gears for the day, I highly recommend you save everything you've done to the usb drive (only takes a few minutes). If you get to level 90 and get reset and the last time you saved the game was at level 85 on your usb drive, then that's
 what your rank will be, level 85. Better safe than sorry. Always save your files to the usb after you're done playing for the day.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><b>How to UPDATE your backup file:</b></span><br />
<br />
To update the backup file, you can delete the backup files from your backup drive and then repeat the original steps OR simply load up the game and choose your backup drive without deleting the old backup file and then play 1 game and it will update the file.
 Feel free to do whichever you prefer.<br />
<br />
It is <b>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</b> that you do this every day or two to maintain a backup file that it up to date.<br />

<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HOW/WHEN RESETS HAPPEN AND HOW TO AVOID IT:</span></b></span></span><br />
<br />
There are a couple of different situations where people are running into this glitch, so I will list them all below.<br />
<br />
SIGNING A SPLIT-SCREEN PLAYER IN/OUT AT THE PARTY LOBBY SCREEN.<br />
This seems to be the biggest culprit. When you do this, it kicks you back to the main menu and asks you to press start. When you do, one or both players will have been reset to level 1. This can happen both if you sign someone in, or sign them out. I recommend
 if you are going to play split screen ONLY SIGN SOMEONE IN/OUT AT THE DASHBOARD. Don’t try to save time by doing it while you are playing.<br />
<br />
MOVING YOUR GAMERTAG BUT NOT YOUR PLAYER DATA TO ANOTHER XBOX<br />
People who are playing split-screen should pay particular attention to this. If you are going to play on another console that is not your main one, you should also transfer your PLAYER DATA FILE (it’s inside your Gears 3 save in system memory) to the usb/memory
 card as well. It contains your rank, unlocks, medals etc. And keeping them together should prevent any kind of data loss. Usually if the game does not detect a player data file for you, it will download your data from the Microsoft servers. However, I think
 sometimes this does not happen when you are split-screening and this leads to rank resets. Since you can now use the cloud to access your player data remotely, I would recommend this for split screeners. Then this problem should not occur.<br />
<br />
TURNING YOUR XBOX OFF INBETWEEN VERSUS MATCHES, OR DURING HORDE, BEAST, OR CAMPAIGN.<br />
A lot of people seems to be having this problem when they turn their Xbox off without backing out of whatever they are playing. In particular, people are turning their Xbox off or dashboarding in-between quick matches. NEVER turn your Xbox off straight after
 a versus match, as this is when it is saving your stats, and can mess up your player data. This also seems to be happening to people who are playing horde/beast/campaign and just turn their Xbox off without backing out of the match. I would strongly recommend
 you ALWAYS BACK OUT TO THE PARTY LOBBY BEFORE SWITCHING YOUR XBOX OFF OR DASHBOARDING. There are a few people who say they waited for the next map to load in a quick match, then backed out before turning their Xbox off and they were still reset.<br />
<br />
FREEZING OR LOST CONNECTION DURING LOADING SCREENS.<br />
This is similar to the situation above, but much more difficult to avoid. During loading screens the game is reading or updating your player profile data, and any interruption to your internet during this stage seems to cause the glitch.<br />
<br />
FREEZING DURING HORDE, CAMPAIGN, VERSES ETC.<br />
Many people have mentioned that their game has frozen while they were playing, and when they restart their xbox and load up the game they have been reset. This does not have to be during a loading screen to cause a reset, any freezing at all seems to be enough
 sometimes. Freezing between waves of horde seems to be the worst offender here.<br />
<br />
PLAYING WHILE OFFLINE.<br />
Many people are having their profiles reset while trying to play while offline. From what I have read, the glitch seems to occur when you are playing offline AND THEN SIGN BACK INTO XBOX LIVE. For example, your internet or Xbox live is down so you play some
 offline campaign, or horde. Your internet/Xbox comes back online so you sign back in, THEN you are reset. I’m not exactly sure what the best way to avoid this is, but I definitely recommend NOT SIGNING BACK IN WHILE PLAYING SOMETHING. For example, don’t be
 IN a horde match, or be doing campaign then sign in. I would probably say going back to the dashboard would be safest. Or maybe even turn your Xbox all the way off and then back on. Unfortunately I’m not really sure, but signing in while playing is definitely
 a bad idea. <br />
<br />
CONNECTION DROPS OUT DURING VERSUS/HORDE/BEAST/CAMPAIGN<br />
This is actually the same as the above. The glitch occurs when you have been booted offline and then sign back in to Xbox live after you have just been offline. Some people are also reporting that they didn’t even sign back in, just turned their Xbox off and
 when they turned it on the next day they had been reset.<br />
<br />
SIGNING INTO XBOX LIVE ANYWHERE BUT THE DASHBOARD<br />
Similar to the above. Some people have said that they signed in for the first time at the main menu or party screen because their Xbox doesn’t automatically sign them in. They were then reset once they did this. This happens most frequently if you do it during
 a loading screen for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
<b>**WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?**</b><br />
I am certainly no expert (at all), but it seems like the game in certain situations seems to fail to recognise the “player data” file that is stored in your memory, which contains all of your rank/ribbons/medals information. When this happens it seems to start
 a brand new one that is blank, i.e level 1. This new file then starts to overwrite the old file when you go through any loading screens. You might be thinking “but all your rank information is meant to be stored on the Microsoft servers”, and it IS. However,
 it is only BACKED UP to the Microsoft servers. The actual information is contained in your player data file. This means, if the player data file on your hard drive is glitched and resets to rank 1 and then you gain xp, or pass through certain loading screens,
 it overwrites your old file AND sends this new information to be stored on the severs AND WIPES OVER THE OLD INFORMATION THERE AS WELL. However, if you delete the glitched file straight away it reads the information directly from the servers and recreates
 the player data file for you on your drive containing all of your actual rank/unlocks. Similarly, if your data on the servers gets wiped but you have a backup of your player data file, your data on the servers will be restored once you start the game up using
 your backup data.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>HOW TO ACCESS LOCKED UNLOCKS AFTER BEING RESET:</span></span></span></b><br />
<br />
After being reset, some unlocks (such as the For The Horde medal) become unavailable, and can no longer be unlocked. GD01 figured out a great way around this problem, so that all locked unlocks will become available again. This method has been tried by several
 people and seems to be effective at fixing the problem. You can read more about it on
<a href="http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/855813-Locked-unlocks-due-to-Rank-Reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>this</b></a> thread if you are unsure. There are two guides available for you to follow. One is written by GD01 and is performed while online. The other is a fleshed out and slightly more descriptive guide written by FredFlintstoned and is performed while
 offline. I will just post both and you may take your pick. Unfortunately, I will probably be unable to answer questions about these guides as I haven't tried them myself. Feel free to ask questions in the thread I linked to above.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><b>NOTE:</b></span></span> This method will allow everyone who has been reset to acquire the crimson weapon skins, all 3 of the avatar awards, all of the medals including "for the horde" now
 and everything else as well. BUT, you will have to re-acquire all of the collectibles in the campaign/arcade mode and you'll also need to complete campaign/arcade on hardcore in order to play it on insane.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">GDO1- Online guide:</span></span></b><br />
This one was done still connected online. You can use the other detailed one for offline option. No need to clear the cache only if needed or necessary.<br />
<br />
Play 1 private match so that you can update your files as well as the servers. Then head to the Menus and straight to the dashboard.<br />
<br />
1) transfer your player data and campaign save to the usb, then log off and transfer your gamertag to the usb.<br />
<br />
2) log in on the dashboard and start the game.<br />
<br />
3) when you see the shield like symbol with EPIC logo on it remove the usb and ignore the message that pops up. let it run through till the part where it tells you to Press Start w/ the Gears 3 logo<br />
<br />
4) Once you hit start go to your stats/awards and scroll through the tabs and go to the collectables and then to the achievements. Both should be empty.<br />
<br />
5) From there (at the achievement tab) place the usb back and a message saying that there's a new storage device or device has changed. Press A to continue which should take you back to the title screen where it tells you to Press Start with the Gears 3 logo.
 Don't press start.<br />
<br />
6) Head back to the dashboard and log off. Transfer just your gamertag back to your HDD [the game already placed your player data from the backup in the servers or cache but if you like you can transfer the one from the usb or keep it as a back up]<br />
<br />
7) remove your usb and log back in and start the game. Check back to your stats/awards and you should see your collectables empty and you campaign progress is gone like you haven't even touched it.<br />
<br />
You will still have your achievements under your stata/award [ war journal ]. The progress did reset themselves so you will see the boxes pop up even tho you already got the achievement.<br />
<br />
All your mutators, medals, skins, executions, and medals you unlock should be intact. And their progress as well.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">FredFlintstoned detailed offline guide:</span></span></b><br />
I tried GD01's instructions and it worked for me too!<br />
However, the instructions were somewhat ambiguous.<br />
But this is what I did based on what GD01 wrote:<br />
<br />
NOTE: before you do this, make an extra backup copy of your gamertag, Gears of War 3 campaign data and Gears of War 3 player save data to a SECOND memory card or USB portable hard drive just in case. (you can now use the cloud for this). If the guide does not
 work for you, try clearing your cache. That seems to fix it.<br />
<br />
1. Go offline by removing your internet connection from your XBox.<br />
<br />
2. Sign in on the dashboard (offline)<br />
<br />
3. "Move" (not copy) your Gears of War 3 player data and Campaign data to a memory card or usb portable hard drive.<br />
<br />
4. "Move" (not copy) your gamertag to the same memory card or usb portable hard drive. It'll say you need to sign-out first before you can move your gamertag. Go ahead and confirm this when it prompts you.<br />
<br />
5. Sign in on the dashboard (offline) with your gamertag from the same memory card or usb portable hard drive that you transferred your data to and start the Gears of War 3 game.<br />
<br />
6. When you see the first Epic logo appear when starting up your Gears of War 3 game, physically remove the memory card or usb portable hard drive from your Xbox and ignore the message that appears about placing the unit back in.<br />
<br />
7. Press start on your controller and go to your stats/awards. If you check your Achievements and Campaign Collectables, they should be empty.<br />
<br />
8. Plug-in your memory card or usb portable hard drive back into your Xbox. When you do this, wait a few seconds and it should automatically take you back to the Gears 3 logo where it tells you to press start (but don't actually press start on your controller).
 Instead exit back to the dashboard.<br />
<br />
9. "Move" (not copy) your updated/modified Gears of War 3 player data and your gamertag from your memory card or usb portable hard drive back to your Xbox 360 hard drive but DO NOT MOVE OR COPY your Campaign data back to your hard drive.<br />
<br />
10. Remove your memory card or usb portable hard drive from your XBox 360.<br />
<br />
11. Sign back in with your gamertag and start up Gears of War 3 (offline) and check to see if your campaign collectibles are gone. If you did the steps correctly, they should be gone.<br />
<br />
12. Now you can connect or go back online with your Xbox 360, sign in with your gamertag and start up your Gears of War 3 game.<br />
<br />
You should now be able to acquire all of the medals, achievements, avatars and weapon skins you weren't able to acquire when you were reset.<br />
<br />
Even though you will still have your achievements that you've earned listed in the game, the game will think you don't have any achievements.<br />
So you'll frequently see an achievement progression bar pop-up for all achievements while playing. This will go away after you actually got the achievement again.<br />
This method will allow everyone who has been reset to acquire the crimson weapon skins, all 3 of the avatar awards, all of the medals including "for the horde" now and everything else as well.<br />
<br />
You will have to re-acquire all of the collectibles in the campaign/arcade mode and you'll also need to complete campaign/arcade on hardcore in order to play it on insane.<br />
<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">If you haven’t already heard, there is a glitch occurring where people are having their rank reset to level 1 and all of their ribbons and medal progress wiped. While this has not personally happened to me, I can imagine how devastating
 it would be to lose medals and rank that you worked hard for. I have read nearly every post on this subject in the last couple of days, so I have compiled all the information that I have about this issue in this post. So apologies in advance, but this is going
 to be a LONG post (China will want their wall back). I don't work for Epic, so this isn't offical in any way. It's just my personal research on the subject.<br />
<br />
This post contains information about:<br />
What to do if you are reset and how to fix it<br />
How and when you can get reset<br />
How to avoid this happening<br />
<br />
I have posted this thread in both the main Gears 3 forum and the multiplayer forum as I want the largest amount of people to see and read this as possible. I am not trying to spam the forums, just help people to prevent this problem. Please help me keep this
 thread bumped so we can help people avoid this problem.<br />
<br />
**MOST IMPORTANTLY IF THIS DOES HAPPEN, DO NOT PLAY ONLINE AT ALL AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN RESET!!!!!**<br />
<br />
Many people are starting up a versus match, or horde/beast just to check if the problem will fix itself. However, this then OVERWRITES your old data and you can’t get it back. The most important thing to do if you have been reset is DO NOT PLAY ANYTHING that
 would give you xp or cause you to rank up. There is a way to get your levels back as long as you have not started ranking up after getting reset to level 1.<br />
<br />
To get your rank back you must DELETE YOUR GAMERTAG from your hard drive/memory stick and then recover it. This will read your data from the Microsoft servers instead of the glitched player data file on your hard drive and restore your rank. If you start playing
 ANY games it will overwrite your old player data file which will then be backed up on the Microsoft servers and all your old data will be gone.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, SpiderGear was reset offline and only cleared his cache and re-downloaded the Title Update and his rank was restored. You may want to try this first, or even as well as. Perhaps deleting your cache AND recovering your tag will cover all of your
 bases.<br />
<br />
If you try one of these methods and they work for you, please reply to the thread and let others know. Remember, you can’t have ranked up AT ALL.<br />
<br />
If you even THINK that there MIGHT be a chance you have been reset while playing, then BACK OUT immediately to the main menu and check. I will explain the ways you can be reset below so you know what they are. Don’t finish a campaign chapter, or horde match
 that you are playing because you will rank up at the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
**HOW/WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND HOW TO AVOID IT**<br />
<br />
There are a couple of different situations where people are running into this glitch, so I will list them all below.<br />
<br />
SIGNING A SPLIT-SCREEN PLAYER IN/OUT AT THE PARTY LOBBY SCREEN.<br />
This seems to be the biggest culprit. When you do this, it kicks you back to the main menu and asks you to press start. When you do, one or both players will have been reset to level 1. This can happen both if you sign someone in, or sign them out. I recommend
 if you are going to play split screen ONLY SIGN SOMEONE IN/OUT AT THE DASHBOARD. Don’t try to save time by doing it while you are playing.<br />
<br />
MOVING YOUR GAMERTAG BUT NOT YOUR PLAYER DATA TO ANOTHER XBOX<br />
People who are playing split-screen should pay particular attention to this. If you are going to play on another console that is not your main one, you should also transfer your PLAYER DATA FILE (it’s inside your Gears 3 save in system memory) to the usb/memory
 card as well. It contains your rank, unlocks, medals etc. And keeping them together should prevent any kind of data loss. I think players are having trouble when they sign in at the menu’s with a gamertag on a memory device and the game does not have a player
 that Xbox. Then this problem should not occur.<br />
<br />
TURNING YOUR XBOX OFF INBETWEEN VERSUS MATCHES, OR DURING HORDE, BEAST, OR CAMPAIGN.<br />
A lot of people seems to be having this problem when they turn their Xbox off without backing out of whatever they are playing. In particular, people are turning their Xbox off or dashboarding in-between quick matches. NEVER turn your Xbox off straight after
 a versus match, as this is when it is saving your stats, and can mess up your player data. This also seems to be happening to people who are playing horde/beast/campaign and just turn their Xbox off without backing out of the match. I would strongly recommend

FREEZING OR LOST CONNECTION DURING LOADING SCREENS.<br />

<br />
PLAYING WHILE OFFLINE.<br />
Many people are having their profiles reset while trying to play while offline. From what I have read, the glitch seems to occur when you are playing offline AND THEN SIGN BACK INTO XBOX LIVE. For example, your internet or Xbox live is down so you play some

 a bad idea. <br />
<br />

This is actually the same as the above. The glitch occurs when you have been booted offline and then sign back in to Xbox live after you have just been offline. Some people are also reporting that they didn’t even sign back in, just turned their Xbox off and
 when they turned it on the next day they had been reset.<br />
<br />
SIGNING INTO XBOX LIVE ANYWHERE BUT THE DASHBOARD<br />
Similar to the above. Some people have said that they signed in for the first time at the main menu or party screen because their Xbox doesn’t automatically sign them in. They were then reset once they did this. This happens most frequently if you do it during
 a loading screen for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
SELECTING THE WRONG STORAGE DEVICE<br />
If you select the wrong storage device your profile will have no rank, unlocks etc because your player data is not on that storage device. HOWEVER, a few people have been reporting that once they have selected the wrong storage device even when they went back
 and selected the right one they were still reset.<br />
<br />
**WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?**<br />
I am certainly no expert (at all), but it seems like the game in certain situations seems to fail to recognise the “player data” file that is stored in your memory, which contains all of your rank/ribbons/medals information. When this happens it seems to start

 to be stored on the severs AND WIPES OVER THE OLD INFORMATION THERE AS WELL. However, if you recover your gamertag straight away it reads the information directly from the servers and recreates the player data file for you on your drive containing all of your
 actual rank/unlocks.<br />

            Hi HaizeaPRO, seeing as you were going to wipe that PC anyway, your best option is to just clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You will need access to another PC, to create the installation media . .. 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            Hi HaizeaPRO
<br />
<br />Try this, to see if you can restore your PC, prior to making those changes in netplwiz . . 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

            No desire to restore, manually deleted mostly everything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm downloading the installation media. My only question, is do I need the USB every time I want to use windows?<br />

<p>"FunKoala64.dll" according to a search is associated with Beijing Funshion Online Technologies Ltd. And I live in China, so I don't know if that is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the clean boot step and disabled third party software, but it hasn't changed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also been having some problems with the computer not awakening for sleep,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RunDLL message comes up&nbsp;several times while the computer is on.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same problem as you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to intall Funshion.exe in my windows 7 and then I have uninstalled it. But after I updated to windows 10, I have the "Funkoala 64. dll" message appeared, which is really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how did you reset the operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards, Koko</p>

            We don't have a great way of fixing errors caused by third party applications. You would really want to follow up with the makers of Funshion and ask them for a fix.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can occur from Winload.exe or Windows Boot loader corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest rebuilding the Boot Configuration Data protocol and see if the issue will persist:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download<strong> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Media Creation tool</a></strong> in a USB or CD.</li><li>Once done, insert eh USB or CD and restart your device.</li><li>When prompted, press any key to boot from the USB/CD.</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>From<strong> System Recovery Options</strong>, select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>On the Command Prompt window, type <strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Wait for the command to be processed.</li><li>Once done, type <strong>exit </strong>to close the Command Prompt window.</li><li>Remove the USB/CD once finished.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we recommend performing a Repair Upgrade using Windows 10 ISO file. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">article</a>
</strong>written by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> for more information on how to perform a Repair Upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <span>Performing a Repair Upgrade can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings, and installed applications.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changes i did to my computer, only install needed software and update the OS Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the clean boot, still didn't work the WOT executable file...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I observe during the installation of World of Tanks, it blocks the installation of the components needed by the WOT, the Direct x, which other did like i saw on the YouTube.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that Microsoft can do help me to solve on this..</p>

<p>Thanks much, I really appreciate it. I noticed the missing content about a week ago. Not that I am a huge fan of Major Nelson or anything (they could use a fresher face) but it was nice to have those updates. I also notice the new releases for the 360 have
 started to dwindle down a little bit. These leads me to think that maybe they are thinking about releasing a new system soon (soon in gaming system terms not like I am going to eat dinner soon, soon). Obviously this is just speculation. I know they are set
 to release some good titles this year, but I have heard much of anything about 2013.</p>

<h2>            Magnifier does not work in  full screen games</h2>
                    <p>original title: Magnifier and full screen games</p>
<p>I play Links 2003 golf a lot, and use a laptop.&nbsp; There are times when I find it helpful to use the magnifier to see some area of play.&nbsp; I have a side mouse button dedicated to that function.&nbsp; When I used Win XP, it worked well.&nbsp; However, now that I have
 upgraded to Win 7, I find that the magnifier will not function in full screen gaming.&nbsp; I have to open the game in a window, and then it works fine.&nbsp; Is there any way to get the magnifier to work in full screen gaming?</p>

            <p>There are three modes for using the Magnifier. <br />
Full Screen - The entire screen is magnified.<br />
Lens mode -&nbsp; Only area around the mouse pointer is magnified<br />
Docked mode - Only a portion of screen is magnified</p>
<p><br />
Full-screen mode and lens mode are only available as part of the <span>
Aero</span> experience. If your computer doesn't support <span>
Aero</span>, or if you're not using an <span>Aero‌ </span>
theme, Magnifier will only work in docked mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I tested on Microsoft Mahjong and Microsoft Solitare and Full Screen mode did work on those games. If the Microsoft Magnifier doesn't work on 3rd party games, you would need to test with 3rd party magnifiying software.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />

<p>Had downloaded the demo years ago and really enjoyed it. Meant to get around to buying it. Would have today and discovered it's off Xbox live, and though it came out for Windows is off Steam, seems like some sort of expired license issue. Is there NO way
 I could purchase this game, even for PC? Does anyone have it on their 360? Could I purchase someone's used 360 that has it on it, but how would I find them?</p>

<h2>            Windows Installation Cannot Proceed Error - May be virus related</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My sister's computer (Everex - not sure of model or specs - bought at Circuit City - did not come with installation disks) - has Vista Home edition. She got a virus or something on her computer. I ran Malwarebytes and installed AVG freeware - ran scans and
 thought the system was cleared. After a few uses (where the laptop was rebooted each time), it was booted up and asked for the Vista repair disk - couldn't go into Safe Mode so I purchased a Vista repair disk (from a legitimate source) and tried to run the
 CD. New error came up: The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation cannot proceed. To install Windows, click OK to restart the computer, then restart the installation. I have tried to have it start normally
 and also with the last known good configuration to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I do not have the original Vista installation disk for it nor her product key, is there a way to stop this prompt - will a Vista installation disk work or does this sound more virus related? If so, should the hard drive be replaced and start from scratch?
 Limited income so do not have much leeway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Sound Plays When Pressing Shift or Ctrl After Start-Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acela97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Plays When Pressing Shift or Ctrl After Start-Up</h2>
                    Whenever I start up my device, after logging in, whenever I press shift and/or ctrl, the device plays a beeping sound. This happens regardless of the length or number of presses after each start up and log in. However, after a certain number of presses
 of either key, roughly 20 presses, the sound stops. All my filter/sticky/whatever keys are off, as are all other accessibility options. There are no functional concerns as both keys still work fine whether the sound plays or not. The sound is merely a nuisance.
 Any ideas what this is and/or how to fix it?

<h3> reggie23  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Pavilion Laptop windows 8.1 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>not used this laptop in quite a while, do not even have email set up on it, updated Norton and windows had 112 updates to download,</p>
<p>it was working just fine until I installed the updates then the mouse would not work and the laptop began to freeze up so I tried a restore,</p>
<p>that was no help, tried a refresh no luck, then the computer crashed and would not start up, so I used my HP purchased recovery discs, it got to disc 1 and then asked for disc 2 which was in for about 45 minutes with nothing happening so I pressed enter,
 it said could not find a bootable device error (3F0), ran a full hard drive test and it passed as did the memory test.</p>
<p>Finally disabled secure boot and tried that but again no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set it back to secure boot and to boot from CD/DVD, again it accepted the disc 1 but the same thing happened with disc 2,it ejected the disc and shut itself down, upon my starting it up again I got the boot options menu showing again, everything was as I
 set it and tried again with the same results, no bootable disc found, error (3F0).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phoned HP and they tell me that this error means that my hard drive has failed, yet all tests pass ok, they think it may be the recovery discs</p>
<p>but they are new from HP and not been used before even though I purchased them a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone? I would really appreciate it, keep in mind I am not a techy.</p>
<p>This Laptop has a 1 TB HD and 8GB of Ram, model HP&nbsp;Pavilion G7-2373ca, the hard drive did fail shortly after purchase and HP did replace it.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Since it has done it since you received the computer there is a chance it is old drivers, BIOS, low<br />
level chipset drivers and possibly hardware. So should definitely update those from the system<br />
maker and major device makers's sites.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these : (and these might fix the issue)</strong></p>
<p>Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />

Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow</p>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Invisible Walls, Kill-Zones, and the Fall of Halo&#58; An Open Letter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexcranson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invisible Walls, Kill-Zones, and the Fall of Halo&#58; An Open Letter</h2>
                    
<p>Here is an open letter to the Halo Design Team, and please feel free to echo my sentiments if you so agree.</p>


<p><span><span>I purchased my Xbox for the sole reason of trying out this new, awesome-sounding game called "Halo: Combat Evolved." Before this, I had been a Nintendo-boy,
 all the way. I got an NES, SNES, Game Boy, N64... but when I had to choose between the Game Cube and the Xbox, I chose the Xbox simply because of Halo.<br />
<br />
And it was glorious. <br />
<br />
I played through the campaign several times, I played with friends, and then my friends and I found a *new* game to play, a game that magnificently improved replay value: We Explored. that's right, we explored the levels. We tried to climb the highest hills,
 get on top of the tallest structures, get a warthog way up there where it wasn't supposed to go, and reach to all those places where players "weren't supposed to go."
<br />
<br />
And it was good.<br />
<br />
Then came Halo 2. We played, we conquered , and once again we explored. We cruised the rooftops in New Mombasa, we got on top of Delta Halo and drove out Warthog through the Lake under the Temple, we climbed to the top of the Control Room (there was a skull
 there, anyways). We had a great time, but we started running into these annoying things called "invisible walls." However it didn't stop us from having fun...<br />
<br />
...yet.<br />
<br />
Come Halo 3 and you'd think that the game developers had a meeting and thought to themselves "Hmm, we keep seeing user vids on YouTube showing players escaping the maps, goofing around, and having fun. We should put a stop to that immediately." And that fast,
 the invisible walls exploded up into the air like a flock of seagulls being chased by Sean Connery armed with an umbrella.
<br />
<br />
It was very sad. <br />
<br />
Every time I saw a ledge or a cool place I wanted to explore, I found myself hemmed in by these infernal invisible walls. I didn't understand why I was forced into the game corridors even though I had defeated the entire game on Legendary difficulty over-and-over;
 it's not like I was trying to by-pass the game's intended level design because I had already beaten the levels countless times they way they were intended to be played.
<br />
<br />
And Now Halo Reach takes the "Insult" one step further - to "Injury." Now instead of just hemming you in with countless invisible walls, the game designers outright kill you for trying to explore. They kill you for treading "out of bounds" even though no soldier
 in their right mind would ever actually use most of the footpaths they're forcing you to use. And, this really makes me angry, they claim to "reward players who explore" by putting secret switches in the out-of-bounds areas at the same time they're telling
 to not explore!!! How rude is that? They *honestly* expect us to spend hours treading carefully around the out-of-bounds areas, zipping back and forth waiting for the death-timer to reset, hoping to find something that may not even exist.
<br />
<br />
IF YOU WANT US TO EXPLORE, LET US EXPLORE WITHOUT DEATH-ZONES!<br />
<br />
IF YOU DON'T WANT US TO EXPLORE, THEN STOP PLACING SECRETS IN THE DEATH-ZONES!<br />
<br />
Now, all this leads me to just one conclusion: Halo 4 will be a game comprised of just one long corridor with 2 invisible walls on the left and right, and they'll kill your character if you stand still to look at the scenery for more than 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Seriously, The Halo games have become so restrictive that I'm not even looking forward to exploring the levels of Halo 4 anymore. I bought Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo: ODST, and Halo Wars right away when they hit the market; for the first time I'll be renting
 Halo 4 before buying. If the invisible walls and kill zones are as-bad-as, or worse-than, Halo 3 or Reach, then I won't purchase it. The only way, and I mean ONLY WAY, that I'll purchase Halo 4 is if it's possible to explore the levels without punishment or
 deterrence. Empower veteran players who have beaten the game to disable the kill-zones and invisible walls... or leave them out entirely!<br />
<br />
Otherwise you've lost a customer. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Signed with the utmost grief - <br />
<br />

<p>Uhhhh.....well. The Design Team you are looking for is not here. This forum is merely a discussion forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I can direct you to where it can be best seen by those who <em>are</em> working on the
<em>Halo</em> franchise, <a href="http://halo.xbox.com/forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here in the <em>Halo Waypoint</em> Forums</a>. So, best to head over there for your idea of exploring out-of-bounds.</p>

<p>I personally do agree with what you're saying, OP, but it's clearly a focus for you where it isn't for me. I know what you mean however, particularly with the jumps from H2 to 3 and H anything to Reach.</p>

<p>Lol the "whoa" was because he wrote an essay on a matter that is barely important to the game. Sure, kill zones and invisible barriers are kind of a stupid concept, but it's really not that big of a deal. Besides, there are plenty of ways to bypass invisible
 barriers in the campaign. I mean just look at the "Pilot a Seraph" glitch on Long Night of Solace. I'm subscribed to a YouTube channel called the "Pro Glitching League" and they're dedicated to finding ways out of maps and other stuff. They've been successful
 in getting out of the majority of Reach campaign maps. There's a reason why Halo isn't listed under the "Open World" or "Sandbox" category.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Kill zones and barriers in matchmaking are perfectly understandable. Those are in every game. You shouldn't be allowed to glitch out of a map to get an unfair advantage, or just venture out into the middle of oblivion during a matchmade game. Should they
 be optional in Forge? Yes, I guess so. But either way, it really isn't THAT big of a deal.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>And stating that he will no longer be buying future Halo games because of these minor restrictions is a bit ludicrous if you ask me. But to each their own, I guess.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>By the way OP, Halo 4 is not being made by Bungie. If 343i doesn't see it fit to include invisible barriers and kill zones in Halo 4, then they won't do it. But it's not the same company making the games anymore, so you have no idea what the future entails.</p>

<p>I agree with the topic. &nbsp;I also searched everywhere for places to explore. &nbsp;It added a whole new level to the title. &nbsp;The videos of Warthog launches with grenades were incredible and I spent hours on this "mini-game". &nbsp;The newer games are bland. &nbsp;The campaigns
 are the same but without the exploration factor which made the game infinitely replayable. &nbsp;In Combat Evolved you could zip past all the enemies on one level and then play the level backwards adding hours of newness and fun.</p>
<p>A good game should allow for the players to think outside the box and try something that even the devs did not ever dream of. &nbsp;The death traps and invisible barriers now make everything seem vanilla. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I surely wouldn't mind be able to explore, I would quite enjoy it actually. But not being able to won't stop me from buying a game, to me it's just not really a big selling point when it comes to Halo. If this was GTA then it'd be a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I will admit there have been times I've tried to explore a bit and got annoyed by the inability to do so, so at least I can say letting us would be a good and well appreciated addition.</p>

    <title>Microsoft acpi-compliant control method battery disables my battery on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buschflip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft acpi-compliant control method battery disables my battery on update.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
I am working with a Lenovo Y530 (ab00216104) Laptop. After a couple of years the battery stopped holding a charge so I ordered a new one from a third party as Lenovo temporarily stopped selling them. The new battery worked fine at first however after a few
 minutes I get the "battery plugged in, not charging" message from the battery system icon in the bottom left. It simply stops charging the battery, but it will run off the battery until it is depleted. At first, I thought it was a bad battery however through
 much trial and error I have discovered the battery works fine. Let me explain.<br />
<br />
If I&nbsp;uninstall "Microsoft acpi-compliant control method battery"&nbsp;from the device manager and restart my computer with my wireless card turned off then the battery will operate perfectly. It isn't until I connect to the internet that suddenly it stops charging
 again. It's as if once my computer is able to access the internet and update "Microsoft acpi-compliant control method battery" that the problem occurs.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As far as I can tell there is no way to stop it from&nbsp;updating&nbsp;once it establishes a connection and no way to "roll back drivers" as that option is grayed out. I would greatly appreciate any advice on this situation, thank you.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform the following methods.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:

<b>Start</b>, right-click <b>Computer</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>In the
<b>Tasks</b> list, click <b>Advanced System Settings</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>On the
<b>System Properties</b> dialog box, click the <b>Hardware</b> tab, and then click
<b>Windows Update Driver Settings</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>Select
<b>Never check for drivers when I connect a device</b>.</span>
</li><li><span>Click
<b>OK</b> twice, and then close the <b>System</b> dialog box.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>: Install the latest
 chipset drivers for the laptop and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, contact the Lenovo support for further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your help, however it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I've found a solution now, it can be done by editing the windows registry as follow.....</p>
<p>regedit....<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\Power,
</strong>add a new <strong>DWORD32 </strong>there&nbsp;and rename it as <strong>AwayModeEnabled,</strong> right click and edit the value as<strong> 1</strong> (Hex). Finally, edit the laptop's<strong> Lid close action</strong>&nbsp;as<strong> Sleep</strong> on the Power
 Option setting page in Windows7.</p>
<p>I am not sure it is the best way or not, but it is fine for me,&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;can keep downloading file even it is in Sleep mode.&nbsp;Anyway, I hope this issue can be fixed by future update.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Mail Merge via email with Windows Mail.</h2>
                    I am trying to mail merge a document via Windows Mail. Outlook Express has been replaced with Windows Mail in Windows Vista.<br />
Does Windows Mail have MAPI capability? If I upgrade to Windows 7, will Windows 7&nbsp;mail then have MAPI technology?<br />
Or do I need to download Outlook to email merged documents?<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What did you download?<br />
Is it MAPI client or Windows Live Mail?</p>
<p>Try to download the file and save it on the desktop. Right click on the file and click Run as administrator.</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, start the computer in safe mode and try to install the tool i.e. MAPI client&nbsp;as an administrator.<br />

            Try running a repair upgrade.
<br />This will not wipe apps or data.
