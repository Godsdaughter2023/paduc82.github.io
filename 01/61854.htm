<h2>            Action Centre and Windows Update.</h2>
                    Over&nbsp;the last weeks nearly every time I turn on my desktop computer (Windows 7 64 Bit) I get a message in the Action Centre telling me that I need to turn on Windows Automatic Update. Each time I do as requested and select Automatic Update (Recommended).Then
 the next time I turn on my computer the same thing happens again. I am getting the same message on my laptop (Windows 7 32 Bit). Does anybody have any ideas as to&nbsp;what is causing this problem and how to rectify the problem? It is not a big issue just a nuisance.

            <p>I would remove Advanced System Care. It is primarily a registry cleaner. Registry cleaners provide negligible benefits and have the potential to create insoluble system errors that can only be resolved by reinstalling windows and all that entails.</p>

<p><span>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list

            Hi Tasha, that depends on the browser you are using . . .
<br />
<br />Generally in all Browsers:
<br />Click the 3 dots (ellipsis) at the top right of the Browser
<br />Choose Settings - Advanced Settings
<br />Somewhere in there you will see the option to change the default download location!

            The settings depends upon browser to browser. But once you set this setting, all downloads will go into that folder only. It can not be set up for a specific file type like audio.
<br />
<br />Firefox - Click 3 vertical dashes in top right corner &gt; Options &gt; Scroll down &gt; Under Downloads, change Save files to by click Browse button
<br />
<br />Chrome - Click 3 vertical dots in top right corner &gt; Settings &gt; Scroll down &gt; Advanced &gt; Scroll down, Under Downloads, change the folder
<br />
<br />Edge - Click 3 horizontal dots in top right corner &gt; Settings &gt; Scroll Down &gt; View advanced Settings &gt; Change folder under Downloads

            Note, there is no provision for changing this for only certain types of files. It will change for all downloads until you change it again.

<p>Hey Gustavoc93,</p>
<p>Where and when do you get this error code 28?</p>
<p>Looking at your problem description and the error coded 28 generated by device manager, it is highly likely that a driver required to run those hardware are missing on your computer.</p>
<p>We can see this information here:<br />

<p>If the troubleshooters fix your problem, you’re good to go from here. If it doesn’t, please proceed with the remaining steps.</p>
<p>Locate the software and drivers specifically released for your device at the manufacturer Web site.</p>
<p>When you download a driver from the Internet, download the Windows 7 version of the driver when multiple Windows versions are listed. Use one of the following options:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
•&nbsp;Visit the Web site of the computer manufacturer if the device came with the computer.
<br />
•&nbsp;Visit the Web site of the device manufacturer if the device was installed after you purchased your computer.
<br />
•&nbsp;Visit the Web site of the device manufacturer if the device was preinstalled on your computer and the computer manufacturer does not have an updated driver.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t turn on &#34;Find My Device&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I go to the "Find My Device" panel in settings to turn it on, it contains the message: "ou'll need to sign into this device with a Microsoft Account to turn this on. If you've connected a work of school account, Find My Device won't work."</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am already signed in with my personal Microsoft Account... I don't think it's a work or school account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the link to "Sign in with a Microsoft Account" it brings my to my "Accounts" panel where it shows I am signed in with my Microsoft Account and offers to "Sign in with a local account instead"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is... how can I turn on "Find My Device"?? :)</p>

If you haven't yet reboot as often that clears the problem and the drive will open.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
<br />
For tray drives :<br />
<br />
Sometimes they get stuck. There is a little hole on the front of the CD drive that you can stick a&nbsp;<br />
paperclip in which will release the drive and allow it to open.<br />
<br />

<p>For Slot Drives :<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker on how to eject the disk.<br />

<br />
<strong>Be careful as you can damage the drive using the&nbsp;method below :<br />
</strong><br />
You may need to get the driver working 1st however this might still work.<br />

I should also add that all of the games I have still see all of the DLC content which seems very odd to me that none of my saved games will load.</p><p><br /></p><p>I did some digging around online but I couldn't find anyone with the exact same issue as myself so any help would be appreciated.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you!<br /></p>

<h3> richardwintjen  say:</h3>
<h2>            TW802 Winbook Windows Tablet Windows 10 Update Failed, won&#39;t accept Windows 10 bootable USB</h2>
                    <p>The latest update stopped in the middle, and attempted to restore to the previous installation, then just stopped. I used the Media Creation tool to create a bootable USB drive, but when I start the tablet, I get a message window that says "It looks like
 you started an upgrade and booted from installation media. If you want to continue with the upgrade, remove the media from our PC and click Yes. If want to perform a clean installation instead, click No.", but the touch screen won't let me tap either Yes or
 No. If I connect the USB drive though a 4-port hub, so I can also connect a keyboard, the tablet freezes after the splash screen, and doesn't start at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a command code I can add to the setup.exe line in autorun.inf to override this test? Or, will a powered USB hub allow it to boot with the keyboard present? Right now, I have a shiny brick that makes for a poor mirror.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted Windows Update file might've caused the update installation to file. That being said, can you tell me the results of the restoration to the previous version of Windows? Are you still able to boot into the desktop? If you can still boot into the
 desktop, I recommend performing the troubleshooting steps outlined in this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix Windows Update issues">support article</a></strong>. If all the methods failed, you can perform an In-place upgrade using the Windows
 10 ISO file downloaded using the <strong>Media</strong> <strong>Creation</strong>
<strong>Tool</strong>. Performing an In-place upgrade will preserve your personal file and installed programs. For the steps on how to perform an In-place upgrade, please refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a" title="How to perform an In-place Upgrade with Windows 10 Step-by-Step Guide">forum
 article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to boot into the desktop, have you tried hitting the volume buttons while the message
<em>"It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media. If you want to continue with the upgrade, remove the media from our PC and click Yes. If you want to perform a clean installation instead, click No."</em> is present? Volume buttons
 on some tablets can be used as a substitute for confirmation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>When it tried to restore, it just kept restarting, for hours, repeating the message that it was returning to the previous version. Eventually, it just stopped on a blank screen, then shut down, as far as I could tell. Now, when started with nothing connected,
 it displays an error window that says "Please insert the external storage media and press OK"; it shows this first, so no desktop. I guess it thinks it used the flash drive for part of the update, but when I inserted that drive with the keyboard via the hub,
 it just went blank again. That is when I used that drive to create the install media, but not an ISO file. I guess I can try an ISO file, if it will work from a USB flash drive, but the tool implies otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this tablet's volume buttons won't substitute for key presses; would have been cool if they did.</p>

            If you re-read my first post, you will see that I tried the installation media. My original question was, is there a command line option for setup.exe that I can add to the autorun file to bypass the failed update check.

    <title>BSOD when laptop starts with charger plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrien lyth  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD when laptop starts with charger plugged in</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I possess an Asus laptop with its original charger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows version is windows professional 10 - 1709 - 16299.125.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start my computer with charger unpluggued, I can do everything fine, and&nbsp; restart my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug in the charger after that, sometimes it fails, sometimes I can still reboot the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I start the computer with the charger plugged in, it systematically goes BSOD after 15-20s of startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to change battery configurations since ventilators were going loud right at startup, so I put everything equal as on battery mode to check if it changes anything. I didn't touch specific options like 'when running a video' since it doesn't seem linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened after the latest Windows Update I got. I executed a chkdsk in case some corrupted files existed, but it's not the case it seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best example I got is the following :&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I start laptop unplugged</p>
<p>2. I wait 1-2 min</p>
<p>3. I launch the game I wanna play</p>
<p>4. I plugin the charger</p>
<p>5. I can play, but I might not be able to restart computer</p>
<p>In that case, the computer is not even getting loud on ventilators. I can press crtl alt supp and check tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following doesn't work :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I start laptop unplugged</p>
<p>2. I wait 1-2 min</p>
<p>3. Plugin the charger</p>
<p>4. Launch the game</p>
<p>The laptop will freeze 100% of the time. I cannot press crtl alt supp it shows me an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really have no idea right now what do to except reinstall windows and hope for the best...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also happened after I understood that my graphics card was not used by my PC (not the intel graphics once). So I updated its driver and forced its use on my game. Don't know if it can be related, looks weird.</p>

            I assume you have a resume in some Word Processing format (perhaps .doc using Microsoft Word or some other file type and program) and need to change it to a format which will be accepted by the internet site that's accepting the applications.&nbsp; To help
 you, we need to know what format the resume is in now (program name and version and file type) and the format required by the internet site (file type).&nbsp; The file type is the three digit extension after the filename (like .doc).<br />
<br />
Thanks!

    <title>Dell NMI Parity Check Error During Vista Upgrade from XP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Dell NMI Parity Check Error During Vista Upgrade from XP</h2>
                    I'm trying to upgrade my Dell E310/3100 from Windows XP MCE to Vista Home Premium SP1.&nbsp; I ran the Vista Upgrade Advisor and it said the computer met the minimum requirements for Vista.&nbsp; It also said that I would need to upgrade my graphics card after installing
 Vista (I have integrated graphics on the Dell) in order to use the Aero features of Vista.&nbsp;So I went ahead and attempted the install of Vista and towards the end of the installation (I believe on one of the restarts) my computer blue screens with Hardware
 Malfunction: NMI Parity check/memory error system halted.&nbsp; After I&nbsp;force the computer to shut off and restart the Vista installation says it has failed and&nbsp;reverses the attempted installation.&nbsp; I have reseated both DIMMs and tried using only one, but niether
 solved the&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; Any idea's on what is causing the hardware failure?&nbsp; Could it be the integrated graphics card?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I installed a new video card and it solved the problem.&nbsp; It seems that my integrated video couldn't handle Vista (or is it the other way around??).&nbsp; Vista succesfully installed after two weeks of screwing with the computer to get it to work.&nbsp; Vista better
 be worth all the hassle!!!

            Hi Stevie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Bogus.  There are no discounts for retail Windows 10, nor are there Family Pack or multi-user keys except for Volume Licensing keys which can only legally be used by businesses who activate using their on-site server which must regularly reactivate or they expire - so we see a lot of customers who bought these who have them work for awhile then ask us why they are expiring.  Retail keys never expire, only illegally sold Volume License keys.  
<br />
<br />There are hundreds of these sites who are selling bogus WIndows software and are outside of the reach of authorities so cannot be shut down or pursued legally.  
<br />
<br />Always buy WIndows software from Microsoft or a major retailer that backs all sales, e.g. Best Buy, Tesco, Amazon mainline but not 3rd party.  EBay never, even though PayPal will back it you might not discover it's bogus until their warranty expires. 
<br />
<br />Here is the safest source for WIndows 10 Home and Pro:
<br /><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you. I am suspicious by nature. Despite that site being posted on a blog that normally gives good advice, it triggered my "too good to be true" warning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two machines.&nbsp; A windows 7 Pro desktop machine and a new Windows 10 Home laptop. My understanding is I can still upgrade my Windows 7 Pro key IF I wish.&nbsp;My new laptop has a Home License.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe a legitimate option would be to transfer the Win 7 Pro key to the new laptop if I decide to scrap the desktop machine or to pay for the laptop's system to be upgraded to Pro. That decision will be forced in January when Win 7 support ends.&nbsp;</p>

            Stevie, while the free Upgrade ended three years ago there are still sporadic reports that one can use the Windows 7 Product Key to activate a Clean Install or Upgrade if inserted after it's done.  There is no guarantee of course, but they spent a fortune in the first Upgrade to add that ability  so they may not be in a hurry to turn it off.  
<br />
<br />If you get it activated it will create a Digital License which you can then link to your MS Account by signing in with it.  Once this is done you can move a DL to new hardware following this guide: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>.  
<br />
<br />I'd save a System Image backup of your Windows 7 install if you value it so you can go back at any time.  You can also roll back an Upgrade within 10 days if it doesn't work out.
<br />
<br />Let me know if there's anything else.
<br />
<br />Also when ready please mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.  A rating is also appreciated.

<p>Thank you for the additional information. It saves me some hunting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would save a system image before upgrade but the reason for upgrade would be the degrading level of security beyond Win 7 EOL. All current programs should run on Win 10 (except Windows Media Player will be missing but that is replaceable).&nbsp; I can think
 of no rational reason to retain Win 7 other than the possibility of hardware incompatibility.&nbsp;</p>

<br />I'd also take advantage of the 5gb free stored in the OneDrive cloud to drag folders you want to backup into OneDrive folder, or tell it to sync Desktop, Documents and/or Pictures to OneDrive using the new Folder Protection here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive backup gives you 15gb real time sync to their cloud and lets you choose all of your User and any other folders.  I use both.

            Windows Media Center is ended in Windows 10.  
<br />
<br />Try the new Windows 10 Movies and TV app which works fine for those.

                    Apparently the advanced appearance configuration isn't available in windows 8 the way it was in windows 7. I usually use dark theme colors and the black font of the title bar is just unreadable.

<p><br />
Good question.&nbsp;&nbsp; That does look like a an oversight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a workaround.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a Microsoft mouse configure a button to be Magnify in Lens mode with reverse video.&nbsp;&nbsp; The title is then&nbsp;faintly readable that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp; Here's something even easier.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Just change focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will be able to read a Title bar of a window which does not have focus.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. I clicked in the Taskbar and the otherwise solid black Personalization bar then became readable.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's interesting that the Taskbar itself gets white lettering
 for its features.&nbsp; I wonder how that happens?&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps knowing that would help you find a better workaround?&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that the tool you remember is still available in a High Contrast theme so another possibility would be customizing a High Contrast theme,
 then finding how it is implemented then trying to export that and import it back into a normal theme.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tip:&nbsp; use&nbsp; ProcMon to help you find out how these values are being updated and stored in the registry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have some clues from that analysis, try
 doing a web search because I imagine that someone will have already done this and reported&nbsp;their similar earlier analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; ;&nbsp; )</p>

Good luck</p>

            I agree om07 - many of these changes that prevent us from customizing our look &amp; feel to windows to work more like the way we prefer is unacceptable. &nbsp;Especially when I want to use a dark color for my Windows Color, it is unacceptable how I cannot change
 the text as well to make it readily visible, especially when all the previous versions of Windows allowed such customizations.
<div><br />
<div>Also, we should not be relegated to having to purchase 3rd party tools or editing the registry to get the desired results.</div>

            I also am annoyed and amused by this. The title bar font turned white when I set my window color darker, which is fine, and the tabs in IE lighten a bit to be able to read the font... but I just don't understand why they didn't add that most BASIC of customization
 options&nbsp;- to be able to set the font and font color. I found the font size option, but still - black text doesn't look good on my dark blue, and the high contrast themes just aren't the same. And then some d-bag keeps posting on these threads links to a 3rd
 party app... lol *sigh*

            <p>After comparing the High Contrast Themes to my normal-contrast theme, I believe I figured it out (it worked for me, even on another computer afterwards):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure the following file is present in your computer:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Windows\Resources\Themes\aero\aerolite.msstyles<br />
<br />
</li><li>Save your theme as a regular theme (not as a&nbsp;theme for sharing).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Find your .theme file in the following folder (it should have the same name you used to save it, with the .theme extension):<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\&lt;YourUserName&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Themes<br />
<br />
You may want to make a copy of it just in case, but save it to a different place. Otherwise, you’ll see both copies, with the same name, on the personalization applet.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Edit the file with a text editor and find the 'path=' line under the [VisualStyles] heading. It should have the path to a .msstyles file.<br />
<br />
Change it to “Path=%SystemRoot%\resources\themes\Aero\AeroLite.msstyles”<br />
<br />
</li><li>Under the [Control Panel\Colors] heading find the 'TitleText=' entry. I changed mine from "0 0 0" to "255 255 255" (white), and it took!</li></ol>
<p>Hope it works for you too…<br />
Good luck!</p>

***********************************************************
* 7.  INSTALLATION SWITCHES AVAILABLE
***********************************************************

The switches in the SETUP.EXE file will have the following
syntax. Switches are not case sensitive and may be
specified in any order (except for the -s switch). Switches
must be separated by spaces.

SETUP [-b] [-overwrite][-nolic] 
[-res {x_pixels x y_pixels x bits x vert_refresh}]
[-l{lang_value}] [-s] [-f2&lt;path\logfile&gt;] [–over4id]

GFX-INSTALL CUSTOM SWITCHES

-b  Forces a system reboot after the installation 
completes. In non-silent mode, the absence of this switch
will prompt the user to reboot. In silent mode, the absence
of this switch forces the Setup.exe to complete without 
rebooting (the user must manually reboot to conclude the 
installation process).

-overwrite  Installs the graphics driver regardless of the
version of previously installed driver.  In non-silent 
mode, the absence of this switch will prompt the user to 
confirm overwrite of a newer Intel Graphics driver. In 
silent mode, the absence of this switch means that the 
installation will abort any attempts to regress the 
revision of the Intel(R) Extreme Graphics driver.

-nolic	Suppresses the display of the license agreement
screen. In non-silent mode, the absence of this switch will
only prompt the user to view and accept the license
agreement. The functionality of this switch is auto-
matically included during silent installations.

-res [x_pixels]x[y_pixels]x[bits]x[vert_refresh].
Sets the four default display parameters: pixels per line, 
pixels per column, bits per pixel and vertical refresh 
rate. For example: If you want 1024 pixels per line, 
768 pixels per column, 16 bits per pixel, and a vertical 
refresh rate of 75Hz, you would input the following at 
the command line "-res 1024x768x16x75".

-l{lang_value}  The switch specifies the language used for 
the Gfx-Install user interface. The absence of this switch
will cause the installation to utilize the language of the 
OS as its default. Hexadecimal values for the supported 
languages can be found in the localized language 
abbreviations section of this readme.

-s  Run in silent mode. The absence of this switch causes
the install to be performed in verbose mode.

-f2&lt;path\logfile&gt;  Specifies an alternate location and name
of the log file created by a silent install. By default,
the log file is created and stored during a silent
install in the windows temp directory as IntelGFX.log
(&lt;WINDIR&gt;\Temp\IntelGFX.log).

–over4id  Forces the installer to overwrite a 4ID format 
driver (vendor ID, device ID, subsystem id, revision number) 
with a 2ID driver (vendor id, device id).

<h3> siabi2005  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 Has no sound after coming out of standby</h2>
                    No sound in menus or game other than cutscenes after waking up.&nbsp; Anyone else had this issue?<br />
On;y way to resolve it is to come out of the game and restart it with the interminably long start-up sequence.&nbsp; It's getting very irritating.<br />
<br />
I'm using the Xbox with an optical digital out to the amp if that makes any difference, but the TV has no sound either from just the HDMI lead.

<p>I have had the problem a few times with a couple different games (I don't play Forza Horizon) and like you the only thing that I have found to resolve the issue is a hard reset but since it doesn't happen very often it really hasn't been an option.&nbsp;

 problem &nbsp;not Norton. I also have a problem sending and&nbsp;receiving pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 does not boot after a forced replacing of the graphics card &#40;old graphic card drivers still in place&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>My first time here.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System: Win10 Pro (upgraded from windows 7)</span></p>
<p><span>Problem: I was forced to replace the graphics card (pci-e Asus en7950gt 512mb) because it crashed the system and it had no more image video when tried to boot (Beeps: 1 long, 3 short - means bad video card). When i took the card out it was extremely
 hot and i found out later on that the fan did not work anymore. Even so, tried the card in another pc and the same beeps were heard. So no doubts about the card malfunction. Replaced the card (with pci-e Ati Radeon XT800 XT-256 mb) and now Windows 10 does
 not boot. Here's the contents (translated) from the messages on a blue pale background.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">1st line - RECOVERY</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">2nd line - The PC / Device has to be repaired.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">3rd line - A required device is not connected or is inaccessible.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">(Comment: The problem was switching graphics cards without having
 uninstalled the drivers first and unmount the card.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">After pressing Enter, as advised in the end of this message, a new 3rd line appears</span><br />
</p>
<p>New 3rd line: The application or operating system could not be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>New 4th line: File:\Windows\System32\Winload.exe&nbsp;<span>(Comment: &nbsp;I think winload.exe it is still there. Maybe what it is happening is that a file/dll/driver that winload.exe is trying to load or use informs that the card (the old one)
 is not present)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">4th line - Error code 0xc000000e</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">5th line - You will need to use recovery tools. If you do not have any installation media (for example, a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC / Device manufacturer. (Comment: As it was an upgrade i do not
 have any of them)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">6th line - Press Enter to try again</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">7th row - Press F8 for boot definitions</span><br />

    <title>Halo 3&#47;Reach Theatre material unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Halo 3&#47;Reach Theatre material unavailable</h2>
                    
<p>Please help, I am unable to access movies of previous games in Halo 3/Reach.</p>
<p>It says - "Unable to start because a player in your party is restricted from playing with user-created content".</p>
<p>I originally purchased a special €2 2 month subscription, so considered this was why I had limited features.</p>
<p>However, because I want to access the content I have now updated my account with a full 12 month subscription&nbsp;and I am still unable to access the Theatre Lobby movies. I consider this unfair and unacceptable since I immediately upgraded my account to avail
 of these features which I enjoyed before. Can you please explain this situation and offer a solution.</p>

<p>Just to clarify for you although it's too late, it doesn't metter what offer you get, if you have Xbox Live Gold whether it be a free trial to the 12 month subscription, the service is exactly the same.</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Sign in to the profile for which you want to change settings.</p>
<p>In the Xbox Live section of the Xbox Dashboard, select your gamer card, and then press the A button.</p>
<p>Select Edit Gamer Profile.</p>
<p>Select Privacy Settings. If you are prompted to leave the current session, select Yes, and then press the A button.</p>
<p>Select Member Content.</p>
<p>Select Everyone, Friends-Only, or Blocked, and then press the A button.</p>
