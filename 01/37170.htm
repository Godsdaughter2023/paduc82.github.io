<p>Hi Sharda,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Updates address other bugs and issues in Windows. Even though they are not responsible for security vulnerabilities, they might impact the stability of your operating system, so it is always recommended to keep your PC up-to-date.
</span>We do not recommend that you disable automatic Windows Update in Windows 10. If your computer is fine with downloads in the background and doesn’t affect your work, it is not advisable to do it. However, if you are experiencing poor PC performance due
 to updates downloading and installing in the background, there are ways on how you can turn off Windows Update depending on the Windows edition you're running. May we know the edition of Windows you're on? Is it the
<strong>Home </strong>or <strong>Pro </strong>edition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you may also schedule or pause updates in Windows 10. Check out this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028233/windows-10-schedule-or-pause-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for more information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon. </p>

<p>Hey,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same question. I understand how important these notifications are, but we are in a position where we can't have them pop up. So would it be possible to disable these types of notifications? We are currently using Microsoft Windows 10 Pro. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - Stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Just a few days ago - Windows Live Mail - which has been operating on Windows 10 since I installed 10 months ago stopped working and I get the following message</p>
<p>
</p><div>Unable to send or receive messages for the Charter (xxxxxx) (1) account. Header download for the 'Inbox' folder did not complete. Could not download new messages from the IMAP server.</div>

<div>
<p>Server Response: The server did not respond to this IMAP command before the connection was terminated.<br />
Server: 'IMAP.charter.net'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC0F<br />
Protocol: IMAP<br />
Port: 143<br />
Secure(SSL): No</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Essentials repair - I have tried switching to POP - I have contacted the server techies also - but to no avail.&nbsp; I have created a new account - and it added all the data from the IMAP account on this computer - but then failed with the same message
 when the 'get' tried to execute.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Also tried to sync Windows 10 new mail program - and it will not sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a Windows 10 problem - if so it is new?&nbsp; If it is a server problem - then they should have experienced this with other customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The error "0x800CCC0F-unexpectedly terminated" is usually caused by interference from an antivirus program.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which antivirus are you running? Some of them cause problems with Windows Live Mail. As a minimum, email scanning in the antivirus should be turned off, although that may not be sufficient to eliminate all bad effects. In a worst case scenario, your antivirus
 may need to be uninstalled/reinstalled or replaced. A free antivirus that is 100% compatible is available here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>To rule out the server as the cause of the problem, you should try a different server. Get a free account with Gmail, which will allow you to try their smtp.gmail.com server.

            <p>Thank you for your answer.&nbsp; Indeed the anti-virus software really seemed to be the problem -&nbsp; The moment I turned it off - then Live Mail started flowing in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned the Kaspersky back on - and have found no trouble since that time.&nbsp; I did not even think
 that Anti-viral software would cause this problem, and neither did my server - who merely responded that they had no trouble shooting with third party software.</p>

<h2>            How do I enable my bluetooth in Windows 8 &#40;option not available in settings&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire 5742 notebook that I upgraded to Windows 8 from Windows 7. Everything seemed to transfer, merge and install completely and efficiently. That is until I tried to use my bluetooth speaker. I went to the Acer website and downloaded all
 drivers for my x64 version. Again everything installed completely, no errors. All drivers were accounted for within the system. Start - Settings - Change PC Settings - Wireless (and here is where it gets complicated.) It shows 3 options with bars to turn off
 or on. 1. Turn off all wireless communications 2. Wireless 3. Bluetooth. Turning off all wireless&nbsp;has the option to turn off and on. Wireless has the option to turn off and on also. But the Bluetooth bar does not let me change it from off to on, it is grayed
 out and in the off position. SO then I tried to find the process and get it started/enabled but with no luck. I have&nbsp;been reading the forums for weeks and even&nbsp;searched&nbsp;for different drivers. The Bluetooth worked perfect before I upgraded, not sure what is
 going on, but it seems a lot of people had Bluetooth issues after the upgrade. So if anyone can please help me, would so very much appreciate it.</p>

Hi! I wanted to ad a bug onto my videos with a transperant logo, but I am having trouble uploading a photo and overlaying it on the clips. Is there a way to add the bug onto the videos?
<br />
<br />
I have watched videos and read forums, but they are for the older version on Windows Live Movie Maker and they are not very similar when it comes to the description on how to add a bug or a watermark. I am on Windows 7 and have the newer version of Windows
 Live Movie Maker. Please let me know if you know what to do, it would help me greatly. Just comment below!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            You can't do it with WLMM.<br />
<br />
You'll need to use a classic version of Movie Maker such as MM2.6 which installs and works in Windows 7, applying the methods you've watched and read about. Or run your finished movie through
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Expression Encoder 4</a> to add the overlay.

            If PapaJohn is going to plug WMM 2.6, I'll plug WMM 6.0 as another option.&nbsp; Personally since WMM 6.0 takes advantage of the GPU (graphics card) and also has a 64-bit version (which is what many/most Windows 7 PCs are using these days), I think WMM 6.0
 is an ideal choice if you want the classic functionality of Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
Here's a link to an installer as well as numerous add-ons for WMM 6.0.&nbsp; After you get WMM 6.0 installed, the item you want is under 'Titles' and is called 'Overlay Logo/Watermark'.<br />

            Hi <span>Deenaf88,<br />
<br />
<span>The feature you are inquiring about is really a great idea and would be a great feature to have. I will submit this request to our product team. You could refer to PapaJohn and considerate_guy's
 workarounds on how you could add a watermark on the movie project you are creating.<br />
<br />
@ PapaJohn and considerate_guy Thanks for helping out!<br />
<br />
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Movie Making in Windows 10</h2>
                    Since Windows 10 doesn't have or support Movie Maker, is there a good free Movie Making app for Windows 10 that will make a movie, allow you to add music, and easily post to social media and save to your hard drive? &nbsp;I know you can still download Movie
 Maker. &nbsp;Has anyone tried to use it on Windows10?

    <title>Calender App in Windows 8.1 Desktop is not smart enough to auto add - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabirafrin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calender App in Windows 8.1 Desktop is not smart enough to auto add events from the Mails received</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Calendar App in windows 8.1 Laptop. The app has serious shortcomings or It is that I am not aware and I plead ignorance. But the issue is</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;received my flight tickets on the Live Mail from airlines. I thought that the date of travel would be automatically added as an event in the calendar app. But I was wrong..... It just didn't happen. The calendar app on the Lumia Phone 8.1 also did
 not have the event auto added. Why is the calendar app in Windows so primitive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried this option with google. I just forwarded the mail I received from my airlines to the Google mail account and when I opened the android phone I was surprised to see that The event has automatically been added in the google and the Google calendar.
 And offcourse since the Sunrise calendar is also connected with my google plus account the travel date event was also updated on the sunrise calendar. No extra efforts were required to set up the travel date event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I wish the developers would add the feature shortly. If the feature is already missing can someone put up a step by step guide to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>regards and thanks in advance</p>

<p>Well Mayank thanks for your honest answer... I never expected Microsoft to accept that the feature is not available and i thought there would be some beating round the Bush with many posts directing me to some link to understand the process of calendar app....</p>
<p>
</p><p>But&nbsp;I hope Microsoft is working on the solution. It helps cut down on unnecessary steps to create an event.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when Google can do it why not you???? It's not rocket science after all.&nbsp;I just hope you will either add the feature in windows 10 or release an update for windows 8.1 pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your honest and prompt reply</p>

            <p><strong>Yes Mayank I do have another question</strong>. I hope you will be able to address it. The complete details is as under</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I know this question is outdated but I am stuck up and could not find the relevant suggestions to resolve the issue. I had a Windows 7 preinstalled on my laptop and when the offer to upgrade to windows 8 pro was announced I was amongst the first few who
 immediately upgraded to windows 8 pro and then as a special offer i was also offered the windows media center to activate. I would like to confirm that I do have the mail where in the product key of windows 8.1 Pro 64 Bit and windows media center. After the
 upgrade barring a few hiccups there was no problem at all. Then when the windows 8.1 pro was available on the windows store I again upgraded to windows 8.1 pro. After the install my new configuration was Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But immediately after upgrade I realized that the refresh option in account and recovery was not working. It always prompted me that certain files are missing and I should insert the media. But I never downloaded an ISO image of Windows 8 Pro nor do I have
 a media of windows 8.1 pro because of the way in which I had been upgraded to windows 8.1 Pro with Media Centre. anyways I just overlooked the issue and never bothered about it seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Offlate I realize that my computer has slowed down considerably. I tried the option of deleting Temp files, clearing Prefetch, scan /sfc, defragmenting etc etc. But nothing seems to work. Suddenly I also realize that while booting I am getting a Blue
 Screen with the message that Critical Process Died Blue Screen Error. Sometimes I just get a comd prompt with message tp press Press Ctrl Alt del and then some message about some problem in external media connected failure... I never took a snapshot of the
 same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now can&nbsp;you tell me how to go about:---</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to refresh windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center without any media. I only have the windows 8 Pro and Media Center Key separately.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp; If there is no way to refresh windows 8.1 Pro without Media&nbsp;</strong>then</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; How to download genuine Windows 8.1 Pro media with the key of Windows 8 Pro from Microsoft site.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What If I download windows 8 Pro Media and then try to refresh windows 8.1 Pro? Will it work????</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I download Windows 8 Pro and then reinstall on my laptop running windows 8.1 Pro will it do a clean install?? what happens to the Sony Vaio Care which came preinstalled on my PC???? What about the Bios which has been
 upgraded on my PC??? I checked the Sony Vaio site and found that It has not released and drivers for Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;or Windows 8.1 Pro. Sony has only released the updates for Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8.1 Pro. So after clean install from where will the drivers
 for Bios, Graphic Card, Ethernet driver, Bluetooth Drivers, Wireless LAN Driver, SATA driver, Memory Card Reader, Vaio Care Driver, Vaio Control Center, Rescue Data, Notebook Utilities, Vaio Update, Vaio Gate, Quick Web Access, Vaio Smart Network, ME Driver,
 etc etc....</p>
<p>(c )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How to address the ISsue of Blue Screen?</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What to do if I get the Message of Press Control Alt Del again and It refuses to boot... Keeps coming back to the same menu again and again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if tech wizards would care to guide me to address the issue. Any attempt to reply back in highly technical terms without the step by step guides is likely to confuse me further.. So a request you to keep it simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But a simple thought crossed my mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;“<strong>Why did Microsoft complicate the issue so much.... Why couldn't they keep the Product key of Windows 8 and windows 8.1 same for anyone to download the windows 8.1 pro directly and refresh the PC</strong>”</p>

            <p>Hi Sabira,<br />
Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to assist you to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned you want to refresh windows 8.1. You can refresh windows by downloading the ISO and make a bootable DVD or USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the Microsoft Help Article to create an installation media for Windows 8.1.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
After creating an installation media. Refer to the link given below on how to refresh your Windows.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
If you upgraded your PC from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and your PC has a Windows 8 recovery partition, refreshing your PC will restore Windows 8. You’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after the refresh has finished.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Warning:</strong><br />
Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to take a backup of all your data before doing a refresh and you will have to download all the software’s and drivers for your PC as everything will be removed from your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing refresh, you may upgrade to Windows 8.1 and then add Windows Media Center using the specific Product Key for it. Follow this article to add Media Center:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are getting blue screen error while booting. I would like to know that are you getting any error codes. If you perform a Refresh, make sure all Windows updates are installed and drivers updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know that, what exactly you mean by when you say (What to do if I get the Message of Press Control Alt Del again and it refuses to boot... Keeps coming back to the same menu again and again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us the screen shot of this issue so that we will be able to understand the issue properly and go ahead to resolve it.</p>

<h2>            Unexpected Kernel Mode Trap</h2>
                    <p>I have gotten UNEXPECTED KERNEL MODE TRAP errors 10 minutes in every time in normal startup. Before, my computer kept stalling when trying to sleep and then crashing. I made some changes to an intel management driver which only made it worse and now the
 constant crashing, but no more sleep problems.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mark,
<br />
<br />Your Mini-dump files indicate Storport.sys as the underlying cause of your System crashhes
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website
<br />
<br />Then download and install the chipset device driver they recommend also, while you are there, look for Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology) if available there, also download and install the version of that software they recommend . .. .

<p>I got my computer fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Storport.sys is a Microsoft driver, so the crash was unrelated to my cpu/gpu drivers. I read somewhere to try resetting power plans with "powercfg -restoredefaultschemes" in cmd.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That fixed it. Running on high performance messes with sleep and hibernate and further issues down the line. So I have the balanced power plan and then tweaked sleep settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how common this solution would be to others but it's something to try out first before messing with drivers.</p>

<p>Hi Mediclamike,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Are you referring to touch pad on the laptop?</p>
<p>I would suggest that you uninstall the pointing device driver from the device manager and check if it works.</p>
<p><strong>How to update the pointing device driver on the machine</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then double-click
<strong>System</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp; Click the <strong>Hardware</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>:&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp; Click <strong>Mouse and pointing</strong> device to expand.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Locate the entry for <strong>ALPS pointing device</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Driver</strong> tab.<br />
5. &nbsp;Click <strong>Uninstall</strong> button.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow wizard to complete uninstallation of the device.</p>
<p>Now restart the computer and check if it works.</p>
<p>You will also need to update the BIOS on the computer by contacting the computer manufacturer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong>: Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

            <p>Hey Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Have you downloaded the software or do you have the CD to install the software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my research, the error "<span>Data Source name not found and no default driver specified</span>" occurs if "<strong>ODBC driver\connector"
</strong>is not installed on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find the setup of ODBC driver in the installation CD. You may need to run the setup of&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">ODBC
</span></strong>and then try to install the software. (search through the installation CD and search for the driver)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, do get in touch with Raceform Interactive Support forum and check if there is a work around to get it installed.</p>

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for posting your reply and let us go back to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the contacts are active, there should be a <strong>green circle</strong> that has a check mark, it means that the contact is available to chat. It is also possible that the one is causing the problem, is your outdated Skype version 7.40. For this, I highly
 recommend to download the new Skype version 8.xx, through this link <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a> (Because you have provided you desktop screen shot) and update the Skype for Android 7.40 via Google Play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this will resolve your issue. Thank you!</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 build 1803 random BSODS after update on laptop. Working fine on 1709.</h2>
                    <p>So updated to build 1803, custom built PC went without a hitch so far. But my laptop was getting a fit with random BSODS after a otherwise succesfull update (did try a clean install aswell with updated drivers etc). Also fails to create kernel dumps so no
 luck there. Getting either 'CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED' or 'DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL' on 'stornvme.sys', no other info to get from the screens. Wondering if these are somehow related to my laptop having a NVME M.2 drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gone back to 1709 on my laptop and had to put my internet connection as metered (to stop auto updating to 1803, as suggested somewhere in the internet).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping this gets fixed soon so I can stop having to manually install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having same kind of problem?</p>

            Update to this. Still running on 1709, but my laptop is Acer ASpire 7 with Intel PCIe SSD. With some Intel SSDs specifically having problems with the latest cumulative update to 1803 build I'm wondering if it is related to the issues I was having after
 updating to 1803.<br />

</p><p><strong>HI; I just purchased a nu HP W10 laptop. Had previous W7 and then did&nbsp;the upg thing to W10 in my old HP laptop. I was able to work heavily W/WORD and POWERPOINT, as I do many things associated&nbsp;w /MS OFFICE SUITE as I am a college student.&nbsp; I thank
 MS for the free UPG when using my old HP from 7 to 10. Learned many new things on the upg version. NOW, it comes the time when I need to do work on my&nbsp;NEW HP W10, but found out that I CANNOT PLAY any CD or DV disc in this machine. I paid GOOD MONEY for this
 nu machine, and now seems like&nbsp;I CANNOT USE THE FEATURES IT HAS.&nbsp;&nbsp; WHAT HAPPENED! THERE MUST BE A WAY to PLAY my CD and DV disc in this machine to watch and hear important information I need for schooling. NO, I DONT PLAY NOR WATCH ANY OF THE GAMES W10 HAS,
 FOR ME, I HAVE BETTER TIME to UTILIZE MY FREE TIME (when I rarely get it). NOT INTO THE "FUN AND GAMES" department W10 SEEMS THAT WE SHOULD ALL PASS OUR FREE TIME INTO.....WHO CARES!!!</strong></p>
<p><strong>ANYWAY, IS THERE NO HELP and NO HOPE of playing CDS in my nu HP W10.</strong></p>
<p><strong>THANKS, NEED ALL THE HELP you are able to give.</strong></p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Brasil n&#38;&#35;227&#59;o tem as DLC&#38;&#35;180&#59;s que quero comprar ...</h2>
                    
<p>Em viagem recente aos Estados Unidos, comprei alguns jogos, dentre eles Marvel vc Capcom 3, fiquei animado para baixar as DLC´s ..... fiquei abismado que não estarem disponivéis na Live BR. Achei um absurdo ... entrei na Live Americana para comprar por lá
 e baixar para meu console....porém devido a restrição de endereço IP, não é possivel comprar de lá.</p>
<p>Tenho Microsoft Points, quero comprar .... e não posso ???????????????????????</p>
<p>Achei uma falta de respeito conosco no Brasil.</p>
<p><br />
Aguardo retorno.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if there is anyone there who can answer this questions in portuguese, so I'm going to translate as I'm having the same issue.</p>
<p>We have Marvel vs Capcom 3 but there isn't any content for that game avaiable on the market (for example, I wanted to buy the two new characters Shuma and Jill).</p>
<p>He tried joining the American Live to download it but due to his IP restriction he wasn't able to download it.</p>
<p>So what's the solution ? We have the game, the points, but we can't play with those new characters because it's not avaiable on the Brazilian Market and can't download from American Market due to IP restrictions ?</p>

<p>language and menu </p>
<p>2nd every region has different laws and distibution rights this is why there is region locks</p>
<p>there is no legal way to download american region locked content</p>
<p>you would also have to match the language</p>

    <title>Match Making made fair and COMPETITIVE suggestion. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogtagx2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Match Making made fair and COMPETITIVE suggestion.</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft has 4 "Classifications" of gamers: Family-Recreation-Pro-Underground. &nbsp;I play Massive Multi-Player Online (MMO) games mostly and without fail, I ALWAYS get matched up with team members and opponents who are just not as like-minded as I am when
 it comes to playing and having a good gaming experience. &nbsp;I am in the UNDERGROUND classification, and the majority of team mates I get matched up with are FAMILY ( usually children), or RECREATION (usually people who arent real serious about challenging their
 abilities or using any kind of strategy to win). &nbsp;Imagine a game with a very experienced player being teamed up with SEVERAL sub-par, not-so-serious team mates.......not a good experience. &nbsp;Even when I try hard to tell these inexperienced ayers how to be better
 or offer tips to help win the game we are playing, all they do is ignore the advice, give you a bad rating in your gamer Rep for bothering them, and you loose the game. &nbsp;Its a no-win situation.</p>
<p>My answer/suggestion for this problem.....Microsoft, Xbox,....PLEASE, filter the players so that the following classes of players are matched up to make game play more enjoyable for everyone. &nbsp;Match those in the FAMILY/RECREATION together, and those in the
 PRO/UNDERGROUND classes together. &nbsp;It only makes sense! &nbsp;There are enough players on Microsoft LIVE to fill all the matchmaking requirements. &nbsp;As players get more serious about gaming, they can change thier classification on thier profile page. If a player
 chooses a class and its too hard or too competitive for them, they can choose an easier classification to suit their level of experience or intensity.</p>
<p>for those who read this post and agree, please hit the "LIKE" button below and MAYBE, if This post gets enough attention, someone in Microsoft may notice and help this change come about. &nbsp; Thank you all for reading.</p>

<p>The "classification" on your profile has no effect on matchmaking.</p>

<p>***Please dont post negative related repliess just because "in your opinion" you think something cant be done. &nbsp;It gives people conflicting information, and you then become part of the problem and not part of the solution.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The "classification system" on our profiles CAN BE USED as a filter to match up gamers according to Microsoft. &nbsp;I have had TWO conversations with staff on this matter already. &nbsp; I am being told by Microsoft Staff over the telephone, that using ANY of
 the profile information a gamer puts on their Xbox profile CAN BE used as an "information filter", and it is being considered for implementation in 2017 when the Xbox 360 platform becomes obsolete and the Xbox ONE becomes the main operating system.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I am trying to make aware to the gaming community that it is possible, &nbsp;and if there is enough intrest generated in this topic, then maybe we can get this filter using the gamers individual profile "Play style catagory" activated in an Xbox update patch
 sooner than 2017. &nbsp;I do think that a filtering system needs to be in place to make the gaming experience more detailed to the individual players "abilities, personality, and play style".</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Since it "CAN BE DONE", why not ask Microsoft to concider it. &nbsp;In your reply you state that there is no better way to have your GAMER REP damaged and tarnished by tryin to tell someone how to play their game. &nbsp;Why not avoid the whole issue, and separate
 the diferent levels of experienced players by giving them the CHOICE as to which level of player they really are? &nbsp;Family, Recreation, Pro, or Underground.</p>
<p>Im sure by the amount of gamer points you have, you have played a game that gives the player the option of CHOOSING whether to play a game on a difficulty level like: EASY, NORMAL, HARD, or NIGHTMARE type settings.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Your statement about Microsoft not being able to filter using the gamers profile information, is unfounded and not factual.</p>

<p>Repeat: the classification on your profile DOES NOT affect match making at this time.</p>
<p>The xbox one uses the reputation system to "smart match" players.</p>
<p>Not one member of microsoft has ever stated the 360 will become obsolete in 2017, phone support certainly would never tell any one that.</p>
<p>I never stated microsoft were not able to filter games using the profile info.</p>

<p>Learn to read please. &nbsp;You can "repeat" all you want, but your not commenting on topic.</p>
<p>If you read my post, I'm asking Xbox / Microsoft to implement the ability they have to "use the gamers profile classification they have chosen to categorize gamers into a matchmaking tool.</p>
<p>Secondly, .......you just go ahead believing that after 2017 xbox 360 support will be terminated. &nbsp;I have spoken to Microsoft about contract details for my company who is a major gaming software company, and ALL CONTRACTS for xbox 360 platform are none renewable.
 &nbsp; You, just keep your head in the sand, dont do any research of major gaming software company websites, believe in rainbows and unicorns and you'll be just fine. &nbsp;I just ask you dont keep posting and stating your opinionated remarks unless you have some kind
 of fact basis to support it, AND, that your comments be on topic. &nbsp; Again, I'm ASKING to have the information on the profile to be used as a Matchmaking filter since I have been told by them (Microsoft Technical Support ) that it is possible to done.</p>
<p>Hint: &nbsp; &nbsp;Do a google search using these key words:</p>
<p>"Microsoft to end support for Xbox 360 at end of 2017"</p>
<p>See what you get and READ THE ARTICLES. &nbsp;The ones from EA SPORTS are from their website and most likely not from a gossip column which aren't usually very factual.</p>
<p>Now, back to the topic in question,..... Does anyone else have the same feelings about being matched up with people of lesser mindset or maybe the opposite, do you not like being matched up with people who are way too serious about a game and you want to
 be able to just play and fun?</p>
<p>Lets see what the gaming community really feels about MIS-matchmaking!!!</p>

<p>All my comments were on topic.</p>
<p>There is no official statement from any one at microsoft that support will end for the 360 in 2017.</p>
<p>You stated that you are being matched up with people from different classifications, which means for some reason you are checking every ones profile you play with??</p>
<p>You are then telling these people how to play to suit your classification??</p>
<p>My point was simple, your classification has no effect on matchmaking.</p>
<p>So you trying to make others play "your way" is a very good way to get bad rep.</p>
<p>If you continue to get bad rep you are risking the "avoid me" level of rep and will find it near impossible to play online.</p>

<p>Owenkiller is right,there is no official end date for xbox 360 support so anything you've read or been told is not accurate.</p>
<p>I don't care what "zone" people I play against are in but if someone on live stated telling me how to play a game i'd avoid them as well.</p>

<p>This thread is about asking Microsoft to implement a filter of some kind to make matchmaking better ..... In my opinion, it currently isn't very good.</p>
<p>As for no "OFFICIAL" announcement of the ending of support for xbox 360 in 2017, no there isn't. &nbsp;As i mentioned several times earlier, I have spoken to Microsoft personnel during the course of my employment duties, and together with articles from other
 gaming software companies, i have drawn my own conclusion. &nbsp;Not asking anyone to take that as gospel or fact, much lime your comment about YOUR OPINION of whether or not it bothers you about other peoples "gamer zone". &nbsp;Your opinion, your temperament, not
 mine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And, once again, i would lime to ask anyone commenting to please stay on the topic of matchmaking using the players gamer "zone" as the filter. &nbsp; Actually you had the correct description of this topic. &nbsp;i was calling it the players profile classification
 because I couldn't remember what it was called when I started this thread, so i appreciate you bring that to table!! &nbsp;Thanks.
</p>
<p>My intent for this thread is to find a way that will allow those of us gamers who want a more serious matchmaking game experience. &nbsp;Me and my friends are often the last ones to survive from our team in the game we play because most of our "team" we get matched
 up with goes "YOLO" in the first minutes of the game which makes it very difficult to have fun when faced with overwhelming odds to win at that point.</p>
<p>Suggestions??? &nbsp; &nbsp; Ideas????</p>

<p>I am sure you can find that as you have "inside information direct from microsoft personnel"</p>
<p>Everything i have posted is in response to your comments, everything on topic.</p>
<p>If you want people of the same abilities why not join a clan or make more friends?</p>
<p>Joining randoms online will never get you into perfectly matched games, no matter how the match making works.</p>

<p>Personally, I think having the match making redone to match players up based on their gamer zone would benefit the players. As an underground player, I play to win. Now, when I get "teamed up" with recreational players, they are playing for fun. They don't
 care if they win or lose, I do. I also understand &nbsp;bad match ups happen. But switching the match making system to include the gamer zone is a great idea. It would make the matches I play in that much better. Dogtagx2 excellent idea in my opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks for your feedback Dreken. &nbsp;Everything you referred to about getting into match ups with gamers who have different views about what it takes to win and strategies, is what I am trying to address. &nbsp;To some, there doesn't seem to be a problem, but to
 other people it is a problem that they want to address and see if there is a solution.</p>

<br />Microsoft takes seriously its commitments to protect and maintain the privacy of its customer data and empowers its customers to implement and use our services in a protected manner. Unfortunately, technical support scams have become all too common across the industry, affecting consumers worldwide. Customers, family, friends and Microsoft employees are receiving unsolicited phones calls, emails and pop-up advertisement from fraudsters claiming to be from a reputable company or a partner of Microsoft.

<p>Thanks but I am not sure &amp; there are links in the email I would like to follow.</p>
<p>I was hoping that experts would be abale to find out whether Microsoft had actually distributed this email, is there not a record of what is sent out to enable validity to be checked?</p>
<p>Is the senders email *** Email address is removed for privacy ***' a genuine Microsoft address please.</p>
<p>If you cannot answer these questiond can you guide me to how to ask Microsoft direct please?</p>

            I received a similar email.&nbsp; Although it appears genuine and seems to link you to a genuine Microsoft site, I think this is a well hidden phishing scam.&nbsp; I clicked on the link and 24 hours later somebody had attempted to access my facebook account with
 the correct password.&nbsp; Windows defender also seemed to behave erratically sometimes reporting that a trojan had been discovered but that trojan never appeared in the threat history.&nbsp; When running in safe mode windows defender was gone altogether and malwarebytes
 didn't work.&nbsp; Eventually I wiped the hard drive and clean installed windows to be on the safe side.

            We can't check as we are users like yourself. It sounds like spam but the email address is auto removed for security. You could post a screenshot of the email but blank out your personal email first.
