<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 2.11 keyboard problems</h2>
                    <p>I installed the Creator update at Christmas but this made the keyboard on my Yoga 2.11 20332 virtually unusable (I had to type at not much better than 1 character per second or some got missed out). I tried various things but in the end the only way to solve
 the problem was to backtrack. Now I am constantly being prompted to update Windows but don't want to unless I'm assured the problem has been resolved. Can you advise if the problem has been resolved (I note many others have advised similar issues) or if not
 how I can stop the update reminders?</p>

<p>Hello ExClevedonian, <br />
<br />
The issue that you've encountered after installing the Creators Update could've been due to driver incompatibility or outdated driver. Noting that you did try to perform troubleshooting prior to restoring to the previous version of Windows, please confirm if
 a manual update of the driver was one of the actions you took.<br />
<br />
This forum article created by Andre Da Costa could serve as your guideline on how to perform a manual driver update:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update Hardware Drivers in Windows 10</a><br />
<br />
A workaround to the repeated update offer would require you to set your connection to metered. This is just a temporary resolution as your system would really need to get security updates to avoid malware attacks and the like. For reference, you may check the
 support article I've attached below: <br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Volume icon in notification area greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Apparently this is not a new problem but all the solutions I could find were for previous versions of windows.&nbsp; I tried some of these suggestions ran system file checker, clean boot&nbsp;etc.&nbsp; They&nbsp;didn't work for my Windows 10 Home version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a work around which pins the volume control to the task bar but this takes up precious taskbar space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power, Location, volume are all greyed out clock, action center, network are all functioning properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would re-setting the operating system be a solution?</p>

            No the options available vary by program but they do not vary by status of the the program (i.e., a program that has the repair option will always show that option whether or not a repair is currently needed).<br />

            No. It doesn't imply any of those things. It merely means that the program has the facility to check for updates or perform a repair registered.

            As a first step of diagnosis, can you use Web Skype on your computer and let me know if the problem persists there also.

<h2>            Cant use party chat on windows 10 Xbox app. Error code&#58;&#91;0x80072EFF&#93;</h2>
                    <p>So for about 3 months now i have been struggling with not being able to talk on party chat in the Xbox app for windows 10 . Every time i'd like to join a friend or invite him it says :" We can't connect you to Xbox Live right now- the service might be down
 [0x80072EFF]"&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched around and seen a few explanations for the problem and how to solve them like going into Network&amp;Internet&gt;Proxy&gt;Internet options&gt;Advanced setting&gt;Restore advanced settings ... I've also tried resetting the Xbox app going , installing Xbox App
 Beta and signing into different accounts to invite friends but nothing works .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any clue how to fix this please help me. This has been bothering me alot and</p>
<p>I really cannot handle this anymore.</p>

<p>Things to try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install all Windows updates in Settings &gt; Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Please try to update the xbox app by going to Start &gt; Microsoft Store &gt; click the 3 dots icon at the top right &gt; My Library &gt; see if there is an arrow beside the xbox app. If you don't see the xbox app click "Show all" on the right to see them all.<br />
<br />
3. Please click Start, type "Apps &amp; features" select that, Find "Xbox" and click it, Click "Advanced Options", Click "Reset" you see there. Restart the app and try to sign in again. (but you've already done this, but it wouldn't hurt to try again).<br />
<br />
4. Please click Start &gt; type Troubleshoot and click it &gt; go to the bottom and click Troubleshoot Windows Store Apps &gt; see if it fixes any problems for the xbox app or shows an error that wasn't fixed.<br />
<br />
5. Go to the Windows Store and find Xbox (beta) and download that and see if you still have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Please press the Win+R keys to open the Run dialog. Type WSReset.exe and click on OK. The Store and a command prompt will now open without any message. The command prompt will automatically close when the store cache has been reset. Try the app after
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. The next steps would be to use some commands in windows powershell, as an admin. Start &gt; type powershell &gt; right click and Run as Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enter this command: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)Axml”}</p>
<p>
</p><p>That resets the Xbox app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Check the Settings &gt; Network part of the xbox app if you can get it running, to see if it says something about no NAT or something about Teredo problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Do a clean boot on windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the "<strong>Windows</strong> + R" key to open a Run box.</li><li>Type msconfig and click OK.</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective startup.</li><li>Clear the Load startup items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab.</li><li>Select the Hide all Microsoft services check box (at the bottom).</li><li>Click Disable all.
<p>Reboot.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Make sure to undo this after you boot up - change it back to normal startup.</p>

<p>Hi, is the Xbox button on the Xbox lighting up white, what colour is the light on the power brick ?</p>
<p>Could you also try a different HDMI cable as sometimes even though a cable works fine with one device it may not with another. Also double check the HDMI cable is in the HDMI port nearest to the power lead on the Xbox.</p>
<p>If you're using a power surge protector or power extension lead then please try connecting the Xbox power supply directly to the mains power outlet instead.</p>

<h2>            Missing Icons in the &#34;Programs and Features&#34; &#40;Formerly, Add&#47;Remove Software&#41; Control Panel.</h2>
                    This problem is something I have noticed for several years on multiple PCs, going back potentially to early version of Windows Vista. The problem is best described as missing icons for several program entries in the list of installed software in the Programs
 and Features control panel. It's unclear exactly when the icons vanish or become corrupt, but it's a recurring problem that eventually causes the icons to be lost for several applications over a large period of time. Creating a new user profile does not seem
 to remedy the issue for most entries, if any at all. I should note that I am not describing the behavior of a program that was uninstalled incorrectly and thus has an uninstall entry still listed while the installer is no longer present. This issue is unrelated,
 and while it does exhibit similar behavior, in my particular case, invoking installer functions still work as described. In other words, I'm able to remove or change the setup of the software suite even while the icon is

<p>The Product Key is located o the bottom of your laptop or if it is a desktop, it is on the sides or back of the machine.&nbsp; It is a 25-digit alpha-numeric code with 5 sets of 5 digits separated by a dash.&nbsp; If you can't find it, download Belarc Advisor at
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a>&nbsp;and istall it and run&nbsp; it.&nbsp; It will give you this code as it exists in the system.</p>
<p>Try disabling or if that doesn't work uninstallig McAfee (if uninstalling, use the McAfee Removal tool at
<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/McAfee-Consumer-Product-Removal-Tool.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/McAfee-Consumer-Product-Removal-Tool.shtml</a>).&nbsp; See if that resolves the problem.</p>
<p>Try booting into safe mode with networking (by repeatedly clicking the F8 key during bootup until the menu appears) and see if you still have the problems in safe mode.&nbsp; Please post the results in your reply to this mesage.</p>
<p>Try a clean boot <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;and see if the problem still occurs.&nbsp; If not, then follow the instructions in the article to find the cause of the problem and then delere, remove,
 uninstall, deactivate or otherwise get rid of it.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to set your system back into normal mode as described in the article and then reboot.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the problem presists after the clean boot, just restore it to normal status according to the instructions
 and reboot - this process will not help resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If the above don't work, then let's do some general troubleshooting:</p>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (it works a bit different than the above instructions but if you follow the prompts on the disks and know the above information you should be able
 to restore with no problems).<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will probably want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot so it will run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning shutdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be infected with malware.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using - using the removal tool posted above if it is McAfee (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp;
 Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download, install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program
 (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To
 test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or from the hard drive manufacturer’s web site if available).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least help identify your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back (including results of all the scans and procedures you tried) and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h3> lin337  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should Win 10 version be 10420 or 10586.xx&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am totally confused.&nbsp; Should my win 10 version be 105786.xx or stay at 10240?&nbsp;&nbsp;I &nbsp;see a post where the upgrade caused corruption and had to be rolled back.&nbsp; My computer works fine after booting up for about 15-20 minutes, then&nbsp;I have to LOG OUT (which
 loses all my windows projects).&nbsp; However, I have no problems for another 10-15 minutes, then have to LOG OUT again.&nbsp;Tthis goes on every time I use my computer.&nbsp; It is maddening to have to logout and&nbsp;back in several times a session.&nbsp; I even had 4 different
 MS Techs take control of my computer to no avail.&nbsp; In fact, one of them formatted my HD and reloaded Win 10.&nbsp; Lost ALL my programs (MS Office 2010, MS Streets, Quicken, RoboForm, Mailwasher, Eudora, and others).&nbsp; The worst part is that I lost data also.&nbsp; Actually,
 even worse than that is that it did not fix the problem.&nbsp; AND, my MS Office Home &amp; Student 2010 would not install even though I had the original disk purchased directly from MS.&nbsp; Another 3 MS Techs had control and could not make it work.&nbsp; So we tried to download
 directly from MS with the same results and&nbsp; same 1935 error code.&nbsp; The second tech told me due to the problem, I could receive a year of Office 365 for free or MS&nbsp; Home &amp; Student 2013 free &nbsp;for my laptop.&nbsp; Before I made the decision, we got disconnected somehow
 and could not get back to the same tech.&nbsp; I had the svc # which I gave to the 3rd tech and told him the problem. &nbsp;Spent over 3 hours with him and still could not install the 2010 version even directly from MS.&nbsp; He said he could not honor the free 2013 or the
 1 year free 365 office.&nbsp; AS A RESULT, I had to pay $99 for one year of Office 365 when I already had a MS Office product that worked before upgrade to Win 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Needless to say, I am not a happy camper.&nbsp; Also when I try CMD and hit command prompt, it comes up user and the scannow does not work.</p>

<h2>            Finding hardware drivers using Windows 7 64 bit OS.</h2>
                    I am having trouble finding hardware drivers using Windows 7 64 bit. I have been told that my Meade DSI CCD camera drivers will run on XP, Vista and possibly Windows 7 Professional. I have Windows Vista on my desktop and the instructions from Meade for
 finding the drivers is when Windows fives up the search and I'm asked if I want to browse, I am to navigate to the driver directory: "Ci\program files\meade\autostar suite\envisage\driver\2k-xp". Trouble is, this directory does not exist. I have upgraded my
 Meade software and still have a problem finding drivers. With Windows 7 Professional, I was told that this OS can run XP format without a problem. Is this true? Meade states that there is a problem with Windows 7 64 bit and that they have no fix for the problem
 and have no plan in the near furture of finding one. Someone else sugestted that the 32 bit OS of Windows 7 might work. I bought this new laptop for the purpose of using it with my DSI CCD&nbsp;Camera. I really don't want to hav

            Hi Tom, Yes, Professional and Ultimate, it should be fine on your son's notebook, but do just check his CPU supports virtualization. If you look at the right hand side of the screen at http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx and scroll
 down a little bit, you will see all AMD CPUs except the Sempron range support it and there is a small download for Intel CPUs to check as they are all so different. Hope this helps and you can get everything running again.

            32 bit drivers will not work, if you can find (or Meade can supply) Vista 64 bit drivers, they will work fine.<br />
<br />
You might also want to try Virtual XP, this runs inside Windows 7 and is free!&nbsp; This way you have the best of both worlds, and you don't have to go back to an older operating system just for the one application.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#40;Windows 8.1&#41; I can&#39;t change my Lock Screen background&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, literally can't change my Lock Screen Picture/Background, for some reason.</p>
<p>The basics are that when I go to devices and then click on lock screen wallpaper,
<strong>it displays nothing and no other pictures</strong>, so I go to browse, which works luckily, and then select the image I want to set, after I've selected it I just
<strong>never stops loading</strong> (the dots never stop spinning), and in fact <strong>
never displays the picture I selected</strong>. Below is a screenshot illustrating my point. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I've already tried everything from, <strong>sfc / scannow</strong>, and <strong>
DISM</strong> repair, and all of that <strong>cmd</strong> stuff, but <strong>none</strong> of it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great, thanks.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for writing your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We understand your situation and appreciate your efforts. I will assist you in troubleshooting the issue. There seems to be some corruption with the user account. I suggest you to
<strong>create a new user account</strong> to eliminate any user account issue (if there is any) and see if that helps. Follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Create a new administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Create a user account</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer to following link:</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps to change the account type of the new account to administrator by navigating to user accounts under control panel:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Press <strong>Window key + X</strong> and select Control Panel.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>A</strong>: <strong>Transfer</strong> the profile data to the new account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please follow the steps below to do that:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press <strong>Window key + X </strong>together and select Windows Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Click on <strong>View tab </strong>and Click on <strong>Options</strong> at the top right corner.</span></span></p>

<h3> taylor.xr  say:</h3>
<h2>            unsupported 16 bit application__windows explorer.exe not supported&#47;running</h2>
                    
<p>When ever i start up my computer and log into my, or any account there are no icons, background or start bar. I have to navigate to get to anything using using task manager. I believe it has something to do with windows explorers registery. This is what
 comes up when i first log in....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsupported 16-bit Application</p>
<p>The program or feature "\??\C:\windows\explorer.exe" cannot start or run due to the incompatibility with 64-bit version of windows. Please contact the software vendor to ask if a 64-bit windows compatible version is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is that i have windows 7 ultimate 64 bit. This all happened when my graphics card died, and i had to stick a really old pci card in (fx 5200) until i got the replacement. A few days ago it stopped showing anything related to explorer. So when i
 got my new cards (gts 250, and 4890) they both did the same thing. I updated my graphics&nbsp; drivers for both ati, and then nvidia but it did not fix anything. I have even tried system restore, and the program it runs to try and fix things before it loads windows.
 I have scanned for viruses and found nothing. sorry if this seems long winded but a lot has happened please help!</p>

            Hi Trishy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that fails then re-register the Microsoft Store app following Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>.  If there are other apps you can re-register them from Option Two or do all of them at once from Option One.
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    Hey, I am at my wits end with these&nbsp;irregular and random BSOD's.&nbsp;
<div>I have downloaded whocrashed, bluescreenview and scanned eventlogs and caused a BSOD using driververifier. All pointing to ntkrnlpa.exe.
<br />
<br />
I have also ran memtest for 15+ hours with no faults and swapped out the graphics card. I have a gut feeling it could be something to do with my usb ports or wireless usb stick.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to the last 5 minidump crash reports.<br />

I am trying to avoid a reformat as I'm getting that frustrated I'm tempted just to get a new computer.

            Looks like 3 files are crashing, USBPORT.SYS and ntkrnlpa.exe x3 and&nbsp; halmacpi.dll<br />
<br />
Wdf01000.sys, amdppm.sys and usbhub.sys maybe crashing as well<br />
<br />
There's a few strange files on your system anonk90h.SYS, aefw1s5v.SYS, auky9axw.SYS, avwgukms.SYS, and avgoo6v0.SYS<br />
<br />
Uninstall Isodisk for now. It may not be fully compatible with Win7<br />

I have removed ISodisk (can't remember installing it)<br />

Those strange files I am unable to locate and google has no results for them. Any idea on location and would they be safe to remove?

<div>I will do another driververifier and upload the dump tomorrow.&nbsp;<br />

I am currently thinking a fresh windows install maybe the only option..</div>

            You may have to show OS fiiles. Theyre probably hidden.<br />
<br />
Theyre probably remnants of malware or something. I would disable system restore, then scan your system, with something<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since HTC told you to check for the drivers with Microsoft you may refer the following methods and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>: Run the following fix it:<b>

            <p>I am using the USB cable supplied with the phone. All my other devices work well. I've tried running the fix-it software but this has made no difference.&nbsp; I have uninstalled HTC sync manager and reinstalled it.&nbsp; The drivers were then installed okay (so it
 said). I changed the compatibility tab to Windows XP Service Pack 2 (no option for service pack 3 available). I've run it again and still not able to sync.&nbsp; The phone is connecting in some way but very quickly disconnects.&nbsp; The HTC sync manager searches for
 the devise but cannot find it - I am still getting Error 3005 on it. Don't know if this helps but I have Vista Home Premium V6.0 Service pack 2, 32 bit.</p>
<p>I have also downloaded the Windows 7 compatibility software - it said there is no compatibility information for HTC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be a setting or a problem with HTC sync Manager.</p>
<p><br />
Contact HTC again and have them know you contacted Microsoft and we asked you to Contact HTC again for further help.</p>

            <p><u>This is the reply from HTC:</u> </p>
<p>"In order to look into this issue further, as you have the software working on one PC, and not the other, could you please provide me with a system information file from each PC, so that we are able to compare the two PC set ups to determine whether there
 are any software conflicts that may be causing the fault.<br />
<br />
To create a System Information file:<br />
<br />
On the computer, click Start and click All Programs.<br />
Click Accessories and click System Tools.<br />
Click System Information.<br />
Click File.<br />
Click Save.<br />
Select the location to save the file, in the File name field enter system.<br />
Click Save.<br />
The NFO file will now be created".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created the 2 files and sent them to HTC.</p>
<p><u>Here is their next reply</u>:</p>
<p>"I must advise you that running HTC Sync manager on Vista SP2 will not work at all. You would need to consider rolling back to SP1.
<br />
<br />
If none of the above steps work we need to disable non-Microsoft applications from running at start-up on your computer so we can guarantee there will be no conflicts to do this please follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
Disabling startup services:<br />
<br />
1) Click Start, and then click Run. Note: In Windows Vista, click Start, click Accessories, and then click Run.<br />
2) A Run dialog box will appear. In the Open field, type msconfig, and then click OK.<br />
3) The System Configuration Utility window will launch. Click on the Services tab.<br />
4) Ensure that Hide All Microsoft Services is checked.<br />
5) Click Disable All.<br />
Note: To disable specific services instead, uncheck the box next to the desired service.<br />
6) Click the Startup tab.<br />
7) Click Disable All and then click OK. Note: To disable specific services instead, uncheck the box next to the desired service.<br />
8) A dialog box will appear prompting a restart of the computer. Click Restart.<br />
9) After rebooting, a System Configuration Utility dialog box will appear.<br />
10) Check the box next to Don't show this message or launch the System Configuration Utility when Windows starts and click OK.<br />
<br />
Once you have installed and tested HTC Sync and it works, we need to re-enable the start-up services:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, and then click Run. Note: In Windows Vista, click Start, click Accessories, and then click Run.<br />
2. A Run dialog box will appear. In the Open field, type msconfig, and then click OK.<br />
3. The System Configuration Utility window will launch. Click on the Services tab.<br />
4. Click on the Enable All button. Note: To enable specific services instead, click to check the box next to the desired service.<br />
5. Click the Startup tab.<br />
6. Click on the Enable All button. Note: To enable specific services instead, click to check the box next to the desired service.<br />
7. Click the OK button.<br />
8. Restart the computer."<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried all of this and still no success.&nbsp; I think I will put my music etc on partners pc and use that one as HTC sync manager is never going to work with Vista.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10, Random Power Off, No BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I've been encountering this random shut off last few days. Been running Windows 10 months without such issue. GPU runs around 36C and max temp is at 70C when gaming, CPU around 35 and max &lt;60C while gaming, mobo constant ~35C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating realtek audio but same issue. Removed my asus xonar dx still the same issue. Looked at the capacitors on my mobo, no bloated cap detected. Downloading driver from mobo website now, hoping downgrading some software version will helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event viewer attached. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
MyEventViewer can be checked at the time of the BlueScreen to with-in <br />
a second or so&nbsp;of the time of the Event to provide more information as </p>
<p>to possible cause - see TIP.<br />
<br />
<strong>MyEventViewer</strong> - Free -&nbsp;a simple alternative to the standard event viewer of<br />
Windows. <strong>TIP</strong> - Options - Advanced Filter allows you to see a time frame instead
<br />
of the whole file - set it to a bit before and&nbsp;after the time of the Event.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html</span></span></a><br />
<br />
2nd TIP : After a power/shut off wait a few minutes then it is easy to see the<br />
applicable events using TIP above.<br />
<br />
Not sure of the cause however Bonjour could be in play.<br />
<br />
Are you over-clocking anything? if so STOP!<br />
<br />
Heat alone can cause shutdowns even if the temps are not excessive. Added a single<br />
component could be too sensitive to even normal levels.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<br />
And if you had purchased the Arabic version instead of the English version, you could have Home Premium.&nbsp; But since you have the English version, you need to upgrade to Professional or Ultimate in order to use the language packs.&nbsp;

<h3> lojong  say:</h3>
<h2>            CD&#47;DVD Drive not burning</h2>
                    My CD/DVD drive will not burn.&nbsp; Ok up to 'Files waiting to be be burned' but once the burn starts (or seems to) the drive just runs on (audibly) and I have to 'Restart' in order to eject the cd.&nbsp; The results from the Fixit CD/DVD trouble shooter show -
 'Disc in Drive D is not detected or is not supported'&nbsp; but it also shows the green, ticked button as 'fixed' but it isnt fixed.&nbsp; I have used several new CD-R discs and tried removing the temporary files (waiting to be burned) and run the burn operation all
 over again with the same result. The trouble shooter detected no other problems.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked the 'Shell Hardware Detection' and it is on auto running.&nbsp; I have run out of ideas and steam, and would be sooooo happy to have some assistance with this one.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and<br />
CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others&nbsp;do so<br />
properly.</p>
<p>Burn Speed used, the actual brand of disks used, and whether Live File or Mastered all come into<br />
play. A cleaning disk can sometimes help.<br />

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />

You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />
<br />
Forums - a lot of real expert help<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />
