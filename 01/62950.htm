            It's already joined and that's why I am receiving the notification in red. Do I need to enable a specific feature on O365 panel or azure to activate this sync feature?&nbsp;

    <title>No volume after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynejohnson124  say:</h3>
<h2>            No volume after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    Looks like this is a common problem, Microsoft. You need to get in gear and offer a solution. After the Mircrosoft Techs looked at my computer 3 separate times, they finally gave up and blamed it on Hewlitt Packard (the maker of the computer). They want
 me to contact HP support and see if they can fix it. The sound worked fine until the device automatically updated to Windows 10. Another complaint I have is the way that the techs always assured me that the problem was fixed, before knowing if it was. All
 they did was re-update the Windows 10 and told me everything was fixed, which they have no way of knowing until the update is complete and the computer has re-started.

    <title>Strange Runtime Error with SWbemLocator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dirtyspitshine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Runtime Error with SWbemLocator</h2>
                    I receive the following error when I attempt to install Lucid Virtue MVP that I have downloaded.<br />
<br />
"Runtime Error (at 43:295): <br />
SWbemLocator: Generic failure" <br />
<br />
I have tried downloading and installing from the disc that accompanied my motherboard, the motherboard manufacturer's website, and repeated the download in case it had been corrupted. All attempts end with the same error.
<br />
<br />
The file works on other computers, so I am convinced that something is wrong with Windows.<br />
<br />
My system specifications are as follows: <br />
<br />
VGA: Sapphire ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series (ATI) 2GB Eyefinity / Intel HD Graphics 4000
<br />
Motherboard: Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd. Z77X-UD5H <br />
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770K <br />
Memory: 8GB DDR3 1600<br />
OS: Windows 7 Ultimate x64<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance!

            Thanks for your reply, but no dice. I still get the same error after using FixCleaner and trying the other procedures it recommends. I should add that I scan for viruses/malware regularly, so that should not be the cause.<br />

    <title>Taskbar won&#39;t switch windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larrychristianson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar won&#39;t switch windows</h2>
                    All I ever did before was left click on a taskbar item in order to switch to it. Was working fine in W10 for months&nbsp;until recently. Now I get a mini window popup and that's it. Tried modifying all the taskbar properties with nothing working. This has me
 thinking of how stable W7 was and just going back to it. If I continue clicking on it the window will eventually open. It appears what's happening is the window I click on is not coming to the front.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><div>1. Do you get any error message when&nbsp;you try to click on the icon in Taskbar?</div>
<div>2. Can you open programs without any issues?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to disable window by hovering over it with the mouse and check if it helps. To do so I suggest you to try the below given steps and check if it helps:<br />
1.Press Windows key + X key and click on Control Panel.<br />
2.Select or click Ease of Access.<br />
3.Click or tap on Ease of Access Centre.<br />
4.Click on Make the Mouse Easier to Use was uncheck Activate Window by hovering over it with the mouse.<br />
5.Check if issue is resolved.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>If the issue persists then suggest&nbsp;you to use :&nbsp;Alt+Tab to shift to recent window.</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm having this same problem with 2 computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to switch from one program to another on the taskbar it doesn't work. It only opens the window behind the other one. So I have to close the open window to access a different window.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggested fix shown on this page did not work. Please help with a working solution.</p>

            <p>I have a very similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have multiple screens up in a program and open another program, I can't get back to the first program by clicking on the taskbar.&nbsp; I can SOMETIMES get back to the first program by closing the second program, but only if&nbsp; I haven't minimized the first
 program before going to the second program.&nbsp; Even if I do get back to the first program, I can only get to the screen I was on; I can't move between screens without closing one.</p>
<p>I can get back to the first program if there's only one screen up for that program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to give an example, here's the scenario:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I open Outlook.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I open Word or any other program by clicking on the taskbar.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; While I'm in Word, Outlook tries to remind me of an appointment.&nbsp; That reminder pops up in the background somewhere, not where I see it.&nbsp; But the icon for Outlook flashes, so I know something is going on.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I click on the Outlook icon.&nbsp; Outlook does NOT come up.&nbsp; If I hover my cursor over the Outlook icon, two little thumbnails show up briefly, but it is NOT possible to click on either of them.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I close Word; then SOMETIMES the reminder is showing on the screen, on top of Outlook as it should be.&nbsp; I haven't figured out why it doesn't always come up.&nbsp; I also haven't figured out why I have to close the second program to have any prayer of having
 the first one come up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the scenario that's worse:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I open Outlook.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I open Word or any other program.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I go back to Outlook, then minimize it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I go back to Word.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; While I'm in Word, Outlook tries to remind me of an appointment.&nbsp; As in the first example, the icon for Outlook flashes.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I click on the Outlook icon; same results as in #4 in the previous example.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; I close Word.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; I click on the Outlook icon; two little thumbnails flash for a nanosecond.&nbsp; Hovering the cursor over the Outlook icon briefly gives me two little thumbnails, but I can't click on either of them or open them by touching the screen.</p>
<p>The only ways out of this problem that I have found are to (a)&nbsp; right click on the Outlook icon and close Outlook completely using the black dialogue box that comes up or (b) use Task Manager to force Outlook to close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, it's not just Outlook; it's just that Outlook is a program that often pops up a second screen behind whatever I'm working on, so that it winds up having two screens open even when I didn't intend to do it.&nbsp; The same thing happens if I DO intend to have
 two screens open -- e.g., if I'm editing a contact in Outlook, then go to another program (for example, to grab an address out of a Word document or e-mail).&nbsp; So, if I close Word completely, I can get back to that contact, but can't go behind that contact
 and find another contact or move to the calendar; I have to first close the contact I'm working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, it's a lot like working before Windows was really Windows -- maybe Windows 3.1, but it's been so long since I used that program that I don't remember if it was this clunky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started in Windows 8, after a major Windows update last fall.&nbsp; I updated to Windows 10 in the hope that it would fix the problem, but it didn't.&nbsp; (It didn't fix the other problems that started with that Windows 8 update, either, but I'm limiting
 my message to this problem to avoid confusing this thread by adding the half dozen glitches that showed up after that update.)</p>

Windows could not connect to the systems event notification service service. This problem prevents limited ysers from logging on to the system. As an administrative user, you can review the system event log for details about why the service didn't respond.<br />
<br />
Well I tried to review the systems event log but it won't let me connect. Please help, I have no idea what I am doing. Thanks.

            Hello Asha22,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I would suggest to log into your computer as the administrator and perform a System Restore to a point in time prior to this problem occuring.&nbsp; Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore
 points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs
 and updates that you installed are removed.<br />

<p><strong><span>Important Notice</span></strong><strong><span>:
</span></strong><em><span>That System Restore affects Windows system files, programs, and registry settings. It can also make changes to scripts, batch files, and other types of executable files
 on your computer. Thus, any recently installed programs, updates, or changes to configuration will be lost if you use System Restore. However, make note that System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot
 help you restore a deleted file.</span></em></p>

<p><strong>No, it does not since the recovery tools and the tools for making a backup recovery disc should be separate from your system drive.
</strong></p>
<p>2) Is there any special disk recommended to use for making a recovery disk?</p>
<p><strong>Usually it is few blank DVD's. Which model and brand computer is this? HP and Compaq computers usually include what is called a recovery manager which you use to create the backup discs.
</strong></p>
<p>3) I glean that I need to use another drive than the Compaq PC, how should I go about it?</p>
<p><strong>Don't understand what you mean. If you have an external hard disk, you can use the following options for reinstalling Windows 8 when necessary and also creating a backup your installation.</strong></p>
<span>
<p>How to reinstall Windows 8</p>
</span></blockquote>
<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>Â· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>Â· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>Â· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>Â· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>Â· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If you create a installation DVD or Bootable thumbdrive, you can use that to reinstall Windows. First, you will need to reinstall the qualifying license, then start the upgrade again to Windows 8. Qualifying license means you will either need to reinstall
 Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>A workaround for this situation is to create a system image of Windows 8 just after you have upgraded. So if your drive does crash, you can simply restore the image on a new hard disk or restore the image on the same drive if you just want to reinstall Windos
 8.</p>
<p>See the following for instructions about how to create a system image of your Windows 8 installation:</p>

<p>(references Windows 7, but the same principles apply to Windows 8).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Any Recovery Disks you make with a program included with your computer solely for that purpose will not be effected by any modifications you have made.</p>
<p>The Disk(s) are burned from a Partition on your hard drive that is not altered by anything you do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Recovery Disks created will restore your machine to AS NEW. The only possible exception is that manufacturers usually only allow 1 set of recovery disks, and as a result...the fact you made a set may or may not be reflected in the ones you burn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>YOU&nbsp;WILL LOSE EVERYTHING that was not preinstalled when you use these disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any good DVD will work...myself personally...I have a preference in Verbatim when doing something critical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program that burns the disks will most likely verify that you got an acceptable burn.</p>

<p>1) I already transferred files to my newly purchased Compaq PC which has pre-installed windows 8.&nbsp; I've also changed some of my settings.&nbsp; Do these things interfere with&nbsp;making a&nbsp;proper&nbsp;recovery disk? Until when it is not too late to make it?&nbsp; (before its
 collapse that is.)</p>
<p><strong>No, it does not since the recovery tools and the tools for making a backup recovery disc should be separate from your system drive.
</strong></p>
<p>2) Is there any special disk recommended to use for making a recovery disk?</p>
<p><strong>Usually it is few blank DVD's. Which model and brand computer is this? HP and Compaq computers usually include what is called a recovery manager which you use to create the backup discs.
</strong></p>
<p>3) I glean that I need to use another drive than the Compaq PC, how should I go about it?</p>
<p><strong>Don't understand what you mean. If you have an external hard disk, you can use the following options for reinstalling Windows 8 when necessary and also creating a backup your installation.</strong></p>
<span>
<p>How to reinstall Windows 8</p>
</span></blockquote>
<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>Â· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>Â· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>Â· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>Â· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>Â· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If you create a installation DVD or Bootable thumbdrive, you can use that to reinstall Windows. First, you will need to reinstall the qualifying license, then start the upgrade again to Windows 8. Qualifying license means you will either need to reinstall
 Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>A workaround for this situation is to create a system image of Windows 8 just after you have upgraded. So if your drive does crash, you can simply restore the image on a new hard disk or restore the image on the same drive if you just want to reinstall Windos
 8.</p>
<p>See the following for instructions about how to create a system image of your Windows 8 installation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><span>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</span></u></a></p>
<p>(references Windows 7, but the same principles apply to Windows 8).</p>
<p>Sorry, &nbsp;but I'm a total beginner.</p>

hi,</p>
<p>I want to create an installation bootable DVD from my preinstalled windows 8, so that when ever

    <title>Why is the Xbox so poorly designed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orbmunk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is the Xbox so poorly designed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have never had such a headache with networking a device in my life! I've been told(by an Xbox Employee) &nbsp;that the xbox uses a very large datagram, and that is why it struggles when my other devices don't. I did some research and found that the PS3 also
 uses the <em>exact same size</em> of packet as the xbox does, yet I've never had any issues with getting and keeping my PS3 online. Any time I've ever called the support line for help I get a snarky agent who tries to pretend that they know about how networking
 works, they are so biased towards the Xbox that they blame it on everything but, "It's your router" they say, and " It has to be the Ethernet Cable" I'm told. Iguess they are trained to blame it on anything<em> but</em> the xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe someone here can help:&nbsp;</p>
<p>My console disconnects from Xbox Live every couple of minutes, this can happen while in a game, as well as if I am idling on the Dashboard. All I can do to reconnect is to restart the console, it will then connect but disconnect a few minutes later.</p>

<p>My setup:&nbsp;</p>
<p>My console is connected wired to a Dlink DGL4500 ( A rep at Xbox told me that this router would solve all my Xbox woes, it didn't)</p>
<p>I have my Dlink going directly to an ONT box in my closet.</p>
<p>My download speed from my ISP is 60Mbps (I've tested several times over, I am getting 60Mbps)</p>
<p>I have a great ping at 48ms</p>
<p>I have replaced the cabling between the xbox and the router.</p>
<p>I have also jumped through all the hoops with the support guys: Clearing System Cache on Xbox, redownloading Gamertag to Xbox, Portforwarding and DMZ hosting, Disabled all firewalls on router.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel that my xbox is broken because my PS3 has absolutely no issues staying connected to PSN. I will not call the support line again, because I just get someone looking to blame some other one of my devices. My only fear here is that the Xbox is just poorly
 designed, and a new console will do the same thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just got off the phone with the networking guys<em> AGAIN; </em>seems that the first agent I spoke with lied to me about "Writing a novel on my case"because nothing could be found in my file- So now Im left explaining this again to someone! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This agent seemed to be more willing to try and figure out what was going on, and by the end of it he was baffled and his answer was that my brand new router was to blame (even though nothing else is disconnecting!). I find it hard to believe that 2 different
 routers have caused the same problem with the Xbox when other gaming consoles run just fine. &nbsp;After hours of trying to fix this problem I am left thinking that Microsoft has made a terrible piece of hardware and has trained their tech support to blame other
 companies for the Xboxs&nbsp;insufficiencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>It is possible there is a hardware fault with the Xbox. Please turn off any portforwarding/DMZ setup and just leave UPnP enabled on the router, the DGL4500 is a great router and just needs to be left with very basic settings (UPnP only)</p>
<p>What happens if you connect the Xbox direct to the ONT?</p>
<p>Is it possible to take your Xbox to a friends house that uses a different ISP? If you do that and get the same issue it sounds to me like the Xbox could be faulty</p>

<p><span>Well, the Xbox uses port 3074 (TCP + UDP both) whereas the PS3 uses others (TCP: 80, 443, 3478, 3479, 3480, 5223, 8080 and UDP: 3478, 3479 as per
<a href="http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/connecttest.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://manuals.playstation.net/document/en/ps3/current/settings/connecttest.html</a> ).</span></p>
<p><span>These high-order ports tend to be blocked by default in routers and since you have the (fantastic! I wish I had that speed!) ONT connection, our troubleshooting is kinda handicapped since the technique taught to
 me by the phone company (United Tel. of Fla. waybackwhen, now it's CenturyLink) won't work since there is no modem for us to attach to for a router bypass.</span></p>
<p><span>To recap: You very kindly </span></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li><span>replaced the cabling between the xbox and the router</span>
</li><li><span>cleared (the) Xbox System Cache</span>
</li><li><span>redownloaded (the) Gamertag, </span>
</li><li><span>disabled all firewalls on (the) router, and
</span></li><li><span>tried Portforwarding and </span></li></ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span>DMZ hosting.</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>Question 1) But, when you did the latter, did you disable UPnP? UPnP conflicts with DMZ which itself conflicts with Port Forwarding. and Port Forwarding conflicts with UPnP. Choose one from Column A, only, please,
 because to open port 3074 for the Xbox, we can't have a conflict.</span></p>
<p><span>Question 2) The suggestion from Shad0wmanUK to connect the Xbox direct to the ONT is also an excellent diagnostic. Have you tried that?</span></p>

<p>The point of the DGL4500 is to not have to use portforwarding or DMZ hosting. Upnp works for
<em>everthing </em>else in the house. But yes; Upnp was disabled when portforwarding was done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, I traded the xbox in for a PS3, restored my router to factory defaults; and now I'm actually gaming online without interruptions! I should have listened to my roommates in the first place, now they will forever tell me about how I tried everything
 in the world to connect my<em> beloved xbox</em> to the internet; but in the end the only way was to betray the confounded machine and crawl to another, but functional machine: the PS3.</p>
<p>Sorry Microsoft, you guys failed on this one. I've been poking around on these forums and found nothing but pages and pages of the same issue. What is worse is that you charge for the Xbox Live service and provide a piece of hardware that is specifically
 designed to connect to the service, and still you are unable to deliver the service. This tells us that there is a flaw in the way the console connects to xbox live.&nbsp;

Start with <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycling</a> your console to see if that helps at all. If that doesn't work, try <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/compatibility-with-xbox-360-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clearing your local Xbox 360 storage</a> from your Xbox One console. If that still doesn't help, you'll want to reset your home network by unplugging everything for 5 minutes and then reconnecting it. </p><p><br /></p><p>Hopefully something there does the trick.

<p>mircosoft uk I spent 4 hours on the phone with them 5 times they hung up on me until I finally got to speak to someone. I was told by mirscosoft uk that because my computer is windows 7 it is outdated and they said they are not responsible for updates for
 that computer. I was spoken to rudely until they finally hung up on me before this happened there was nothing wrong with my computer. I&nbsp; also have had my computer set back to how it was when I bought it by a leading tech company called guru aid they have done
 this 4 time in last few weeks. I have never had such a problem like this before are there lots of others like me with this problem.</p>

            Hi Navish
<br />
<br />You will need to perform a custom or clean install in order to go back to Windows 10 Home.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />		Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro

            Hi Navish
<br />
<br />You cannot Reset your PC to Windows 10 Home, if it is running the Pro version
<br />
<br />You will need to Clean install Windows 10 from bootable USB Installation Media and even then you need to trick that into giving you the choice of installing the Home version . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose New - Text Document 
<br />
<br />Paste the text below into that document 
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Save Aa, at the bottom of the Save As dialog, change file type to 'All Files' then save that file as ei.cfg (note you must manually add the cfg file extension) 
<br />
<br />Then copy that ei.cfg file into the Sources folder in your Installation Media 
<br />
<br />Then when you begin the Installation, you should be asked which Edition you want to install . . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />[EditionID] 
<br />Core 
<br />[Channel] 
<br />Retail
<br />
<br />
<br />3
<br />Finally, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            The only thing we know for sure is that Xbox exclusives will be available on Game Pass the same day they are launched. How long they will remain available is undetermined and Microsoft has said nothing beyond that. So anything beyond that is speculation.
 However it is safe to say they will be available for the foreseeable future. But I would expect them not to be there forever. So it is up to you whether you want to sell them. For me it would depend on the game. Although I haven't purchased a game on disc
 for 3-4 years.

            The powrprof.dll is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after.<br />
<br />
If you rename it,&nbsp; Windows File Protection will quickly and silently replace the now "missing" file with the backup copy from the dllcache folder and log an event like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\powrprof.dll. T<b>his file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability</b>. The file version of the system file is 6.0.2900.5512.<br />
<br />
You won't have time to get your CD out of the case before the file is replaced.<br />
<br />
So really, if you want to get a fresh copy, simply rename the one in system32 (so it is now "missing") and WFP will copy in a fresh one for you automatically!&nbsp; Try it and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
Why don't <i>you </i>click Start, click Run, type <span>sfc.exe</span> in the Open box, and then click OK and tell us what happens.<br />
<br />
SFC will not replace a missing or corrupted powrprof.dll file in the system32 folder.&nbsp; That is not how SFC works, that is not what it does, and that is not what it is for.<br />
<br />
Good try though.<br />

            Thank you I will try that....
<div><br />
<div>Below is an answer I prepared for your other questions to my posts on another part of this site...I couldn,t send it when I finished....this is very difficult for me.......</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>will try to answer all the questions. The multiple posts occurred because&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 . I am unfamiliar with doing this</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;My connection is&nbsp;fitful&nbsp;and keeps dropping out</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I found the website difficult to navigate</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please bear with me.</p>
<p>powrprof.dll is what I meant - typo - sorry</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>THot2nd Window is what the box that appears with the powrprof.dll is called; I dont know what it means.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Tecra running XP professional Service Pack 3.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was using Firefox and now have Chrome just installed. Problem occurs with both.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I dont think I have Windows Desk Top Search installed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Ithink the drives are SATA</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I routinely use GFI Vipre - deep scan clear</p>
<p>Yesterday I installed MS Security Essentials - clear</p>
<p>I down loaded MS safety Scanner - clear</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Preceding issues - for some time [many months] the screen locks and cursor locks; I have been guilty of holding down the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- recently [3wks ago] I got a trojan which Vipre quarantined and removed; since then I have had a couple
 of issues, one resolved with help of the software provider; then this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is an internal CD?DVD drive</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not have a bootable XP disc. I do have a bootable system copy made with an external program</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What happens - After 1-2 hrs running the system makes the 'somethings wrong' sound and the THot2nd Window with the powrprof.dll.......message appears. This happens repeatedly . There is a box that says the
 system has crashed and the program will be terminated. As I try to close these boxes more appear until there is a&nbsp;Unresponsive&nbsp;Program&nbsp;box appears and I click end now. Then when I click Start to shut down I am prompted to log off [which I dont usually see].
 Either clicking logoff or cancel or x-ing out has no effect. Eventually the system restarts.</p>

<p>will try to answer all the questions. The multiple posts occurred because&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 . I am unfamiliar with doing this</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;My connection is&nbsp;fitful&nbsp;and keeps dropping out</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;I found the website difficult to navigate</p>

</p>
<p>Please bear with me.</p>
<p>powrprof.dll is what I meant - typo - sorry</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>THot2nd Window is what the box that appears with the powrprof.dll is called; I dont know what it means.</p>

<p>I have a Toshiba Tecra running XP professional Service Pack 3.</p>
<p><br />

<p>I was using Firefox and now have Chrome just installed. Problem occurs with both.</p>

<p>I dont think I have Windows Desk Top Search installed.</p>

<p>Ithink the drives are SATA</p>

<p>I routinely use GFI Vipre - deep scan clear</p>
<p>Yesterday I installed MS Security Essentials - clear</p>
<p>I down loaded MS safety Scanner - clear</p>

</p>
<p>Preceding issues - for some time [many months] the screen locks and cursor locks; I have been guilty of holding down the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- recently [3wks ago] I got a trojan which Vipre quarantined and removed; since then I have had a couple
 of issues, one resolved with help of the software provider; then this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is an internal CD?DVD drive</p>

            I You're doing fine.<br />
<br />
I found out the THotkey.exe has something to do with the Toshiba touchpad utility software.<br />
<br />
I found on CNET.com that several people with THotkey errors (maybe not just like yours) used this as a solution.<br />

http://forums.cnet.com/7723-6122_102-287379/touched-error-thotkey-toshiba-tablet-laptop/</a><br />
<br />
Here is the link and the alleged solution that worked for some people:<br />
<br />
Navigate to C:\Windows\system32 <br />
<br />
DELETE 000StTHK.exe and 00THotkey.exe.manifest <br />
<br />
COPY 00THotkey.exe <br />
<br />
Navigate to C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup <br />
<br />
PASTE 00THotkey.exe into the Startup directory. <br />
<br />
<br />
Since I don't have a Toshiba laptop, there is no way for me to try it or test anything and I am running out of ideas.<br />
<br />
The Toshiba WWW Support Forums are here - if you post out there where all the Toshiba people hang out, they might have some other ideas:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you remember making any specific change prior to the issue?</li><li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ul>
<p>Press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys together and check if the cursor shows up. If it does, I would suggest you to update the mouse drivers and check the status.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are on desktop, press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X </strong>
and click <strong>Device Manager</strong></p>
<p>Expand <strong>Mice and other pointing Devices</strong></p>
<p>Right click the driver and click <strong>Update driver software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the driver does not get updated for any reason, visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest mouse drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
