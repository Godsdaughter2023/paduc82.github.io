<h2>            windows 7 - applications changed to a purple colour.</h2>
                    HI,&nbsp;
<div>My father uses windows 7, and recently all applications (especially LR4) seemed to have changed to a purple colour. We have tried to changed it back to the original colour but with no success. By going into 'control panel' and 'personalised settings' we
 can change things back to the original colour but within about 30secs it just changes back again. Please can anyone help?

            <p><span>Hi Dale,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the issue description, I understand that you are having issues with the applications changing to purple color. I will be happy to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What do you mean by “</span><b><span>applications changed to a purple color”?</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What exactly do you mean by “</span><span>recently all applications (especially LR4)</span><span>”?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you receive any error message when trying to change the color?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue normally occurs when you load any specific program which uses extra graphics; Windows by default changes the theme to 'basic' to ensure better performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The aero theme is basically enabled depending on video card.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows Display Driver Model</span></b><span> is the graphic driver architecture for video card drivers running Microsoft Windows versions beginning with Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>'WDDM driver model version 1.0'</span></b><span> does not support multiple drivers in a multi-adapter, multi-monitor setup, the latest version is 2.0 is introduced.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows will disable the <b>Desktop Window Manager (DWM)</b> that controls the transparent glass effect or other effects of the
<b>Aero </b>theme. The <b>DWM </b>manages the desktop and the primary display settings in Windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>I would suggest you to try updating your video driver to the latest by visiting the manufacturer’s website.<br />

            Hi Andrew, this is happening much too often at the moment, I think you are logged into a temporary account . . . 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see another user profile in there that looks like yours
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)

<p>Most people have a home network behind a router/modem from their provider.&nbsp; The home network is not public at all and the only item with a public IP is the providers equipment; essentially your local demark point to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you do inside that private network doesn't really matter.</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
IPv6 on Xbox One
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>Xbox One can connect to networks using two protocols that allow devices to transmit information: the traditional IPv4 communications protocol, and its newer version, IPv6. For Xbox One to connect to the internet
 using IPv6, your home router needs to have IPv6 enabled, and your internet service provider (ISP) must support IPv6.</p>
<p><strong>What’s IPv6?</strong></p>
<p>Internet Protocol version 6 is the most current network protocol, bringing several improvements over IPv4. Most important, IPv6 expands the number of possible IP addresses (the unique numbers that represent every
 device on the internet). And—most useful for Xbox—the expansion removes the need for
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Address Translation (NAT)</a>, which can interfere with multiplayer gaming and chat over IPv4 networks.</p>
<p><strong>What if my Xbox One isn’t connected using IPv6?</strong></p>
<p>Your Xbox will work normally without IPv6 connectivity. However, for the best possible experience, we recommend enabling IPv6 on your network. Several Xbox One features already make use of IPv6, and we’re building
 more.</p>
<p><strong>How can I tell if my Xbox is connected using IPv6?</strong></p>
<p>Here’s how to check:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your controller, Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>to open the guide. </li><li>Select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network</strong>.
</li><li>Select <strong>Network settings</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If your Xbox One has IPv6 connectivity, your
<strong>Current Network Status</strong> will read <strong>IPv4 &amp; IPv6</strong>. (To see your actual IP and gateway addresses, select
<strong>Advanced settings</strong>.)</p>
<p><strong>My Xbox is using only IPv4. What should I do to add IPv6?</strong></p>
<p>Several home routers support IPv6 but disable it by default. Check the manual for your router, or visit our
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/*-*/xbox/forum/xba_neteq">
Networking Hardware Information</a> support forum.</p>
<p><strong>My router has IPv6 enabled, but my Xbox is connected on IPv4. What else can I do?</strong></p>
<p>Try contacting your ISP to see if IPv6 is available in your area.</p>

    <title>Child accounts and xbox live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nijsx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child accounts and xbox live</h2>
                    <p>So basically, we've been finding it increasingly difficult to control our son's xbox live time as my wife used her microsoft email a very long time ago to set up his xbox 360 and now he still uses it on his xbox one as it has his gemertag and purchase history
 and the paid for xbox live subscription</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought I'd be able to use screen time on the family page to block him after a certain time as he was staying up some nights at gone 5am, but I contacted support who advised the only way to do that would be to add my wifes MS account to my family group
 but as a child account so when he logs in we can use screen time to block him which has worked fine so far, they said it isn't possible to transfer his gamertag onto a newly created child MS account also so would need to do this</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had also turned his wifi off at a certain time but he was also able to tether his phone to his xbox to get himself back online using 4G, but also over the weekend he somehow managed to remove himself from the family group through settings on my wife's
 account and then add himself as a parent to another family group he created to bypass the screen time, so obviously we immediately made him undo what he'd done so he's back on the main family group as a child so we can control his screen time again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night again though he was online again at 2am and his screen time had ended so I'm guessing he's just signed in with another MS account as I know he had created a few other MS accounts, so he must be just using them with a new gamertag and as his xbox
 is set to his home xbox, I'm guessing he can still use xbox live, no matter who he signs in with</p>
<p>
</p><p>Losing the will to live with it now, other than cancel his xbox live fully, taking it out of his room every night or just smash the thing up, is there anything that can be done to stop him logging into the xbox with a different account or limit the xbox
 live to be only used on one gamertag/MS account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>I assume he has the password to your wifes account. If this is the case change her password and then you enter it into his console, go to settings&gt;account&gt;sign in, security &amp; passkey and set it to instant on. Do not tell him the new password as this is how
 he is circumventing the security you are trying to set up.</p>

<p>Yeah she did have to give it him for when he stays at his dads (I'm the stepdad) but she has changed it since, but he still must be logging in with another email address and using another gamertag to get past the screen time and then using his phone to get
 online, kids 😡</p>

<p>Hey there NijSX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having a hard time with this. Now one thing that you can always do is
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/setup-guest-key-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up a Guest Key</a> on the console. Once his time is out on the console he won't be able to access that account. The only way to get on the console would be to use the guest key (which he should not know) Once the guest key is set up you have the option
 to check a box that will prevent new accounts from being added to the console.</p>
<p>Of course at this point he should have access to his account once it is time in which he is allowed to play.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course make sure that all other accounts are removed from the console, you can always follow the following support article to remove all accounts except for his original account.

<p>Hey there NijSX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having a hard time with this. Now one thing that you can always do is
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/setup-guest-key-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up a Guest Key</a> on the console. Once his time is out on the console he won't be able to access that account. The only way to get on the console would be to use the guest key (which he should not know) Once the guest key is set up you have the option
 to check a box that will prevent new accounts from being added to the console.</p>
<p>Of course at this point he should have access to his account once it is time in which he is allowed to play.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course make sure that all other accounts are removed from the console, you can always follow the following support article to remove all accounts except for his original account.

<p>Ahh Great, thanks for this, so I can use the same MS account that has his gamertag on and add him as a guest and remove all other users and he'll still have his gamertag and be able to play during times where he's allowed screen time

<h2>            MLB2K13 Trouble</h2>
                    
<p>I got the game yesterday and played a Franchise game. Played fine. Went to play just now and after everything loads it freezes. I've deleted all files and cleared the Cache. I installed the game and tried to play again. It loads everything and freezes. Delete
 everything again and try to play off of disk. Everything loads then it freezes. Put in MLB2K12 and it plays fine!</p>
<p>Any advice on how to get 13 to work or should I get another disk even though there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the one I have?</p>

</p><p>I have a client who's surface pro 3 type cover when attached will cause his system to become unresponsive at start up. If the device is detached it will start normally. I have ran all system updates and tried all of the suggestions for troubleshooting the

<h3> rpmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            HAL Event ID 12</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Toshiba Qosmio x505-885 on which I installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit. I have been having random restarts and have noticed several different errors in Event Viewer. Some are related to Microsoft Security Essentials which I am trying to resolve
 with MSE support. I also noticed another one:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>The platform firmware has corrupted memory across the previous system power transition. Please check for updated firmware for your system.</p>
<p>This is corresponding to HAL event ID 12. It says I need to update firmware or BIOS. I went to Toshiba's website and got the latest BIOS update and installed it properly. Still, no go.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts on resolving this issue? Toshiba wants me to recover my system to factory settings which I want to avoid if possible.</p>

<p>Well it seems like you have no alternative than to restore your sys to factory spec, then see if the problem has gone away. If you do so (restore) turn off reccommended updates in winupdate settings.</p>
<p>You dont mention what the origonal o/s was, do I assume it was a 64bit version of win7?</p>

<p>I have a sony DAV-DZ170 surround sound system, a vizio E3D420VX 3d tv, and my xbox 360 now my tv is smart and has music,you tube and such and connects to the surround sound via Digital Audio Out. and my xbox is connected via HDMI. so its xbox&gt;hdmi&gt;tv&gt;toslink&gt;surround
 sound.<br />
<br />
will my current setup give me surround sound for games?<br />
or do i have to plug surround sound into xbox?</p>

<p>If you have an older white 360 and don't have the audio AV adapter with the optical and RCA jacks only, i see how your method with audio from the TV itself works.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>But if you have a newer 360 Slim with an onboard optical port, use that so you have it like this:
</p>
<p>Xbox&gt;HDMI&gt;TV</p>
<p>Xbox&gt;Optical&gt;receiver</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>This will reduce any possible audio delay caused by an extra decoder from the TV which the 360 already does for the receiver. The optical port on an HDTV is usually only needed for cable TV from a coax line that provides channels that use Dolby Digital.
 The HDMI audio passthrough usually isn't ment to work like that from the Xbox 360 to your TV, but disabling Display Discovery does this and you can do it that way. its just not advised.</p>

<p>If your Elite dates back to before September, 2009, it included a thin AV adapter dongle that fits in the AV port alongside an HDMI cable and provides only optical and left/right audio out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to try HAY HAY Its MDA,'s suggestion&nbsp;you'd use that adapter and plug the optical audio out into the optical audio in on the Sony Home Theater device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Elite was purchased after September, 2009, it lacks the adapter. I wouldn't worry about it unless your home theater reports LPCM instead of 5.1 for the incoming audio signal from the 360 while in-game.</p>

 source and if that channel provides DD 5.1, puts it out over that optical port on your TV. (see 3rd quote below to understand how this works with HDMI) [quote]Originally, the content industry did not want 5.1 pass through. Now, they don't seem to care. My
 Sony KDL-55HX850 has 5.1 passthrough. All of my HDMI video is routed into the TV and the audio goes out to my Yamaha sound projector over the optical audio out.[/quote] This is not a preferrable method unless you have no other way. Going from the Xbox to your
 receiver by either optical or HDMI audio is the best way as it isn't going through any unecessary devices such as your TV or Projector's sound processing system to the same format again. Even if it doesn't decode or encode it, it still takes time to "read"
 the signals data and in a display that's not geared towards audio but video, its sound system is cheap and subpar in performance. I have 80+ms of audio delay tacked on if i use your described method.[quote]Display Discovery has nothing to do with this. On
 or off, it makes no difference. If the display doesn't support 5.1 audio over HDMI it's not going to work if you disable Display Discovery and then force Dolby Digital 5.1 on the 360.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I hope you know how a computer communicates with a display... because thats what your missing here. The EDID is a chip in your HDTV/projector that contains information on supported video and AUDIO modes of your connected device. Display Discovery is essentially
 that DDC/CI feature you see on monitors that controls reading from the EDID which is what Display Discovery is but on the Xbox 360's side and not the display since TV's usually don't have this feature. If you put the receiver first in the chain and have Display
 Discovery on, then it will allow you to switch over to DD 5.1 or not depending if you have a receiver or a TV hooked up by HDMI first. This does not affect the optical port on a 360 of course. If you disable Display Discovery, it stops reading your displays
 EDID and just forces any resolution or audio you choose. Its kind of a "dummy" control. so if you don't know what your setup supports, best leave it on. By doing this, your display is FORCED 5.1 surround and thats how it takes it to the optical port of your
 display. Its an option, but not ment for the purpose of high quality surround sound gaming.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Sony HX920 does. Everything gets fed into one giant ASIC, and that&nbsp;ASIC handles output, including redirecting audio to the optical port.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Sony KDL-42WE655 splits audio and video from the HDMI input. Audio goes one way (and ends up becoming left/right out), the video goes another.[quote]That dolby digital decoder in the TV[/quote]The audio is
<strong>delivered</strong> in Dolby Digital format. There is no&nbsp;decoding occuring when that signal is sent to the output of a TV that supports an optical out,
<strong>unless you specifically change a setting to do that.</strong> Get 5.1 in, send 5.1 out. That's it. There's no decoding process. If you want to say that it's stripped from the HDMI input stream, that's fine, but it does not need to be decoded and re-encoded.[quote]This
 is not a preferrable method unless you have no other way. Going from the Xbox to your receiver by either optical or HDMI audio is the best way as it isn't going through any unecessary devices such as your TV or Projector's sound processing system to the same
 format again.[/quote]In a modern day TV that does not do any format conversion, there's no delay being added. It takes longer for the TV to assemble and display a frame than it does for the audio to leave the TV, go to a receiver, and be output via the speakers.[quote]Even
 if it doesn't decode or encode it, it still takes time to "read" the signals data and in a display that's not geared towards audio but video[/quote]No. These are not monolithic devices that do everything in serial. They use off the shelf ASICs from Silicon
 Image and others to accept inputs. The video path through a display device like a TV is going to take significantly longer than sending audio back out of the TV. Once the HDMI packets are disassembled, the data goes where it's supposed to in a parallel fashion.[quote]I
 have 80+ms of audio delay tacked on if i use your described method.[/quote]Then your TV has issues. Mine does not. I have no sync issues&nbsp;when allowing my TV to do the job of splitting audio and video.[quote]The EDID is a chip[/quote]EDID is a standard format
 for communicating display capabilities between devices. It is not a physical device or object.[quote]TV's usually don't have this feature.[/quote]TVs most certaintly do communicate EDID data with connected devices. It's how the 360 detects 3D capabilties.[quote]By
 doing this, your display is FORCED 5.1 surround and thats how it takes it to the optical port of your display.[/quote]What comes out of the optical port on a TV is determined by what the TV does with the input. My previous&nbsp;TV turned&nbsp;everything into stereo
 audio. My new one passes through. Modern TVs have shifted to a passthrough arrangement in many instances. There is no reason to believe that BUMPNGLOW's new Vizio is not providing passthrough.</p>

<p>All-in-All, stop taking things like "The EDID is a chip" out of context. which i meant by that being its not the NAME of the chip, but the EDID is held on THAT chip. iIhave no idea what the chip is called and i don't care much until there is something wrong
 with my own EDID.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>Really think here. Putting audio into ANY TV needs a bit of processing. whether its being decoded/encoded or just passed on. It needs to "sense" that audio is coming to itself and thats what my TV is doing and causing a delay i can understand. I use an LG
 LHB326 HDMI sound system anyways so i could care less about Optical anymore. So my setup is basic and doesn't have much to troubleshoot. If there's a problem with it, its pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>I know your not directly bragging about your setup Icestorm, but through implication that you say your Sony does not do that and its a high-tech piece of equipment that trounces everything i say because it works differently than mine sounds a little like
 bragging. ALOT of people brag their technology these days. It peeves me because we are in a time where a lot of countries are in recession including the US. Take what you have for granted and keep it to yourselves. thats why "Post your setups!" kind of threads
 are just a way of formal bragging.</p>
<p>\</p>
<p>What im trying to summarize is look what i have said up and see if it matches any "standard" that is described by wikipedia, a handbook, or anything from a manufacturer of that field of equipment's standpoint and then tell me i'm wrong about what i say.</p>

<h2>            Being Disconected when Connection isn&#39;t Vital&#63;&#63; It seems...</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so recently, I've been being disconnected from Live virtually every time I've been playing my Xbox. It seems that when what I'm doing isn't vital of a Live connection (i.e. Playing Black Ops online, chatting in a Party or actively downloading something).
 I connect with no problems. But when playing something offline, or just sitting idle for a minute or two, I get disconnected. I always have to reconnect. Most the time having to do so on every level just so my scores can link up to the online leaderboards
 depending on the game I'm playing. It's a real pain. Most of the time, I wait until I'm on the finishing results screen before attempting to reconnect otherwise I would have to do it three or four times in a 15 min stretch. It's sorta weird... but very annoying.
 Can someone help?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't really provide much info. It isn't my internet connection. I haven't had any problem with it using my computer at all. My connection strength seems to be top notch, either on the computer or in an online match. I never have trouble connecting up
 initially.&nbsp; btw, I'm using a New 360 and my wireless adapter. ...And that seems to be it. I've tested the connection many times and it always says that it connects just fine. Don't know what to do. Is it a Live problem going on?? I hope it isn't just me.</p>

<p>No, that isn't the same problem. I stated that my problem wasn't that I "couldnt connect," but rather I would get dc'ed under certain situations... and never any problems when re-connecting either.</p>

<p>You need to log in to the router's config page, more than likely that's going to be 192.168.0.1 for you (just type it in the address bar, no www or anything). &nbsp;Then log in (default username should be admin, the default password should be left blank).</p>
<p>Click on setup, then wireless settings and manual wireless setup. &nbsp;Once there, uncheck "enable auto channel scan" and change the wireless channel to either 1 or 11 (if the first one doesn't work, go back and change it to the other one).</p>

<p>Thank you. I'll try that... btw, what's the significance of the channels?--Why would 1 or 11 work? And why is 3 I guess the default one it picked???</p>

<p>So in the US, wireless on 2.4Ghz runs from channels 1-11. &nbsp;The way the wireless channels work is that there's some overlap. &nbsp;Channels 1 and 11 have the least amount of overlap because they're at the extremes of the spectrum. &nbsp;Here's a picture that sort of
 demonstrates what I'm talking about:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Dear Soumya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestions. </p>
<p>I have a similar issue on my Lenovo laptop. The USB 3.0 port was working normally on Windows 8.1. After I upgraded to Windows 10 my external devices cannot connect properly via the USB 3.0 port (they get connected and disconnected all the time).</p>
<p>Can I apply the hotfix from KB2830154 on Windows 10? Can I try to modify the registry manually according to the instructions in the same article?
</p>
<p>Is there available any other hotfix particularly for Windows 10?</p>

<p>No, stationary AT rockets go in the direction youre pointing. &nbsp;So if you fire, and look to the left, the rocket will fly to the left.</p>

<p>Yeah some geometry like foliage can send them flying off when it hits it. It's a bug that has been around since the game came out. I have had it happen a couple times trying to hit snipers with stationary AT.</p>

<p>cool so its not a connection issue. just need to beware the trees then. while ive been @ b on harvest day ive nailed snipers on the hill behind d. @ the same time cant hit the broad side of a tank @ a and c. the trees would explain that.

    <title>Hello Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kid wong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hello Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me tell you a true story. Myself is a user of Windows Phone, Surface, Xbox. Office365 and Xbox Live subscriber too (and more...). Basically, all my electronic devices are all Microsoft's, I bet
 I deserve to share you this true story happening on myself, and have you actually listen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People around me are all Android and Apple users, people look at me like a weird person supporting everything Microsoft that much. Even though I have to agree that The MS products / services are always
 missing a bit, never can be perfect, only I always work around to make things happen with (between) the services. It because I believe a global wide well-known company is trying its very best to benefits the world, "unfortunately" MS is in the technologies
 business, so the best products and services are always in the future, not the present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So story starts. I had my Surface since RT version and now I own a SP3. When I got my SP3 about half a year ago, my 60 years old father wanted to try my SurfaceRT see what have I been using so proudly.
 So I passed my RT to my father 6 months ago let him experience how cool Microsoft can make him. Maybe you are wondering, a 60 years old man, he probably using Nokia 8310 to call his son does he? No he doesn't. He always own a latest model of iPhone, he can
 make simple editing on PC within MS Word, sending emails on a smartphone, this 60 years old man also can tell you the different between iPhone and Android, so as the different of DropBox and OneDrive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, compare to his son who's daily reading the technology news and using FULL services with the whole range of hardwares, of course we can judge him only a "user" or a "consumer", he doesn't do coding,
 he of course can't build an application from scratch, can't even fix a battery if it won't charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 months ago, I had to go to China for a job for couple of months. When I passed my father the SurfaceRT, I spent a night to show him how to Skype me on Surface, how to share me his living photos by
 OneDrive using outlook.com. At the end, he didn't Skype me once, but he learnt to use WeChat to video-call me on a Android phone. He also choose to share me DropBox link by using Gmail. When I came back to Hong Kong, I found that SurfaceRT just sitting at
 the dining room looks almost never been touched.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I question my father why didn't he use the "new toy" and the things I showed him like Skype and OneDrive? My father looked very upset and told me that he's sorry, using that machines and those applications
 wasn't easy for him. The harder he tried, the more stupid he looked like, because he couldn't even call his son in the way his son want him to try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happened? Why the 60 years old geek feel sorry when using Microsoft products? Not matter software nor the hardware? Here I have to say, don't get me wrong, I don't think Microsoft is having such
 a failure because one 60 years old user doesn't know how to use their products. But I think, he maybe right, using MS products is really not that easy. From numbers of buttons, to a over-design user interface, I have to agree with this old man when I rethink
 how I use the products everyday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I don't mean its a failure. I mean if we rethink, if Microsoft really wanted to gain market share back, the number of users and devises people holding in their hands is the very first step, am
 I right? Why is this user having all these choices in hand, but he end up choosing NONE from Microsoft? NONE!! Don't you want to figure out the reason? That might be the reason the current majority have chosen too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that about the price? No I don't think so. Let make the current flagship model of the three OS as an example. Buying an iPhone in HK will cost you $6,400 or more depending on the memory size you
 choose. A Samsung Galaxy 6S is about $6,200 depending on the deals from retailers. A Lumia 930 is only $3,600 you can get one in most places. A Lumia is nearly half price of the other two. So I bet price is not a reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess, you must have concluded one reason is not enough users to inference the others using MS products. And let's ask why again? In so many years, MS have been depending on the developers. Yes, I
 know the one hour coding campaign and Universal app system is rolling out. But, is this a betting? or a solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not teaching Microsoft how to do its business, but its was a true story worth us to think about those Whys. As I have been, I'm and I will be a very Microsoft guy. I'm just feeling sour for Microsoft
 when I enjoy using Microsoft products but the others won't. I hope this story will wroth something for you to design you products and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A sincere user.</p>

            I'm older than your father so I guess I qualify as an "old man."&nbsp; I have no quarrel with that designation, however I do wax a bit indignant when others use it as an excuse for not being willing to learn about what they're doing or trying to do.&nbsp; I'm sympathetic
 to people of all ages who suffer from some form of cognitive deficit, but being 60 years old in and of itself is no excuse.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have the Battle Stations Pacific Disc, when I attempt to download it into my computer, which is a Toshiba satellite C-55 AS-105 with Windows 8.1 it will not load normally, so I must play it from my D drive cd player. It load but will not play correctly,
 everything slows down while playing, I have tried downloading Games for windows but it still wont work properly, When I bought Battle Stations Midway all I had to do was download it then then right click on the game icon on he screen and then hit Properties,
 then Compatibility then select Vista Pack2 and the game played correctly. This new game will not download properly. can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Scan Dialog Box in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corrines  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scan Dialog Box in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and can no longer find the same scan dialog box that I had in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Envy 7640 and understand there are many different options now on what to use as an interface for scanning (i.e. HP Smart app, HP Scan &amp; Capture app, Windows Scan app, MS Paint, Windows Fax and Scan, and Webscan).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked into many of these options and settled on the HP Smart app, but I miss the old dialog box and all the options that were presented with that. Is there any program/interface for scanning that will display that dialog box in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a sample of the dialog box I'm looking for:</p>

            Hi Corrine.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.       
        </p>

            What happens if you do the following:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Right click your Printer/Scanner
<br />Click Start scan
<br />
<br />You have several options on the screen which let you preview the document, choose a color format (color or black and white), adjust brightness, set the appropriate resolution and even choose the format you want to save it in: JPEG, PDF or PNG. If you are satisfied with the results after previewing the document, proceed to click scan.
<br />
<br />Make your selections, Click Preview to ensure everything looks good then Click Scan.

<p>Thank you for your quick reply Andre. I did look at that option (right-click on the printer, Start Scan), but that Scan dialog box does not have the PDF option which is what I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on exploring all the different scan options I could find for Windows 10, it doesn't look like I can access the same scan dialog box anymore&nbsp;(pictured in my question), which is a bummer. I do a lot of scanning for work and that dialog box (and interface
 for saving)&nbsp;were awesome for a number of different reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up going with the HP Smart app option for now; it's the least amount of mouse clicks to get the scanning done &amp; saved, and offers PDF and JPG as save as types. Those are the two I would need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

<p>Thank you Greg for your quick response. I'm really just looking for a "Yes" or "No" on whether or not&nbsp;I can get the same Scan dialog box I had in Windows 7 (pictured in my question). If it's a "Yes", I'd like to know how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scanning is working fine on my computer and I spent several hours today&nbsp;on creating a working shortcut, getting scanning to work, installing Drivers, etc., so I'd&nbsp;rather not uninstall and reinstall unless that will produce the old dialog box (even then,
 I've spent too much time on this already!). Please let me know though&nbsp;if that's the case, and then I'll decide if I want to key those steps.</p>
<p>

            Hi again Corrine -
<br />
<br />Yes you should get that box as long as you have the full HP Software installed.  
<br />
<br />Since Windows will often supply a basic driver to get the printer to print, if that's all you've got then you won't see that box because it only comes with the full HP software package for the model.  
<br />
<br />Since you need to go to the HP Support Downloads webpage to download and install the software anyway, I gave you fuller steps which tend to work better and last longers because they first clean out old drivers that can interfere.  But you can just install the HP software package to see if that's enough.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
<br />I hope this clarifies.  Let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

<p>Thanks Greg. I will consider uninstalling and re-installing at another time. I'm going to keep your instructions above to use when I do that. Right now the HP Smart app is giving me what I need, but I'll see how it goes after working with that for a while...</p>

    <title>Windows 10 View All Pictures by Date Regardless of Folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 View All Pictures by Date Regardless of Folder</h2>
                    <p>When viewing pictures in Windows 10, is there a way to disregard which folder within Pictures they are stored in and to see ALL pictures organized by date? &nbsp;When using the sort by and group by functions, I am only able to sort WITHIN the folders by date.
 &nbsp;In Windows 7, I was able to see all photos stored within Pictures sorted by date OUTSIDE of their subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this function gone in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature is still there.. Make sure you're in Library view. To enable Libraries in the navigation pane, click View &gt; navigation pane &gt; Click "Show libraries"</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in Pictures Library i set:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arrange by &gt; Folder</p>
<p>Group by &gt; None</p>
<p>Sort by &gt; Date</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I get.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;Actually, what I am looking for is to see icons of all my pictures at once including those in subfolders within the pictures library. &nbsp;For example, my photos are stored as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Library &gt; Pictures &gt; 2016 &gt; 2016-01-31 &gt; 0100.jpeg; 0101.jpeg; 0102.jpeg...</p>
<p>Library &gt; Pictures &gt; 2016 &gt; 2016-02-15 &gt; 0205.jpeg; 0206.jpeg; 0207.peg...</p>
<p>Library &gt; Pictures &gt; 2015 &gt; 2015-07-01 &gt; 0092.jpeg; 0093.jpeg....</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, I could go to Library &gt; Pictures and either sort by or view by (I can't remember) date taken. &nbsp;It would take all those photos within Pictures out of their respective folders and put them all together. &nbsp;I had them set as large icons. &nbsp;WIndows
 7 then showed the date and all the photos taken that day, and then another date and those respective photos, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>February 14, 2016</p>
<p>Picture Icon Here &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Picture Icon Here</p>
<p>0207 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0206</p>
<p>
</p><p>February 1, 2016</p>
<p>Picture Icon Here</p>
<p>0205</p>
<p>
</p><p>January 10, 2016</p>
<p>Picture Icon Here &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Picture Icon Here</p>
<p>0102 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;0101</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm only getting Windows 10 to sort the folders themselves by date and then the photos within those subfolders by date. &nbsp;It is not gathering ALL the photos out of the subfolders and sorting them by date at the Picture folder level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Huh? &nbsp;Can someone give step-by-step for achieving this. &nbsp;That is exactly what I thought I couldn't do (after much trial and error): show all pictures one huge listing regardless of folder or subfolder. &nbsp;Don't care how they are sorted.

<h2>            Upgrade to new CPU from AMD FX-6100 to FX-8350 problem with cores&#40;FX-8350 not working with 8 cores&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have upgrade my CPU few days ago and having problem with windows 10 restarting, when I used my old CPU AMD FX-6100 there was no problems but when I upgrade it to new AMD FX-8350, it started to restart and I even can't get to the login screen some times.
 I chek all my hardware and it was ok but I read that someone had problems with the cores when upgrading to new CPU, and I trun off 2 cores in the bios, so it works with 6 cores like my old CPU and then Windows 10 is working great ( if I turn them back on it
 will start restarting again ).</p>
<p>Pls help what can I do, is the AMD&nbsp;FX-8350 not supported by Windows 10 ? (sorry for my bad English)</p>
