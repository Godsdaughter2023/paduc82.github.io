<h2>            My Xbox wont connect to Netflix</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started the whole process of obtaining earlier today and something went wrong in the middle of the activaton. Now when I try to log into Netflix I get an error saying "We're unable to connect you to Netflix please try again later Support: netflix.com/tvhelp".
 I've read their little troubleshooter deal and it says that it is because my device is not activated, even though I did. Now I cannot get to the screen where it will give me another code. Can anyone tell me how I can fix the problem? Or even erase whatever
 to get back to the original screen.</p>

<p>I have 2 suggestions to try.</p>
<p>1) Sign into the Netflix website and go to your account. Then go to Manage Netflix ready devices and computers and see if you can disconnect the Xbox from there. Then try activating it again through the console.</p>
<p>2) If that doesn't work, try deleting the Netflix app from the console and then re-downloading it.</p>

            Hi ClarenceClark,
<br />
<br />Is it possible you could use the following software, TreeSize, to run a scan on your C: drive? <a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>

            okay, sorry about that, First, The game is called Need for speed underground 2, the next series to the original Underground, Now, the problem im facing is, That, when im playing, the controls do not properly save "controls reverting to original" and, You
 can only fix it by having the Dimap.dll in the directory of the game, this seems to only happen to windows vista + windows 7 for some unknown reason, is there any way i can get this dll? (from extracting it from the direct X install? or download it)

            Never heard of the dimap.dll (until doing a search just now), and a search of my Windows folder
<br />
does not reveal one either (Win7 64bit).<br />
NFS Underground 2 does save my Wheel profile, but only if I go back to the Profile Manager<br />
tab and save it after doing the setup.&nbsp; <br />
I have found that some games will loose the Wheel profile if I play the game when the Wheel is not connected.<br />
There is no dimap.dll&nbsp; in my games install&nbsp; directory either.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't think the dimap.dll is part of DirectX or it would have come up in my search of Windows<br />
(I also looked through System 32 manually), but -<br />
Have you updated Direct X,&nbsp; and have you installed all the 'important' Windows Updates ?<br />
There are several game related Windows Updates. If you have not installed Windows Updates<br />
yet do them in small lots as a precaution against corrupt installs.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If you continue having problems with the game not retaining your controller setup use your
<br />
controllers profiling software to create a profile for the game and it will override the game settings.<br />
<br />
I have read of various "fixes" for games involving popping a certain DX&nbsp; file into a games<br />
folder, but I've never come across a case where adding a file is needed on a properly configured system, except in rare cases when a game installs a file and it has been corrupted somehow, in which case reinstalling the game is a good option.<br />
Having said that - whatever works, eh!<br />

            I wouldn't dismiss it as a Virus out of hand, but it should be scanned before using -<br />
I just had another look and apparently&nbsp; XP used a dimap.dll .<br />
You may have already been to the site below which has a download for the dimap.dll&nbsp; and<br />
does seem to help preserve bindings for some people.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nfscars.net/file/view/underground2/17510.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nfscars.net/file/view/underground2/17510.aspx</a><br />
<br />
But as I said previously, none of my NFS&nbsp; games has a&nbsp; dimap.dll&nbsp; file, so maintaining settings is not a universal problem.<br />
With this game it's best to save to your profile after configuring your settings and before going on to race.<br />
I'm not really certain. It may just be that it does not save the wheel settings if you don't complete
<br />
a race and save, but some games save settings automatically when exiting the setup screen, even it<br />
you quit the game without doing a race. This game does not.<br />
<br />
What controller/wheel&nbsp; are you using ?<br />
<br />

I have provided further details to assist in resolving this issue:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Windows Live Mail 2012 - Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3528.0331)</p>
<p>2. Email Account is “Telstra Mail”</p>
<p>3. OS – Windows 7</p>
<p>4. I have checked that <em>Read all messages in plain text </em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">isn't</span></strong> selected on the
<em>Read </em>tab.</p>
<p>by pressing Ctrl-Shift-O for Options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<em>"View/Reading pane/show message header in the reading pane".</em></p>

            You should remove the mail account and re-add again. This should solve the problem. But if doesn't (Note - You will not lose any mails because of below step) -
<br />
<br />1. Reset Mail app 
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; Scroll down and click Mail &amp; Calendar &gt; Click Advanced options &gt; Click Reset &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />2: Uninstall and Reinstall Mail app
<br />
<br />A. Uninstall - Type Powershell in Windows Start Search box
<br />Right click on Powershell &gt; Run As Administrator
<br />Copy the below and paste into Powershell and Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />B. Reinstall
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Click Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below command and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers *windowscommunicationsapps* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

                    For some reason, I cannot minimize or maximize any window on my desktop. I see the proper icons on the top right of the window bar (the usual underscore-box-red X), but only the close button works. When I hover over the minimize button, the pop up shows
 maximize. The maximize button shows Close as does the red X. <br />

            Try doing a System Restore before the problem happened. If you are unable to do this in Normal Mode. Reboot your computer, press F8 just before the computer reaches the boot screen, from the boot options, click Safe Mode and attempt system restore.

 We've been friends for years, and I haven't deleted her from my contact and she told me my name is in her contact. We haven't talked on Skype for about a year but this shouldn't change anything, should it?&nbsp;</p>

            4shared is website for users to upload various files (mostly illegal). It has nothing to do with Microsoft.

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which file format you're trying to open?</p>
<p>Is it JPEG or jpg or Bitmap or PNG or any other?</p>
<p>From which location you're trying to access those files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you come up with the above information, try to change the location of the files from where you're trying to access them. Say for example, if you're opening the file from desktop, then try to copy them from that location to Documents or to any other
 drive partition&nbsp;and then try to access them from that location to see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check this issue by opening the files using MS Paint or any other image viewer to see if it works. To do that, right-click on the image, point to
<strong>Open with </strong>and select the desired app to open the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us above information to assist you better in this regard.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I see that MS Paint still fails to open the file. I suspect that the problem might lies with the images you're trying to access. This happens when the image files goes corrupt. Do test this issue by accessing this images on some other PC to confirm the same.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Hello All,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
My son started playing FORTNITE on my Xbox Account/Gamertag.&nbsp; He now has his own Xbox Account/Gamertag.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I want to move his current Fortnite game progress &amp; purchases (skins, etc) from my Xbox Account/Gamertag to his Xbox Account/Gamertag.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I've read in various threads that all of this is stored in the EPIC GAMES account and not the Xbox Account/Gamertag so I would simply need to login to his account at epicgames.com and unlink my gamertag.&nbsp; I would then go to his Xbox and login under his account
 and link it to that one.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I've read 2-3 different reports on what happens when you do this.&nbsp; The first is success and no issues.&nbsp; The second is that he'll lose all progress and purchases and you can't get them back once you unlink from the first account.&nbsp; The third is that it's not
 possible to do.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I also know that there's an update to the game in the works allowing you to "merge" accounts so wasn't sure if I should just wait until that is out?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. At the moment, there is no way to transfer game progress/purchases from one Microsoft account/gamertag to another.&nbsp; If you wish to attempt to do the transfer via the Fortnite/Epic Games account,
 then you would need to seek the instruction to do so from their website, or you may ask about doing so in their forums (there may already be a thread there about it).&nbsp; You may also want to look into the account merger information about Fortnite directly there
 as well.</p>

            Do they stay with the Epic Games account or with the Xbox account?&nbsp; That's the part I'm trying to get clarification on.&nbsp; I know that you can't move purchases from one Xbox account to another.&nbsp; My understanding with this particular game though is everything
 is stored within your Epic Games account and not the Xbox gamertag so that's how it is potentially possible because that account moves with you?

<p>Hey Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding. I understand you wish to unlink an Epic Account from his current Gamertag and link it to his own account, but would like to know what would happen with his purchased/unlocked content. Unfortunately, here in the Xbox Forums we cannot
 give you a direct answer as this falls under the jurisdiction of Epic Games. We suggest you get in contact with their support team and explain your situation to get an accurate response. Good Luck :D</p>

<h2>            Critical Process Died - Windows 10 reboots continually</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro, networked not wi-fi, so I cannot use 'Metered Connections' to prevent updates auto-installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appear to have this same issue as Arturs here&nbsp; https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update-winpc/critical-process-died-blue-screen-error-every-hour/16658f97-a9c3-42e4-b0f7-779cfacb4e9e?auth=1 although the last update on my PC was
 some Windows security patch for Adobe from memory - it crashes before I can check too much detail.</p>
<p>If I start the PC normally then it crashes within around 1 to 2 minutes without fail and restarts.&nbsp; It has also restarted before I can log back in.&nbsp; If I start in Safe Mode it does not restart, but Windows 10 will not show me the Update History in this mode
 - appears to hang even when left overnight, so I cannot try to uninstall the last update.</p>
<p>I have;</p>
<ol>
<li>Tried to uninstall the last update - but the PC shuts down before I can do that</li><li>Started in Safe Mode, but the Windows 10 will not list the Update History, so cannot uninstall</li><li>Restored an earlier version from backup - about 5 times by this count<br />
<ol>
<li>Started in Safe Mode</li><li>Edited gpedit to prevent auto installation of updates - options tried are 3 and 4 I think (or maybe 2 and 3?)<br />
</li><li>Restarted</li></ol>
</li><li>Still crashes - I assume after installing some updates.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Can someone please tell me how to resolve this?, I'm reaching the end of my patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nigel</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses.&nbsp; This has been resolved, but cannot be certain I know why.</p>
<p>I did not try response 2 as I was trying to avoid a clean install.&nbsp; I did open the MiniDump but could not see anything in that file when analysed using the DumpCheck application.</p>
<p>I did schedule a chkdsk /r on the system drive for the next restart and maybe that did the trick?&nbsp; Personally I tink I have just been on an extended 'turn-it-off turn-it-on' journey we are all too familar with.</p>
<p>This is what I did and this time it worked, and I think the only difference was that a different Microsoft cummuative release was finally loaded.</p>
<p>First thing to say - make sure you have a backup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start PC in Safe Mode - this seemed to stop my PC restarting, but does not allow you to check all the drivers are the right version or check what your Microsoft update history is (at least for me anyway)<br />
</li><li>Restore a suitable backup from a time before you think the problem was introduced</li><li>Start again in Safe Mode to prevent a 'Critical Process Died' restart</li><li>Edit gpedit and change 'Configure Automatic Updates' to option 5 'Allow local Admin to decide'. To edit this navigate to Windows Components&gt;Windows Updates&gt;Configure Automatic Updates</li><li>Restart in 'normal' mode</li><li>Hold breath and hope system stays up</li><li>Backup if stable</li><li>Apply updates that are pending</li><li>Restart and hope system is stable</li></ol>
<p>You could then repeat loading the backup from 7 if the updates cause instability, waiting until there are different Microsoft Cummulative Updates to install - at least you will have a stable system to use even if not all latest security patches and drivers
 loaded.</p>
<p>Obviously also worth searching, or raising an issue, on this forum to see if others have the same issue and found a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone in the future.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nige</p>

Do you have an official MS HDD attached to your console?.<br />
There have been several posts about this issue happening with this title over the last few days so you are definitely not alone.<br />
<br />
I will try and find an answer for you but the usual suggestions do not seem to help, deleting and re downloading the game, clearing the cache &amp; re downloading any title updates that are needed etc.<br />
<br />
Will see if I can find anything that will help you though, and hopefully someone else&nbsp;may see your post, know what needs to be done to get your game working.<br />

<p>the game IS supported on the 360 (I know cause I played it on my 360 Arcade with a 120 gig drive from an Elite) but you have to have a 360 hard drive for it to work as only those drives have the emulation that allows the 360 to play the older xbox games.
 &nbsp;if you do not have a hard drive, you need one, just make sure it is the one that is made to work with YOUR 360, if you have the older style model with the clip on drive you need a 20, 60, 120, or a 250. &nbsp;if you have the current slim style you need the 250.
 &nbsp;if you DO have a hard drive than pretty sure it is a fake drive that is enclosed in a real looking 360 hard drive enclosure and those drives usually do NOT have the emulation for old xbox games on it.</p>

<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it?

    <title>ASUS Touchpad not working with Windows 10. Does not move or has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> electronicfog  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS Touchpad not working with Windows 10. Does not move or has erratic movement. Have to uninstall and reinstall drivers almost daily.</h2>
                    <p>Almost daily I have to uninstall and reinstall the drivers for the Asus touchpad to use it. Before, when I uninstalled and reinstalled the touchpad driver and the Asus Smart Gesture package, it would work almost normally. I could not use 2 finger scroll
 on the right half of the touchpad and to right click I had to click on the bottom middle of the touchpad, as clicking on the right bottom side had no effect, but I could use it. Lately, I have to use a USB mouse as the touchpad is practically useless. It has
 erratic motion. Moving the pointer, which you can only do when pressing very hard on the touchpad, causes the pointer to appear in another point of the screen. Usually it moves to the right of the screen. Clicking on any part of the screen causes the pointer
 to click on the lower left side of the screen. In this state, the only way that the touchpad can be used properly is when I have one finger on the touchpad, and a second finger moving the pointer. If I remove the first finger the pointer stops moving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the latest touchpad drivers and packages numerous times today and in the past days. For months I have had the issue and now I cannot even get it to work partially like before. I basically have a non-functioning touchpad.
 My Asus laptop model is GL552VW-DH71.</p>

            Hi  ElectronicFog
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Reinstall the driver again, but before restarting, try disabling fast startup:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Power options
<br />Click Additional power settings under Related settings
<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)
<br />
<br />Click Save changes.
<br />
<br />Click Restart now and see if it works.
<br />
<br />There is also a BIOS update from September 2017
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/GL552VW/GL552VWAS300.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/GL552VW/G...</a>
<br />
<br />Apply that update to see if it helps.

<h2>            Frequent hiccups plaguing performance &#40;Computer randomly freezes&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I built myself a brand-new computer about a month ago, and I've been having performance issues since then. I guess a good place to start would be the parts:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 7 Home Edition, 64-bit</p>
<p>Motherboard: ASUS P6TD Deluxe</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i7 930</p>
<p>RAM: Corsair 6GB DDR3 1333 (can't find the actual product code, but it was listed in the compatible RAM in the motherboard's booklet)</p>
<p>HDD: Western Digital WD15EARS - 1.5TB</p>
<p>Video Card: EVGA GTX 470</p>
<p>Power Supply: Corsair TX750W</p>
<p>Cooling: Cooler Master Hyper N620</p>
<p>Internet Connection: Broadband</p>
<p>As you can see, all of the parts are new and a notch above decent. The problem that I am having is that I'm having very frequent random hiccups where my computer freezes for 1-2 seconds. It is much much worse after I have done a fresh startup, as I can't
 do anything for a good 10 minutes without seeing the cursor switching to waiting mode, and those hiccups last several seconds, only to start again shortly after they end. Thankfully, this is not happening at all when playing a game; only when I am browsing
 the internet (using Firefox, but it still does it with Internet Explorer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have tried to look at so far:</p>
<p>I have only 3 program that launch startup: my antivirus (aVast), a program for my sound device, and Java.</p>
<p>I have noticed that whenever the hiccups occur, there is usually a high disk I/O (&gt;3MB), or a 100% highest Active Time (from the Resource Monitor Screen). A high I/O only really occurs when the Indexer is running, which isn't too often.</p>
<p>My computer does recognize my 6GB of RAM, and I've never seen more than 30% used physical memory (from Resource Monitor).</p>
<p>I have run a HDD check, with no error on my HDD, downloaded and installed of the Windows Updates (all are successfully installed), Microsoft's Automated Troubleshooting Services, and probably more various checks, to no avail.</p>
<p>I am currently running a Data Collector Set from the Performance Monitor (perfmon), but I understand that I need at least 24 hours before there can be an output of some sort. I'm also not certain that I will be able to use the results intelligently, as I
 have never used this tool before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply writing from this post, I've <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">noticed</span> about 7-8 hiccups, where the letters wouldn't appear right away as I type them, or scrolling up/down the page would be dealyed. As you can imagine, this is very aggravating,
 considering that I have spent a lot of money to have a performing computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, as I don't know where else I can go to fix this!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Marc</p>

<p>The problem is compounded by the stopping of the respoince of the Windows Explorer. After the computer os running for a couple of hours a reb oot is required. please advise.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>HI THERE,</p>
<p>WE INSTALLED WINDOWS 10 WHEN IT WAS READY TO INSTALL FROM THE FREE UPGRADE MADE AVAILABLE THE MONITOR WORKED PERFECTLY WELL BEFORE AND SINCE, UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO WHEN IT STARTED BLINKING. THE BLINKING LASTED INITIALLY FOR ABOUT 3-4 MINS THEN THE MONITOR LOADED
 AS NORMAL. IT SEEMS TO WORK WELL FOR ABOUT 30 INS THEN STARTS BLINKING AGAIN. I HAVE CHECKED TO SEE THAT THE DRIVERS ARE UP TO DATE, AND THEY ARE.</p>
<p>HAS ANYONE GOT AN IDEA OF WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THIS TO HAPPEN. COULD IT BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH WINDOWS 10??</p>
<p>WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE ANY ADVICE AS THE MONITOR IS A REALLY NICE ONE.</p>

<h2>            Need help on surface pro extended warranty</h2>
                    <p>I have an extended warranty for my Surface Book but don't know how to exchange the device.&nbsp; The keyboard does not work anymore.&nbsp; Some keys work, some don't and it needs to be exchanged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to the website:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices, web site indicates device is under warranty</p>

            Hi Destine.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you explain a bit more.  Digital LIcense and Product Keys are two different ways to activate.  Did you have a DL for Home version and now want to use a Pro Product Key to Upgrade?  
<br />
<br />To Upgrade from Home to Pro if you have a Pro Digital license already on the PC,  copy and paste into Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key the Pro generic version key VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T to Upgrade to Pro, after which it should then activate when you go online.  
<br />
<br />For those without a Pro Digital License yet, this above not work after Version 1803, and you must go offline by choosing Airplane Mode from Action Center at right end of task bar, and then insert the Pro Version key.  After it changes version, go back online to activate with the retail Product Key.  
<br />
<br />If this is not your scenario then please explain further.  You can also Upgrade Home to Pro in the WIndows 10 Store as shown here:

    <title>Xbox Live enforcement investigation protocols are flawed and need some - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> avid atlas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live enforcement investigation protocols are flawed and need some serious reassessment</h2>
                    
<p>I had a player message me following a match in which he went around the map killing his own team. After being kicked for betrayals i started receiving several messages harassing&nbsp;me with lewd\and inappropriate messages verbally assaulting me I responded a
 total of 3 times with a single of those messages being a single word and question mark followed by a casual lol. Another match started up and&nbsp;through the entire match and the following match i was non stop spammed by this player after i informed him i had
 reported him, assuming maybe he would stop, but no avail it continued. I was then sent a message from xbox live stating that my account had been subject to "enforcement action". After reviewing an apparent email that was sent to me and being redirected to
 the "enforcement team" I was shocked to see that a 2 day ban had been placed on my entire account. For "engaging&nbsp;in inappropriate communications. This activity may include harassment, abusive language, hate speech, profanity, disruptive or offensive language,
 spamming, or other inappropriate uses of Xbox Live communications features." But wait that wasnt me?? I was the victim of said harassment?? Why was i being punished and deprived services for an act not at all of my own.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This "team" also has no way of contacting or disputing this issue because the ban was placed on the console itself. No offline play, no signing in on my phone to review that awesome snipe my buddy got last night in battlefield.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire system is flawed and I will include the entire text conversation between me and said player as it appears in my messages on xbox.com&nbsp;omitting any&nbsp;gamertags and fowl language, lets see what the community and the support team and hopefully someone
 a little higher up in the chain of command have to say about it, excuse the minor text commentary which will be notated by a simple (*)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now this conversation finally stopped and he apparently found someone else to yell&nbsp;and shriek at&nbsp;but that isn't even the point. I filed a report against a player who was clearly harassing me and the outcome of that report was that my account got banned.
 Now i'm not really sure the logic behind that, but i am pretty sure that's not intended. And I'm sorry Microsoft but you aren't Bethesda with the whole "Its not a bug, it's a feature," attitude, and upon further research this is a problem dating back till
 from what i have seen first hand 2015. This is your fan base, your customers, for all intensive purposes your clients, why is this still an issue. Now I'm not naive in thinking every single post made about a false flag ban is legitimate but there is no doubt
 in my mind that an abundance of false bans have been made. I'm am in that boat entirely here. Can we please do something about this because I for one don't appreciate paying for a service that is without a correct and functioning support outlet considering
 the time and money invested.&nbsp;There has got to be a better method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for your time and I bid you adue,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just a humble gamer</p>

            <p>I have this posted listed in the support thread as well I was given a response, short, and very obligatory but indeed a response I wont put names once again because I am not hear to put any one in an uncomfortable situation I'm all about the player base and ultimately the consumer. Here was his response "In situations like that, it's best to just file a complaint on the other person and block communications rather than respond. If you respond in a way that violates the code of conduct, which you did (Me: b****???? lol *(can we call confused playful banter on this one guys?), you can be punished.,"</p><p><br /></p><p>Now I'm afraid he's missing what the entire point of this post was, which is to Reassess the way the enforcement team conducts their "investigation". I am pulling this straight from the home page for the xbox enforcement team, again my statements on these tenants,&nbsp;if you will, will be noted with (*). Here is what their policy is...:</p><p><br /></p>What is the Policy and Enforc
<p>A team of Xbox Live professionals dedicated to the preservation and promotion of a safe, secure and enjoyable experience for all Live Platform and Community members. *(Alright guys I like the sound of that sounds smashing, so whats the catch?)</p>
Our Values
<i>Integrity</i>
<p>We are accountable for our actions; we must make consistent, unbiased decisions based on the best available evidence. *(Evidence would mean you had messages, video, voice recording or something OTHER than a report that popped up.)</p>
<i>Compassion</i>
<p>The policy is our guide. We must do what is right, not always just what is written. Context matters. *(Oh i agree 100% context does matter, and the constant reminder that your reputation score will be taken into account during an "investigation" must be a joke considering mine is 3/4ths of a bar and all green buddy, I tell hyou hwaht.)</p>
<i>Precision</i>
<p>With authority comes great responsibility; we must be precise in our investigations, documentation, reporting, and application of enforcement policy. *(Here is the big one that gets me now these are in my mind everyday people, like you or myself so they know right from wrong. I mean i would hope so, so during an investigation into an alleged report take mine for instance, where I was clearly the customer being harassed. How does an everyday person who takes pride in Integrity, Compassion, and&nbsp;Precision come to a conclusion that the person being spammed by a clearly hostile player is the one in the wrong?)</p>
<i>Team</i>
<p>Each individual is critical to our success. Each is trusted and empowered to do what is right. We learn from mistakes and always try to improve. We care deeply about our customer’s experiences on Xbox Live and are dedicated as a team to make it a safe and fun place to be! (Okay if that is truly the case then it is high time for some adjusting the way we communicate with your team and how we as a consumer "defend" ourselves. This is a problem and it needs to be addressed.)</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm a member of the preview program and take pride in having the ability to voice my opinions and suggestions&nbsp;, as a consumer, for future updates/games and other features coming to xbox. I'm taking the same approach when it comes to this topic here. This isn't about my ban getting lifted I work the next 2 days and its only a 2 day ban. What it is about though is finding a better way of communication and accountability with the people who step in and say "Okay you need a time out,"</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Not missing the point at all. There are a lot of people who get into the same sort of situation as you and post the same thing as you, but in the end, you are the only one to blame for your suspension.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p /><blockquote><p /><p><br /></p><i>Integrity</i>
<p>We are accountable for our actions; we must make consistent, unbiased decisions based on the best available evidence. *(Evidence would mean you had messages, video, voice recording or something OTHER than a report that popped up.)&nbsp;<u>The enforcement team has access to everything you do or say on Live. This is something you agreed to when you agreed to the terms of service. So they do investigate that evidence before issuing a ban.</u></p>
<i>Compassion</i>
<p>The policy is our guide. We must do what is right, not always just what is written. Context matters. *(Oh i agree 100% context does matter, and the constant reminder that your reputation score will be taken into account during an "investigation" must be a joke considering mine is 3/4ths of a bar and all green buddy, I tell hyou hwaht.) <u>Rep has nothing to do with suspensions.</u></p>
<i><br /></i><i>Precision</i>
<p>With authority comes great responsibility; we must be precise in our investigations, documentation, reporting, and application of enforcement policy. *(Here is the big one that gets me now these are in my mind everyday people, like you or myself so they know right from wrong. I mean i would hope so, so during an investigation into an alleged report take mine for instance, where I was clearly the customer being harassed. How does an everyday person who takes pride in Integrity, Compassion, and&nbsp;Precision come to a conclusion that the person being spammed by a clearly hostile player is the one in the wrong?)&nbsp;<u>Regardless of what the other person did, and nobody is saying he is right either, YOU&nbsp;responded in a way that violated the code of conduct.</u></p>
<p>Each individual is critical to our success. Each is trusted and empowered to do what is right. We learn from mistakes and always try to improve. We care deeply about our customer’s experiences on Xbox Live and are dedicated as a team to make it a safe and fun place to be! (Okay if that is truly the case then it is high time for some adjusting the way we communicate with your team and how we as a consumer "defend" ourselves. This is a problem and it needs to be addressed.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>In a situation like yours, you don't need to defend yourself. You clearly said something that was a violation. It would be a different situation if you did not respond to the other player and received a suspension.</u></p><p><br /></p><p>I'm a member of the preview program and take pride in having the ability to voice my opinions and suggestions&nbsp;, as a consumer, for future updates/games and other features coming to xbox. I'm taking the same approach when it comes to this topic here. This isn't about my ban getting lif
 </blockquote> <p>When you signed up for Live, you agreed to the code of conduct/terms of service. You are responsible for your actions.&nbsp;It doesn't matter what the other person did, you clearly violated the code when you responded.&nbsp; You are responsible for your actions. The enforcement team would have been investigating the report on you, not both of you. Since you used profanity, you got a punishment. It's that simple. The other guy most likely also received a suspension or will receive one as well.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>PA Bear:</p>
<p>The answers to second set of questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>September 28, 2015. </li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Staples Easy Tech Management stated that the computer was unrepairable.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It was locked up and would not even boot up. I went in to the Bios and changed it back to 8.0</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer booted and reverted back to win 8.0.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.0 is working fine. I did all the updates and install. That is why I give the date
</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">In February 21, 2015. I contacted Samsung. Purchased their “Samsung Signature Service” to get this
 resolved &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and upgraded to 8.1. During this period Feb. to Sept. Samsung Tech had me do a reset. Install all Win 8 updates &nbsp;(195) and Samsung SW update tools. Then with no luck I was told it needs to be taken to a reputable PC tech for &nbsp; &nbsp;fixing. In the
 small town I live Staples had to be my choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">3. The Easy Tech stated it was installed and working. I take it home and do the Windows updates for Win 8.1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Restart to finish the updates and the machine stalled for 30
 hours. I finally got Win 8 back and it is working fine &nbsp;now.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">4. In the uninstall Norton asks to remove all and I checked “yes remove all”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">5. Yes</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">6. Windows Defender will not run or open.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">7. Yes</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">8.&nbsp;<em> I have ran it today. It fixed some files. I will do updates and install.</em></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>1. In a reply dated September 22, 2015, you told me the last Reset was done on "September 28, 2015." Wanna try that again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You still can't enable (turn on) Windows Defender, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is AT&amp;T your DSL (or FIOS)&nbsp;internet provider&nbsp;<em>as well as </em>your mobile wireless&nbsp;provider or do you only have mobile wireless access to the internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has Windows 8.1 successfully installed yet?</p>

            <p>PA Bear:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excuse me for taking the ball in hand and try and fix what is wrong as you stated it might be the down fall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. YES</p>
<p>2. Correct</p>
<p>3. AT&amp;t is stand alone due to the SIM Card with a Phone Number</p>
<p>to access the internet through the tablet.</p>
<p>4. NO</p>
<p>I would need a schedule of events as what would be <strong>AFTER</strong> the 8.0 is reset.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Unless you live in the future, you couldn't have done a Reset three days from now so I'll ask you again:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>When did you do the last (most recent) Reset (e.g., February 27, 2015)?
</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2. You use a mobile wireless connection to the internet. Is the connection already configured as a metered internet connection? See
