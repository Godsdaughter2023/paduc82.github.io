<h2>            Windows 10 stuck on purple restarting screen</h2>
                    I tried to restart my laptop as a few applications were running slow but after 12+ hours it is still stuck on the purple restarting screen with rotating dots, after inactivity the screen will go into sleep mode, I have tried sitting here pressing a key
 when this happens but it's not completing the restart.

<h3> rwpg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Cortana on Windows Phone Search button &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>By having Cortana on the Windows Phone&nbsp;search button, you cannot put the phone in your pocket when on a call (or when the phone is not turned off) otherwise Cortana takes over doing stupid
 things and in some cases, hangs up the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm OK with Cortana, just not on the&nbsp; WinPhone search button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So how do I disable Cortana just on the Search button on the bottom of the phone (win10 phone)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is it an all or nothing disable of Cortana, in which case how do I&nbsp;totally disable&nbsp;Cortana
 on Win10 Phone?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Alternatively,&nbsp; I have to kill the search button by physically destroying the button.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a stupid solution but I'm getting to this point as&nbsp;Cortana has now made my phone a permanently
 hand-held device</span></p>

    <title>CPU Temperature is very High in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            CPU Temperature is very High in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Lenovo X220 notebook having Core i5 second generation processor and 4 GB ram. I was using Windows 7 and never checked CPU temperature but as soon as I updated to Windows 10 I noticed about temperature of my notebook. The notebook was becoming
 very hot on CPU side. The air was also so hot from CPU vent so I installed CPU temp monitor software and shocked that temperature was over 90 degrees centigrade despite I was using only web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I installed again Windows 7 and all things have become normal. I also see some post regarding the same issue but did not find satisfactory answer. I don't think to update the drivers is the solution. Something is in Windows 10 that is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hi Muhammad,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.<br />
<br />
This could be due to any third party software conflict. Hence, I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.&nbsp;
<br />
Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.

<br />
<em><strong>Note: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot "to reset computer as usual.&nbsp;</strong></em><br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website to <a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-x-series-laptops/thinkpad-x220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download the latest drivers </a>available for your device. Please install all the latest drivers including Graphics, Network, CD/DVD drive/Audio and BIOS drivers from the computer manufacturer's website and check.

<h2>            Warning 1909. Could Not Create Shortcut &#60;program name&#62;.lnk.  &#124;   Widows XP Professional 2002 Service Pack 3</h2>
                    <p><b>Warning 1909. Could Not Create Shortcut &lt;program name&gt;.lnk.&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; Widows XP Professional 2002 Service Pack 3</b><br />
<br />
The problem begun yesterday July 23, 2013 when updating a program I use everyday.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
During the installation of the updated program I received the following errors:<br />
<br />
<b>Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut &lt;program name&gt;.lnk.<br />
Verify that the destination folder exists and that you can access it.<br />
<br />
And also:<br />
<br />
Warning 1909 could not create shortcut license.lnk</b><br />
<br />
I clicked "OK" after each error code and the installation completed saying I had successfully installed the program.&nbsp; (Which is not true of course).
<br />
<br />
After the install the original desktop shortcut disappeared.&nbsp; I went to create one myself and discovered that the program did not install properly as there was no EXE file.<br />
<br />
I clicked repair from the Add or Remove Programs in Windows.&nbsp; This did not work.&nbsp; I uninstalled the program and reinstalled it.&nbsp; I got the same errors described above.&nbsp; I downloaded the program again thinking I may have had a bad download.&nbsp; Again I had the
 same problems.<br />
<br />
I also updated iTunes today as a test.&nbsp; When the option came to create a desktop shortcut I said yes to see if the shortcut problem was isolated to the program I tried to update yesterday.&nbsp; During the iTunes update I got the same error codes.&nbsp; I tried to create
 my own iTunes desktop shortcut from the EXE file and it did not create one that worked.&nbsp; I tested the iTunes program and it opened fine from the file folder using the EXE.<br />
<br />
<b>So I now know there is something wrong with my system and not the updated program I tried to install yesterday.</b>&nbsp;<b> HELP</b><br />
<br />
I also searched the Microsoft Help Pages and the Community for answers but nothing was written regarding my system and the errors.<br />
<br />
I tried the following to resolve the problem using Fix It Online.&nbsp; The program ran but could not help me.&nbsp; I clicked the link for additional help which suggested two more Fix It Online programs which I tried both.&nbsp; Same problem occurred.&nbsp; The programs were
 unable to resolve my issues.<br />
<br />
Yesterday, from reading advice for other Windows systems help, I read I should try SFC to scan for corrupt files.&nbsp; I tried to do this but I lost my Windows XP disc.&nbsp; Can't find it.&nbsp; I also downloaded and installed the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool
 and ran a complete system check.&nbsp; There were zero problems.&nbsp; Since I spent so much time on my pc already I also ran a defrag on all of drive C.<br />
<br />
At this point it's no longer about running my favorite program there is a serious problem if I can't download and install a program successfully with these errors.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate any help you can give.&nbsp; I am not a tech person so please address me in plain English with simple steps to follow.&nbsp; (LOL)<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Margaret<br />
<br />
<b>System:<br />
Windows XP Professional<br />
Version 2002 <br />
Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
Intel Pentium 4</b><br />
<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; I am the admin of this pc.&nbsp; So I don’t know why all of a sudden programs are not installing/updating correctly and I am getting the error code that a shortcut could not be created or verified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I also updated my Windows and IE 7, Adobe Flash Player and all other out of date programs to make sure all programs were up to date so my system is running at its best.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>While trying to resolve the updated program not only did I Uninstall the program but also removed all cached files for that program on my User Account and Drive C.&nbsp; Thinking I may have a corrupted User Account I created a new one with admin rights
 and tried installing the program and had the same errors.&nbsp; (I later deleted the new User Account.).</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Please help.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. before running above fix, you are not fully updated if you are only on IE 7, you should be at IE 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>please go to Microsoft updates, run an express scan and install ALL, then do a custom scan and install any rootkit updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. afterwards, run checkdisk, preferably from the recovery console, but you can run from within windows.:&nbsp; go to start, run, type in cmd and click ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in cmd type in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type y for yes and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type exit and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>restart pc, allow checkdisk to finish, percentages will fluctuate this is normal, when finished run again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. defrag pc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. test your downloads, ok now?&nbsp;&nbsp; if not then run the fix listed in step 1.</p>

Thanks Elizabeth for replying.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
'm so sad right now.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I updated IE to 8.&nbsp; First understand that IE7 had stopped working for me 2 months ago and I have yet to resolve the problem.&nbsp; Last Saturday I reinstalled IE7 and at least the browser opened for me even if the page didn't load.&nbsp;
 (No pages will load or other links work when typed into the browser).<br />
<br />
I just finished installing IE8 and it won't even open.&nbsp; Well it opens for a sec and closes. This is what IE7 was doing before I reinstalled it.<br />
<br />
Since IE stopped working I am forced to use Firefox as my browser and yes I have it set as my preferred browser.&nbsp; I am not sure if that should have made a difference or not during the installations of IE but thought I'd mention it.<br />
<br />
I tried going to Microsoft updates using Firefox but of course they won't allow me to do the updates because I am not on IE.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can help me with suggestions on fixing IE?&nbsp; I'm almost tempted to reinstall IE7.&nbsp; At least the browser stays open even if the page doesn't load.&nbsp; LOL&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'll hold off on my foolishness until I hear back from you&nbsp; :D<br />
<br />
Thanks so much!<br />
Margaret<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; Thanks also for keeping your explanation easy for my non-tech brain to understand.&nbsp; :D<br />

<p>The content linked at dougknox.com is not a singular "fix" that should be blindly used. &nbsp;Rather, by judiciously selecting one or more of the items posted, you may be able to resolve your issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had most of the same symptoms describedby Margaret (and I'm a fan of detailed write-up.)</p>
<p>My situation was that shortcuts (*.lnk files and even hypertext links in dialog boxes) would not launch when clicked. &nbsp;I could workaround with a right-click &gt; Open. &nbsp;This was resolved by using only the "linkfile_fix.reg" fix.</p>
<p>But there remains another annoying symptom. &nbsp;A new program installed, which creates a programs group folder in the Start menu -- normally. &nbsp;However, this issue leaves an "Empty" folder ... some of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g. the following Start Menu folders exist, but contain no *.lnk files within:</p>
<p>- Software995 &gt;&nbsp;<em>Empty</em></p>
<p>- Logitech &gt; Mouse and Keyboard &gt; <em>Empty</em></p>
<p>- Malwarebytes Anti-Malware &gt; Tools &gt;&nbsp;<em>Empty</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>But, by contrast, these folders are populated as expected:</p>
<p>- Avast &gt; AvastUI</p>
<p>- Logitech &gt; Logitech Unifying</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following error which I got after installing Win7 Upgrade Advisor seems to be an indication of the problem, whereas other programs I mentioned above, do not throw an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor<br />
----------------------------------<br />
Warning 1909. Could not create Shortcut Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor.lnk &nbsp;Verify that the destnation folder exists and that you can access it.<br />
----------------------------------<br />
OK<br />
----------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know if any of you has a suggestion on correcting this in WinXP SP3, expecially now that it's no longer supported by MS, but I'd love to hear from you if you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>what is the version of windows installer on your pc??</p>
<p>
</p><p>do the following to find out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>start, run, type in Msiexec , click ok a dialog box will open and it should be windows installer 4.5</p>
<p>
</p><p>============</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should also run checkdisk:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265/en-us</a></p>
<p>How to perform checkdisk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you do not have Recovery Console installed, then run from the start menu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to start, run, type in cmd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in cmd type in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type Y for yes and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type exit and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>restart pc, allow checkdisk to finish and run again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is a lengthy process depending on the size of your harddrive, the percentages will fluctuate, this is normal, you can view report in the event viewer.</p>
<p>go to start&gt;run&gt; and type in eventvwr.msc, click on the applications directory, and in the right hand panel choose winlogon.</p>

<h2>            intellimouse 2.0 model1007</h2>
                    I have been using a Microsoft wireless intellipoint 8.2 mouse on my computer for years&nbsp;along with a wireless elite keyboard. The other day I decided to try a new antivirus program, I switched from ad-adware to supposedly the top rated free antivirus program
 for 2016 panda free. Everything went fine uninstalled old antivirus installed new antivirus no problems. When I tried to use my wireless mouse nothing happens. Changed batteries,&nbsp;uninstalled intellipoint 8.2 and re-installed all went fine but still nothing,
 mouse will not move. Funny thing though the wireless keyboard works fine. I plugged a wired mouse into a usb port and that works as it should. I am by no means computer literate so any help a dummy can follow would be appreciated as I love the freedom of the
 wireless mouse.&nbsp; Thank You&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.S. I am running windows 7 ultimate 32 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><span><span><span>Hello John,</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per your well described issue posted, I understand that you are facing issues with your Microsoft Wireless intellipoint 8.2 mouse. It has stopped working after you have installed your new antivirus.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try to disable the antivirus and try to do clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Important Note:</em></strong><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Try Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more,
 follow the article below:</span></span></p>

    <title>sd card not detected in xp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanley.k  say:</h3>
<h2>            sd card not detected in xp</h2>
                    Hey,<br />
I experience the problem that is listed in<br />
Article ID: 921413 - Last Review: August 29, 2007 - Revision: 2.1<br />
A High Speed SD Secure Digital card does not work correctly in a Windows XP-based computer<br />
<br />
The card is at first detected, but it later becomes unavailable after eject and insert.<br />
I got the hotfix provided in it ( the same language selected) but it says I have service pack 3 which is newer than itself. So there is no update.<br />
Perhaps MS should check again this problem.<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hello Stanley K,</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Set the computer to clean boot state and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps from the link “<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a>”, to place the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Follow the step “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”, from the link, to place the
 computer to normal start.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Perform System File Check to fix the corrupted system files and then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link “<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows XP</a>”, to perform System

<p><b><span>Note: </span>

            I have checked all the methods suggested in 3 and all report that the xp service pack 3 installed is newer than their hotfixes. I think Microsoft should have tested it themselves. The card is a 8GB micro SDHC card.<br />
For the time being, I use Window 7 on another&nbsp; machine to do the work.<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Hello Loki13,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Once you find out who makes your video card, then go to their website and see if&nbsp;they have any updated drivers for Windows 7.<br />
Not sure why the DVD Maker worked once and not now.<br />
<br />
Have you added any programs or software to your system recently?<br />
<br />
Please reply back and we will be glad to assist you.<br />

<h3> jmone1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 Update 1 --&#62; LSI Driver &#61; Code 10</h2>
                    <p>Prior to the Update 1 for Win 8.1 there is was no issue with the "LSI Adatper, SAS2 2008 Falcon" driver. &nbsp;The device is a IBM M1015 cross flashed using the "IT Firmware" as LSI 9211-8i.<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Post
 the update the drive "Code 10"'s. &nbsp;You can Disable / Enable the driver in Windows Device Manager and it is then fine but on the next reboot it will "Code 10" again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>- Updated the MB BIOS to the latest version</p>
<p>- Updated the card to the latest LSI IT FW/BIOS &amp; Driver</p>
<p>- Uninstalled / Reinstalled in Safe mode</p>
<p>- ...even purchased a new PSU incase it was flaky&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I rollback to prior to Update 1 then it is fine.</p>
<p>If I reboot the PC it will Code 10, but many times it will load correctly if I do a Cold boot (power down, power up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>It's not the fault of your device, it's Windows 8.1 update. It is not compatible with not only this device but many devices have failed after installing the latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice would be to not install this update but wait for any confirmation from the manufacturer for any updated drivers which support this latest Windows misery.</p>

<p>Thanks - already tried this and the result is the same. &nbsp;I've tried:</p>
<p>- Uninstall &amp; Delete driver: then rescan (installs an earlier driver and is fine till the next reboot then Code 10)</p>
<p>- Uninstall &amp; Delete driver: then reboot (Win 8.1 installs the driver during the install and it is Code 10)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Code 10 error is generated in Device Manager in one of the following situations:
</p><ul>
<li>Device Manager can't start the device.</li><li>One of the drivers that the device needs does not start.</li><li>Device Manager has insufficient information to recognize the error that is bubbled up by the device driver.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> In this situation, the Code 10 error can be a very generic message that indicates some kind of unspecified driver or device problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can either try installing the native drivers in compatibility mode or you can c<span>ontact the hardware device vendor's technical support for further assistance.</span></p>

 message: "Something went wrong" "Give it another try. If this happens again, let us know by entering the code below at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate." So I've given it several attempts now to see if it would work but unfortunately that hasn't been
 the case. I've also typed in the code which appears below the message but no luck either. When purchased, I was given two codes one for UT Legends Pack and the other for the full game. The first code has worked with no problems but the 2nd code which is for
 the full game hasn't worked at all. I was wondering if anyone has came across this problem before in the past and if there's any chance I could work around this problem to make it work. As I've been tempted to just completely forg

<h2>            Monopoly Tycoon won&#39;t run on windows 7</h2>
                    I recently bought a new laptop running windows 7 and I can't get Monopoly Tycoon to run normally it will in safe mode but not fully I also went to find patches for it, Hasbro and the programmers who couldn't help.

            We had the same problem with a laptop running windows 7.&nbsp; However, it worked when I ran&nbsp;Monopoly Tycoon&nbsp;as administrator,&nbsp;in Windows 98 compatibility mode, and turned the music off in the Monopoly Tycoon game.&nbsp; On the very first Monopoly Tycoon screen,
 instead of pressing play, click configure and&nbsp;check the box for No&nbsp;Music.&nbsp; You'll still have sound, just no music, but the program works.&nbsp;&nbsp; We did also change the screen resolution to&nbsp;1024 x 768 x 32, and&nbsp;Texture Bit Depth to&nbsp;32 (rather than 16) (all also
 in the configure screen), but I don't think that made any difference other than enhancing the graphics. Hope&nbsp;you can get it to work.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 System Image Restore is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavillion laptop which came pre installed with Windows 8. I updated it to 8.1 and subsequently to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few days back windows 10 crashed and it took me a lot of search and try to bring it back to boot to OS.
</p>
<p>I have to rebuild BCD thorough command </p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">bootrec /rebuildBCD</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this my laptop is booting into win 10 and few things are working. But there is no sound, start button not working, windows update is not working and few other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily ( At least I thought before trying to reimage), I have created windows system image backup few months ago.
</p>
<p>I am trying to reimage my pc through it since last few days. But it is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I boot through System repair disc/ Windows 10 USB and try to reimage it says, Image is created on EFI and system is running on BIOS.</p>
<p>Conversely, when I get into recovery through EFI and try to reimage it ask for system repair disc and it is not created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am bad stuck here. I can't use my recovery media because it will throw me back to Win 8 and there is **** lot of updates after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Sachin</p>

            <p>Not knowing all that was done to get your system to boot, you may have ended up changing your boot configuration.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you&nbsp;are now using a MBR&nbsp;boot instead of a EFI boot, Windows 10 may no longer be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem is you are booting the recovery media as MBR for some reason instead of UEFI you might get that message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot the recovery media are you using the Boot Device menu and selecting&nbsp;the UEFI version of the install media?&nbsp; If you created the recovery media did you format the Flash Drive as FAT32?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you get us a snipping tool picture of your Disk Management window while booted into Win 10 and expand so we can read partition designations?</p>

    <title>Three things that made this game a bit less fun for me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadowwo1falpha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Three things that made this game a bit less fun for me &#42;spoilers&#42;</h2>
                    
<p>1.) The game is a free roam so I decided to explore a good bit and get to the quest part later, while exploring I just so happened to find the garage where the vault the main characters dad was. Explain to me how they didn't prepare for that possibility
 it ruined the story and it acted like my character already knew things that I missed because I accidentaly skipped half the game. Just to clarify I never made it to galaxy news radio, strait out of the vault with only one or two side quest complete I found
 the dad and missed most of the story and my character talked as if he knew all about project purity and the mad scientist guy and all of that stuff, major down fall.</p>
<p>2.) I stored all of my equipment in a house I found in minefeild never lost a thing, but I saw the loading screen that said my stuff could be stolen so I used the meagaton house. Turns out the lockers have a glitch where occasional items disapear, I thought
 maybee I just lost it somewhere but it happened over and over again and I know I ain't sloppy like that so I looked it up and it's a known glitch. Worst part is it only took rare items that I can never get back. So whats up with this? Unoficial hidding place
 equals items safe, oficial hidding place equals items gone? Seriously!?</p>
<p>3.) I find it increadibly dumb that my partner is a giant ogre monster that can obsorb massive amounts of radiation and yet when I ask him to&nbsp;go into the radiation&nbsp;filled chamber instead of me&nbsp;he says "No this is something you must do" No I don't! Get your
 big Oger butt in there and do it now! I mean I have no problem if the character dies but don't add an option for survival and then terminate it&nbsp;with stupidity.</p>
<p>Fallout was really fun but these things kind of bug me.</p>

<p>oh and while these didn't ruin the game I think some of the morality choices are out of wack for example after I got that freaking goul into tempany tower peacefully and then he kills everyone I should be alowed to kill him without getting evil points he's
 a murder he had it coming, I stuck him and his buddies heads to the walls with the rail road spike gun and didn't feel bad about it at all. Some evil characters you kill you get stuff from them and get bad points for that too, my vendettas are my vendettas
 the cannibles weapons are forfeit after I kill them. There needs to be a clearer line between scaving and stealing in future titles. But again this didn't ruin the game there are plenty of opportunities to raise your good image up I just found some of these
 a little weird.</p>

<p>1. most fallout games can have half of it's main story skip, just like fallout 1 &amp; 2 so this isn't some new info to fallout lore.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>2. it's a known glitch some people get lucky others don't, it's impossible to predict when this bug well appear.</p>

<p>1. You can skip around in any <em>Fallout </em>game, but easily doing so is supposed to require prior knowledge of the game (that is, if you're replaying the game and know where everything is and how everything plays out already) to reduce the chances of
 skipping around in the story by simply stumbling around.&nbsp; Not that this still can't happen (and it's an open world game, so it can certainly stem from random exploration), but the developers do try to hide it.&nbsp; Of course, if you do accidentally skip ahead,
 your character gains all this knowledge they should've have (as you said, which does ruin the story a bit), but it's not a big problem and some people actually like that kind of openness in a game<br />
<br />
2. <em>Fallout </em>has always been glitchy (as have RPGs and other games of this scale in general), so saving often and saving in multiple slots is always a good rule of thumb to live by.&nbsp; But glitches are variable (and Bethesda has patched the game up pretty
 well), so I wouldn't advise putting much weight into them.&nbsp; Doesn't mean it doesn't stink when it happens to you, but following that rule helps avoid this, and it shouldn't ruin the experience regardless.&nbsp; Also, no one is going to be stealing things from a
 house in the middle of a minefield<br />
<br />
3. The technical term is "super mutant" (although the ones in <em>Fallout 3</em> certainly resemble "giant ogre monsters" more than the super mutants in other games), but you're not the only one who found this stupid (not to mention you couldn't send the radiation-immune
 ghoul or robot follower in either).&nbsp; The whole ending was s***: it crept up on you without any real warning so many people save inside the Purifier thinking the game would continue, it lacked an essential and probably the most logical option of sending a radiation-immune
 follower in, and there was no ending slideshow showing the consequences of your choices and how they would affect the future of the wasteland like in every other
<em>Fallout </em>game.&nbsp; But unlike some other developers (*cough*Bioware*cough*), Bethesda actually realized they had dropped the ball with the ending and created
<em>Broken Steel</em> to fix some of the issues (which you can download for $10 if you want).&nbsp; It allowed to a post-game (which was devoid of any semblance of the consequences of even some of your choices, making it hollow, poorly done, and seemingly useless
 while stripping most of what you did of any importance), so even if you sacrifice yourself, you just wake up a few weeks later and continue on your merry way.&nbsp; And you can send several followers in, but then the game scolds you for not following your father
 and sending in a "true hero" instead.&nbsp; This was utter bulls***; not only did you probably save your follower a ton of times and do damn near everything yourself, but you made the LOGICAL CHOICE THAT ANYONE WITH F***ING COMMON SENSE WOULD'VE MADE and sent your
 RADIATION-IMMUNE follower to do this job so that no one has to get hurt.&nbsp; So even in adding in this choice, the game did it poorly by reprimanding me for being smart.&nbsp; And still no ending slideshow. Still,
<em>Broken Steel</em> at least somewhat fixes the ending (or tries; it certainly at least allows you to send your follower in, even if it handles it poorly), and maybe what it does will suffice for you<br />
<br />
4. <em>Fallout 3</em> f***ed up with the karma system, as it labeled things that shouldn't have been labeled and took away any moral ambiguity that might have been there, and it was too easily reversible so you could get around the consequences of your actions
 and didn't define you (or defined you for things it shouldn't have).&nbsp; That's why
<em>New Vegas</em> brought back the reputation system from <em>Fallout 2</em> so that you were treated based on your dealings with specific factions and didn't have to always worry about petty crimes like stealing (or looting off dead criminals) that overshadowed
 your good deeds (or have water bottle donations make people forget about your genocidal acts and call you a saint, which was the case in
<em>Fallout 3</em>).&nbsp; Plus, it meant you could decide what was "right" and "wrong," not the developer, and make it more morally grey by being about what you think is the best and worst rather than good or evil<br />
<br />
The Tenpenny Tower quest, on the other hand, illustrated the flaws in the karma system while being poorly designed, and you have every right to be pissed about it.&nbsp; Don't give me a diplomatic option, make me put in all the effort, and then just end up killing
 everyone anyway; that's not dark humor, that's making a quest choice completely pointless.&nbsp; I could've just killed everyone myself and then donated water bottles if I didn't want to lose karma, and it would've been the same result.&nbsp; And while do the ghouls
 end up killing all the residents if the only discriminatory ones are forced out and the rest say they're fine with ghouls?&nbsp; Hell, what's the point of asking any of the residents to talk to Tenpenny about the ghouls, as it doesn't play a role in any option
 of the quest?&nbsp; Would've been nice if having these people talk to Tenpenny meant leaving them alive when the violence started.&nbsp; Also, why can't I get the suite after the ghouls kill everyone in the hotel (or for helping Tenpenny sort out the ghoul issue)?&nbsp;
 Why is the suite only tied to one quest?&nbsp; Why do I get bad karma for killing the ghouls after they kill everyone in the hotel despite agreeing to a diplomatic solution (as you said), and why do I get bad karma for siding with Tenpenny if the ghouls are planning
 on killing all the human residents anyway?&nbsp; And why would I ever side with Tenpenny?&nbsp; He just gives you money, while the ghouls give you money AND an incredibly useful mask that makes feral ghouls non-hostile towards you.&nbsp; Yeah, real even choice, and any bad
 karma/regrets I might have could be easily undone by donating some water bottles, so there weren't even any real consequences to my actions (different inhabitants, sure, by the tower operates the same regardless, I have no idea what impact my decision has
 on the future, and everyone still considers me a saint so no one reacts to my actions).&nbsp; So yes, it was a poorly designed quest</p>

<p>Let me preface by saying that I do not like the Tenpenny Tower quest.<br />
<br />
It's the one quest I typically always complete in the evil fashion, which is to say, killing Roy Phillips and his followers.
<br />
<br />
Saying that though...I have to admire the fact that this is one story that you cannot resolve in any satisfactory manner. No matter what you do, people are going to die. That hit me like a rock the first time and I am loathe to even go to the tower in current
 playthroughs. I'm not saying the story is deep or dark or even well-written, but the simple matter of not being able to resolve it peacefully, I felt, was a needed shock given how many games give you that chance.</p>

<p>[/quote]See, I wouldn't mind that being the case if it didn't give me the option to try and if the quest wasn't labeled with karma.&nbsp; If it was just kill the ghouls or kill Tenpenny...well, I'd probably complain that there wasn't a diplomatic option knowing
 me, but at least it wouldn't be misleading</p>

<p>I didn't feel it was misleading. It was essentially, take Phillips at his word that bad things were going to happen to the Tenpenny residents, and kill him. There are one or two lines spoken by both him and one of his subordinates that pretty much spell
 this out even if you say you can convince the humans to let them in.</p>
<p>Or, have faith that getting the residents in there will win hearts, and find out that isn't the case.</p>
<p>In any event, I'm not really happy with the Karma system in either game, so that little bit I'm not going to bother defending.

<p>You see I didn't hate that Roy Phillips killed everyone, I thought it was a cool twist, I just thing he should officially be considered a bad guy after that. As for what you said about the #2 Maul Yoda I do have more than one file slot the problem was I
 didn't know when they disapeared so I was saving after they were gone and didn't know it, I understand games like this have a lot of glitches beleive me, I still love both Mercenaries games and they were loaded with them. The locker glitch is the only one
 I beleive is unforgivable other than that I understand the rest. As far as what you said about openness yeah I actually thought It was cool I found the dad that quick with no prior knowledge (lets get that strait for anyone doubting I was looking for items
 when I just so happened to find the secret entrance) but I didn't like the part where my character instantly knows stuff he shouldn't which I understand would be dificult for the game designers to program in but maybe they could have locked a door or something
 till I completed a few quests? I don't know. I just got live about two months ago and I loned Fallout to my cousin so I havent checked their patching jobs or DLC although a friend told me a little about it but I think he screwed up a few details (he said your
 stuck in a slaver camp with no way out at all.) And as for me calling it an ogre monster it's been so long since I played it I forgot what he was called (I remember ghouls, raiders, mirelurks, but forgot what he was.) But yeah I don't think Fallout 3 is total
 crap, I'm just saying these things kind of made me a little less interested. (espesialy the locker glitch the biggest of my grievences). While I'm on the subject is Fallout New Vegas as good/any better? I watched a review that compared it to Fallout 3 DLC,
 which isn't that bad to me concidering Fallout 3 was pretty good.</p>

<p>[/quote]I remember in <em>Fallout 2</em>, you could have your character bypass the entire story and go straight to San Francisco.&nbsp; And all of a sudden, your village had been kidnapped by the Enclave (which you knew all about) and you had to go save them...and
 then you could walk back to Arroyo and they were still fine.&nbsp; So I guess my point is, when you allow skipping around in the plot, you're going to find holes like that.&nbsp; Thing is,
<em>Fallout 3</em> could've avoided that if, as you said, Vault 112 was locked (which it should be).&nbsp; Also, there's a DLC called
<em>The Pitt</em> for <em>Fallout 3</em> where you are stuck in a slaver camp; I assume that's the one he's talking about.&nbsp; And no, the super mutants in
<em>Fallout 3</em> are ogre monsters, I wasn't criticizing you on that.&nbsp; They look NOTHING like the super mutants in the other games<br />
<br />
As for <em>New Vegas</em>, I know Kimieva has a different opinion than I do on this, but I think it's much, MUCH better than
<em>Fallout 3.&nbsp; </em>It's a deeper RPG, it's better written, the story is less linear, and above all, it's an authentic
<em>Fallout </em>experience, which <em>Fallout 3</em> is not.&nbsp; So yeah, I'd check it out</p>

<p>Yeah I'd never played privious Fallout titles so I didn't know skipping around the plot was a common part of the game. I personaly don't like it and think it's unintentional but thats just my opinion. Non linear isn't a problem to me I just hate that my
 character magicaly gained knowledge he shouldn't have had, I mean if he had whent into the Vault 112 and started asking his dad about project purity instead of telling him all about it and acting as though he had already read those disks (I found them later)
 it wouldn't bother me. As I said though the locker glitch to me is the most unforgivable I mean my items were safe in the mine feild house but the loading screens and my friends all said no no someone will still them you need either a meagaton house or tempany
 tower house, and one of those "safe" houses ate my one of a kind specialty items. Is the slave camp you talked about inexabable? My friend said it was I told him there was no way. Thanks for talking with me everyone.</p>

<p>[/quote]I mean, I don't want to say it's common (and it was in <em>Fallout 2</em> more than
<em>Fallout 1</em>) and you're certainly not supposed to, but the possibility is there and it shortens the game, which is nice for people who replay the game and already know how the story unfolds and want to skip the slower beginning parts.&nbsp; Like we're both
 saying though, you then run into problems with the dialogue since it's pre-written and indeterminate of what else you've done in the plot.&nbsp; That is, your character know what Project Purity is even if you don't because you skipped around in the plot.&nbsp; Of course,
 you're not supposed to skip around so the game expects you to know by the time you find your dad and is written as such.&nbsp; But if you're going to give people the option to skip around, then you should write some dialogue for if they do skip around so there
 aren't any unintentional plotholes (i.e. if you find your dad early on, you don't know what Project Purity is).&nbsp; Or you can just write a plot that allows you to skip some stuff without any unintentional plotholes because you're only skipping some background
 and context stuff rather than important info (which I believe <em>New Vegas</em> did).&nbsp; But at least in
<em>Fallout 2</em>, they made it hard to get to San Francisco right at the start, and therefore, hard to skip to the end (it was way out of the way and guarded by a ton of difficult enemies that your low-level character was no match for).&nbsp; And hey, if you're
 doing simple exploring, it's not like they're going to block off the entire city (especially because you can go to San Francisco early without spoiling much of the plot).&nbsp; But for
<em>Fallout 3</em>, just lock the damn vault door that should be locked to begin with and make the character go through the plot to get the passcode.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; Hell, they did it with the Citadel, so why not here.&nbsp; And you could still explore that garage
 without ruining everything (or skip around in the plot by going to Rivet City straight away instead of Megaton, which would be better).&nbsp; But nope, Vault 112 is open<br />
<br />
As far as glitches go, they're unfortunate, but they're such a variable part of the game and on a case-by-case basis (I had no problems with my Megaton house or Tenpenny suite) that you should look past them if you enjoy the rest of the game.&nbsp; This is especially
 true if they're just some minor glitch, which losing items isn't, but it's not as bad as something like an unfinished quest in my opinion (which there was in the vanilla version of the game and has since been patched).&nbsp; But whatever, you're allowed to be mad
 about it.&nbsp; And as for storing your stuff in random containers, they might get stolen if you store them in a place with people, but not in an isolated minefield.&nbsp; I think the Fallout wiki lists it as a safe place to store stuff, but you can double check me
 on that (<a href="http://www.falloutwiki.com/Fallout_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">falloutwiki.com</a>)<br />
<br />
As for the slaver camp, once you enter it and start the main quest of the DLC, you have to finish it before you can leave (it's so that you only have limited supplies since you can't just go back to D.C. and restock in the middle of
<em>The Pitt</em>, which adds some challenge).&nbsp; After it's complete though, you can come and go as you please</p>

<h2>            Imap folders in Livemail - showing for one account, not for another</h2>
                    <p>I have just started using Live Mail and I have set up two accounts - as far as I can see these are identical in every way.&nbsp; However, under the Inbox on&nbsp;one&nbsp;there are subfolders for drafts, sent, spam and trash; under the other this is not the case even though
 there are messages there.&nbsp; I have found numerous posts on the web relating to this issue but nothing seems to move me forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to "show / hide IMAP folders" the listings for the two accounts are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the first account&nbsp;the listings under "all" and "visible" both show all folders and against each folder there is a little yellow icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the second account the two listings are different - all the folders are shown under "all" but only the inbox is shown under "visible".&nbsp; The yellow icon is missing too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something short of deleting the offending account that I can do to make these show?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>What is the reason for setting up two identical accounts? This is bound to cause problems as they vie for attention. It may also be the source of the difficulties you're facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every IMAP server has its idiosyncrasies, so there can be no universal set-up instructions.&nbsp;Since you didn't tell us who the email service provider is, we can't say where the fault lies. However, here are some general guidelines that&nbsp;might help.
<span>These are suggestions only - you may find on experimentation that different settings work better for you:</span><span><em>&nbsp;</em></span><span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reset the list of IMAP folders:<br />
</strong>Click on the account name in the folder pane and then press Alt-S F to open the
<em>Show/hide IMAP folders</em> dialogue. Click <em>Reset List</em> to refresh the folder list, then use the buttons to show only the folders you want to see. Note the exact names of the 'special' folders.</li><li><strong>Map the local special folders to the IMAP folders on the server: </strong>
<br />
Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>.
<br />
On the IMAP tab, select <em>Store special folders on IMAP server,&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;then enter the server's names for the special folders in the boxes. If the folder for sent messages at the server is called
<em>Sent</em>, then enter <em>Sent </em>into the box alongside <em>Sent Items path
</em>and so on. You may have to provide a <em>Root folder path,</em> but we can't tell what this should be without knowing the name of the IMAP server.<br />
</li><li><strong>Make </strong><em><strong>Deleted items </strong></em><strong>folders work the same way for all accounts:<br />
</strong>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. <br />
On the <em>Advanced</em> tab, select <em>Use the 'Deleted Items' folder for IMAP accounts</em>.</li></ol>
