<h2>            MW3 Xbox One problem retrieving profile </h2>
                    <p>Hey all. Come across an incredibly annoying problem with trying to play multiplayer on MW3 on an Xbox One&nbsp;now it’s backwards compatible. it asks you to sign in, then to download a profile, then asks you to sign in with the Microsoft account. Then gives you 2 error screens both having error code&nbsp;80070428, one says there’s a problem please try again later, the other then says there’s a problem with my credentials. There isn’t, the email and password are correct.</p><p><br /></p><p>Going through all the solutions to the error code on Microsoft’s website, network checking etc, nothing has solved it. Driving me insane now.</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyone come across this and solved it?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Laptop freezes after replacing hard drive</h2>
                    I am REALLY frustrated with my laptop. It is a Vista x64 Home Premium (Toshiba, Model NO: L305-S5912). I JUST got a new replacement hard-drive after this problem happened to me. Now this problem is happening yet AGAIN, FOR THE 7TH TIME. I'll describe this
 stupid, annoying problem now. At first, I had a Black screen of death. I tried to restore it, but it didn't work, and SOMEHOW, I ended up getting a Blue Screen of Death. After this, I replaced my hard-drive. It worked for about 2 MONTHS. And now, it's happening
 all over again. My laptop kept freezing, and I kept restarting it. Then, I tried safemode. Safe mode worked for AWHILE, and then it froze. So, I turned off the power and turned it back on. I tried to run my laptop in "normal mode", but it still kept freezing.
 And now, I have a Black Screen of Death. My laptop isn't even 2 YEARS OLD YET, and this is about the 7th time this has happened to me. I JUST replaced my hard-drive and everything, and it's just happening all over again. I

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I play my own music&#63;</h2>
                    When I upgraded to Windows 10 and started using the Groove music player, I started to get messages that I wasn't allowed to play my music. I changed the default player back to Windows Media Player, but I am still getting the same message and something
 about "Media Usage Rights Acquisition." and Xbox. My music is on my computer; I don't own an Xbox. And I would like to know what the hell is going on and why I'm being denied the right to play music that I own!!!&nbsp; How do I solve this problem? It's driving
 me nuts that I can't listen to my own music.

Hi, <br />
<br />
When I ran the troubleshooter, it said it didn't find any problems. I have the latest version of Windows Media Player. As for Windows Essentials, my apps listing says it is unavailable. I did look at Windows Essentials online, and it seems to have more with
 making movies and photo files, which is something I don't do or use. I'm not sure what I can else I can do. I did a screen capture of the error message I am getting. I'm in the US, so changing the country won't help. And I don't know what this problem has
 to do with Xbox because I don't own one. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
Dorothy

<p>Again, this is music I already own, and have owned for years, and until I downloaded Windows 10 I have never had any problem playing my music. I wish Microsoft would do something to solve this problem.

            <p>I'm having the same problems, I upgraded my laptop with W7, working great at the time to W10. And when I did, I been having nothing but trouble with it. I can't play my music, watch movies that I downloaded on it, so I can watch them over the road when I'm
 away from the house. I done checked everything I know to check. Now its to the point where I run the troubleshooter, it evens sorry dude, I got the day off from this thing. Now I'm regretting switching from W7 to W10. Something has to give.

Revo Uninstaller helps you to uninstall software and remove unwanted programs installed on your computer even if you have problems uninstalling and cannot uninstall them from "Windows Add or Remove Programs" control panel applet.<br />
<br />
Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!<br />
<br />
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry
 keys that are usually left over on your computer. Even if you have a broken installation, Revo Uninstaller scans for an application's data on your hard disk drives and in the Windows registry and shows all found files, folders and registry keys so you can
 delete them. <br />
<br />
With its unique "Hunter mode", Revo Uninstaller offers you some simple, easy to use, but effective and powerful methods for uninstalling software. You can use it to manage your installed and/or running software programs.

    <title>Can&#39;t record from USB audio interface - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spkrsnotworkn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t record from USB audio interface</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 and I’m trying to record using my USB audio interface. Problem is, since I upgraded it will not record from my USB interface, instead it records from my laptop’s internal microphone. I have been able to get the USB
 interface to playback by setting it as my default speakers and changing the setting to “DVD quality” however that only works for playback and the recording still doesn’t work. When I open the “Sound” app it shows no green bars under record, yet continues to
 show green bars for my internal mic. At my wit’s end here as I need this to work asap! Help would be appreciated.

            Hi BowAndYarrow 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM Windows 7 licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />If that is a retail licence, your best option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 - please have your Windows 7 product key at hand (that should be printed on a sticker on the casing of your PC)

    <title>Disable Photo Auto Rotate Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claudiobluer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Photo Auto Rotate Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason windows 10 is auto rotating all of my pictures, leaving some shots in landscape view and rotating others vertically. I must find a way to disable this feature. I'm using Windows 10 on a business computer and we draft reports using photos
 that must all be in horitonzal view which would be incredibly tiresome to manually set for every single picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked all over for answers but since windows 10 is so new, I can't seem to find a compatible solution. Does anyone know how to disable the photo auto rotate feature???
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions for Windows 7 or 8/8.1 will not work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh_Rai,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually doesn't matter what program we are using, as the photos are still auto-rotated when vied within the file folder. I have noticed that disabling the auto-rotation when viewing the photos directly in Windows Live Photo Gallery, stops the rotation
 but this does not transfer over to the file folder. We have tried the Windows Photo Viewer, Picasa, and Live Gallery and the photos are still auto rotated in the desktop folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the computer, we are using Windows 10 on 3 different pcs, 2 Lenovo desktops and 1 acer laptop and all 3 are experiencing the auto rotate issue. I have also done some research on this and have noticed that others have struggled with this issue in Windows
 8 and 8.1, without a solution. Is this feature written into the software? And is there anyway at all to disable it other than manually for each individual photo?

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding! Unfortunately there is no&nbsp;<strong>Allow the screen to Auto-rotate
</strong>box to check or uncheck in&nbsp;<strong>Personalize</strong>, this is true for all 3 computers operating windows 10. I performed the steps just as you wrote: Right clicked on empty space on Desktop and clicked
<strong>Personalize.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I looked all through it but no where do I see this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again, I do appreciate your help!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Claudio,</span></p>
<p><span>I am having the same problem after recently upgrading to Win10. Luckily I don't have that many photos so I will be manually modifying the photos so they have the correct orientation. From what I can deduce, the problem stems from&nbsp;Windows respecting
 the properties in the file itself. In some of my photos it shows the dimensions 2592x1936 (WxH) for photos in landscape, while the reverse for portrait (1936x2592). Using option 1 below&nbsp;reverses these numbers.
</span><span>So rightly or wrongly that's what it appears to be&nbsp;doing.</span></p>
<p><span>I have two options you could try:</span></p>
<p><span>(1) <strong>Using the Rotate Left and Rotate Right in </strong><strong>Windows Explorer:
</strong>There are two&nbsp;rotation options: Rotate Left and Rotate Right&nbsp;on the Manage tab in Windows Explorer. You can use either function on multiple photos at once by holding down the Ctrl key and selecting all photos that need to be rotated in the same direction
 (e.g. all need to rotate left) with the left mouse button. After selecting all the photos, click the Rotate left (or right) button to modify all photos at once.</span></p>
<p><span>Now from your response, you didn't seem too keen on the idea of modifying photos manually. So... on to option 2.</span></p>
<p><span>(2) <strong>Use Third-Party Apps Like JPEG ExiF AutoRotate: </strong>Depending on what metadata is stored in your photos, you might want to try JPEG-EXIF Autorotate to do the entire folder automatically. It uses the Exposure Program property in each
 file to determine the rotation. </span></p>
<p><span>Right-click on a photo and select <em>Properties. </em>Then select the <em>
Details </em>tab<em>. </em>Scroll down to the<em> Advanced Photo </em>section and look for
<em>Exposure Program. </em>Hopefully it says Portrait or Landscape on yours. For mine they all showed Normal. So I am out of luck here.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a link to how it works:</span></p>

            <p>Hello Claudio</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if you finally got a solution to the problem. If you do can you share with me as I have exactly the same problem you were facing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am transferring photos from my iPhone to my PC but it seems that Win10 automatically rotate the photos into the correct orientation. But when I copy the photos from PC to other devices, it doesn't seem to have the correct orientation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate if you or other experts seeing this could share a solution to deactivate the auto-rotation feature in files explorer in Win10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ricky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your&nbsp;query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a feature, instead this is how File Explorer saves your pictures. When you transfer a picture from&nbsp;a device to the system,&nbsp;some&nbsp;pictures may rotate. You have to manually rotate these files using either the
<strong>Photos App</strong>&nbsp;which is pre-installed in Windows 10 or&nbsp;<strong>Photo gallery</strong> which comes&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<strong>Windows Essential
</strong>package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;may post this query on the Feedback app. Your feedback is&nbsp;important to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand I have to manually rotate the photos myself. &nbsp;But the issue is that all the photos are automatically displayed in the correct orientation in the file explorer of Windows 10. &nbsp;As such, I can't see which photos need to be rotated! &nbsp;I guess that's
 why&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Claudio</span>&nbsp;asked if there is a way to disable the auto-rotate function in Windows 10, so that users could see the photos in their underlying orientation and choose to manually
 rotate their orientation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate if you could advise a solution.</p>

            This worked for me: Try opening with Windows Live Photo Gallery. Images are shown in their correct orientation. Edit accordingly. Good luck. (If Bill Gates is listening, not all 3rd party applications accept the auto rotated image so causes a lot of grief
 uploading and then deleting and remembering which way round to rotate to upload again. Zoopla for example.

            This is driving me batcrap&nbsp;crazy. I work with a lot of pictures. I just want them to display normally in the directories like they did in Win7. I shouldn't have to do any editing or manual rotating. Overall, I really like win10, but this is ridiculous.
 Please just give me some box to check or uncheck. Thank you.

<p>Hey there Trenton26, </p>
<p>Sorry to hear you are experiencing difficulties signing into Live with backwards compatible games! Please do the following: Go to Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; System &gt; Console Info &amp; Updates &gt; Restore. This is a Factory Restore. There is now an option that
 will allow you to keep everything installed except profiles, etc. Games and Apps will be unaffected as long as you select "Keep My Games and Apps" before starting the restore. Try this out and let me know how it goes!</p>

            So&nbsp; far, no dice .I am getting the same error.&nbsp; Followed instructions but did have problems with step 10c. The initial pop-up should be dismissed and then Fix-It 50202 run twice. Once in default mode and then again in aggressive mode. Should I reboot each
 time Fix-It 50202 is run? The instructions only mention one reboot but the program demands a reboot each time it is run (default and aggressive). If I have to do it all again, do the registry backups need to be restored again?<br />

<h2>            How to change file icon sizes for Windows 8.1 everywhere&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using a 15.6" laptop with a touchscreen monitor and Windows 8.1 installed. Each folder on my hard drive contains file different icon sizes, for example:&nbsp; small icons, list view, detailed view, etc. and I want to change all my icon sizes to medium.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know if there was a simple way to "globally" change the size of all my icons, and maybe their default size as well? I know how to change the size of my file icons for individual folders, but this would be tedious and impractical process to perform
 for every single folder on my hard drive.</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place and I will try my best to assist you with this query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To apply a specific folder view to all the folders that have been optimized with the same folder template, please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Navigate to the folder that you want to apply its folder views to all the folders on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(In this case, you may go to the location, for example: “<strong><em>C:\Users\</em></strong>” and change the folder view to “<strong><em>Medium Icons</em></strong>” for all the folders in that location
 as you need to have the “<strong><em>Medium Icons</em></strong>” for all the folder on the computer.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b) Now, click on the “<strong><em>View</em></strong>” tab from that folder and click on “<strong><em>Options</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) This will open the “<strong><em>Folder Options</em></strong>” window,</span></p>
<p><span>d) On this window, click on “<strong><em>View</em></strong>” tab and then click on the “<strong><em>Apply to Folders</em></strong>” button under the section “<strong><em>Folders view</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on “<strong><em>Apply</em></strong>” and then “<strong><em>OK</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Now, check if you have the “<strong><em>Medium Icons</em></strong>” view for all the folders in different locations on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this resolves the issue. If you need any further assistance with Windows Operating System, please post your query on Microsoft Community Forums and we’ll
 be glad to assist you with it.</span>

<p><strong>Hard Disk Test Failed Error: read failure also.</strong></p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciate&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 ignores .wr2 raw images</h2>
                    The import photos and videos ignores .WR2 raw images in the format used by some Panasonic cameras. However, it will happily delete them if you forget this fact, and check the checkbox to clear the images.<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this?

<h2>            How to retrieve the original windows 8 product key after I accidentally changed it&#63;</h2>
                    Hello guys,
<div>&nbsp; Something really bad happened to my laptop and I fail to solve the problem. Therefore, I am here posting this problem in order to gain helps from you smart guys. Last week a friend of mine borrowed my laptop for 3 days while I was working. When he returned
 it to me, he said that he accidentally changed the product key of my windows and he couldn't get it back. I have been trying to work on that ever since. Finally, I decide that I need some extra help after the&nbsp;future shop(where I purchased the laptop) fail
 to come up with a promising solution. I know there are lot of guys here are really smart and pro on computer problems, so maybe you can help me with this problem. It is an ASUS K75DE model laptop with windows 8 pre-installed in it. I just want to know if there
 is a way for me to get the original product key of the windows that is pre-installed in the laptop.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am looking forward to hear from you guys,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Paul Liang</div>

<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your only option is to restore the computer to its original factory state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
</font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>

<h2>            Not received my XBOX ONE.. Please can the forum help&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Good Day... I am at my wits end, so I am trying here. &nbsp;I ordered the Xbox One in August from microsoft store... so that I would receive the day one edition. &nbsp;Didn't get it on the 22nd of NOV. &nbsp;So I called.. the guy asked me to just give it a day...... STOP
 IF YOU HAVE HEARD THIS ONE..... any ways.. I noticed they did with drawl the money from my paypal account and that they created a shipping label. &nbsp;So I gave it a few more days... 26 Nov, tried the chat service. &nbsp;They guy on the other end, Jason, said there
 was an issue, and "it will be sent to UPS in 6 minutes" &nbsp;So I was ok with that.. no issue if i get it right.... WELL... nothing.. finally on the 1st of December I call to ask again, and I am told that she could see that there was no movement on my shipping
 and that she would be escalating my case to tier 3 support. &nbsp;So that got me off the phone.... and asked to wait 24 - 72 hours. &nbsp;Waited tell the 4th.. called and asked to wait for 24 hours... called the 5th asked again to wait 24 hours... 6th.. and now today..
 the same thing.... Its not been a week that I have given them time to help... No xbox.. no cash.. What else can I do.... Can anyone here help... I have order number, reference number and everything if that can help.. PLEASE&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tell them you can furnish proof that the money was withdrawn (should be simple enough through PayPal), and tell them you need to know where your console is or you're filing a fraud report. They have your money and have a responsibility to provide you details
 on your purchase in a timely fashion. Usually the words "fraud" or "Better Business Bureau" will get a customer service representative to realize you mean business and will motivate them to resolve your issue. Also, ask them for a full employee name and employee
 ID number. Indicate that it is for your records since previous representatives have been unable to resolve the issue and you would like a point of reference for any potential future contacts.

<p>Thank you all for your help, The shipping label has been created, but UPS states they have not received the item yet.. Cause if it was, it would have been moved from created to in transit.. And honestly.. Being in Alaska, I understand the winter storms issue..
 but it was supposed to be here well before the storm was even around. &nbsp;I did finally get an email today... just to tell me that HE can't help.. and he "contacted our fulfillment department to investigate. " so yet again....... STUCK.. thanks again.. :)</p>

<p>If the product is being delayed by a snow storm, then that should be communicated to him. Making various promises to him about getting the package on a certain date, or telling him to wait for a call that will never come could be considered fraud when they
 have already taken his money, and, by the sounds of it, over a week has passed without receiving a tangible update from the company. If I were to make a purchase on eBay or Amazon and received this kind of runaround from the seller after my payment cleared,
 you can guarantee I would be busting out allegations of fraud. Microsoft should not get cut a break because it is a large business. They have entered into an agreement with the buyer to provide a product or service, and not fulfilling that product or service
 in the specified time frame or without reasonable updates could be construed as fraudulent behavior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where exactly has the fraud occurred?&nbsp; MS took the money, have not provided the X1 yet due to unforeseen issues on there end. The OP will get his console, 100% guarantee that. So they didn't provide it by the time promised....&nbsp; well think of all the games
 that get held back, where people pre-order....&nbsp; there should be thousands of fraud cases then......</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On a side note, I ordered mine from MS on Nov 22, received Dec 7..... luck of the draw.</p>

<p>Where exactly has the fraud occurred?&nbsp; MS took the money, have not provided the X1 yet due to unforeseen issues on there end. The OP will get his console, 100% guarantee that. So they didn't provide it by the time promised....&nbsp; well think of all the games
 that get held back, where people pre-order....&nbsp; there should be thousands of fraud cases then......</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>On a side note, I ordered mine from MS on Nov 22, received Dec 7..... luck of the draw.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>The fraud has occurred by not providing the promised product or service in the given time frame. Per Microsoft's terms of sale, a product will not be charged until it is shipped. Therefore, the item should have shipped already. If the item was to ship from
 a location affected by adverse weather, then it is simple enough to tell him that the shipping was delayed by the weather - this status update is acceptable.
<br />
<br />
However, providing no status updates or refusing customer service when the buyer has upheld their end of the sale, but the seller has not, is tantamount to fraud. It indicates that they have no concern about delivering the promised product after already receiving
 the money from the customer, and implies that they do not intend deliver on the product as promised. Keep in mind, if the OP is being honest (and I have no reason to believe he is not being honest), then he has been waiting for weeks for a status update on
 his order. Per Microsoft's store, Day One editions were to be available on the release date of 11/22/2013. It boils down to the seller being responsible for the sold item until the item reaches the hands of the buyer. They accept responsibility for a good-faith
 effort to ensure delivery of the product once they are in possession of the buyer's funds. Moreover, if it is a problem with the shipping company, then it is the responsibility of the seller to initiate a lost/stolen package claim with the shipper, which will
 place a trace on the package, which must be located in a certain amount of time before the shipper assumes liability for losing the package.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the package was never sent to the shipper, then this certainly constitutes fraud, as the Microsoft Store Terms of Use states that an order will not be charged until it is shipped. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks again to everyone... believe &nbsp;me I am tired of hearing the ''give us 24 hours''. &nbsp;Just to update, I have now been assigned a person, Justin, who I am able to call and get directly. &nbsp;Sadly, all he has been able to do, is send my info to another department
 to confirm that it hasn't shipped..... (NOT LIKE I HAVENT BEEN CALLING FOR 18 DAYS SAYING THAT, but I guess there are people out there that would get it.. and call for 18 days to cheat them) Supposedly he is to give me an answer no later then Wednesday. &nbsp;So
 hopefully they will be shipping it to me and have it for the weekend. &nbsp;But all the complaining, and aggravation, they did offer me a $50 coupon for Microsoft store. &nbsp;Thanks again for the support... WHEN/IF I do get my Xbox one... will be using the forum for
 questions... Thank you :-)</p>

<h2>            I keep having dpc watchdog violation BSOD, is it related to event 153&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I left my laptop downloading Path of Exile thru Steam and when I came back to check its progress, it is already on bsod (dpc watchdog violation) screen. While on this screen, I noticed the internal gpu fan (laptop has two gpu's in SLI: one is internal and
 the other is removable) is blowing hard, like it's overheating (I'm not sure if that's the case).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting for several minutes, it went to a black screen with blue box saying "EFI Network 0 for IPv4 (28-D2-44-2d-95-FD) boot failed" and after pressing "OK", it then went to the same screen with "EFI Network 0
 for IPv6 (28-D2-44-2d-95-FD) boot failed" and pressed "OK" again. It then went to "Default Boot Device Missing or Boot Failed. Insert Recovery Media and Hit any key Then Select 'Boot manager to choose a new Boot Device
 or to Boot Recovery Media" and went to the Boot Manager screen, where I choose 1 of the options and it went to a screen saying "No bootable device -- Please restart system. I then pressed the power button to turn the laptop off and turned it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing seems unusual when its booting and startup was normal. I then checked event viewer and saw tons of event id 153 (like a hundred of them, I think). I have 1,515 total of this event 153 since I got this laptop from Amazon 3-4 months ago. I've been
 having this dpc watchdog violation bsod randomly (I think) since I had this laptop, maybe I was getting this&nbsp;bsod&nbsp;for like 6-7 times including this one today. If there's something I noticed before the screen goes to the bsod screen is that I'm either downloading
 from Steam or after playing a game on Steam (last time, if I remember it right, I played Tomb Raider before the bsod and it happened after I turned the laptop back on).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were also two instances, where it would freeze up on boot (where those dots spinning in circles) and I would need to shut it down using the power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I ran chkdsk /f /v /r /b and sfc /scannow, nothing seems unusual. But then, I downloaded Defraggler to&nbsp;check SMART info and this is what I have:
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4998d5bd-aeed-444b-8d54-550d53bfd3ba" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried driver verifier, but I only ran it for like 10-20 minutes before I restarted the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what my event viewer looks like right now:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2d3762f0-86fb-4638-b9ff-88c794b7f11f" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>I also did system restore when the bsod happens, but I still get them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first laptop and I have no idea what to do or how to fix this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo y510p i7-4700mq gt750m SLI 8gb ram 1tb sshd windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can figure out if its a software, driver or hardware problem. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows Defender and Malwarebytes for scanning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what do you suggest I do first? Call Lenovo and have the hdd RMA'd or deal with the drivers for the bsod?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is it also possible that the one causing those bsod's is&nbsp;because of the hdd failing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Also, if the issue persists it may help to look at the minidump files from the BSOD crashes with a debugger.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive (SkyDrive) or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following link has information on using OneDrive&nbsp;(SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            <p>Downloaded every Win8 driver&nbsp;on the Lenovo site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed everything without problems except when I was installing the wlan driver. This error occurred 3 times when installation was in process:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3548ea8e-4b74-4cc8-a852-e9483d60ea1a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to close it then installation continues and pops-up again. I did the same and it popped-up again then this followed:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/982bbfcd-ea20-4305-9711-e42fd3511eea" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressed 'OK'. Installation continued and finished successfully and asks me to restart the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the reboot, I ran the installer and chose the repair option&nbsp;to see if the installation could go smoothly but the error still appeared twice during the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed in Device Manager under Bluetooth that instead of having Intel Bluetooth something ( don't know the whole device name, I got Generic Bluetooth Adapter and Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator which weren't there before installing the wlan driver and
 bluetooth driver. I also tried turning off the Bluetooth on PC Settings under Settings on the Charms Bar but say that "could not turn of" above it which wasn't the case before updating the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found errors in the event viewer after updating those drivers: event id 10 WMI, event id 30 BTHUSB, event id 1000 Application Error and event id 1026 .NET Runtime.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply! Unfortunately, it was not enabled before the bsod. That is why I wasn't able to provide a minidump file. Hopefully, it crashes again so that I can provide a minidump file to pinpoint what's causing the bsod.</p>
