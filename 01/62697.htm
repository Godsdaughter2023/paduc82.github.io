<h2>            Cannot open zip file downloaded from Unix</h2>
                    I am downloading a zip file from a website that is&nbsp;running on&nbsp;Linux/Unix. When I double click on the zip file, I receive a message that the folder is invalid. I was able to test the&nbsp;zip file and it is not an invalid file. I can ftp the zip file and it
 opens fine but I do not have access to only ftp files. Any ideas?

            <p>If you are certain the file is OK, then try another zip program like 7Zip - <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.7-zip.org/</a> its free and it <em>may</em> be able to open it. Get the right version for your PC, 32 or 64 bit. You can set it up to be the default 'zipper' or leave the windows one as default and use 7Zip as an (right-click) on demand backup. It
 also allows you to password protect ZIP files again, should you want to.</p>

            It would appear that they are the same cable, you could always get in touch with customer support or ask at your local store about this.

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Problem with the contacts has a lot of causes. To isolate the issue we would like you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Just to confirm, only the group contact lists are not showing on the new device?<br />
</li><li>Based on the tagging you chose, are you accessing the contacts from your Outlook.com account? If yes, does the issue happen to a different browser? Do you see the contacts or groups when you create a new email?</li><li>Are you accessing the contacts using the People or the Outlook app? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response. </p>
        </p>

<p>we only have one contact list and this contains both individuals and groups. on the new laptop only the individuals are listed, it is as though the groups have been deleted.</p>
<p>my wife's uses hotmail.co.uk but it is basically outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>we access using People.</p>

<p>on my desk top my wife and i each have a list of contacts. when we click on PEOPLE it brings up a list of contacts. that list contains both individual and group contact addresses. my operating system is windows vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when we purchased the new laptop, Windows 10, and set up her account were able to click on PEOPLE and bring up our lists of contacts. the problem is that the list does not contain the groups, only the individuals. there is no way we can call up a list of
 addresses for our groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the pc, when we wished to send an email to a group we would just click on the group name and up would come all those people in the group and the email would go to all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the new laptop we cannot bring up the group, the group is not in the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>why are the groups missing from the list of contacts on the new laptop?</li><li>surely we are not going to have to set up the groups again?</li></ul>

            well, it seems that windows 10 people app does not allow for groups which explains the problem. after about an hour on 'chat' with a microsoft technician controlling the device it ended up with him finding out this information. &nbsp;microsoft &nbsp;do not appear
 to care, judging by the many complaints that can be seen on feedback.

<p>Yes "Jelo Sen" who seems to have MICROSOFT written underneath their name, does not realize that the "People App" does not have the ability&nbsp; to Create Contact Groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me say that again for anyone who comes across this thread and is as perplexed, insulted, mortified, apoplectic, disgusted, and in sheer awe of the nonchalance with which Microsoft has completely ignored the
<strong>thousands </strong>of Feedback requests for the BASIC FUNCTIONALITY of any email program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The People App/ Mail App in Windows 10 is unable to create and email to a group of contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is correct. Read no further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one of the most insulting slaps in the face for consumers Microsoft has ever pulled off, and the only reason I sound a little ticked off, is because I am perhaps one of the biggest Microsoft Fanboys out there. But they continue to ignore this basic
 functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encourage anyone who comes across this thread to PLEASE open the FEEDBACK APP that is listed in your App List on the Start Menu, and type in the word "Groups" into the search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then <strong>PLEASE </strong>go down the list, and <strong>UPVOTE </strong>on every single complaint about this, and the ADD YOUR OWN complaint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am probably the #1 complainer, on Twitter to these guys, and in these forums on this subject. They are not listening and they&nbsp; need to hear it from the users , over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...&nbsp; JF</p>

            Hello Fler,<br />
<br />
Than you for posting.&nbsp; The dw20.exe is a error reporting tool mostly found in found in Office.<br />
Check your event log when you get the system back before opening your apps and see what it has to say.
<br />
<br />
You could always use Task Manager to kill the process - if you have access to one of course.
<br />
Now you can't actually stop it, but you may want to read this article to lessen the impact that you may be having.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Xbox One Elite controller question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lil angryman69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Elite controller question</h2>
                    
<p>Is it possible to 'disable' the effect of downward pressure on stick of the Elite controller?</p>
<p>I ask as I have a "heavy thumb". When I play COD of Battlefield 4, when I have to turn quickly I often put too much downward pressure on the stick and instead of turning, I either melee or go prone, depending on which action is mapped to 'stick down'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So is it possible to map the Elite so that no action is mapped to the 'stick down' position?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help or advice appreciated.</p>

<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Open the Xbox Accessories app, click your Elite controller, and head to button mapping. &nbsp;Choose the "Left Stick Click" or "Right Stick Click" as the button to map, and map it to "Unmapped." - it's the last option in the list. &nbsp;That will make it so the click
 does nothing. &nbsp;You might want to also map that function to one of the paddles in the back if it's a command you need in game.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live issues for xbox one x</h2>
                    <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a long read (my apologies) but please bear with it and leave a help suggestion below once you've finished. Also apologies for spelling mistakes and grematical errors I wrote this late at night after a long day's work in the kitchen (and I'm dyslexic,
 so that doesn't help) please don't judge to much. I can clarify this if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for the past month or so my xbox won't connect to xbox Live, it connectedto the Internet fine but won't connect to xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first week or so I didn't mind as I don't play online but then I decided to try and fix it as it was a minor inconvenience to me and thought I might as well see if I can fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Big mistake, I tried everything that a found online and eventually I called xbox support. They told me to remove my account and add it again, another mistake, I couldn't add my account back. So the person I was taking to said restart your console but keep
 games and settings, so I did this and my console rebooted and said it needed an update, I hadn't updated my console in a while and I figured this would happen, but it then came up with the message "there was a problem with the update, you need this update
 to use your console but something went wrong" followed by a Web link, console ID and error code (0x80072EFD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps it showed me and everything the person I was talking to as well, nothing fixed this. I then did a offline update to see if this would fix it, it did not. Annoyed and frustrated I then left it for a day or two and when I was free I tried
 again (the whole shabang, console restart, turning it on and off, offline update again still nothing. Called xbox support again and while fiddling around with stuff (turning my router off and and doing the offline update without a network percent) still the
 same error message appeared I then turned my router on and checked my connection again and hey it worked, happy days my console updated and everything seemed fine but when I got to the home screen I still could not connect to xbox Live. I could connect to
 the Internet but not xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then called xbox support and low and behold they set me back to square one. Restart console but keep everything, silly me went along with it and when it came to it console checking for a update I thought I just updated it so this won't be a issue again.
 But oh boy was I wrong, exact same error message came up ("there was a problem with the update, you need this update to use your console but something went wrong") even though it had just updated this message still showed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the same steps as before but to no avail and then all of a sudden it after getting really annoyed and just spamming check again for a couple of seconds a message saying "opps looks like your console is up to date, our fault" (or something along
 those line) and it then rebooted like normal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got to the home screen I was connected and everything as good with the world. Apart form the fact that in the attempt to break the loop my console appeared to be in I did a factory reset. But not to worry I had all my games backed up on a hard drive
 (apart from fifa 19 and red dead redemption 2) as I was reinstalling fifa 19 I disconnected from xbox Live (not through my actions but the console did it it self) and I was back to where I was at the start of all this mess.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then left it for a week or so and just used my xbox offline, only problem (a minor one at that) was fifa 19 (which I play career mode the most) was at launch setting (basic settings and no squad updates available) nothing major just I couldn't use the
 nowly added players and potential updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also couldn't use any online features (no amazon prime, BBC Iplayer ect) even though it said your console is connected to the Internet, it just couldn't connect to xbox Live. I also couldn't add any new (or old) accounts to my xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then thought what the heck I might as well try this again maybe this time it will be fixed (spoiler alart it did not get fixed) I'm currently at the same stage as before, stuck at "there was a problem with the update, you need this update to use your console
 but something went wrong" and but this time I can't seem to make it work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten to the stage where I think it might be the network problem (I'm with Vodafone for my broadband) a but I have no idea how to solve or even go about seeing if the network (broadband connection) it to blame. I thought I'll try a different Internet
 connection but being the last of my friends who still lives in my town (they've all gone to uni or moved abroad, I'm at the local college) I don't have anyone I know to bring my xbox over and test this theory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My mom and dad have split and my dad recently moved into a new house but he doesn't have Internet for another month (according to his broadband comany) so I can't go there to check my theory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway this is way to long and convoluded so please if you have made it this far (I salute you) is there anyway of fixing my problem that you can see, any and all suggestion will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need me to clarify anything please ask and I'll let you know if I manage to solve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading and I look forward to reading about your possible solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours truly the (not so) CapableParrot37</p>

<p>Hey there Parot thanks for taking the time to bring this particular issue to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do understand the frustration Network issues can cause but rest assured we are here to help, the first thing we would suggest is looking into
<a href="https://portforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Port Forwarding</a> as this would open up all the channels of communication on the router to guarantee the strongest connection possible. Unfortunately this would be best setup with the ISP
 (internet service provider) as they have the best steps since they have the Network Hardware information available to them. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes or if further clarification is needed!</p>

<h3> deanbigbee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 unable to format &#47; transfer files to Glyph external hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I have the Surface Book 2 with a Glyph 2TB external connected via USB 3. I am unable to format the drive from the Surface Book 2. I've connected the drive to an older Lenovo laptop and was able to with no issue. When I connect the drive to the Surface Book
 2, it recognizes it just fine, and can even write files. However, if I try to copy folders over it usually hangs endlessly. If I try to quick format it from the Surface Book 2 it also hangs endlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Western Digital cheapo 1tb drive as well, and I can interact with that just fine from the Surface Book 2. The glyph drive functions just fine on other computers, but not this one. Thoughts?</p>

            Hi Dean.  I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You could try taking ownership of the drive in case it's an unannounced permissions error:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />Just in case something else like drive firmware is interfering try wiping the drive with Diskpart Clean Command to zero the boot sector and partition table, then reformat in Disk Management:  
<br /><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a>

<br />You can also check the drive with Disk Check and drive diagnostics:

            I would check to make sure the latest firmware updates for your Surface Book 2 are installed. This sounds like a driver issue.
<br />
<br />Also try the following:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Disk drives
<br />Right the external drive
<br />Click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart then check if its detected.
<br />
<br />You are not using a hub to connect the drive to the Surface Book right?

<p>Thanks so much Greg, and for your patience as I finally have bandwidth to get back to dealing with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm unable to complete your suggested tasks as</p>
<p>1) The drive doesn't show up in explorer so I can't right click it.</p>
<p>2) It does show up in disk management after heavy delay, and shows that it's having a read error.</p>
<p>3) I can select it in disk part (again, after about 1 minute delay for each request to it), but upon typing
<em>clean all </em>I get:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>DiskPart has encountered an error: The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error.</em><br />
<em>See the System Event Log for more information.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The System Event Log gives me:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>The IO operation at logical block address 0x0 for Disk 1 (PDO name: \Device\000000a8) was retried.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>HD tune pro gives me errors right at the gate with "Error at 0 MB (LBA 0) through LBA every other sector.</p>
<p>In trying to do a zero fill on the disk with HD tune pro it fails within moments and gives me this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>HD Tune Pro:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Glyph RAID0 Erase</em><br />
<em>Erased data&nbsp; &nbsp;: 163 mB</em></p>
<em>Elapsed Time&nbsp; &nbsp;: 0:02</em><br />
<em>[11:45:18]&nbsp; Starting Zero fill erase</em><br />
<em>[11:45:20]&nbsp; Errors: 2500</em><br />
<em>[11:45:20]&nbsp; Time: 0:02</em><br />
<em>[11:45:20]&nbsp; Total time: 0:02</em><br />
<p>
</p><p>These errors don't occur when the drive is plugged into my macbook or my lenovo win10 laptop from 2012, and the drive is plugged in directly to the laptop and not through the dock.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</p>
<p>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></p>
<p>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click <strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></p>
<p>c. Next, hit <strong>Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</p>
<p>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you‚Äôll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</p>
<p><strong>F4 for Safe Mode </strong></p>
<p><strong>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </strong></p>
<p><strong>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </strong></p>
<p><strong>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a>
</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

Friend, try this program: DriverMax.<br />
He worked with me and had a similar problem (even using Kaspersky and DriverBooster).<br />
It has a limit of two updates a day, however this can easily be solved by looking for the drivers by name he provides and shows how out of date.<br />
Hugs.

            <p>I've had a similar issue where the memory usage goes way up if you run a search in the Recycle Bin, and have a large number of files in there. (17K ish. I'll get around to cleaning it up... someday) I managed to have explorer eat up 3.4GB of RAM while it
 was running a search within the recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran a search on a directory with a much larger number of files (252K) , and explorer only ate about 1GB of RAM, which emptied out as soon as I closed the window, unlike the recycle bin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also left the recycle bin open, out of curiosity, and it was eating around 3GB of RAM already. Closing it does not free the RAM until garbage collection (or paging, not sure) kicks in, sometime later, and otherwise, explorer just sits around with the same
 amount of RAM in use. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think that there is any way of fixing it, other than waiting on Microsoft to do something, as I doubt that it is possible to access the Recycle Bin externally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a note to the other responders, this problem is not an issue caused by faulty drivers, and neither is it a problem with Windows Update. It could potentially be caused by a rogue/corrupt program, or malware, but that is extremely unlikely as my computer
 is not infected (to my knowledge), and Rafael has taken the effort to replicate the problem in a VM, which indicates that it is not caused by either of those problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In terms of the memory usage going up when you refresh the items, I think that it's not removing the excess data from RAM, but it is making it inaccessible, so it adds the data to RAM when you refresh. (RAM goes up, since explorer thinks the excess data
 is gone), or explorer assumes that the data is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to add that I'm running Windows 10 with the Anniversary Edition Update.

    <title>How to sign out of the mail app in a windows 8 computer when I&#39;m - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marsupial mouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to sign out of the mail app in a windows 8 computer when I&#39;m logged on with a local account, not with a Microsoft Account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I click on Mail on the Start Screen, then log on to Microsoft Account, Outlook.com comes up WITHOUT a profile name visible in the top right hand corner of the screen. But when I go to Desktop and use Internet Explorer to connect to Outlook.com, I do
 get a profile name visible in the top right hand corner of the screen - so I can log out of Outlook.com if I connect via the desktop, but can NOT logout of Outlook.com if I connect via the Start Screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the problem is related to something else I have noticed too. If I start up Internet Explorer on the desktop, I get a menu display at the top of the screen which I do not get if I start up Internet Explorer from the Start Screen. This means that I
 can configure and change Internet Explorer if I start it from the desktop, but can NOT do so if I start it from the Start Screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... In both applications, the top part of the display seems to be missing IF I START THEM FROM THE START SCREEN, but NOT if I start them from the desktop. AND THE INTERNET EXPLORER PROBLEM EXISTS EVEN ON A BRAND NEW WINDOWS 8 INSTALLATION that has not
 been changed in any way, not even connected to the internet to receive updates. (So it seems reasonable to assume that the problem with Mail from the Start Screen also exists on a brand new Windows 8 installation as well.) Therefore the problem can NOT be
 corrupted cache or temporary files or anything else like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequence of this problem in Mail when I connect to it from the Start Screen is that I remain permanently logged in, and anyone using my computer can read my mail simply by clicking on the Mail icon on the start screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is not related to my monitor or video controller card settings, because the Internet Explorer problem is the case on three different computers in my house - so presumably&nbsp;the Mail problem is as well. (I don't want to test the Mail problem on
 any other PC than mine in case I end up permanently logged in to my mail account on a PC that isn't mine. It's bad enough having the problem on my own PC.) I have tried different monitors on my PC and the Mail problem persists on all monitors. I've tried resetting
 screen size when in Mail after connecting to it from the Start Screen, but doing so did not make visible anything that wasn't visible prior to experimenting with the monitor. So the problem is the Mail (and Internet Explorer) application on the Start Screen,
 not my hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do NOT have the "keep me connected" box clicked on Microsoft Account, I can find no "keep me connected" box on Outlook.com to ensure that is not the problem, and I sign on to my computer using Local signon, NOT Microsoft Account signon. I'm running Windows
 8 Pro, and I do not have touch screens, so it is configured for a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched and searched Microsoft Help and Microsoft Community, but no other reply to this question works. All replies either assume that the profile name is visible in the top right hand corner (which it is if I start it from Desktop, but is NOT if I
 start from the Start Screen), or else suggest the problem is in Internet Explorer cache or corrupted files, which it can't be in my instance because the profile name is there if I start from Desktop but isn't if I start&nbsp;from Start Screen)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do I not get the full screen in Internet Explorer or Mail on my Windows 8 computer if I start them from the Start Screen, but do get the full screen when I start them from Desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I sign out of Mail when I connect to it from the Start Screen?</p>

            <p><font>Hi Marsupial,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I appreciate the efforts which you have put to post the query on this forum.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I would like to inform you that if you are referring to Mail app on the Start screen, it‚Äôs by-design that one can‚Äôt log out of the email account while it can be done while using a web version to access the email account. Well, as far as accessibility
 of the mail account is concerned, it‚Äôs designed in such a manner that you will always have the latest updates on the top when you click the Mail icon and don‚Äôt have to sign-in and sign out to switch between account. You can also add and remove an account easily
 in Mail app.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Again, for Modern Version of Internet Explorer as compared to the Desktop Version, the menubar is not present for the former. You can easily access other tabs and some accessibility options when you right click on the webpage window on the Modern app
 version. You will also be able to check for Tools options at the bottom right corner which has other options View downloads, in-private etc.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>In Windows 8, you can find Built-in apps as well as apps at Store. You can refer to the link to get the details:</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also use your <span>Windows</span> Store account to install apps on up to five computers. Here's how you can do so:</p>

<h2>            XBOX USB Thumb Drive</h2>
                    
<p>I have an old Xbox game saved on my Xbox 360's hard drive and want to transfer the saved data to a thumb drive.</p>
<p>However, when I tried to do so, the only option I get in System/Storage on the console is to "Delete".</p>
<p>Is there a work-around for this?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply Mike, but I had already configured the flash drive so I just get the menu when I click on it in settings/system/storage and the drive is empty.
</p>
<p>The game does appear in the hard drive's "Game and Apps" list, but selecting it only gives the "Delete" option (no copy or move choice). &nbsp;Since it's an old Xbox game (Dai Senryaku VII) I figured I may just be out of luck.</p>

<p>have you tryed puting other USB stuff into the xbox like phones or a other USB drive and see if it comes up on your xbox? if not try doing doing this step - go to your other xbox360, and go to account management and you it says your billing options go to
 license transfer &nbsp;see if that helps you </p>

    <title>Program Manager delaying restart W10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g_r  say:</h3>
<h2>            Program Manager delaying restart W10</h2>
                    <p>Have been having increasing 'not responding' messages, and activity frozen for extended periods of time, eventually coming alive.</p>
<p>On re-starts I am getting the normal notification of applications (if any not previously closed) but always getting the notification that 'Program Manager' needs closing, and suggesting that I 'cancel' and save any open work.&nbsp; After a period of 10 or 12
 minutes, the re-start will continue; either it has closed 'Program Manager' or acted in the 'force re-start' mode, not sure which.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an upgrade from 8.1 in a new laptop.&nbsp; No programs had been previously installed in 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was experiencing ongoing problems with onedrive advising that it couldn't open with the current user account.&nbsp; See from searches that this is a common problem and I have tried virtually every suggestion without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I believe that possible most of the 'not responding' may be due to program manager problems?</p>

    <title>DNS Server Connection Issue &#40;Can&#39;t Connect to the internet due - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DNS Server Connection Issue &#40;Can&#39;t Connect to the internet due to some type of DNS Server Issue&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This has been going on for about 3 days now. On the first day, when the issue appeared, I tried resetting the router and modem, as well as unplugging everything and plugging it back in just to start with standard stuff. That worked for a small while but
 then the DNS Server issue reappeared, so I did the whole /flushdns /release /renew thing. However, when doing this, it gave me the error of a connection being disconnected on the release and renew commands. I tried connecting to my wireless internet (Im already
 connected through wired internet) and while that got rid of one of the disconnection errors, one still remained. I thought it might be a virtualbox thing, so just to test I uninstalled VirtualBox completely. Then I did the netsh interface thing, but all it
 showed up were the two connections that I knew were there already. I went back to retry flushdns thing, and it showed up the same error. So, I decided that since I couldnt find any other solution to change the IPv4 DNS. Initially, that also worked, but then
 it re-disconnected due to further DNS server issues. (This time the error was "Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS server) is not responding") However, weirdly enough, it then reconnected and disconnected due to
 the same issue constantly, and then eventually it never even showed up an error message while troubleshooting, my only indication was event viewer telling me it was a DNS issue along with anything I search up. (DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NO_INTERNET) I then attempted
 to reset the TCP/IP settings, but that did nothing either. So I went and changed the IPv6 DNS to google's public one as well, and that also did nothing. I am absolutely sure its not the individual computer as well, as ive tried other devices during this and
 they gave the same error (Apple Phone gave "Safari cannot open the page because the server cannot be found." error.) I then attempted to check services.msc and make sure the Computer Browser, DHCP Client, DNS Client, Network Connections, Network Location Awareness,
 Remote Procedure Call, Server, TCP/IP Netbios helper, and Workstation were all started and running, and some of them werent, but when I started &nbsp;them up and changed them to automatic, they seemed to be doing fine. (The only one that I noticed that didnt really
 work was Computer Browser during the DNS issue, but it worked once it reconnected) I then tried to make sure the drivers were updated, and they were. My router requires a firmware update, but I don't believe thats an issue. I am going to update it once the
 connection goes up again, though. I attempted to see if I could ping the router, the DNS server, and a website (In this case, I used youtube.) and all three pings wen't through without problem. I also attempted netsh winsock reset and netsh winsock reset catalog,
 and those also did nothing. I also decided to move any wireless devices inbetween my computer and the router in case that for whatever reason did anything, and that also fixed nothing. I recently have just changed back the DNS server to the automatically provided
 one instead of the manual one I connected to (which was google's public one) and so far, the same disconnect and reconnect has happened. I have absolutely no clue what else to do or how to get that flushdns, release, renew to work without giving that error.
 I think that third LAN connection that's "disconnected" MIGHT be a Sonos that we have, its possible since its connected to the router, but I doubt it. This has also popped up out of nowhere. The only thing that has sort-of happened around the timeframe is
 something dealing with our septic tank and while doing something with it they dug up some cable wires. To my knowledge they werent damaged, and cable still works fine in our house. &nbsp;I have no multiple antivirus programs either, only one, that being Norton,
 though I don't believe my computer is the problem as the same error has happened on multiple devices that are connected, through wireless or wired. Further information from the modem itself is whenever this error occurs, the "DS" light on the modem I am using
 (Which is an "A R R I S" TM902) turns orange, and then it either stays that way until I can connect again, or all the lights other than the power light (which is green) and the DS light (which is now a blinking orange) turn off, &nbsp;as it seems to have almost
 reset itself and turn on again. (Though when actually resetting said DS light doesnt start the reset off with blinking, it starts off just like all the other lights other than the power light.) Looking at events in the event viewer, these events have popped
 up within the last 37 minutes:</p>

<p>If you want me to give any further details on any of these I can, but most of the DNS Client Events are just iterations of&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Name resolution for the name (insert whatever here) timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded."</p>
<p>The router itself has none of the flickering light problems that the modem seems to have, which leads me to believe its either a problem with the cables in some way or the modem itself, maybe.</p>
<p>If any further information is needed I can probably provide it, just warning you that I'm on the young side (below 20) and I have very limited knowledge of this kind of stuff.</p>

<h2>            D&#58;&#92; is not accessible. Access is denied</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was trying to setup my D: drive (all my media) with bitlocker. I am on Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit.</p>
<p>Now that it is setup, whenever I unlock my drive, I get the error "Access is denied"</p>
<p>I went to edit the permissions but the "security tab" is not listed under properties.</p>
<p>Also I tried to run the command in cmd with admin rights (to re grant me permissions) but it says ERROR: Access Denied.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to reset the access permissions to default or access the security tab again? I am on an admin account and I've tried in both safe mode and "normal" mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help,</p>

<p>I had just right clicked on it and selected "turn on bitlocker". The drive was locked on my main account which was the same I was trying to access the drive from after lock.</p>
<p>I was prompted to enter a password to unlock it, but once it was unlocked, it would still give me access denied. I decrypted and tried your steps but they didn't work. The nosecuritytab key wasn't in my reg.</p>
<p>I ended up placing the drive in a external enclosure and booting up my old Vista machine. Doing that, I was able to take ownership using that computer for some reason. I was able to pull my files off after taking ownership (takeown in cmd).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I had my files pulled off, I put the drive back in my laptop and was able to boot into&nbsp;safe-mode&nbsp;and format the drive (not using the drive&nbsp;management&nbsp;took in msconfig, had to use elevated CMD).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, problem solved and lesson learned haha.</p>

            Hi Dalip.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />When did it last work correctly?  What has changed since then?  Is there a System Restore point to roll back to before then?  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Change the batteries if wireless, try another USB port, reset mouse from button on bottom if available.
<br />
<br />Try the mouse in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows causing this.
<br />
<br />Try another mouse in this PC to confirm if Windows is the problem.
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab. First try Update this Driver &gt; Automatically, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there mouse software installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features? Uninstall it to see if the problem stops. This is unneeded bloatware.
<br />
<br />Adjust the mouse settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse, checking all settings including the Additonal Mouse Options box - check Settings on all tabs.
<br />
<br />Report back all results for possible other things to try.
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>...
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>...

<h2>            &#91;HELP CONNESSIONE&#93; Xbox e Vodafone Station con cavo Lan</h2>
                    
<p>Buongiorno a tutti, </p>
<p>√® la prima volta che scrivo e mi serve il vostro aiuto, ho cercato in qualche altra discussione ma non ho trovato (mi pare) nulla che si avvicini al mio problema...</p>
<p>Ho da due gg la VS attiva con linea adsl (primo ero alice) e la xbox √® collegata tramite un cavo LAN alla VS, il mio problema √® che i due apparecchi non si vedono cio√® la VS non da nessun impulso alla xbox cos√¨ non vede la rete, la prima volta ho preso il
 vecchio router e attacco la xbox&nbsp; subito ha visto il collegamento e da li ho settato l'ip manuale della xbox quindi 192.168.1.14 sub 255.255.255.240 gate 192.168.1.1 e dns 192.168.1.1 tutto contento sono andato online ho giocato poi ieri ho riacceso la xbox
 e sorpresa stesso prob di prima non vede di nuovo la rete....ovvio a questo inconveniente staccando la lan dalla porta 2 del VS alla porta 3 per poi tornare alla 2 in quel modo la rete magicamente appare...per√≤ non si pu√≤ andare avanti cos√¨..... il pc fisso
 e il blu ray sempre collegati via lan non hanno di questi problemi ...</p>
<p>aiutatemi per favore.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Embed Metro &#40;and apps&#41; into desktop background. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Embed Metro &#40;and apps&#41; into desktop background.</h2>
                    Can someone at MS please add an option to embed Metro and it's apps into the desktop background. I hate having to manage two sets of programs.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Two window managers is not intuitive in the slightest. One taskbar on the left for Metro apps. One on the bottom for my most used software. It's terrible! If Metro were in the desktop background, and opening apps like viewing a picture displaced the desktop
 wallpaper (but the taskbar remained on top) then I could get what I need done without Metro being "in the way".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I like Metro, but not as a "alternative screen". It needs to be embedded so I get the best of both worlds at the same time! Switching between two different worlds (old and new) is inconvenient and as anti-user-friendly as it gets. Metro embedded is a no-brainer.
 I'm practically a MS fanboy, so trust me when I say I mean this in all due respect. Anyway, please please please do this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLEASE!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. At least suggest it to someone who could get it accomplished. You do this, and I'll not only convert to Win 8 completely, I'll convince everyone else to jump on the band-wagon! Until this happens, it's not worth the hassle.</div>

            I agree. I can't work out how, in Internet Explorer for instance, I try to type something in search, maybe some info on how to alter some program on my PC.&nbsp;I need both desktop and search open at the same time. Can't be done!

            Gum Dragon,
<div><br />
<div>There is the option to drag some programs onto part of the screen. I found this handy to use the Metro messenger app while working on something on the desktop. But embedding Metro would still be better.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe that can help you.<br />
<div><br />
<div>Just to elaborate on what I'm asking for, in case anyone is interested...<br />
<div><br />
<div>Imagine if the search bar was just "in" the desktop. You search and it comes up in the desktop. You open a metro app, like Internet Explorer, and it opens into the desktop. Then they could be managed from the desktop taskbar with all your other programs
 (all in the same place, yay!) and if the desktop peak button was still by the clock... you could easily get back to the desktop with your icons, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This would be the ultimate Windows 8 feature. It would solve every problem with Metro for me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please Microsoft, hear this! lol</div>

            I fully agree, was thinking the same thing.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The way things are now has forced me into installing a 3rd party start menu, and I never ever use the metro system. Which is a shame since they've put a lot of work into it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft, please open your eyes here. Metro is cool and all, but the way it's integrated right now just doesn't work. Putting it on the desktop makes a lot of sense, since it would breathe new life into a part of the OS which hasn't changed in more than
 a decade. Tiles are a great idea - please let us use and enjoy them instead of being annoyed by them.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Well it's a year and a half later, 8.1 was released, and they still don't get it. I agree it's simple, BEYOND simple really. MS has some brilliant things going on behind Windows. But on the front, they surely aren't doing enough research on what people want.
 That is evident enough in how long it took for them to update the task-bar based on what EVERYONE was asking for from the beginning (pinning and reordering).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on MS, get your act together and give us a metro desktop in an all-in-one interface, instead of "two" versions of the same computer experience and two types of application management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly did 8.1 innovate, a "new" start button? Holy cow! Earth to stupid! No offense guys, I like MS a lot in some ways. But seriously... get your user experience design team's act together or start listening to them if you aren't.</p>

            <p>I could not agree with you more! I've been telling my friends this for a long time now how the metro apps should be embedded into the desktop background, not an entirely new screen alternate screen. the alternative full screen makes sense on tablets but
 not on desktops. </p>
<p>
</p><p>i think the idea they have with multiple desktops in windows 10 is also not very good. its not intuitive for end users.&nbsp;</p>

            It is not part of windows 8. You can uninstall it but sometimes it can be difficult to do that. Wait until you have used your new computer for a while to make sure the manufacturer hasn't installed some apple programs. Check the Add Remove Programs to
 see what is installed.

            <p>It is used by other programs besides Apple, but nothing comes directly to mind. It's mostly used as a "zero configuration" background program, similar to "plug and play".</p><p>Rather than uninstalling it, you can always change it's start-up properties to Manual.

            <p>Not that I'm aware of; services doesn't list anything that's depending on it, not even Apple.</p><p>You could set it to Disabled instead of Manual, and the next time you start a program that's dependent on it, you'll get an error that the Bonjour service is not running. The only reason I have it set to Manual instead of Disabled is that I occasionally connect my iPod to load new songs. If not for that, I'd have it Disabled, just to see what else uses it.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>
