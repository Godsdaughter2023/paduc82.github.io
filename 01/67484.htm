<p>No, it always receives both chat and game audio. You have to turn the volume all the way down on the adapter itself.

<h2>            Type cover on new Surface Go stopped working after recent update</h2>
                    <p>Hi. The type cover on my daughter's new Surface Go stopped working after a recent update. Have spent hours trying to get issue fixed and unable to reach anyone on the telephone to assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears to be a known issue with a missing driver. Please advise if you have a solution.</p>

<p>Hi SammJack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know about your concern. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disconnecting and reconnecting the cover </span><span>causes Windows to re-enumerate the device is Device Manager which can help resolve this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restart the device if disconnecting and reconnecting the keyboard didn't help.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are some solutions you can try that might also help:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Clean the connectors</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Unplug your Surface and detach the Cover.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Wet a cotton swab with rubbing alcohol. (Use 95% or stronger isopropyl alcohol if possible.) Rub the cotton swab back and forth over the six circular magnets on the Type Cover's connector. After you're done, make sure the pins are dry and that no cotton
 fibers remain on the connector. Then clean the connector on your Surface.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Reattach the Cover, making sure that all the magnets touch the bottom edge of your Surface.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Running the Surface Diagnostic </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates for your device<span>.

 After running the toolkit, force shutdown and restart your device to ensure all updates are applied.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button until the screen turns off (about 10 seconds), then release the power button.</li><li><span><span><span>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Microsoft logo.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If that doesn't work, use this shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Press and hold down the power button until your Surface restarts and you see the Windows logo screen (this takes about 20 seconds), then release the power button.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reset your Surface</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If running the toolkit didn't work, reset your Surface. </p>

            Problem solved. Turns out the type cover wasn't functioning. Microsoft Store replaced it and my daughter's Surface Go is back in business.

    <title>Incorrect Password for local Admin acct., only pw I entered when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> azsobo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect Password for local Admin acct., only pw I entered when setting up is pin code for login</h2>
                    <p>I was having issues the other day, when I tried to Safe Boot it asked for password,
</p>
<p>entered my login pin - incorrect</p>
<p>entered my Microsoft Live password - incorrect</p>
<p>entered nothing - incorrect</p>
<p>
</p><p>being new to Win 10 and this pc, I hadn't even created the Recover Password disk yet, apparently I wouldn't have been able to (see below)<br />
</p>
<p>I used the manufactured supplied Win 10 Pro install disk and reinstalled OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set up exactly as before, first thing I did was try to Create a Recovery Password Disk and can not do that because none of the passwords or lack of password is working. So what am I supposed to do????? I can't change the password for my acct because it won't
 let me. There is no hint, I didn't enter one - I don't believe I was asked to or I would have, it is a 2 month old system (CyberpowerPC) and when I set it up brand new and the other day, used my first name and a pin that I am 1000% sure I am entering correctly,
 it lets me log into windows at startup.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am the Admin, it is a local account (I just checked to confirm) and not my MS live account so I am lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been reading several posts here and from the web, places like Windows 10 Forums and nothing is helping.</p>

            <p>It's not possible to use a PIN login unless you set a full regular password first. &nbsp;But maybe you just happened to set a 'regular password' that was nothing but numbers? &nbsp;Hard to say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see the "sign in options" button so you can choose if you are authenticating via PIN instead of password?</p>

            <p>I don't know, when I set this pc up I took any notes I had on the invoices, etc. - I will most definitely go over them again to make sure I didn't miss something, I wouldn't have wrote down 'password' over any password I enter so in my frustration I could
 have looked over it. I'll comb over it as soon as I can get my hands on that folder. I'm really hoping I missed it before, I haven't looked at it since that day I couldn't get into Safe Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restored Win 10, I'm 99% sure I choose the option that deleted everything except personal files (I have a boot only drive but I was still trying to be least obtrusive) - would that have kept some of my profile?
</p>
<p>I thought I had to choose language and all the other inputs first time I booted after the restore, but full disclosure, I'm just assuming I only used pin this time. After all was said and done, I was up hours after my usual bedtime trying to get this pc
 back up so I was falling asleep sitting at the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the 'Sign In Options' option on my login screen but I've never clicked on it, I've always just used the pin.</p>

            <p>First just check if the text box says "password" (ghosted inside the box) or PIN, and try that sign-in option link to switch and see -- maybe that's all you need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to answer your other question -- keeping your files during a reset also retains the profile those files were in (including the password).</p>

                    <p>I'm running a laptop (2 cores, 4GB RAM) with 64-bit Win8.1 Enterprise. Recently I have had issues with slowness whenever the hardware is put under stress that it used to handle fine. I run regular virus, etc. scans and I have a program that deletes registry
 entries from uninstalled programs. To my knowledge I have only minimal antivirus and firewall. Disabling them entirely helps but does not solve the problem.</p>

Right now as I'm downloading Windows Refresh media, the cursor has delayed responses to mouse movements (which is a first). What's surprising is that my task manager says only 60% of the CPU and RAM are in use.<br />
<br />
In the past I've been able to use Restore Points to successfully delay these problems (I think), so I think it's a software problem and not hardware. Would refreshing Windows help with this problem?<br />

Part 2, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/how-to-downgrade-from-windows-81-pro-to-windows-81/9d99938f-398e-4af6-aecf-2845c331014c">this answered question</a>, it's possible to effectively downgrade Win8.1
 Pro to Core/Base just by reinstalling Windows. 2 questions here: Would this work for going from Enterprise to either Pro or Core? And would doing this require a wipe or would it be a refresh?<br />
<br />
This has been plaguing me for a year. Any help is appreciated.</p>

            I have Enterprise for private use because the computer originally came from my university. Now that I have graduated I do not have access to a System Admin because they took my computer off their network.<br />
<br />
Would the OS let me install Pro over Enterprise using their refresh media?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<h2>            Xbox still faulty after repair</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>i have received my console back from the xbox service center two days ago after sending it back when i experienced the "green screen of death".</p>
<p>the console worked initially, installed updates and was up and running as normal. upon playing a game (BF4), the game became laggy and crashed back to the dashboard. i shut down the console and restarted and now the console will boot past the green screen
 but to a black screen. i have tried the offline diagnostics which just throw up errors E101, if i boot the console without the usb drive after a couple of minutes i get an E102 error. of course the console is now out of warranty, i even tried to buy an extension
 whilst the console was away&nbsp; but the service site threw up error after error, it was a pain to even log the faulty console in the first place!!!</p>

<p>my question is what can i do now?! the console still doesnt work, it broke again within an hour of getting it back!</p>

    <title>Unable to install third party and Microsoft apps on Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenpotter1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install third party and Microsoft apps on Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give a bit of background first then proceed to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 sometime in 2017 and last week on 12<sup>th</sup> of January, 2018, I restarted my laptop to install some Windows 10 updates. I have no idea what happened, but my laptop got stuck on a restart loop and just would not
 boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many attempts at turning off and trying to boot again, I gave up, and, on a friend’s laptop, I downloaded the media creation tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then managed to get into boot options of the affected laptop and proceeded to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All went well, but when a screen presented itself and asked what edition of Windows 10 I wanted, I chose Windows 10S thinking that S meant Standard.</p>
<p>Well, everything was installed, but when I went to install the third party programs which I need for my employment, I got a message that I could not install third party apps on Windows 10S and that I needed to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that would solve all my problems. I dutifully forked out 339.00 Australian Dollars for the privilege. I then tried again to install my employment related software, but I got a message stating,
<strong>“Your Organisation used Windows Defender Application Control to block this app.”</strong> It then showed the file path and another statement saying,
<strong>“Contact your support person for more info.”</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought, “OK”, I’ll reinstall Microsoft Office 2013, but, alas, I got the same message saying that Windows Defender blocked installation of Office 2013!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I’m a person and not an organisation and therefore<strong> <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">
I am</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"> </span>the support person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: How do I overcome this problem of not being able to install third party apps AND Microsoft apps on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple fix? I have tried turning off Windows Defender for a short period (and attempted to install the apps I need) to see if that made any difference, but, NO, once more, NO luck!

<p>None of the Microsoft Support suggestions helped so I decided to give a reinstall a go.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being technically proficient in these things, it was a little daunting, but I solved this matter with, what I believe is called, a clean install of Windows 10 Pro and everything is running as it should, now!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I still feel dudded having forked out $339.00 when it was unnecessary since it was a Windows 10 update which caused this problem in the first place; all I needed was you to advise me to do this reinstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did ask about this, but nothing was forthcoming from your support so I naturally thought that it wasn't on the agenda, so to speak, because you're the ones who are supposed to know this stuff...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose a refund is out of the question because Microsoft will always deny liability no matter if their updates were the cause of the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>

<p>

            Open the Store app, then select Downloads and Updates. Then select Get Updates. If OneNote does not update, then it might be easiest to just reinstall it.
<br />To Uninstall and Reinstall OneNote, you'll need to right click on it in the Start menu, and select Uninstall. I'd recommend a reboot after this, but it's likely not a *must* - Once done, open the Store and search of OneNote - then install it. If that does not work, please respond and I'll see what else I can think of to help.

            =( I'm sorry. I haven't experienced any serious errors with the Store apps, so I'm not sure which folders would contain a prefs list for this particular app.
<br />Maybe give CC Cleaner a try, use the Windows Store cleaning feature in the app after removing OneDrive and then do a reinstall. Not sure if that would help at this point. I will do a little searching and post back here soon.

<p><a href="http://www.creative.com/soundblaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.creative.com/soundblaster/</a></p>
<p>Open Device Manager and right click on the sound card driver to uninstall.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Retry audio.&nbsp; Is it working?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try reseating the sound card although it may be fried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run</p>
<p>Type DxDiag and press Ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note if your system is unable to locate a copy of DXDIAG, it most likely means that a recent version of DirectX is not
</p>
<p>installed on your computer.&nbsp; You may download a recent version of DirectX from the Microsoft web-site at the following</p>
<p>address:</p>

<p>Click the Sound Tab</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sound tab contains detailed information about the sound card settings and driver. On</p>
<p>this tab, you can test DirectSound and lower the Sound Hardware Acceleration Level. If &nbsp;DXDIAG detects any problems with the sound card or driver files, a warning will be displayed in the notes box</p>

<h2>            Does Surface Book 2 support HDCP 2.2 on external display via USB-C to HDMI Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if&nbsp;Surface Book 2 supports HDCP 2.2 on external display via USB-C to HDMI Adapter?</p>
<p>I know that the USB-C to HDMI adapter itself supports this feature, but what about the SB2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            The Surface Book 2 only support HDCP 1.4 for external wired displays. The internal display is HDCP 2.2 though.

<p>Hi Rainingcoconuts.</p>
<p>The problem started when you have to tried to start your hrad drive in other console.</p>
<p>The license is didn´t atached to hd, is link to your machine!!!</p>
<p>When you use in your friend machine the system reconizes the "diferent machine" and atives the demonstration mode, to make work again in your machine a sugest the folow passes.</p>
<p>First delete minecraft (and pray for give you a option to delete the game only!!!, because much arcades games have the save atached to main content...)</p>
<p>Second delete your profile (only profile, maintain all the rest like saves)</p>
<p>Third Clean your system cache (go to memory when shows the space you have the option to clean cache when press Y).</p>
<p>Fourth down again your profile (in social, in and out)</p>
<p>Fifth down minecraft again</p>
<p>Remember to do all in YOUR MACHINE and IN THAT ORDER!!!!</p>
<p>And remeber too not use your hd in other 360 because for use your´s games in other machine you have the trasfer license toll, and that SERVERS ONLY FOR CASE´S LIKE YOUR MACHINE IS GONE AND YOU HAVE TO INSTALL THE HARD DRIVE DATA OR THE HARD DRIVE IN ANOTHER
 MACHINE!!!</p>
<p>You can´t "share" your content for diferent machines!!!(legaly)</p>
<p>I hope i help you and forgive my bad english it´s self learnerd.</p>

<h2>            Internet connectivity problems</h2>
                    <p>So earlier, I was on my computer and I had JUST updated my network driver. I was wanting to download some coding software so I went onto firefox and tried to search it. It didnt load. So I tried again, it didnt load. So I tried MSEdge and it didnt work either.
 I even tried Cortana who didnt work either. I ran a WLAN report and it seems that my system is shutting down my internet connection. When I look around, I find this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect Reason: The network is disconnected by the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I go further into the report:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[-]WLAN Extensibility Module has stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Module Path: C:\Windows\system32\Rtlihvs.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running an SFC scan right now but I just need to know what to do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I just got my Xbox One X but it makes this sound when running that li pretty much like my PS4 Pro … a coil whine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can hear it on this recording https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wth84ZSmv_s&amp;feature=youtu.be</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is more noticeable from the 8th second till the end.</p>

            Hi all, I was having the same problem as this, the way I fixed it is as follows.
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Sign in to your Windows Live account services:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a>&nbsp;(This is the account you want to verify)</span></li><li><span>Upon signing in, you are prompted with the following message: "You need permission to use Microsoft sites and services".</span></li><li><span>Select "I'm an Adult. Why am I seeing this page?"</span></li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>When I did this it allowed me to update the information of my child's account so I simply changed the country to UK set the birth date as it was, so keeping it as a child's account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After this was completed I could sign him into windows live on his laptop, but kept all the security of a child's account. Happy days.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There was no need for me to enter any credit card details or anything like that.</div>

<h2>            Unable to communicate in party&#38;&#35;39&#59;s or in-game after 24 hour suspension, XBLPET&#47;Official Support Incompetence &#38;amp&#59; Xbox&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Outdated Support system</h2>
                    
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Unable to communicate in party's or in-game after 24 hour suspension, XBLPET/Official Support Incompetence &amp; Xbox's Outdated Support system</strong></span></p>

<p>So to briefly explain, I was suspended from communications for 24 hours on the 20/10/2015, was then unable to communicate in party's or in-game after the suspension was served. I contacted support a week later and was made to to do all kinds of troubleshooting
 tests to no avail and was told I will receive a email within 24 to 48 hours explaining it more and when the issue could be fixed and with possible information on possible compensation, which didn't happen. I then contacted support again a week later again
 to be told the same thing "that they don't know when this issue will be resolved and that I should post on the forums"</p>
<p>So I post on the forums making my point present and ask some questions such as "when will the issue be fixed" and "what compensation will I receive"&nbsp; to be replied to with an email stating my post got deleted and I was given a generic pre written response,
 as seen below. Read if you want or skip ahead.</p>
<p><em>"Your forum post was deleted by a moderator.</em></p>
<p><em><b>Reason:</b>&nbsp;Thank you for contacting the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team regarding your recent Party communications difficulties. XBLPET is aware of a situation currently affecting a small number of Xbox One players in which Party chat and in-game
 communications may encounter temporary difficulties following the conclusion of a communications suspension. We apologize for the inconvenience that you have experienced, and genuinely appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to resolve this situation.
 In an effort to help Xbox gather additional information and resolve this situation"</em></p>
<p>This basically didn't tell me anything that I didn't already know and it also assumed I had access to the Xbox preview program and should follow these steps to help give feedback on the situation, (which I don't)</p>
<p>So considering I have been unable to communicate in party's or in-games for the past 4 weeks, with no resolution given to me within sight and I'm still paying for a service which is not fully functional, arguably in one the most important features of the
 service and wont be able to for the foreseeable future, and also as far as I'm aware will not be receiving compensation. So with no legitimate place make a formal complaint against the service other than on the forums. here I am.</p>
<p>So I feel like this issue will not be resolved by the end of this year and will probably be present going in to 2016 which is utterly ridiculous, I'm also aware of other people that have been dealing with this issue long before I have (for as long as 3 months
 already after looking at other posts) so my claim is rather mild in comparison to their claims, still its the same issue that has been present for this long and still hasn't been resolved which goes to show the utter lack of competence not only form the support
 team for not being able to:-</p>
<p><strong>1) give a rough idea as to when this issue will be fixed </strong></p>
<p><strong>2)&nbsp;provide compensation to the people who have been affected&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>as well as the Xbox technical team to be able to fix this issue with relative ease which makes me believe the issue is more complex than has been made clear to me or that this issue is not of a high priority to the team for the issue to be fixed in a hurry.
 They use the term "a small number of Xbox One players" as if there is no importance in this issue because its only a small number of people, which is such a bad practice in terms of providing customer support, which is extremely condescending almost making
 us out to not be of equal importance to other peoples issues because we are at fault because we did something wrong to get suspended.</p>
<p>So just to clarify as to why I got suspended, I was playing Pool Nation FX in a game of snooker in which I was dominating an opponent who proceeded to rage quit voiding me of my winnings, which if anybody has played Pool Nation FX before and experienced
 this can find this extremely irritating considering you place stakes which people should honour. Regardless I sent him a message saying "where you gone ***" and reported them for quitting early, at the time I found it quite humorous because this is a regular
 occurrence in this game and happens often so I can see the funny side in it so I leave it at that. But I then sign in the next day to find out I cant send any forms of communications.</p>
<p>Which was fine by me, if they got sensitive and reported me for inappropriate communications (mild profanity at best, of course I meant a cute little *** cat) resulting in a temporary ban on communications for me, however I found it ironic they didn't seem
 get and form of repercussion&nbsp;against them as far as I'm aware obviously it hard to tell but still goes to show the lack of competence on behalf of Xbox for deciding to enforce punishment on one thing and ignoring the other, basically exposing more of Xbox
 enforcement teams lack of competence with deciding to pick and chose what to enforce and then picking the lesser of two evils so to speak.</p>
<p>The Xbox support team is more or less outdated in the practices and have been zero help in this issue making me waste time by doing troubleshooting for no reason other than to waste time as far as I can tell, as well as being completely inadequate with helping
 me resolve this issue, along with being almost robotic with generic pre written responses and the processes they go through to help solve the issue which they very well know will not resolve it. As well as being condescending and unprofessional at times with
 their demeanour as if they were trying to shun me and then try to back peddle out of the situation, along with feeding me what they think I want to hear to buy them more time for a fault on their end. As seen below are excerpts from my second IM chat with
 a team member</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Gil: at 0:20:00</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks. I'm so sorry to hear about the contact Joshua, however have you tried making a post on the</em><br />
<em>forums regarding this?</em></p>
<p><em>Gil: at 0:35:18</em><br />
<em>Thank you for patiently waiting Joshua. I personally apologize if you feel that I was just trying to get</em><br />
<em>rid of you. I just actually wanted to help since that was the update that given to us. Regarding the</em><br />
<em>compensation we haven't receive a word regarding it yet but I will have it documented since I</em><br />
<em>understand how important this feature is.</em></p>


<p>Surely they must realise that the way this comes across as is not professional it seems condescending especially when dealing with some directly as oppose to communicating at a slower rate on the forums, to then only have my posts deleted. It is a utter
 shambles that this mis-communication is present, "the support team say they don't know when it will be fixed because the technical team hasn't given them the information, i will receive and email in 24 to 48 hours which didn't happen and also tell me to post
 on the forums, I then get my post deleted. I then engage in a second IM chat to be told the same thing and should post on the forums again and then have a second post go unanswered still to this date" &nbsp;It just seems like the entire support service wouldn't
 know an Xbox from a PS4 at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So honestly I'm at my wits end currently and basically have to leave this issue with the seemingly incompetent hand of the teams from Xbox to fix the issue in there own time with no importance or precedent to fixing this issue, so lets just call this the
 entirety of my formal complaint against the whole service provided and the complete backwards logic of deciding to continue to suspend people even though the function is flawed, its like saying "hey you're getting sentenced to day in prison because you were
 naughty, but we messed up and you accidentally serve 4 weeks and you still will be serving this imprisonment until we can fix this issue, but were sorry about this, Ohh and by the way you're still good to pay for this service right? Ohh and were not going
 to give you any word on compensation you will receive to buy us more time and hope you forget about it" Which i probably would if this this issue would actually get fixed but at the moment I feel as though I'm in Xbox's version of
<span>Guantanamo Bay which I'm paying to be here.</span></p>
<span>Guantanamo Bay which I'm paying to be here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Respectfully.</span></p>

 for the issue to be fixed, i got this answer.</p>

<p>lol @buckshot that sounds truly ridiculous, its like their saying "give us more money while we fix an issue we have, just so you can use a service that doesn't function properly because of us"</p>
<p>If a service doesn't work as fully intended due to a fault from the service provider then the people affected by the issue should be compensated fully, not told "well the service works mostly except for one of the most important features of the service required
 for online play and socializing" Could Xbox come up with any more obscene excuses.</p>
<p>To compare, say for instance you pay for a netflix subscription but you don't get any audio and only video, then you contact them about the issue because their service doesn't function properly, but they say just buy another account until we fix this. except
 its 100x worse with with an Xbox account due to it being way more personal and persistent.</p>
<p>Xbox has such a horrific customer service model its laughable, I literally tweeted Xbox support enquiring where to make a formal compliant and they sent me mailing address, honestly what is this the 1920's there system is so outdated lmao "I know let me
 just pull out my quill and ink and write on a piece of hand pressed paper and attach it to a pigeon to send it by the Xbox offices to make a formal compliant" Its almost like a deterrent in its own right, I bet nobody formally complains if they have to send
 letters. Once again just furthering the point that Xbox support is outdated and unprofessional considering they cant even update their practices to the 21st century.</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>The team are currently already looking into this issue, and will provide an update as soon as they are able. There really isn't a whole lot that we can do on the forums, other then reiterate the point that they are looking into the issue, and that they will
 update you as soon as its fixed.</p>
<p>I know it must be frustrating, but there just isn't anything that can be done until the issue is resolved by the support team.</p>

<p>They hand out bans because they know no one can contact them try getting ahold of an enforcement team member they may as well not exist, and they keep laying this claim out that it only includes a small number of players, yet everyday we get more and more
 people on here complaining. This issue is great for Microsoft imagine how much money they have made off of people buying new headsets and controllers because they believe it's a hardware malfunction, and don't realize that it's a glitch no one seems to have
 an answer or to or wants to fix.</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>They hand out bans because people are breaking the ToU's, and doing so results in a ban. To avoid the ban, you just need to follow the rules and you won't have a problem :)</p>

<p>@boxcarracer182 This is so true, like i said in my analogy about being imprisoned for a certain amount of time but having to serve longer because of a fault on Xbox's behalf. Xbox definitely should not be enforcing a temporary suspension if its far from
 a temporary suspension, it just goes to show how misleading this whole situation is and deceiving the support team seems when trying to get answers for a fix as well as answers for any form of compensation that should be received, such a poor disappointing
 business practice from the entirety of Xbox.</p>
<p>@denaz666 You're right nothing can be done on the forums except this is the only place why I can make my point be heard about the utter lack of competence dealing with the support team as well as trying to gauge other peoples opinions who are affected by
 the same issue.</p>
<p>So for future reference read the initial post before coming in and being all polite and grammatically correct answering a question that every single person in this post has already been told, and that nobody in this post is asking, it looks completely condescending
 and misinformed on your behalf, and honestly is laughable considering you think you're trying to help but in actuality you are only stressing a point that has already been made abundantly clear to us "you don't know when it will be fixed and were probably
 not going to get compensated"</p>
<p>Plus you go on to say "They hand out bans because people are breaking the ToU's, and doing so results in a ban. To avoid the ban, you just need to follow the rules and you won't have a problem :)" which is the worst possible thing you could have said but
 your basically implying that we shouldn't break the ToU's which I think we all know is justified leading to why we got suspended, I even found humorous, but then try to pass the blame on to us like its not Xbox's fault for being unable to correctly enforce
 a suspension without a fault incurring after its been served, it is complete backwards logic and you should do yourself a favour and shouldn't comment in posts where you come across as being a condescending with your sarcastic smiley face at the end of a clearly
 sarcastic remark. What a utter joke that Xbox stands behind you as an ambassador on the forums and you word is "supposedly valued" which is pathetic.</p>
<p>@bigjonny83 Quite right they should enforce anything as long as the enforcement system is evidently flawed, and apparently has no easy way of being resolved considering it takes this long to rectify and that so many are affected by the issue. Instead we
 get "Denaz "mr state the obvious" 666" over here telling us things we already know and not have not been asked and being condescending and sarcastic in his demeanour and the remarks he made. GG Xbox, once again furthering your professional stance on dealing
 with this issue.</p>

            On my Windows 7 machine the file user.exe exists here: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\user.exe. Perhaps OffiSyncSetup is not compatible with Windows 7. Best to check the OffiSycSetup FAQs.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t select game mode on fortnite</h2>
                    <p>Can't get in fortnite. When it gets to the game select mode a mouse cursor appears at the top and none of the game modes in the menu highlight so can't select anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>i have fixed the issue.</p>
<p>You have to use an mouse pad - link it with your xbox and use in the settings from Fortnite 'accessibility' or the 4th tab from the left side and use the input option for the mouse pad and take it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Than u have to restart the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have fun best regards.</p>
