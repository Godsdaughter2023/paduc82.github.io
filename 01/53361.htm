<li>I did not try anything initially, except restarting Windows.</li><li>No messages, just no response at all.</li><li>Yes, I had just updated Nvidia GeForce driver, and a couple of Intel drivers, wireless and mgmt engine.&nbsp; I was investigating how to back those out.</li><li>Using a PC, HP with Logitech keyboard.</li><li>I had just used IObit Driver Booster Pro to check and update drivers.</li></ul>
<p>I had tried looking for solutions everywhere and most started with '<span>Select the&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;button,'
 which of course I couldn't do.&nbsp; Couldn't type in Cortana search box, either.</span></p>
<p><span>Eventually, I shutdown the PC.&nbsp; When I powered up, everything was fine.&nbsp; This is not the first time

</p><p><span><span>HDMI cables do support audio signals, but not all HDMI-enabled video cards support audio. If your HDTV has an audio input, you might be able to connect a separate audio cable from your computer's sound card directly to the TV. Otherwise, you'll
 need to connect the audio signal to a different output device, such as external computer speakers or your home stereo system. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</span></span></p>

    <title>Can Google Chrome be installed in standard account without admin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can Google Chrome be installed in standard account without admin rights&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've read that Google Chrome can be installed in a standard account without admin rights. But, at least for me, it has not been the case.</p>
<p>I tried to install it in my standard account on Win7, but it asks for my admin password. When I cancel, it gives me the message "Installation failed. Google Chrome needs administrator privileges to install.".</p>
<p>Why does it ask for my admin password if it doesn't require it?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<br />My name is Ana. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />Approach to modify ownership and permissions for folders and files
<br />1. Find the file or folder you want to delete or access from Windows Explorer. Right click it and choose Properties from menu.
<br />2. Select Security tab from the Properties window and click Advanced button.
<br />3. Continue click Owner tab from the Advanced Security Settings and you can see the current owner is TrustedInstaller.
<br />4. Click Edit button and choose user who you want to change owner. If your account is Administrator account, then choose it. Click OK and the current owner becomes the one you just selected. If you want to delete multiple files in a folder, then check off “Replace owner on subcontainers and objects”
<br />5. Click OK button on all Properties windows and then close it. Again right click the file or folder that you cannot delete and choose Properties again.
<br />6. Click Security tab again and hit Edit button this time.
<br />7. Click user name from the list and user name should be the same as the one who you changed the current owner. If it is not is the list, then click Add button to add it to the list.
<br />8. Select all boxes under Allow in the Permission for Administrator section. Click Apply and then OK button. Then you can delete file or perform actions without getting error message.
<br />

<br />
<br />If this is isolated to only a few files or folders, then you can Try taking Ownership using the Take Ownership shortcut which is a handly tool to add to your right click mouse menu, but should never be used on the WIndows folder for Security reasons:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have lost Admin rights more broadly then try these steps leading up to if necessary testing a new Local Account which sometimes is the only way to escape Account Corruption in Windows 10:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>

<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> 
<br />
<br />It may be necessary to create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC to access the Command Prompt without needing a password:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this.  If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account.  If not try another of these methods: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for you help.&nbsp; I previously tried your solution, making sure 'show thumbnails instead of icons' was checked, and had no change.</p>
<p>What I ended up doing to restore point restoration from January 17th.&nbsp; There was an update Windows 10 pushed, and it caused my problems.&nbsp; Restoring to that Jan 17th point, has solved my problem.</p>

<p>Hi thanks for reply.</p>
<p>I have tried Gearbest.com support but they ignore the complaint.</p>
<p>It is clear they are selling defective articles so I will be taking legal action through Which.co.uk Consumer Rights page.</p>

    <title>unable to view O&#47;U format videos in 360 mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjchen1972  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to view O&#47;U format videos in 360 mode</h2>
                    <p>just got my Acer WMR set. and it seems that I can only play local 360 video files with TV&amp;Movies.</p>
<p>all third party 360 players simply run as desktop apps and cannot enter 360 mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that Microsoft's TV&amp;Movie only supports Side-by-side 360 format, but not the Over/Under (or Top-down) one.</p>
<p>AFAIK, most VR video players support both formats. Why TV&amp;Movies only supports SBS??</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF MS doesn't allow us users to use 3rd party video player for 360 mode, you at least need to make your own player complete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF TV&amp;Movie does support O/U 360 mode, please inform me how to set the configuration.</p>
<p>IF it indeed doesn't support it, please add this functionality in future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi KJChen1972,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better address your concern, I recommend that you check the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/collections/MixedReality/pc?rtc=1/360-Viewer/9NBB1023SLZF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong> to see a number
 of apps that you can use to open local videos that are <strong>360 enabled</strong>. In this case, I suggest that you install
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/360-viewer/9nbb1023slzf?cid=msft_web_collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">360 Viewer app</a></strong> which you can download from the list. This is so you'd be able to associate video formats that are
 enabled with <strong>360 capabilities</strong>. By following the steps indicated on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028161/windows-10-change-default-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>, you can change the default apps by file type. This way, you'd be able to assign it to
<strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> for videos that you want it to be played to enable the 360 Viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that if the issue still persist, I recommend that you post a feedback by using the
<strong>Feedback Hub</strong>. You can use this <strong><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/filing-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> as a guide in the event that you've done the troubleshooting
 steps recommended and still the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your response, to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>ok...I will try the Feedback Hub, since the one who wrote this reply obviously didn't try the method him/herself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. when I change default video player to a third party player, it works as intended in normal windows mode. BUT when in Mixed Reality mode,&nbsp; photo and Movies &amp; TV are still the ONLY options to open a video file (that can do the Virtual Reality thingy). Things
 work differently in Mixed Reality, don't MS PR staff don't know this???</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. when I try to assign video file type to different default app, Microsoft Edge is not on the list, there's only looking for stuff in windows store...which one is able to do the 360 O/U and free again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it should be so simple, just make your designated video player support Over/Under (Top-down) format, problem solved.&nbsp; the worst purchase I had made in years.</p>

            Hi Faisal, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes during large file operations with SATA HDD</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been having problems with one of my hard drives for a long time (since Windows 7 RTM) and I have been waiting for a solution to pop up on the web, but I figured I should finally ask for help.</p>
<p>Here are my system specs,</p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional 64-bit</p>
<p>PSU: Corsair 650W (650tx)</p>
Mobo: ASUS M2N-SLI Deluxe AM2 NVIDIA nForce 570 (BIOS upgraded to 1701)
<p>CPU: AMD Phenom 9850</p>
<p>RAM: 4x1GB OCZ DDR2 PC2-6400 PLATINUM REV2</p>
<p>Graphics: EVGA NVIDIA 8800 GTX</p>
<p>HDDs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;OCZ Vertex 2 120GB (OCZ-VERT EX2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Seagate&nbsp;Barracuda 7200.10 500GB (ST3500630AS) --&gt; Boot drive (for now)</p>
<p>&nbsp;Samsung Spinpoint F1 750GB (HD753LJ) ***PROBLEM DRIVE</p>
<p>&nbsp;Western Digital Caviar Green 2TB (WD20EARS)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During large file operations (copying/pasting, moving) to/from the problem HDD, the system locks up. Sometimes it recovers during the transfer after waiting several minutes if I am moving only files. However, if I am moving folders (with many small files
 or a few large files) then it is guaranteed to lock up and can take 10 minutes simply to cancel the transfer<em>if possible at all</em>. After cancelling the folder transfer, the system is completely unusable (major lag) and does not complete a successful
 system shut down (I've waited at the "shut down" screen for 30 minutes).</p>
<p>A soft reboot after the system locks up (or becomes extremely laggy) will yield the Samsung HDD being dropped from the BIOS and Windows will stall at the splash screen. Hard power cycling will have the Samsung HDD reappear in the BIOS and Window will load
 without any problems.</p>
<p>A similar problem also occurs when a computer on the LAN (gigabit ethernet) attempts to download shared data on the drive.</p>
<p>I have my system dual booting Windows 7 Prof 64-bit and Windows XP Prof 32-bit. When I am in Windows XP the Samsung HDD works perfectly normal, file transfers and all. (I've been booting into XP to backup files and then booting back into 7 *sigh*) However,
 with the new SSD, I want to drop my dependence on XP and clean install only Win7 without risking locking up my system while accessing the drive, which could cause errors.</p>
<p>I've checked for errors and bad sectors on the Samsung HDD, and it is in perfect condition. My BIOS is up to date. I even installed&nbsp;KB976972 in case it was somehow related (closest thing I could find in the knowledge base). But the problem still persists.
 Also for reference, click <a href="http://windows7forums.com/windows-7-support/6521-windows-7-rc1-x64-crashes-during-large-file-operations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;to read another case of what seems to be the exact same problem (the problem was not solved in the forum).</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>

            Technically the problem isn't solved (problem in nForce SATA), but it has been circumvented (JMicron SATA instead) and that's good enough for me.

            <p>Hey Gerard here,</p>
<p>Thanks for the speedy reply whenever I try to diagnose the problem the computer says my diagnostic policy service isn't working and now it does't even give me limited access to networks any more. My wireless adapter in an Atheros AR5B125 Wirelss Network
 Adapter&nbsp;and it is fully updated, I wouldn't be able to update it normally only my friend has a usb stick that connects to the internet. I have tried disabling and then enabling it but it always turns out the same, it won't connect. To answer your first question
 also I don't get an error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for time,</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry I haven't been able to reply, prior to this issue, no I have not made any changes.&nbsp; I am now having issues with Device Manager giving me a error message every time I turn my system on.&nbsp; I ran the TDSS killer, it found nothing.&nbsp; I ran the Malicous
 software removal tool from Windows, nothing.&nbsp; I run a full scan with Norton 360 ver. 5.0 weekly.&nbsp; Running fullscan from Microsoft Security Essential as I type this.&nbsp; Will return to let you know what it finds.

</span></span></span><span>Did you try to restore the computer to a previous point when it was working fine?</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to access ‘Device Manager’?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check the status in Safe Mode, if ‘Safe Mode’ works fine when computer is idle then set the computer to clean boot mode
 to check for software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the following article on how to start computer in ‘Safe Mode’.</span></p>

<p>
<span>(Steps in the article also applicable for vista and XP operating systems)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the steps in the link mentioned below to set the computer to ‘Clean boot’ state.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span>

<h2>            Right click on Start Button</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Friends,</p>
<p>When I try to right click on start button to access EXPLORE, SEARCH options etc., mouse's right click does not work. However, right click works once I left click on&nbsp;start button or on any other icons on the desktop, but not on the START button itself. I
 am suspecting I may have to fix it by modifying registry keys, but not positive on that. Any help is greatly appreciated to fix this problem. Thank you and have a good one.</p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Lorien,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response for my question. However, this problem is persisting me for a very long time, probably for more than 6 months. I was hoping the solution has to do with updating Registry keys or something like that. If the solution is to do with
 restore points, then I am afraid, it may not b an option for me as the exact time of the problem is escaping my mind. However, I do thank you for trying to help me. Have a good one.</p>

<p>I think there may be an issue with your mouse driver - but I'm not sure (though it is my first choice for the cause of the problem).&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click
 on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need
 to get drivers (and you should <strong>do so for at least your mouse</strong> and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact,
 you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Another option is to swap this mouse with one you know works properly and see if the new one has the same problem.&nbsp; If it has the same problem, then the issue
 is with the computer.&nbsp; If the new mouse works fine, then the issue is with the mouse or its driver.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they
 can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;the mouse&nbsp;(Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt
 starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></p>
<span><span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span></span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>How to multitask in Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hypatia42  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to multitask in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've had Windows 8 for just over a week and I've watched every tutorial video I can find. I'm still frustrated. Someone, please help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I work at a university and part of my job is composing PDFs that include complex equations pulled from multiple other sources. I frequently need to search for terms, open a database, and use a scientific calculator all in order to complete one task. Under
 Windows 7 and Vista I was easily able to keep all of these programs open at the same time and decide how large each program should appear. I was able to stack the calculator over internet explorer while keeping the PDF open and entering formulas. Now I am
 forced to split the screen between two programs and if anything else is open alongside internet explorer, I am unable to read the data I've found. I am constantly opening and closing programs or cycling in between them. I am losing my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has taken me three hours to create a form with linear algebra examples that would have otherwise taken me at most 40 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Windows 8 becomes widespread in American businesses, it will be the death of productivity. Entire industries will grind to a halt! I've googled until my fingers are raw; how can I do my job more effectively with this 2/3 split screen non-sense? Either
 the PDF I'm working on or the Wolfram-Alpha screen&nbsp;is too small to read! My data is impossible to access and work with under these conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**I'm not looking for people to say Windows 8 works great for them, I need real advice on how I can do my job with these bizarre constraints.**</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are more basic multitasking problems too. I do frustrating, stressful work and I enjoy having youtube or music playing the background. If I want to view the video while I work on a Word document, which keeps me calm and happy enough to do my already
 stressful job, I am apparently out of luck? There doesn't seem to be a way to both write up a letter informing a colleague they failed to make a series of citations, and watch a video. Why is this?&nbsp;How can I get this to work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every job I have ever had has required me to be a multitasker. I've answered phones and searched for data, verified orders, checked department catalogs, searched archives, and looked online for relevant citations. This requires at least half a dozen different
 programs.&nbsp;I've developed websites and worked with statistical software. There isn't a single time I could easily do my job with one program open. Honestly, was this entire operating system designed around people who play angry birds and send 'lol' e-mails
 to each other? *Literally* how can I make this work? My office forced me into a Windows 8 computer, how can I use it without pulling my hair out and sobbing after each task?</p>

            I am not sure why you are not able to do this in WIN 8. &nbsp;As i write this, I have Chrome, a PDF file and a calculator all on the same screen and sized and positioned where i can see all of them. &nbsp;The functionality is no different than in WIN 7. &nbsp;Are you
 in the desktop (not the modern UI)? &nbsp;Are you using win 8 pro or RT?
<div><br />
<div>If you are in the modern UI click the tile that says desktop and you will be at a more traditional desktop environment. &nbsp;Traditional explorer is there as well. &nbsp;You'll want to install Adobe reader as well as the stock reader in win 8 is only for the modern
 UI and cant be used on the desktop UI and placed on that screen and sized properly. &nbsp;When opening programs, make sure you open the ones under the desktop app category if you are the desktop as they are the ones that function correctly on the desktop. &nbsp;The
 rest are Modern UI apps and will switch yo back the modern UI when you try to use them.
<div><br />
<div>See my post on "Getting started with WIN 8 with less frustration". &nbsp;I was exactly where you are when I started with WIN 8 so don't give up... you'll be fine.</div>

            <p>Desktop mode is just like previous versions of Windows so you should easily understand that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Modern UI, first make sure you update to Windows 8.1 (if you haven't already). That allows you to open up to 4 programs on a single screen. To use apps side by side, check out this tutorial:

    <title>Why can&#39;t the Windows 8 Calendar do forghtnightly recurrence&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t the Windows 8 Calendar do forghtnightly recurrence&#63;</h2>
                    I'm sure I'm not alone in having events that happen every 2 weeks that I need to enter on my Calendar.&nbsp; With the Windows 8 Calendar it seems the only way to do this is to enter 26 separate events each year as there doesn't seem to be the functionality
 to enter any recurrence between weekly and monthly.&nbsp; The ability to have recurring events for say the first or second monday of each month would be nice too!<br />
<br />
Looks like I need to look for an application that is actually functional :-(<br />

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community, where you can find resolutions for all windows related
 queries.</span></p>
<p><span>It looks like you want to set an reminder for
<span>&nbsp;</span>every 15 days in Calendar app.</span></p>
<p><span>I am sorry to inform you, but there is no such option in the Calendar app of windows
 8 where you can set the reminder for 15 days. You will have to set it manually for every 15 days.</span></p>
<p><span>But I can suggest you something which might help you. You can create two Calendar entries
 with monthly recurrences. (e.g. One on the 1 <span>
&nbsp;</span>and the other on 16)</span></p>
<p><span>Provide us with your feedback within the app:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click anywhere in the app.</span></p>

            Every two weeks is every FOURTEEN DAYS.&nbsp; It is NOT the same as every 15 days then every 13/15/16 days depending on the month!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />

I have come to the conclusion that the Windows 8 calendar is completely and utterly useless and I am looking for an alternative.<br />

Looks like it just shows an existing calendar, so if the existing calendar&nbsp;can do what you want then the W8 Calendar would see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp;mine looks like a Hotmail Calendar and with it you could import a calendar or appointments from other applications such
 as Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then if Outlook can create "bi-monthly appointments"&nbsp;you could probably just import its specifications to see them in the W8 Calendar.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            Yes, this is exactly the point.&nbsp; The Windows 8 'pseudo applications' aren't real.&nbsp; They can't do ANYTHING useful themselves and rely on some other application.&nbsp; That is fine if you want to pass all your data out to the cloud and not have it accessible
 if you don't have internet access.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, some of us don't have guaranteed 24/7/365 access to the internet (several times a year it goes out of service here, sometimes for longer than a day) and would prefer to have our data on our PCs.&nbsp; It seems like Microsoft doesn't want customers
 like me (or at least only if we are willing to pay a lot of extra money).<br />
<br />
And I can't believe how difficult it is to get across that appointments every 14 days are NOT, REPEAT NOT, bi-monthly e.g. 1 Jan, 15 Jan, 29 Jan, 12 Feb....<br />

            Hi there,
<div><br />
<div>I am new to Windows Phone and, like these many others, truly struggling with the lack of a fortnightly recurrence facility (yes, that means every two weeks or every fourteen days).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Previously, I used a number of Nokia Symbian phones going back nearly 10 years (none of these were "smart") and ALL of them supported a recurrent appointment where you could specify
<i>n</i> weeks between occurrences.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After these phones, I used a galaxy mini and the Google calendar straight out of the box also did not support this, but for less than the cost of a cup of coffee I found an EXCELLENT business calendar, which did "n weeks" and a whole lot more.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Given that both Symbian and Android do this, it is obviously a well understood problem domain.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, for a variety of reasons, I recently upgraded to a Nokia Lumia running Windows Phone 8 (amber) to tie in with my Windows 8.1 tablet (hopefully).</div>
<div><br />
<div>And here we are again: back in the stone age with no fortnightly recurrence in the calendar. None of the offered calendars do this as they all simply appear to focus on skinning the existing calendar.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If some user stories will help, please let me know because I will be happy to oblige with a number of different examples.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime I will simply live with the "stone tablet and chisel" option that is the Windows Phone calendar and, month by month, delete every alternate appointment in a weekly series.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When will the Windows Phone support an "n weeks" recurrence (where n is an integer greater than zero)?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi again</p>
<p>good...ish news</p>
<p>I had a moan about the 2 week repeat issue and its a bit of a nuisance bit ive set it up now. I do a rolling two week shift and have done a repeat. You can set it from a pc on the outlook calander then it will sync to the phone. I cant remember the exact
 way but if you fart around doing one day to repeat you can then copy it to tuesday, wednesday etc.</p>
<p>good luck all</p>

            This is absolutely ridiculous! Creating two repeating monthly calendar entries does NOT achieve what we are needing to do. I get paid fortnightly - every 14 days. I need to be able to set a recurring fortnightly appointment as a reminder for pay days.
 Doing it the way you've suggested will create calendar entries on incorrect days. How can you not see that?<br />
<br />
I can't believe that MS continues to fail with the small, everyday things such as this. This should be a standard option in ANY calendar application.
<br />
<br />
I love my Windows phone but MS - you need to get your act together and provide software that does what it should!<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 gone paranoid</h2>
                    <p>I am the only user of a Dell laptop, used as a desktop; out of habit I use a La Cie external hard drive to squirrel away data-folders, in case the Dell goes up in smoke. Used the routine with my Compaq desktop [Win XP, regrettably mothballed] and with the
 current Dell Win. 8.1 because I have no choice.</p>
<p>Connected the external HD, folders are displayed/listed. Wanted to update a document in one and I was on my way to the looney bin again;
<strong>..."file is locked for editing by: UNKNOWN USER, open read-only or open a copy for editing" [I'm the only USER and I did not lock it!]</strong></p>
<p>Opened and edited a copy and tried to save it to/move it to the external hard drive, as is [to drag it into the proper folder later].</p>
<p>WIN 8.1 informs me that <strong>"you'll need the permission of the administrator to do this" [I'm the only user and the administrator too!]</strong></p>
<p>Sanity check: fired up the mothballed desktop [Compaq-Win. XP]; the La Cie external hard drive is working as usual, I can edit&nbsp;document files stored in a folder, I can save onto the external hard drive whatever I choose.</p>
<p>Why is MS updating Win. 8.1 with features sure to cause nothing but misery?? Who needs this?</p>
<p>Please, if you have a solution to deal with this idiocy, share it-I'll be most obliged.</p>

            <p>I got the same problem. I got a new power adapter, same problem. This should be able to be solved, without 4 weeks of service. Did you send it in for service?</p>

            After a week of troubleshooting Apps and Win10 Upgrade, having to do an in-place upgrade again, and continuing to spend hours researching problems... I'm glad to say<br />
THIS WORKED FOR ME!<br />
<br />
My settings were English-US language and my Home Location was Pueto Rico, wher I'm at. I changed it to United States. I also remember Cortana gave me a message about not working for my location and language, or that they didn't correspon to each other.<br />
<br />
I assume this will breakother featuresthat rely on Location... but at leas my Weather Tile still says San Juan, PR.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>For a week I cannot download apps that I had never "purchased" before on Windows 10 devices. I live in Croatia.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; All was working fine for years on multiple Windows 8, 8.1, 10 (1511) PC's and Phones</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; It stops working for downloading&nbsp;previously "nonpurchased" apps&nbsp;a week ago, roughly a month after&nbsp;I bought Lumia in the US (coincidence maybe). I still can download and install apps
<strong>that I had installed before on any device </strong>I had for years (My apps)!</p>
<p>3. <strong>Windows 8.1 phone </strong>can install previously "nonpurhased" apps, and then it becomes "my app" and then I can install it even on Windows 10 Lumia and other 5 computers and tablets!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things that I noticed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked account.microsoft.com. I recently bought Lumia&nbsp;in the US, and it was delivered there to an US address. I also bought games in GB years ago, because&nbsp;back then I&nbsp;couldn't open an account in Croatia. So I have 3 billing options. I want only Croatian,
 and&nbsp;GB and&nbsp;US cannot be deleted!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also since my first Microsoft account was set for GB, (I couldn't choose Croatia back then), I found that my account is still set to GB! I set it to Croatia. But all that happened after Store stopped working in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Local in Regional settings is now&nbsp;set to Croatia, and language to Croatian. I also did all other things people suggested except resetting Windows and opening a new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It must be something with the Microsoft&nbsp;account and Windows 10 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you still install apps that you previously had?</p>
<p>Can you install previously "nonpurchased" apps on&nbsp;Windows 8.1 device (PC or phone), and then install it on Windows 10 device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

    <title>Error 1392 wlan autoconfig not starting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe camel1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1392 wlan autoconfig not starting</h2>
                    I am using Win8/64 on an Asus G75V laptop.&nbsp; The original Atheros WIFI card had too many problems, so I replaced it with an Intel Advanced N 6235 that worked fine for a few days.&nbsp; Now the WLAN Autoconfig service will not start.&nbsp; Some additional observations:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The WIFI adapter is visible in Device Manager and is shown as "working properly".<br />
&nbsp; I am working from the Administrator account.<br />
&nbsp; Wired network works fine.<br />
&nbsp; The driver is v. 15.8.0.5 (4/25/2013) and I got it from the Intel website using their auto install utility.<br />
<br />
How do I resolve this?<br />
&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System error code 1392 means "The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s follow the instructions to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Let’s perform SFC Scan on the computer and check for any missing or corrupted system files.</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open Charms Bar.<br />
b. Type “cmd”without quotes in the search box.<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
d. Type ‘sfc /scannow’ without quotes and hit enter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2: Uninstall the driver from device manager and reinstall it from the manufacturer’s website</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;Type Device manager on the start screen<br />
b.&nbsp;Right click on the driver and select “Uninstall”<br />
c.&nbsp;Restart the computer and install the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> The dependencies on WLAN Autoconfig service must also have been stopped, hence WLAN Autoconfig service&nbsp;is not starting up.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><strong>Try the steps to check Dependencies.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Type Win + R on the keyboard</p>
<p>b. Enter <strong>"Services.msc" </strong>and hit <strong>ok</strong><br />
c. Right-click on <strong>WLAN Autoconfig</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Click on <strong>Dependencies,</strong> you will find all the dependency services under box labeled This service depends on the following system components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: Temporarily disable security software and firewall settings and check
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Note:</font></span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to
 install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back with the result. If the issue is still not fixed, we’ll be glad to assist you further.</p>
