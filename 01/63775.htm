<p>Hey there Victor,<br />
<br />
Sorry if you're having issues with Crash Bandicoot.<br />
<br />
Since that title is an original Xbox title, to play it on your Xbox 360 console you will need an official Xbox hard drive. You will not be able to install the game to your hard drive since original Xbox games don't have that capability.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you have further support needs.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4&#47;Refund request - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard surface4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4&#47;Refund request</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface 4 as a Christmas gift. I gave it to my wife Christmas day and after set up and doing all the updates it seemed fine. After one hour of use the Pen would disconnect and had no screen pointer. Rebooted, it came back. This kept happening.
 I connected&nbsp;Microsoft store support and they did a remote log in and spent hours to try and fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This kept on for days and they finally shipped us a new pen and said this will fix it. It took 7 days to get the pen and after pairing and setup we still had the same problem, Pen would disconnect. Second call to Microsoft store they spent hours by remote
 and in chat trying to fix it, At that point they said is not the Pen but the Surface. They shipped me a replacement Surface I was hoping for miracle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second Surface did the same thing, I had asked for a replacement Surface and Pen that was paired and ready to go but they refused to do that. The Microsoft Store is not easy to deal with and can be rude and not display Microsoft in the best way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had asked for a refund from the second attempt to fix it and many other times after that. They stated no refunds after 30 days PERIOD. I called MS HQ and told them my story and they gave me the Return Dept and nicely they agreed. It is shipped back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time I paid $149.00 to the Microsoft store for accident protection and I no longer need that and wish a refund, They MS store says no way and I have spent hours on the phone and text chat with them. Bill Gates should be ashamed to allow these
 people to treat this loyal customer in the way they have!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get a refund for $149.00 for a Surface that never worked and a service I no longer need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Store chat can not even tell me who the higher ups are and a phone number to call them to by pass them. They say My higher ups are unknown to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help</p>

            <p>Update, I have finally heard from Microsoft and it looks like they will refund my purchase. I also wanted to post my reply as I think it is important for people and customers to see. Thanks to fatou8 for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Hi,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">You have no clue how much I appreciate your help in this matter. Since December I have spent at least 30 plus hours on the treadmill with the Microsoft
 Store and searching for ways not to lose my $2000.00+.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">A special Christmas gift for my wife that would help her to see the screen better than her Surface Pro 3 we bought a few years ago. She only views
 the web, her email and puzzles she gets from MS, not a heavy user.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I have been a loyal Microsoft user since Windows 3.1 and have bought countless Microsoft products and also promote your products and use them for my
 business machines. I was so sad to have to send the Surface4 back I never expected it to not work properly after reading and watching the reviews. I felt so guilty I gave my wife such a useless Christmas gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">The worst part was dealing with the Microsoft Store and also my Assure plan only to be told point blank after 30 days you will get no refund. I kept
 asking who else can I contact please provide me MS HQ phone numbers, I was told they will say the same thing….No Refund. So it made no sense to me to pursue the Issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">After thinking about it I decided to call my local Microsoft office in Washington, DC, I was greeted with a friendly voice I could understand her and
 she allowed me to tell her my story and she referred me to Microsoft HQ, I spoke to the operator who was willing to help and she sent me to the Product Guarantee dept. The person I talked to instantly helped me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I finally reached
 a person I could understand and made me feel like she cared. Unlike the Microsoft Store putting me in loops and hanging up at times and endless chats and remote log-ins, I found my answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I thought buying from the Microsoft Store was like buying from Microsoft HQ and everyone is on the same page, It seems like that is not true. I wonder
 if the two are really connected? Is it possible the Microsoft Store people work on commissions and a refund will reflect in a loss of income for them? Just asking……..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I will never &nbsp;purchase a Microsoft product online from the Microsoft Store again. I do not wish to come off as some crazy guy out to trash people,
 I just wish Microsoft to reflect on how everyday people have to deal with a machine I bought for special gift for my wife.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">I am willing to beta test a Surface4 and Pen since I have experience in this matter and provide feedback to your engineers. If it works we have deal
 and I will purchase it&nbsp;&nbsp; for the second time</span></p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Surface Pro 4 bought from the Microsoft Store Story:</span></p>
<p><span>I posted a few comments before about the Christmas gift I purchased Dec, 2015 for my wife. Surface Pro 4 256GB I7.</span></p>
<p><span>Day one was setup and doing updates etc. After about one hour the pen would disconnect which my wife depends on because of poor eye sight. After reboot it would work for a while. This went on for
 a few days and I finally called Microsoft Store and they did a remote login and after 2 hours they said it was fixed. It was not.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Store continued for days to remote in and tries to fix it and they finally sent me a new pen, 5 days had passed, I paired the new pen and it worked for a while but it lost connection
 just like before. More remote sessions later they said it must be the Surface Pro 4, they shipped a replacement that was not current and it took hours to do the updates Microsoft had. More remote logins.</span></p>
<p><span>Guess what, Pen would still disconnect at random times and reboot was needed. By this time my 30 days was up for a refund which I asked for many many times. I was told point blank no refunds!!!!!
 One tech guy in a remote chat said there nothing more we can do.</span></p>
<p><span>I finally called Microsoft Corporate and explained my problem and they sent me to the Money Back Guarantee Dept. I told them my story and they said ship it back to us and we will refund your money.
 I paid the $60.00 to ship it and thought finally resolved, shipped back 2/29/16.</span></p>
<p><span>UPS delivered it back to me today and Microsoft refuses my request for a credit and I must call the Microsoft Store for a refund, I called them they said no refund period. So here I am stuck again
 with a $2000 machine that still does not work as advertised.</span></p>
<p><span>For some reason the Microsoft Store is cloaked in secrecy. No one there knows the people in charge or will give names and contact information for higher ups. Someone has to be in charge of this Microsoft
 Store Department and not just some off shore people that take phone calls.</span></p>
<p><span>Throw me a bone here who is the man responsible for this Microsoft Store?</span></p>

            <p>Fatou8 I was reached out to and as always the person had no idea what I was asking and asked me to give a detailed report about my request for a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think from the above post and the other posts I have made it is very CLEAR what I am asking. It is always a merry go round when dealing with the Microsoft Store and also Microsoft HQ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be enough support tickets and chat logs etc that go back to 12/19/15 to issue me a full refund for $2034.34 for a product that has failed to perform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fatou8 show this forum that the Microsoft Store will do the right thing and stop making me ride the hamster wheel.</p>
<p>I will not get stuck with a $2036.00 paper weight that my wife can not use.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already asked this question, but none of them worked. I have even had a chat with Microsoft and all they could do for was to give me a link where I should be able to find the answer. What surprised me during the chat was that I was asked what kind
 of printer (as in a physical printer) I had. The Windows Print to PDF does not involve a physical printer, yet they asked me this anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that whenever I right click on, say, an open html file and click Print, I have several options, Print to PDF being one of them. Unfortunately it does not work. The message I get is</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your printer has experienced&nbsp;an unexpected configuration problem - the code is 0x80070005.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I look at Devices and Printers, I see 'Error' under Print to PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect&nbsp;that this problem started after the April update (1803) because the feature worked without any problems before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            WIndows 10 support is a joke</h2>
                    So after sitting over an hour in a queue, I got a guy who had no idea what he was doing, he wasted over 3 hours of my time, telling me things that I even proved weren't true. He basically told me since my official windows 10 home had programs that aren't
 compatible with it, I will continue to experience constant crashes and bsods. Since I no longer have my windows 8.1 cd key and for SOME REASON, microsoft won't let you roll back to 8.1 after one month, I was basically told I have two choices, have my computer
 be physically damaged by all the constant crashes, even though this is supposed to basically be the retail version of windows 10, or fork over 40 dollars to microsoft to redowngrade to windows 8.1. I am honestly disgusted by the level of support I received
 today. He even ignored me for up to 20 minutes at a time and even went on his lunch break during chat. Mark H with the supposed 5 star rating, I have no idea how he has that because he has no idea what he's doing and he swore he

<p>You mentioned you have Windows 10 Home before</p>
<p>Would you know what is the edition of windows that you have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a mismatch</p>
<p>Refer to this link</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10738/windows-10-get-help-with-activation-errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Home to Pro</p>
<p>There are 2 ways to upgrade</p>
<p>Via windows store $99 and $199 for US. Price varies per location</p>

<p>Hi Eris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, I own a brand new laptop with Window 10 Pro. Then I replace my hard disk with SSD and installed with Window 10 Home. Now I was trying to enter my Window 10 Pro license (comes with the laptop), but it turn out to be error&nbsp;0xC004F050.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your link, but it doesn't work out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window store seems allow me to enter my existing license key to redownload window 10 pro, but it shows my key has some problem,&nbsp;0xC004F050.&nbsp; Is this because I did not deactivate from previous hard disk?</p>

<br />
<br />Since you have your Product key, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

<p>Hi Sumit,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troublehshooter option doesn't show up. I could not check it this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it is because I have activated window 10 home, so troubleshooter doesn't appear?</p>

<h3> rws55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Camera Roll</h2>
                    I am not interested in using One Drive to store items.&nbsp; I have saved my images to the camera roll for This PC and they still end up in One Drive.&nbsp; One Drive is now full so I deleted the images out of it.&nbsp; That caused other folders in the camera roll on
 This PC to disappear.&nbsp; I found them after I did a search under Users and also found a whole other camera roll located there.&nbsp; What in the world is happening?&nbsp; I just want to store images on This PC and perhaps to an external hard drive.&nbsp; How do I accomplish
 this?

<p>Hi Mistaken, Try doing a hard reset on your console by holding the power button down on the front of the console until it turns off then unplug it from the outlet for 30 seconds. After 30 seconds plug back in and power back on and hopefully everything should
 be back to normal.</p>

<h3> alexanderpuhl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I not play media from a USB stick</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously, this is how I started hating on Apple back in 2000, the iPod wouldn't let me use it as a mass storage device without messing with the registry, didn't like how Apple was trying to tell us the best way to use their products. Now Microsoft is doing
 the same... Who made the decision to keep this basic feature out?</p>
<p>Can't seem to find the USB drive.</p>
<p>If there is a way, can somebody tell me? I've been looking all over xbox.com and all the other websites. I could spend an hour or two trying to get that POS Windows Media Player to find my libraries and then sit their and wrestle with it to just stream to
 the xbox. But no, i'm done with that, takes forever to setup and fix later. You have to have both devices on, this should be just an option, not the only way.</p>
<p>I've inserted the thumb drive. cannot find it anywhere. It's not on the home screen. The drive is not showing up in "My games or apps"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried looking in the Xbox video, this isn't xbox video like on the 360 anymore, this is an online service that has nothing to do with playing local videos.</p>
<p>Went to the store section, not under "Movies and TV", not too surprising here.</p>
<p>Obviously not under friends.</p>
<p>Not under Pins either.</p>
<p>If the console can play media from a USB stick, where is it?</p>

<p>Ok, so here's the solution. LEAVE the Xbox one turned on, then pull the external storage device out and push it back in. The "next generation" Xbox One will only then, realize that something is in the port, and prompt for you to download the "Media Player"
 app.</p>
<p>Without this "Media Player" app, you will never figure out what's wrong.</p>
<p>You see, my mistake was inserting the external storage device, and THEN turning the Xbox one on. Normal computers and even an xbox 360 wouldn't get tripped up over this, it would still show up, but not the next generation xbox one, can't do it. Gotta keep
 it on if this is your first time so you can be notified to download the missing app.</p>
<p>So now that I've been told to download "Media Player" seems to work great, so far. I guess better late than never Microsoft on such a basic feature. Who made the decision that this wasn't an important feature?</p>

<p>When I start the laptop, I get internet-connection &nbsp;WiFy and it remains stable. Sometimes it gets cutoff, and I am not able to connect it back , unless I restart the laptop.Then the connection remains stable. Is there any way, I can restore the connection

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Intermittent network connection might occur due to outdated network driver. It might also happen due to corrupt TCP/IP settings for the wireless network or conflict from other applications running on the laptop.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try these following methods and check, if the issue still persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><strong>Method 1: </strong></span></span>&nbsp;</span></p>

Perhaps you have left something out...</p>
<p>Do you have dual-boot or something so you have WIndows 7 32-bit and Windows 7 64-bit installed and when you attempt to "Run As Administrator" in your Windows 7 32-bit installation, it fails (with what message?)</p>
<p>Or are you saying you cannot run Internet Explorer 32-bit as an administrator, only the 64-bit version?</p>
<p>64-bit Internet Explorer executable (on a 64-bit Windows 7 installation) would be found here: "C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>32-bit Internet Explorer executable (on a 64-bit Windows 7 installation) would be found here: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you right-click on either of those and choose to "Run as Administrator", it should work fine.</p>

<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to start a program automatically in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Explorer.exe doesn't start automatically for some unknown reason so I need to start it this way instead of using Task Manager, File, Open to start it each time the computer restarts.&nbsp; I tried Group Policy but that didn't work as the things that were supposed
 to be there were not.&nbsp; Apparently Task Scheduler can be used for this and although its starting automatically I have no idea where it is.&nbsp; I looked in C:\Windows where I thought it might be and also used Search but its probably an abbreviated version of Taskscheduler.exe.&nbsp;
 Hard to find if you don't know the name!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the problem description, I understand that you have query regarding Zip/unzip program in Windows 8.1. I will certainly help you to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files. In Windows, you work with zipped files and folders in the same way that you work with uncompressed files and folders. Combine
 several files into a single zipped folder to more easily share a group of files.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1 Zip/unzip program is not required to compressed the file you may use the built in feature of Windows 8.1 in order to extract the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the kb article mention below and check if it helps.

 to get him to turn around, the most difficult part when soloing.&nbsp; The other times, I never made it to the corner.&nbsp; Stupid maggots!</p>

<p>I think there is a level different between playthrough 1 and 2. &nbsp;And as such, the loot he drops when killed is also different between the playthroughs. &nbsp;I would recommend doing it on playthrough 2 with a good team, and playthrough 1 if you are just looking

<p>According to most glitch still works, though never tried it myself can't say for sure. Glitch or no glitch Craw can be killed with almost any character. Saw CRYSIS PSYCHO do it with just a hunter, no glitch / no modding.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Folder Permissions - Blocked - Access Is Denied after installing App from the Windows Store</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have always used a local admin account to login before and after Windows 10 upgrade. Today for the first time I &nbsp;bought and installed an App from the Windows store. It asked me to sign in with Microsoft account and setup the payment type,..etc.<br />
<br />
After I downloaded and run the App, I have noticed that all in a sudden the current login account lost the permission to the folders such as pictures, documents and my ICould drive and Dropbox all stopped working, saying I don't have the permission.<br />
<br />
When I opened up to see the User Account setting from the Control Panel, my local administrator account is GONE, in the same session!! Installation App did replace the account with the Microsoft account that I used to access the Windows store.<br />
<br />
There is an option allow me to switch to the local account so I enter my original account name and it has switched, however I do not get the correct permissions back to the directories!!<br />
<br />
Have anyone noticed about the current account being switched without any notification without any resolution on the permission?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I can't use any of my login &nbsp;directories. When I try to save a text file in Document folder, I get the following message:<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
C:\Users\&lt;LOGIN&gt;\Documents\test.txt<br />
You don't have permission to save in this location.<br />
Contact the administrator to obtain permission.<br />
<br />
Would you like to save in the Documents folder instead?<br />
<br />
[Yes] [No]<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
I AM inside this login session &lt;LOGIN&gt; which has the Administrator role and privileges, and I AM saving in THAT folder! The directory [C:\Users\&lt;LOGIN&gt;\Documents] &nbsp;properties security tab confirms Administrator Group has full control, &nbsp;yet I have lost access
 to all directories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to Windows 10, I used only possibly plainest &nbsp;options, no new account with emails and no App setups. My original local admin login from Windows 7 worked until I installed an App from Windows Store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>This does not help at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spend already three days in trying to upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 because of a failure of Windows Update. Even a standalone program for updating from Microsoft had put my CPU in overdrive for hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally i found a way to download the install program but it blocked again while updating files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's only with a startup configuration with a few files that i could upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to copy my Business Contact Manager files from my external hard disk to the users/application folder, but guess what 'ACCESS DENIED'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft you have presented us a wonderful OS, but did you tested it before launching?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Social media is a strong tool to ventilate ones anger, i hope i can restrain myself of doing this.</p>

            <p>I ran the account troubleshooter, but it did not help. The logon user's directories are still blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check the effective access in the security panel for those directories, Windows reports that the logon user has full control, &nbsp;as one would expect. However they are all blocked from the user in actuality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That alone itself seems like a software defect to me. The issue that I have described in my first message is a common usage scenario should have been in the QA test plan before the roll out, please advise if it is a known bug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-- scenario --</p>
<p>- (user) upgrade from Windows 7 to 10 keeping Local Admin User account, no Apps option.</p>
<p>- (user) buy an App, (buying process switches to Windows email account</p>
<p>- (Windows) Original Local Admin Account is removed and replaced with Windows account without any notification.</p>
<p>- (Windows) Directory accesses are removed (blocked) for the current logon.</p>
<p>- (user) switches back to Local Admin Account as Logon User.</p>
<p>- (Windows) Local Admin User Login is still blocked from it's own user directories, even after restart, reboot,..etc</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still facing this issue then try the following:</p>
<p>
If you get a message denying access when you try to open a file, here are some options you can try:
</p><p>Check the permissions of the file or of the folder the file is saved in. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Right-click the file or folder, and then click <span>
Properties</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Security</span> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span>Group or user names</span>, click your name to see the permissions you have.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>I have had this exact issue and nothing works to fix-so frustrating being a lab rat sometimes. But you're idea to create a new folder and call it Save Documents"&nbsp;-- a logical name--&nbsp; WORKED for me , so thank you for the fix. Maybe now I can get back to work
 instead of chasing my documents around!</p>
