<p>
</p><p>I have two Users set up on my PC. &nbsp;When it loaded up, it defaulted to the other user (I don't use it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just clicked on the Start (Windows) button, went to the top of the menu, and logged into my main user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was there, all my programs, just like I left it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem, except I don’t have the password for the second user.</p>
<p>When I turn the computer on, I can only try to log in with the second user and not my user, which I used to install the update from Windows 7.</p>
<p>The two accounts were local, and I upgraded from the notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to tell windows I want to log in as another user - without loging in as the first one before?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Ronan,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please be informed, there is no such setting, instead you will have to create a new user account with administrative privileges and delete the old user account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Press </span><span>WinKey</span><span> + Q, type
</span><strong><span>user accounts</span></strong><span> and click on the result.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then select your User Account &gt; Click <strong><span>Manage another account</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the following window, click <strong><span>Add a user account option</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now we have to create a local account user. So after clicking
<em><span>Add an account</span></em>, click <strong><span>Sign in without a Microsoft account (Not recommended)</span></strong>, then click<strong><span>Local account</span></strong>. Fill the details on the screen so appeared for adding local account. Click
<strong><span>Finish</span></strong> when done.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows Key + Q</strong> and type <strong>
cmd</strong>, for the search results, click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Type following command and hit
<span>Enter</span> key: <strong>shutdown /r /o</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The previous step will result your system to boot into
<em><span>Safe Mode</span></em>. After getting into <em><span>Safe Mode</span></em>, press
<strong><span>Windows Key + Q</span></strong>, type <strong><span>user accounts</span></strong>, and pick the same from results so appear. You would have now two accounts on your system; first you’re issued admin account and second the local account which you’ve
 created in <em><span>step 2</span></em>. Select local account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Now click <strong><span>Change the account type</span></strong> link in following window:</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Moving on, change the account status from <strong>
<span>Standard</span></strong> <strong><span>to</span></strong> <strong><span>Administrator</span></strong>. Click
<strong><span>Change Account Type</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In this way, the new local account we’ve created has been changed to Administrator. Now you can restart your machine and log into this account with administrator rights. Since you have administrative privileges now; so you can back up your documents
 from the old administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Finally, delete the old admin account and switch to Microsoft account to synchronize your settings with new administrative account. Your system will now act normally with full admin rights in your hand.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the reply. I finaly solved my problem by tracking the person who created the account and retrieving the password from him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m not sure your solution would have worked, as the first step implies I would have to be logged in to the computer, and it wasn’t the case as I didn’t have the password to the only remaining account on the computer (the account I used previously having
 disappeared during the win10 update).</p>

<p>It's no longer available from Microsoft. You need to buy it from someplace like Amazon.</p>
<p>

<h2>            XBox one randomly signs in</h2>
                    I have my account signed into my PC and my Home Xbox One. Periodically, while my grandpa and I are playing games together (Him on my xbox, me on my PC) my account will sign into the xbox, kicking my off of the PC because I'm "using this product somewhere
 else." I have set my xbox to require my password to sign in every time and this has not solved the issue. This is quite aggravating, please help.

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/26eb99e2-4038-479b-8f64-e837dd1fd354" title="TristanLittle1">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Xbox support forums team. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that while you and your grandpa are gaming together simultaneously (Him on your Xbox, you on your PC) your account will
</p>
<p>
</p><p>sign&nbsp;into the Xbox kicking you off your PC because you're "using this product somewhere else."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I&nbsp;would like to ask, Is your&nbsp;grandpa using&nbsp;his own&nbsp;Gamertag / Microsoft account on the Xbox console? And, are you 100% sure that
</p>
<p>
</p><p>you've completely logged out of the console before your grandpa signs into the Xbox? Let us know. I would recommend
</p>
<p>
</p><p>deleting both profiles from the Xbox console and redownloading the profiles back onto the console. (<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to add or

</a>to see if that resolves the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that helps! We look forward to hearing from you! </p>

            Yes, he is signed into his own gamertag, and I have set the xbox up to not sign me in at launch.&nbsp;<br />

I will try the delete/download accounts later tonight.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply. Is there a chance that the controller itself being used on the Xbox One could be assigned to your Gamertag so when its turned on it signs you in automatically? You can go to your Settings under the Account section there is a "Sign in,
 Security, and Passkey" section. Press "A" on it and locate the tab that says "This controller signs in". And make sure that is set to "Nobody". Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may seem like an odd thing but do you use a Kinect with our console? I set up facial recognition for my brother in laws Kinect to sign into my account way back when. I have since gotten my own console, but occasionally if I walk through the room or
 my brother in law, who arguably looks a little bit like me, this feature will still log me in. Just a though about something I have dealt with in the pass. If it is invalid, apologies for my interjection. I hope your issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another thing that I can think of you is it actually signing you into the xbox there that your grandfather is playing is there a pop up that actually says that you are signed in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing that you are playing a xbox play anywhere game and once you are signed into the account on another device and playing that same game it will kick you out of the game on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your grandfather does not see the popup saying that you have been signed in there at that xbox that means someone else is signing into your account on their xbox.</p>

========================================<br />
Did you try to drag/drop the photos to change the order?<br />
<br />
When your project is complete and you save it...the <br />
resulting file will be a Video file...not individual photos.<br />
<br />
The following tutorial explains how to save as a WMV <br />
video file.<br />

<br />
Once you have the .WMV file saved...you can view it<br />
in Windows Media Player, share it with others and <br />
use it to create a Video DVD with Windows DVD Maker.<br />

    <title>Cumulative Update has failed to install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barryfox_22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cumulative Update has failed to install</h2>
                    <p>5 times. The one I am talking about is KB3081444. It has tried to install automatically in the middle of the night and I have manually done the restart to trigger it twice now. It goes through the process and does an automatic restart as expected. I have
 watched it go through the process and on the restart that should bring the computer back up it gets to 59%, hangs and then reboots again. Following that it displays a message that it has been unsuccessful and is restoring the previous settings, which it does
 successfully with no other side effects that I can detect. However, when I sit to watch what happens I burn up a bunch of time without getting a proper result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then it sits in the queue to try again later, which it does. </p>
<p>
</p><p>No other updates have failed since the upgrade so there is something in this one that my system doesn't like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is pretty straightforward but I am running Norton Internet Security for virus protection. I haven't tried turning it off to see if that is an issue.</p>

            <p>Well, I did the first solution and ended up with the same result. Before I do the second suggestion I will have to read through all those instructions a few more times as that is a lot of effort to go through for something that usually works cleanly. Maybe
 I'll go looking for the file and get rid of it and maybe get a fresh download. It installed correctly on my tablet without any intervention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the advice.</p>

            <p>Well, I went through the clicks and performed a clean boot (at least as far as I could see it was - the included link has not specific Windows 10 guidance). Although there are no specific Win 10 notes in the instructions I followed the win 8.1 set and found
 the System Configuration utility which seemed to have the place to do the steps in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But&nbsp; . . . . it was summarily unsuccessful. The restarts all were pretty much identical and it stalled again at 59% and then reverted back to the previous versions and restarted again (many times) to get back to where I am. It has done this every day now
 and failed every time. Consistency at the very least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I need to find a way to get this update off my system or marked to not install and then wait for a future version that may actually work on this computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not go through the process of starting each service one at a time to see if it cures it as the time it takes to find out if it works (when unsuccessful) is on the order of 20 minutes by the time it tries to update, fails, restores and then restarts
 at least 3 time before it goes through cleanly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a better way. Can I do a reinstall to skip the update and just get the current full version?</p>

            <p>I received an automated email asking me to post on here. But there isn't much to post. The next cumulative update has also failed (numerous times) so I have just deferred those and the intermediate ones are installing OK. Really not too sure where to go
 from here. I'd be happy to let someone from Microsoft poke around on my computer but the chances of ever getting connected to them is very slim so I will just move on for now and hope everything else keeps on going. At some point I'll maybe do a reinstall
 and hope that cleans things up. My tablets all seem to update fine but something on my main machine is an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I could disconnect from the Internet and disable my virus protection and see if that is an issue. But, I use the same protection software on my tablets and have no issues on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's where I'm at.</p>

<h2>            AMD Radeon HD 6700M not working with Windows 8</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 8 not too long ago and every time I start up my computer I get a message saying there's a&nbsp;comparability&nbsp;issue. I have tried following the steps and downloading the software from the AMD website, but it wont open either. When I go
 into device manager and check the driver it says it's all up to date so I don't know what to do. Any ideas?

            <p>I had the same problem but doing the following resolved it for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall all ATI Related Drives.</p>
<p>2. Update the HD 3000 graphics driver(part of optional update of Windows 8) to the latest.</p>
<p>3. Then go to hp.com, Support &amp; Drivers,&nbsp;give the laptops product number and download the latest Display driver for Windows 8 and install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this you should be able to see switchable graphics in the Desktop context menu and it should work fine(Atleast it did for me)</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I close the lid of my Surface Book 2, the lid didn't stick to the keyboard as firm. It can be open just by lifting my finger. Will it cause a big problem in the future, because I know a case which the lid of the SB2 just fail to stick to the keyboard
 when close?</p>

    <title>Locking computer prevents monitor turning off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rcberg3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locking computer prevents monitor turning off</h2>
                    Problem:<br />
So here's the basic problem, my laptop's built in monitor will not turn off when the screensaver is enabled with the option to show the login screen when resumed.&nbsp; What actually happens is that the screensaver kicks in and the monitor turns off for a little
 bit when its supposed to.&nbsp; But, in under a minute, windows seemingly turns the monitor back on and displays the log in screen as if I had moved the mouse.&nbsp; In the power settings, the monitor is set to turn off after 5 minutes and the screensaver is set to
 turn on in 1 minute with the screensaver set as blank.&nbsp; I also have sleep, hibernate, and hard drive turn off completely disabled when the computer is plugged in.<br />
<br />
Ways I have trouble-shooted:<br />
<ul>
<li>If I disable the option to have the screensaver to go to the login screen upon being resumed, the monitor turns off and stays off until I want it.&nbsp;
</li><li>If I manually lock the computer (either with windows+L or using the rundll32.exe command) the monitor will not turn off either.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>I have tried it with an external monitor, and the built in disabled, and the external displays the same issues.
</li><li>I have gone through the device manager and disabled all devices from being able to wake up the computer
</li><li>I have tried new drivers from laptopvideo2go and still nothing. (dell has not made any drivers for this computer since XP.&nbsp; I ran vista on this computer perfectly from day 1 (had the bill gates signature edition) with stock drivers and I may note that this
 issue did not occur in vista). </li><li>I have tried unplugging my logitech g500 mouse. </li><li>I have turned off all programs running (did a restart with diagnostic startup selected from msconfig)
</li></ul>
I am out of ideas at the moment.&nbsp; What I need is to have the monitor turn off <em>
and </em>have the computer locked.&nbsp; what could be an option is to have the rundll32.exe lock automated task run after the monitor is turned off, but I have not yet figured out a way to have it run in such a way (selecting "run when idle" as a trigger doesn't
 work.&nbsp; perhaps a trigger for it to run a set amount of time after the screen saver kicks in is a possibility, but I don't know).<br />
<br />
So I turn to you all here at answers. Please help or advise.<br />

<p>I have this problem on a fresh Dell M6500 laptop running Windows 7.&nbsp; Exactly the same symptoms.&nbsp; It looks like a bug either in Windows or in the video driver.&nbsp; When the computer displays the login screen, if the monitor is off it wakes-up.</p>
<p>Just to clarify the original poster's description:</p>
<p>1) Set the monitor to go off after 3 minutes.<br />
2) Set the "On resume, display login screen" setting to 4 minutes.</p>
<p>The monitor will go off after 3 minutes, then wake one minute later.</p>
<p>I lean toward this being a Windows issue, not a driver issue, since the original poster has an nVidia card while I have an ATI card.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t install new updates after SP2 is installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a problem with updating my windows. This started after a made a factory reset. Here's the whole story:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a some what old laptop (8 years). It came with a factory installed Vista with service pack 1 installed. Over the years I have made a few factory resets (every 2-3 years). I've never had problems doing so till now. What happens now is that I can't
 move past SP2. I tried two different ways, neither of them worked. After the reset I first uninstall a bunch of stupid programs that came with the laptop, then defragment and then tried two different ways of proceeding. I tried using windows update, installed
 over 100 updates, kept installing updates until finally i was offered service pack 2, installed it successfully but then no more updates were offered. Then I tried a different approach - a new reset, uninstall, defragment and then downloaded and installed
 SP2 from the download center directly. And again the same thing happens. As soon as install SP2 I check for updates, get the new update agent and nothing happens after that. It keeps looking for new updates all day long (using ~50% of the processor all the
 time). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read quite a few articles and discussions but couldn't find anyone with the same problem (most of the users reports certain error codes which is something I can't do). I tried the Fix it tool - it doesn't do anything! Every time I run it, it finds errors
 - sometimes 2, other times up to 5. Sometimes it reports all of them fixed, other times it reports Missing or corrupt files not fixed. Whatever the results though I restart and when I try to check for updates again it's the same story again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I tried manually installing IE9 as soon as SP2 is installed (I understand it's not supported under SP1) but the installation fails. I was expecting it to be offered in the updates but since I don't receive any updates I tried installing it myself. Not
 sure if it's related (though I assume it is) but Defender's not able to check for new definitions either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? May be the registry is corrupt or some of the files the update agent is using are corrupt? There's currently no antivirus program installed that might be blocking anything. I haven't touched Windows Firewall in any way so everything must
 be set to defaults.</p>

            <p>Did you figure this out? I ran into the exact same issue... restoring an old notebook to give to a family member, and every time I'd get to the point of installing SP2 and a newer windows update agent right after, I couldn't install anymore updates. It would
 hang "checking for updates" forever. Tried twice, same problem. However, I tried some things differently the third time and got past the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you still need some help and I'll reply with what I did.</p>

    <title>How to Auto-Login Windows Live Family Safety on Monitored Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yordicus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Auto-Login Windows Live Family Safety on Monitored Account</h2>
                    Greetings!<br />
<br />
I am seeking assistance with a hopefully minor request in regards to the functionality of Windows Live Family Safety on a Windows 7 Enterprise install.<br />
<br />
I have configured an Administrator account that is not monitored, as well as a limited guest account with the intention of monitoring the guest account. The problem I have been encountering is, upon bootup and login to the guest account, Windows Live Family
 Safety does not initialize. Additionally, when I get&nbsp;the service&nbsp;to start up, it prompts for the login ID and password of the WLFS monitoring account before it actually initializes the monitoring.
<br />
<br />
I have tried the following steps thus far to no avail:<br />
- Using Services.msi, changed Parental Controls item to launch Automatically--this failed to start the service<br />
- Attempted to add "fsui.exe" to both C:/ProgramData/.../Startup and C:/Users/.../Startup--this fails to start the service<br />
- When I attempt to manually initialize WLFS on the guest account, it prompts me for my monitoring account username and password<br />
<br />
I must be doing something wrong, as it does not make sense to me that WLFS should need to be re-initialized&nbsp;with the parent/monitor credentials upon every reboot.
<br />
<br />
Is there a way to automatically initialize Windows Live Family Safety on Windows 7 for a limited guest account, without requiring parent/monitor credentials to activate the Web Filters?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time,<br />
<br />
- Joe C.

            Hello, Neha--thank you for your detailed response! <br />
<br />
I have run through these steps, but the problem that I am trying to resolve persists. I am not certain my request was clearly stated. Your steps removed the password associated with the limited Windows user account. Additionally, after the password was removed,
 your steps detailed adding that Windows user account to the Windows Live Family Safety monitoring. These steps did not achieve the intended goal. What I am hoping to do is as follows:<br />
<br />
- Have a user log into a limited password-protected account that is actively being monitored by Windows Live Family Safety<br />
- Upon the&nbsp;guest user&nbsp;logging in, I need Windows Live Family Safety to automatically initialize and activate Web Filters<br />
<br />
After following your steps, the user does not require a password to log into the local Windows account (OK, but not what I was requesting). Upon login, Windows Live Family Safety fails to initialize, and I am able to navigate to websites that I've added to
 the monitoring account via the web UI. To initialize Web Filters manually, I seem to be required to do the following:<br />
<br />
- Upon rebooting, log into limited account<br />
- Test navigations&nbsp;show that web filters are NOT active<br />
- Navigate to Start&gt;Windows Live Family Safety--this prompts me for the Administrator password<br />
- Now, the "Sign in to Windows Live Family Safety" prompt displays, requiring the login credentials for the WLFS monitoring account<br />
- After entering this information, it shows a list of the local Windows accounts, and shows that the limited account is being monitored (check box under "Monitor account" is selected)<br />
- Clicking next, I am required to associated the local Windows account with the account name listed in the WLFS Web UI monitoring account<br />
- Once I match these again and press OK, it prompts me that since the limited account is currently logged into, Web Monitoring will be activated the next time this user logs on--this is not true however, because Web Monitoring immediately activates and the
 websites I have blocked within the WLFS monitoring account on the web UI are confirmed as being blocked<br />
- After these steps are performed, web monitoring works as intended, however if the computer is restarted, the entire process needs to be repeated<br />
<br />
I would like the above steps to be performed automatically so that whenever a user logs into the limited account (with or without a password for that local Windows account), they are actively being monitored without requiring&nbsp;further credentials for Windows
 Live Family Safety to initialize.<br />
<br />
I appreciate your assistance! Please let me know if further clarification is needed, and thanks again!!<br />
<br />
- Joe<br />

    <title>Windows 7 randomly dismounts a drive. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shortfuse2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 randomly dismounts a drive.</h2>
                    <p>I have four hard drives on my computer.&nbsp; C: is a 2TB Toshiba, F: is a 500MB Western Digital (WDAADS-00S9B0), G: is a 1GB Western Digital (WD10EARX-32N0YB0), and the fourth is for my Ubuntu OS.&nbsp; I'm using 16 gigs of memory with whatever virtual space Windows
 uses on C: and a quad-core AMD processor at 3 gHz.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 7 Pro, SP 1 with all drivers and updates current as of 12/26/2014.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some unapparent reason, Windows will dismount my G: drive.&nbsp; It won't bother with C: or F: at all, though.&nbsp; I can only get it to remount G: by going to Device Manager and scanning for hardware changes.&nbsp; Then it discovers G: and re-mounts it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to recode home movies and make slideshows with files stored on G: using Nero 2014 but most of the projects fail because of this dismounting problem.&nbsp; If I try recoding with something on C: as the source, I don't have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adjusting the power scheme to keep the computer from shutting off hard drives or activating screen savers, although it shouldn't be shutting down any drives that are in use.&nbsp; I've also run chkdsk /f on my G: drive in case there is something going
 wrong with the MBR or file structure, but that hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

</p><p><span>1) What is the make and model of the computer you are facing issue with?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Are you using this hard disk as an internal or are you using any hard drive enclosure to make it an external hard drive?
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be an issue with the drivers not properly installed or not configured.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to uninstall the drivers completely and reinstall them after restarting Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below to uninstall driver:</span></p>

            <p>You have no idea how far over my head that article went.&nbsp; I also forgot to mention that I'm very inexperienced with troubleshooting or programming.&nbsp; (The last time I did any programming of any sort I was using punch cards and hex code.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did notice on a separate article that making a disk dynamic as opposed to basic makes it more fault tolerant.&nbsp; What kinds of faults can be prevented by converting a basic drive to dynamic?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And would I have to back up my data elsewhere before converting it to dynamic, or if I convert it back to basic?</p>

            <p>Thank you again for your help, but the problem resurfaced.&nbsp; I think the problem might be something to do with Nero.&nbsp; The source and destination folders are both on G: (and it's the same folder) so that may be causing the problem.&nbsp; I'm having Nero read from
 the folder, recode the file, and write back to the folder.&nbsp; This has also caused Windows Explorer to stop working, but only as of today.&nbsp; It hasn't happened before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recently tried a system restore to no effect.&nbsp; I'll try Andrew's solution of converting to a dynamic drive to see if that makes any difference and I'll post those results as well.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>The issue has now spread to F and G drives and now they disappear even without Nero's involvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been using Nero Recode as included with Nero 2014.&nbsp; I had changed the destination folder to one on C and then one on F, but that made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to suspect that the drives may be getting set to fail.&nbsp; Just about twenty minutes ago, both of them disappeared from My Computer.&nbsp; Even going to Device Manager and scanning for hardware changes won't make them reappear.&nbsp; They're both over three
 years old.&nbsp; However, they're both recognized by my BIOS as being SMART capable and they report no problems; repeated uses of chkdsk /f on both drives doesn't solve the problem, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted and went to the disk management utility and changed F to a dynamic drive like Andrew suggested.&nbsp; It still disappeared and won't reappear without a reboot.&nbsp; I can't make it show up refreshing the Device Manager, but it does appear on the disk management
 utility.&nbsp; It showed as a dynamic drive that had "failed" and wouldn't reactivate.&nbsp; G won't show up at all.</p>
<p>

    <title>Vertical scrolling on Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0 keeps reverting to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vince silva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical scrolling on Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0 keeps reverting to slowest speed.</h2>
                    I'm using a Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0 on a Sony Vaio F Series laptop running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.<br />
<br />
I've installed the very latest mouse drivers and software (Intellipoint 7.1 for 64 bit) from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Whenever I go into Mouse properties and increase the vertical scrolling speed from slow to fast the slider reverts back to the slowest speed immediately.<br />
<br />
I have uninstalled and reinstalled Intellipoint 7.1 3 times now, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
I have also uninstalled the Optical mouse, gone into the native settings for the laptop's Alps Touch Pad. Set the scroll speed to max and then reinstalled Intellipoint 7.1, but no luck again.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. <br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I do think windows store is missing though because I have to get to it by searching for an app I got from there. Once there it gives me a series of apps that are also missing and can't download.&nbsp; They look like they were apps that came with&nbsp; Windows 10.&nbsp;
 I updated from 7 to 10 a year ago.&nbsp; Otherwise, Windows Store appears no where on my computer or start page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this might have something to do with a windows update that occurred about a month ago but I'm not sure.</p>

            <p>First of all, thanks for the fast answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running the command: <strong>net localgroup administrators apfel /add</strong></p>
<p>I got an error saying that the local group doesn't exist. This could be due to my system language not being english (just a wild guess of mine). However, I managed to access the system configurations via the search function (which seems to be (partly) intact,
 but can't find installed programs...) and gave the new user administrator rights over there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging into the new user, everything seems to work perfectly fine. I can open all the things (start menu, calender, notification center) which I can not access in my "original" user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean that I need to change users and "abandon" the old one? Or does this information help you understanding what went wrong and finding a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>Depends on what you actually mean by "server".&nbsp; Explain that.</p>
<p>It can be used to share out files/folders and printers easily enough.&nbsp; Media server of sort too.&nbsp; However - it is limited to 5 or 10 active connections if it is not a server class OS.</p>

<p><span>Hi Smcm – Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
Changes in EFS:<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd630631(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd630631(WS.10).aspx</a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>*The above might help; however, it doesn’t provide any<br />
details about (encrypted) Folder sharing. <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
Maybe it doesn’t support multiply (encrypted) folder sharing. <br />
<br />
I hope you find this information useful. If you need any further assistance,<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>
<p><span>Have a nice day…</span></p>
