    <title>Zero doesn&#39;t work in codes like Alt&#43;0151 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firewine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zero doesn&#39;t work in codes like Alt&#43;0151</h2>
                    <p>I just got a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort keyboard, which I really like, and it has instantly fixed some minor pain I was experiencing in a finger.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there's a slight niggle: When I go to type a code like "Alt+0151" using the numberpad (I often have to insert an en-dash in my work), as soon as I press the Alt key followed by the zero, a zero (0) instantly appears instead of the computer waiting
 for the rest of the code. I never had this problem with other keyboards. Strangely, however, if I wait a couple of seconds before typing the code (in other words, I press the Alt key, wait a few seconds, then continue with 0151), the code works fine and an
 en-dash is inserted. Any ideas? It's slightly irritating having to wait for that delay...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 boots to Windows repair utility and then crashes with a black screen.</h2>
                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u>: <strong>Windows 7 has stopped working.&nbsp; It boots to Windows repair utility and then crashes with a black screen.</strong></p>
<p>I have tried just about everything and I can't boot into safe mode or any other mode for that matter.&nbsp; I have tried F5 utilities and everything checks out.&nbsp; Any attempt to launch safe mode crashes the computer and takes me back to Windows Repair Utility,
 which crashes with a black screen.&nbsp; Restore to an earlier version doesn't work.&nbsp; NOTHING WORKS.<br />
<br />
This all happened 1 hour after I signed up Windows Live parental controls and blocked Youtube on my laptop.&nbsp; (Possibly irrelevant information).<br />
<br />
Can I reinstall Windows 7 to repair it?&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows Vista a year ago and don't have a Win7 Install disk, just an upgrade disk.<br />

<br />

If you have a legitimate Windows 7 Upgrade disc, what Andre suggested should work.</p>
<p>The upgrade disc is capable of doing a complete reinstall if needed.</p>

            I have a legitimate Windows 7 Upgrade disc received directly from Dell.&nbsp; When I attempted to boot off of this disc, it crashed and never started back up.&nbsp; I waited 5 minutes before hard shutting it down.&nbsp; I'm willing to try again tonight when I get back
 home from work, but I've read other forums which agreed with my position that the Upgrade Disc will not reinstall Windows 7.<br />

            <p>If the disc is a "Microsoft" disc it should work. Discs that are sold by Microsoft, full or Upgrade, will do a complete reinstall of Windows 7.</p>
<p>If it's a disc that "Dell" put together you may have a problem.</p>
<p>You might have to get a set of recovery discs from Dell and do the upgrade again.</p>

            I have not contacted Dell because the computer is out of Warranty by 18 months.&nbsp; I have the disc with me right now and the outside envelope holding the disc has a Microsoft "Proof of License Certificate of Authenticity" Sticker on it along with a product
 key.<br />
<br />
Inside the envelope is an olive-green disc with a white slice at the top.&nbsp; the words "Operating System" is printed in Olive Green in the white slice.&nbsp; The text on the disc says:<br />
<br />
This DVD supports 32-bit edition only<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Option<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium to Wondows (R) 7 Home Premium<br />

            I have contacted Dell.&nbsp; They were utterly useless.&nbsp; They also refuse to provide any assistance.&nbsp; Between Dell refusing to help and Microsoft not offering any support on their products without paying fees, I'm completely disgusted by these companies and
 will probably go out and buy a Mac.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Just utterly useless products and people.&nbsp; Terribly disappointed.<br />

<p>Hello Bubzzy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important it is to you. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-to-go-number/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype To Go
</a>and <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/features/online-number/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype Number</a>&nbsp;are two calling features of Skype. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype To Go gives you numbers that <strong>let you call</strong> your friends, family and colleagues abroad from a mobile or landline while avoiding international calling charges. While with Skype Number,
<strong>people can call you </strong>from mobiles or landlines and you can pick up the call in Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will make a call using Skype to another person's mobile/landline number and you would like to know what number will appear on their end; if caller ID is not set up on your account, the first 11 characters of your Skype name will appear or any random
 letters/numbers. I highly suggest for you to set up <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?q=caller+ID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
caller ID</a> so the receivers of your calls will be able to identify that it is you who's calling them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 goes black screen after verifying DMI... BSOD no safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Hoping for help, trying to reinstall windows 10&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My computer will not boot past the verifying DMI pool screen, it just goes black. &nbsp;It used to give me blue screen errors, not anymore.<br />
<br />
I am very out of practice with computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I bought a PC off Ebay from someone that builds them in 2015 <br />
I think it had windows 7 &nbsp;did the free upgrade to windows 10 in 2016 and i think that messed it up.<br />
</p>
<p>The recovery CD that came with the PC wont work<br />
I am not able to start in safe mode or recovery mode. I have tried a lot of ideas from the internet with not success<br />
Could be a virus?<br />
<br />
I am OK with reinstalling and losing all data, I just dont know how to obtain the files i need to do so, like the serial number.<br />
unless there is a better route to take without reinstalling windows?<br />
<br />
I was able to get into recovery mode randomly at one point and go through the steps to reset windows but it failed&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here are some of the blue screen messages i used to get:&nbsp;<br />
Driver_overran_stack_buffer<br />
memory_management<br />
kmode_exception_not_handled<br />
<br />
system_service_exception<br />
Bad pool header&nbsp;<br />
FLTMGR.SYS<br />
<br />
It collects the error info restarts and does it again<br />
<br />
whats plugged in<br />
I have a usb wired mouse&nbsp;<br />
standard keyboard non usb<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different factors that can contribute as to why your computer is getting a blue screen with different error messages. This could be caused by a recent update was installed or system files that got corrupted. There are different
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
recovery options in Windows 10</a> that will allow you to repair or reinstall the operating system depending on your needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to resolve your concern, you can follow the steps in the section labeled "<strong>use installation media to restore or reset your PC</strong>". This will guide in your downloading and creating an installation media that can be used to recover your
 computer first. If the option to recover your computer does not resolve the issue, the next step indicated will guide you in doing a reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response once you complete the steps.</p>

<p>Appreciate the fast response!<br />
<br />
Here is where I am,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to boot up into the system recovery options with the files i downloaded onto the flash drive.<br />
when it loads one of 2 error messages pop up and cover the recovery options tab, and my usb mouse is not working so i cant move the box away to see the panel. &nbsp;should the mouse be working?<br />
<br />
The errors are:<br />
The file or directory \windows is corrupt and unreadable. &nbsp;Please run the Chkdsk utility.<br />
The file or directory E: \windows is corrupt and unreadable. &nbsp;Please run the Chkdsk utility.<br />
<br />
I was able to use the keyboard to run a windows memory diagnostic.<br />
<br />
Windows is checking for memory problems... it did complete the 2 tests and said it would display the results after it restarted. &nbsp;On the restart it went to the black screen, &nbsp;PC still ticking away. Been sitting for 30 min now running to see if it is just taking
 a long time to do its business.<br />
<br />
on the diagnostic screen it said "Hardware problems were detected. &nbsp;To identify and repair these problems, you will need to contact the computer manufacturer."<br />
<br />
I was not able to select startup repair<br />
system restore and system image recovery gave me this error: <br />
system.32\VSSTrace.DLL is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error.......<br />
<br />

            Since the diagnostic results indicate that there may be issues with the actual hardware, we do suggest that you contact the manufacturer or a service technician to have them verify if there are any hardware issues. Before you proceed through with that
 step, we can still attempt to perform clean install or a reinstall of Windows 10. Take note that performing the clean install will completely remove all of your files in your computer.
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the steps posted by Andre Da Costa to either <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
perform a clean install or a reinstall of Windows 10</a>. This also includes how to make sure that you have the correct version of the Windows 10 installation media, the methods available to reactivate your Windows 10 computer after completing the steps and
 a few more reminders before you start the procedure.</p>

<h2>            Virus blocks all System files &#38; folders, windows defender and restore point </h2>
                    I have a virus that blocks access to my SYSTEM files, Windows Defender and maybe even Windows Support. For some reason when i give Windows permission to check my system for my Product key and ID it can't access. Both Malware bytes and AVG didn't find anything.
 Malware i ran in safe mode. AVG was not available in the save mode. Defender doesnt open. IE and Windows explorer are constantly stopping and giving errors too.
<p>My system is Vista Home Premium, service pack 1, last changes i made is language change. This week i removed a very annoying taskbar called Babylon, that popped up out of nowhere, from my computer which seemed like malware to me too. All traces of this have
 been gone. What to do next. I've tried everything i can think of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I would suggest you to install Microsoft Security Essential in place of AVG:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a></p>
<p>For its latest database of offline installation setup:</p>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Definitions/ADL.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/Definitions/ADL.aspx</a>
<br />
<p>Have you ran <span>Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD724AE0-E72D-4F54-9AB3-75B8EB148356&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=AD724AE0-E72D-4F54-9AB3-75B8EB148356&amp;displaylang=en</a>
<br />
</span></p>
<p>In this circumstances you might not access the any page from Microsoft domain so you should download it from another machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If nothing works then:</p>
<p>It seems malware has badly edited the system files. Fresh formatting will be the best procedure but you may follow the below instructions if you want not to format now &amp; solve the problem by repairing from OS platform.</p>
<p>1. Open Command Prompt (Right click on it &amp; 'Run as Administrator').</p>
<p>2. type <strong>sfc/scannow</strong> &amp; then press enter.</p>
<p>(the command will restore all the windows system protected files to its original version)</p>
<p>3. Then it'll ask for the Windows bootable disc,so insert it &amp; allow times to complete the scan.</p>
<p>4. after command/scan is complete verify that your problem exist or not.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note: </span></em>if succeeded then you might have to activate your copy of windows with its original CD key. Otherwise on next restart it'll deny/delay to log in you to your account until you activate it by original
 key. If you have no genuine CD key then do not try the command.</p>
<p>You will be unable to perform this command if you have no windows bootable disc. (You will need Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 bootable/Retail disk not any restoration disk)</p>
<p>In the extreme file corruption command may failed. Then you have to repair OS by booting the disc.</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This might be an issue with the keyboard driver. However, we need additional information for us to provide you with the appropriate solution.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue occur when the keyboard is connected to other devices? </li><li>Have you tried disabling and enabling the <strong>NUM LOCK </strong>key? </li><li>Does the issue also occur when using the<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10762/windows-use-on-screen-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> On-Screen Keyboard</a>?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. To learn more on how to run the toolkit, click

</p><p>Is it allowed to use Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center?&nbsp; In any case, there is a utility that comes with that package called mskey that you could use to check what those keys are generating.&nbsp; Off hand I would wonder if NumLock was on.&nbsp; You can use the

            This is a Bluetooth keyboard. I don't have any other devices to connect and test.<br />
<br />
Yes I have tried disabling and enabling the NUM lock key.<br />
<br />
Yes, same issue with on-screen keyboard.<br />
<br />
I have since contacted support and they are assisting me with the issue. They have made sure that all of my updates are properly installed, and are running some other checks as well.<br />
<br />
I'll keep you posted on the progress.

            <div>Here are the usual methods to resolve this issue:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair flash disk, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account). This is by far the easiest option.</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>
<div>Here is a recipe to create a Windows Repair flash disk:&nbsp;</div>
<div>http://mintywhite.com/windows-7/7maintenance/create-bootable-windows-7-system-repair-usb-drive-netbooks/</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you did not create a spare admin account while you were able to access Windows then you will face some big challenges. If none of the above methods work for you then there are other methods. They all require a bootable flash disk. Post again if this
 is the case.</div>

                    <p>I notice i the uninstall update there is no uninstall button on this and the updates history log file has been erased. I can't roll back the computer either. So how do I uninstall it I already tried using wusa command in command prompt. I also have been
 very extensive on figure out whats going on. I uninstalled all my drivers even unplugged my raid so that drivers for it wouldn't load still doesn't work. Only leaves one thing which it happened right after I got this update. So how do I uninstall it so it
 works again?&nbsp; Or do you have another fix. If you want to say get a new computer or something like that don't post because your wasting my time.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 0xc0000225 Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to start up my Dell Inspiron laptop and instead get this blue screen with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code 0xc0000225</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue Screen only gives me two options: Enter to try again or F8 for Startup Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Elsewhere it says something about "UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying again doesn't work as it still won't boot.&nbsp; I tried to boot to Safe Mode, which also didn't work.&nbsp; None of the Startup Settings seem to work.&nbsp; I have a "Dell Operating System Windows 8 Recovery Media for Windows 8 Products 64-bit" recovery disk that
 was sent to me years ago for an unrelated problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I put it in the disk drive to see if I could boot from that but I don't even see the option and I can't see any way to get to a command prompt. Not sure if it would work for this problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea how to fix this.&nbsp; I haven't installed any new hardware or software and I haven't been partitioning anything so I'm a bit puzzled as to what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody please help me with this?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are varied reasons for that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have hard drive failure, etc.</p>
<p>This information from Dell describes it</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN129813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.dell.com/support/article/us/en/04/SLN129813</span></a></p>
<p>UNMOUNTABLE BOOT VOLUME <br />
<br />
INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE </p>
<p>These two errors have similar causes and the same troubleshooting steps apply to both of them. These stop codes always occur during the startup process. When you encounter one of these stop codes, the following has happened:</p>
<ol>
<li>The system has completed the Power-On Self-Test (POST).</li><li>The system has loaded NTLDR and transferred control of the startup process to NTOSKRNL (the kernel).</li><li>NTOSKRNL is confused. Either it cannot find the rest of itself, or it cannot read the file system at the location it believes it is stored.<br />
When troubleshooting this error, your task is to find out why the Windows kernel is confused and fix the cause of the confusion.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>The SATA controller configuration in the system BIOS</strong> If the SATA controller gets toggled from ATA to AHCI mode (or vice versa), then Windows will not be able to talk to the SATA controller because the different modes require different drivers.
 Try toggling the SATA controller mode in the BIOS.</li><li><strong>RAID settings</strong> You may receive this error if you've been experimenting with the RAID controller settings. Try changing the RAID settings back to Autodetect (usually accurate).</li><li><strong>Improperly or poorly seated cabling</strong> Try reseating the data cables that connect the drive and its controller at both ends.</li><li><strong>Hard drive failure</strong> Run the built-in diagnostics on the hard drive. Remember:
<strong>Code 7</strong> signifies correctable data corruption, <strong>not</strong> disk failure.</li><li><strong>File system corruption</strong> Launch the recovery console from the Windows installation disc and run
<strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong>.</li><li><strong>Improperly configured BOOT.INI (Windows Vista).</strong> If you have inadvertently erased or tinkered with the boot.ini file, you may receive stop code 0x7B during the startup process. Launch the recovery console from the Windows installation disc
 and run <strong>BOOTCFG /REBUILD</strong></li></ul>

            <p>Hi Bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate all the help.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after trying several of these, none of them worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access the BIOS.&nbsp; I have repeatedly tried pressing "F2" during startup (which, according to Dell is the correct key) and it does nothing.&nbsp; It always comes back to blue screen.&nbsp; So I can't even look at BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no RAID system whatsoever, so I am pretty sure that's not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not even going to attempt to take the computer apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't access built-in hard drive diagnostics.&nbsp; I have pressed the correct keys (according to Dell) but it accomplishes nothing.&nbsp; I end up back at blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no Windows installation disk.&nbsp; Windows 8 came pre-loaded on the laptop.&nbsp; All I have is my "Recovery Media for Windows 8 Products 64-bit" disk, which isn't an installation disk.&nbsp; If I could get to a windows console, I would love to run any kind of
 scan, but I suspect if I could do that I would have been able to fix the problem in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Dell's "Recovery &amp; Restore" tool on a USB to boot from that, but when I press F12 to get boot options, the computer doesn't respond, just shoots me back to blue screen.&nbsp; I have boot options on the blue screen.&nbsp; None of those options actually
 work, which leads me to an endless cycle of restarting and blue screen.&nbsp; Frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping <strong>something</strong> would work but my computer refuses to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas, short of me taking it to the computer repair shop?&nbsp; I'd like to avoid that if possible but if nothing else is an option, so be it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            &#34;Why did my PC restart&#63;&#34; Loop</h2>
                    Hi! So, I recently recieved a laptop as a gift and upon recieving it, I had an issue. I opened it and I was greeted with the normal blue screen that asks to set settings and such, but the real problem occured when I clicked next. A screen popped up saying
 "Why did my PC restart?" And then a few sentences under it describing the issue. In case you need it, it reads "There's a problem that's keeping us from getting your PC ready to use, but we think an update will help get things working again. Here's how to
 update it." And then there's 4 steps giving me directions as to what's needed to be done. So I plugged it in, and since I had internet, I clicked next and selected my internet. After that, it just did the normal "wait a moment" blue screen which wasn't at
 all worrying. After awhile of waiting, I was greeted with the black screen and hp logo, then brought back to the same screen with settings I needed to set. So I did that again, then was greeted with the same exact screen saying "Why did my PC restart?". So
 I did the same thing as I did last time and the only thing I can do and clicked next, except this time, I wasn't given the option to select my internet. It went through the same exact cycle: "Please wait a moment", waited for a bit, black screen with the hp
 logo, then the blue screen with settings and the same exact screen saying "Why did my PC restart?". I contacted the friend who had gifted the laptop to me, and they said all they did before resetting it was update it, so maybe that has something to do with
 it? Anyway, I looked up online some things I could do, and I found a thread saying I should I shut it off and when the windows logo (in this case it was the hp logo) popped up, unplug it and plug it back in several times until the troubleshooter booted up.
 Then, afterwards, select the "repair start-up" option. So, I did exactly that and thankfully got to the troubleshooter, but the repair start-up option needed a password. So I asked my friend, and she gave me 3 different passwords, but none of them worked.
 So at this point, I was rather agitated and decided to see if resetting the laptop again would work. As of me writing this, I've reset the darn thing at least 3 times and clicked next more times than I should've and still, that same two blue screens keep popping
 up. I don't know if it's a problem with my internet or what, but all I know is I'm out of ideas as to what to do :/<br />
In case it's important, my laptop is an HP Spectre x360 and runs on Windows 10. I'd really appreciate some help. Thank you so much for the trouble in advanced!

            Hi Summrb.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Did you do the factory reset which reinstalls all the HP bloatware?  HP makes great hardware but the factory install is the worst in the industry, larded with bloatware like utilities that duplicate and cause issues with better versions built into Windows.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello! Thank you for getting back to me so quickly! The links you shared definitely seem helpful and your reasoning behind why my laptop is acting silly is conceivable and understandable, but I don't exactly know how to do any of that since it's in an endless,
 unescapeable loop of those three screens. If there's a way to actually use my laptop and get out of the loop, I'd definitely be able to use the methods you shared! But as of now, it's basically unusable with it stuck repeating the same three screens :/</p>

            I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:<br /><br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.<br /> <br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.micr

            Hello! I have a few issues regarding the steps and options you've given me. For option 1 and 2, I'll be trying that later once I'm able to get my hands on a seperate PC and flashdrive to do them. For option 3, none of the options in the troubleshooter
 workerd, neither did the command prompt. When I entered the command prompt to get into safe mode, it brought me to the hp logo and told me that it couldn't work since windows 10 wasn't installed, then told me to reset my PC (which I did). For option 4, I'm
 not able to do any of those things because my PC isn't useable. All it can do beyond it's infamous three screens is access the troubleshooter from turning the laptop off and on several times. For option 5, I tried the sfc/scannow command and all I got in return
 was "Windows Resource Protection could not preform the requested operation", then I tried the other ones provided, which didn't seem to do much. For option 6, it's the same for option 4; I'm unable to do anything with my laptop, and even 
        </p>

            Then I would create the bootable media on another PC by installing Media Creation Tool, open the tool to create bootable media on USB or burn ISO to DVD, following the steps you can read on the downloads page:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning shutdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There&nbsp;is no upgrade path to either 8.1 or 10 from XP; it has to be done with a clean install and reinstallation of Programs/applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the information for XP &gt; Vista, Windows 7, 8.1 and 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on the hardware requirements of later operating systems and also&nbsp;whether the computer/laptop manufacturer supports and supplies drivers for the later operating systems as to whether it is possible or feasible to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no free upgrade from&nbsp;XP to Vista,&nbsp;7, 8.1 or 10.</p>
<p>Forget about Vista as the extended support for Vista SP2&nbsp;ends&nbsp;April, 2017.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>

            <p>I think you should not spend any money until you have put a test installation of Windows 10 on your computer to see how it performs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You ought to make a system image of your current XP installation before you start so that you can get back to where you started if it all goes horribly wrong.&nbsp; If you do not know about system images then search for the free version of Macrium Reflect - it
 can make them and its Help system will probably explain enough to get you going.&nbsp; Do not omit making Macrium Reflect's rescue disk / boot disk - you might need to use it to boot from to be able to restore the system image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your computer's hardware &amp; software compatibility.&nbsp; <span><span>The </span>
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)"><span>Windows 10 upgrade checker [GWX] </span>

 will be useful.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>Early versions of the Windows 10 System requirements also stated that the
</em></span><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">processor (CPU) must support SSE2, NX, PAE extensions but I have absolutely no idea if that part of the requirement has become irrelevant or is merely omitted for brevity.</span></em></span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the compatibility report is optimistic then make a Windows 10 installation DVD/USB - see the&nbsp;procedural&nbsp;guide &amp; links in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your hard drive is big enough you might consider partitioning it into two drives and installing Windows 10 in parallel ["dual-boot"] with XP - that would also ease removing it later if it had problems and you would always have the option of booting into
 XP in the meantime for any important tasks.&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.pagestart.com/winxpdbwin10tp1206141.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>You might be able to solve driver problems for hardware reported&nbsp;in the compatibility report&nbsp;- see

Where to get hardware drivers</a>&nbsp;- but you might not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also give serious consideration to the costs involved.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Buying Windows 10 would only be worthwhile if your computer lasted long enough to repay the investment.&nbsp;
</li><li>Since none of us know how long any machine will last for, your decision will be an act of faith.&nbsp;
</li><li>You might also usefully have a look at a modern computer and watch some tasks that you carry out being done on it - you might be so impressed with the improved performance that you lose all interest in the halfway house of continuing with your current computer
 with Windows 10 installed.</li><li>You might think it better to keep your money and start saving up for a new computer that already has Windows 10.&nbsp;

                    <p>I have a problem in the past few weeks with a VS 2005 MFC application.</p>
<p>It compiles and runs fine on my machine, but when I install it on my friend's machine it fails with a Sxs problem.</p>
<p>I ran the SxsTrace utility, it is missing&nbsp;atl80.dll version 8.0.50727.6195 and all related DLL's.</p>
<p>I tried installing the latest vcredist_x86.exe - but this didn't bring in what I need on th etarget machine.</p>
<p>When I compare my Windows\Winsxs folder's updates, that same update is NOT on the friend's machine</p>
<p>The friend's machine is&nbsp;running with Windows 7 SP1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, where can I go from here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            <p>Are you also running Windows 7, or are you running a different operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You friend could try installing all of these if they are running 64-bit, or just the x86 versions if they are not 64-bit.&nbsp; The multiple versions coexist with each other.</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>Your prompt feedback and detailed response are really much appreciated. I followed your suggestions, downloaded to my own PC all the relevant re-distributable, but yet, no cigar...</p>
<p>I have tried to replicate the problem and decided to install SP1 on my Windows 7 Laptop.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 32 bit on my desktop and the same on the laptop where I applied SP1.</p>
<p>An EXE I make on the desktop, runs OK on the laptop, but an EXE from the laptop does not run on the desktop PC. It is not an exact replication – because my friend’s PC with Windows
 7 32 bit with SP1, doesn’t have on it the VS-2005 development environment.</p>
<p>For another option, I tried installing it on a Windows 2008 R2 Server (which I understand is like Windows 7), also with SP1, and my program compiled on my Laptop doesn’t run there
 either.</p>
<p>The location of this DLL on my computer is located in the same folder as yours.</p>
<p>Until now, I had my manifest embedded into my EXE in the Project setup. I thought I will make it an external file. When I look in that file – I find out to my surprise ... It seems
 it is set to look for “8.0.50727.4053”, so why is the error showing as if it is looking for “8.0.50727.6195”?</p>
<p>In my journey to resolve this – I see people talking about manifest and configuration files, that through this I should be able to FORCE which dll file versions are need for my
 program to run. I am really confused about what should I tell it to do, which versions etc should I put into the config file, and really – I would prefer that I can resolve it through a patch</p>

For what it is worth, the 4053 version is located here on my machine, C:\Windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft.vc80.atl_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_8.0.50727.4053_none_d1c738ec43578ea1, it has a size of 95.0 KB (97,280 bytes).&nbsp; With the failing machines what are the File Access
 Permissions like for those two Winsxx folders, or any other folder or files they require access to,&nbsp; is there any problem with those?&nbsp; Are there any blocking" parameters set on files created on the Laptop.&nbsp; You would check for that by right-clicking on the
 files and selecting&nbsp; Properties, where down the bottom of the Properties, there may be an "Unblock" check box.</p>

            <p>Thanks again for the feedback.</p>
<p>While I continue searching the problem, I found something very interesting on MSDN.</p>
<p><b><span>Copy Visual C++ Redistributable Package (vcredist_x86.exe) from %PROGDIR%\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\SDK\v2.0\Bootstrapper\Packages\vcredist_x86\vcredist_x86.exe to the target
 computer</span></b></p>
<p>I did that, copied the redistributable from my laptop (Windows 7 with SP1) onto the target machine – Windows 2008 R2 Server with SP1, and the EXE that I compiled on the laptop works
 fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, when I tried doing the same thing on my Desktop - Windows 7 Without SP1, this didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I assume that the same
<strong>vcredist_x86.exe</strong>&nbsp;is only right for same OS and same SP combination, therefore it does nothing for my Desktop?</p>
<p>If so, I can assume that the same file from my desktop, should do the trick for like machines (Windows 7 without SP1)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that any such
<strong>vcredist_x86.exe</strong>, is only backwards compatible - therefore such file from my desktop did nothing on my friends PC with Windows 7 and SP1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try your suggestion to check the
"Unblock". The utility you suggested can be useful, but not for this case. I need to have the program actually running in order to be able and use it, but seeing that my program fails on load, it is of no use at this stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also checkout the other forum you suggested, in the meantime - please answer my question above, if you know the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thaks again</p>

            <p>I can't really answer your question about vcredist_x86.exe but IF what you are doing on machines of the same edition, version, and same Windows Update level is working, and if things really match up between the three machines you mention then all I can suggest
 is you look to the users on the Desktop and perhaps see if creating a new Admin User on the Desktop to test with makes any difference.
</p>
<p>Copying files across machines to run and launch programs can be hit and miss at the best of times as very often the Registry needs attention too.</p>

<h2>            I keep losing my D drive when windows updates.</h2>
                    When ever Windows updates I keep losing my D drive which is 2 1T drives striped together. I can still see them in CMOS but Windows can't see it. Any ideas what can be causing this?

            Nothing seems to help once Windows boots. It is still available in CMOS and before the Anniversary Edition update, everything was working fine. What else could have changed?

    <title>Windows Event Viewer &#40;Critical Errors&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Event Viewer &#40;Critical Errors&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I really don't know what the problem is, mu computer is bombarded with critical errors. I see plenty of question asked but no answers from Microsoft.</p>
<p>While my computer seems to run right, I think and I do not see any visible problems.</p>
<p>there is the event viewer showing at least 80 problems a day, DCOM, license and what ever else.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this or do we just disregard.</p>
<p>I even completely formatted the hard drive and installed Windows 10&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ONLY</span>, then after updating the errors all come right back, so it is not a third party issue.</p>
<p>Someone, please give me an answer.</p>
<p>Bought a program that claims it correct it, while it states it is all fixed, it is not true.</p>
<p>Again, while I did get some event viewer critical errors it was only like 1 or 2 at the most with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>So what is the story here.</p>

            Could be a failing hard drive or memory. Can you find the HDD vendors testing program for the drive and carry out a memory test.

<p>This issue is not the hard drive as it passes every test from the vendor and motherboard diagnostics.</p>
<p>memory is more then enough (8GB).</p>
<p>Again the computer reacts Error&nbsp;1/11/2019 11:18:44 AM&nbsp;DistributedCOM&nbsp;10016&nbsp;None quick and I have not seen any problems other then that of the event viewer</p>
<p>Please note! this issue I see on all PC and laptops even in the store, the exception is, not to many people look at the event viewer.</p>
<p>For what I have been reading, there are over 1 million people reporting this issue.</p>

<p>Sorry, I forgot to mention</p>
<p>(1) passed memory test, no issues.</p>
<p>(2) passed the SFC /Scannow</p>
<p>(3) passed the DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image / RestoreHealth.</p>
<p>(4) passed, no virus or malware on the PC.</p>
<p>(5) CHKDSK, no issues.</p>
<p>Like I said, the computer is very responsive but never the less reports this event viewer.</p>
<p>I spend $149.00 at Best Buy to check it out, they claimed nothing wrong.</p>
<p>All they did is clear out the reports, no sooner I got home the same thing, over 80 critical errors</p>
<p>reported the event viewer per day.</p>
<p>I here through Microsoft, try assure program, does this really work.</p>

<p>Event Viewer is commonly misunderstood. You'll typically see hundreds, possibly thousands, of scary sounding critical errors and warnings that are completely harmless. If you don't have a specific problem that you are trying to a diagnose, you can safely
 ignore what you see in Event Viewer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just opened my own Event Viewer, and I've got 411 critical errors and warnings over the last 7 days. Yet my computer runs very well.</p>

<p>S_and_S</p>
<p>I thank you for the info and you are telling me what I suspected and as you said, if it doesn't affect the performance or security then don't worry.</p>
<p>However, don't you think that somehow Microsoft would had come up with a solution already as this is 85% of all Windows 10 Operating Systems.</p>
<p>The answer does not make sense but never the less correct.</p>
<p>The performance is great on this Intel 7 processor with and ASUS board along with 8GB memory.</p>
<p>If I would had never seen the Event Viewer (RED) critical errors, then I would had never asked.</p>
<p>However, never the less, this error is more then just common, it is a normal on almost all the Microsoft PC's, I keep hearing that there are fixes but you have to go through the registry which means that you could be adding more problems then what we really
 want.</p>
<p>I will take your suggestion because there are programs out there that say they correct the issue but it does not, don't be caught.</p>
<p>Thank you, it is like you said if it runs good leave it unless you actually see issues with performance and security.</p>
<p>Like I said before, I have gone to stores and found that this issues are in all the PC's, regardless of the store.</p>
<p>So again, Microsoft has got to find an answer for this, until then, we have to live with it.</p>
<p>After all, it is an access issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you, at least I have an honest answer and not getting some company to take advantage of the situation and charging for it.</p>

            If you are happy then fair enough . I had looked at my event log before posting my original comments and i don't have any critical errors at all.

<p>There's no solution from Microsoft because there's no problem to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event Viewer is a log, so it records everything that happens, whether it matters or not. I'll give an example: You pour hot water from the kettle into your tea cup, and the kettle pops up a critical error: "Water level in kettle is low." Well, of course,
 that is a problem but what did you expect? You can avoid seeing that error by buying a bigger kettle so you never pour out enough water to cause the error message to appear, but what have you really accomplished?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want, you can always lookup the meaning of these errors on the internet. You will eventually come across someone who really knows this stuff and explains what it means. Even if you don't completely understand all the geek terminology - I don't - you'll
 understand enough to know that while these are, technically, errors, they don't really matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is not to say that Event Viewer is useless. Far from it. If you are researching a specific problem, like a BSOD, the information in Event Viewer can help you understand what went wrong. The trick there is to look for events that occurred at the same
 moment as your problem occurred.</p>
