<h2>            Skype profile pic not updating&#63;</h2>
                    I press save after uploading a photo, and as soon as I refresh skype my picture is gone. I've tried on mobile and desktop and neither fixes this. I just want to have a profile pic lol. This happens every time.

            <p>First of all your assumption is correct.&nbsp; You can delete the partitionwith 350 mb of windows 8.1 data since you are running Windows 10 without any harm to your system.&nbsp; Next you r problem with H: drive is a genuine one I come across, that contains data of
 your Windows 10 file in iso format.&nbsp; Even when you have created a usb installer the one in H: is still functional.&nbsp; You need to format it.&nbsp; Disapperance of&nbsp; G: drive may due to insufficient space to allocate System reserved partitions and Updates.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the 350 MB partition, I will probable find out how to delete it. &nbsp;However, given the 850 MB partition is in between the "C" (OS partition) and the 350 MB one, I kind of doubt that I can add it back to my OS partition and it would just be sitting there
 as unoccupied space and totally unusable unless of course Windows 10 needs more space on the 850 partition and could use it rather than taking more from the OS partition, "IF" windows if fact would look to "both sides" and not just to the left for extra space.
 &nbsp;Should I delete it and than "expand", i.e. add that space to the 850 MB partition? &nbsp;I'm sure I find out somewhere the "how-to" as to deletion and expanding. &nbsp;Anyway it's only 350 MB not like the 3.05 GB on my Data drive for the other issue below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You lost me on your reply on the "extra" <strong>non-physical</strong> CD-Rom 1 drive sitting as a
<strong>"non-delete-able" file</strong> on my Data drive. &nbsp;Given I have already installed the 1511 update, I assume, unless told otherwise, this installation file is no longer needed. &nbsp;I also still have the USB version and furthermore even if I reformat my
 USB drive it could be re-created on it. You mentioned "format". &nbsp;Are you suggesting, a) I copy my "D" Data drive info to my Sundry drive (of course that file in question would not be copied). b) reformat the "D" drive to get rid of that file and than move
 my data back to the reformatted D: drive? &nbsp;N.B. as to "G" my "D" drive has certainly enough room so it's disappearing is not to insufficient space assuming is was also a "file" on D. &nbsp;Also just fyi the installation created also an icon called Windows on my
 desktop which opens the "H" drive.</p>
<p>

            <p>Could you please clarify the issue (my 2nd paragraph) as to how I delete that "CD-Rom 1 drive" You said: "you need to format it" &nbsp;Do I format the "CD-Rom 1 drive". This is just an iso file on my desktop which I can't delete. How do I format a "file" which
 windows classifies as a&nbsp;<strong>CD drive? &nbsp;</strong>Or do I need format my D: drive where that data resides (having first made a copy)? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps since it is also listed as the "H" partition formatting that "partition" will then let me delete the "file" on my desktop and all data will then automatically drop off from from Disk Management and that is what you suggested I do. I just like to
 be careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally as to that 350 MB partition, I couldn't find a way of accessing it in Disk Management to perhaps format it and give it a drive letter. No action menu shows up when right-clicking like for my "named" partitions, only "help". &nbsp;The same applies
 to the 850 MB and 13.64 GB partitions. Whereas the 260 MB partition shows the menu but all grayed out and the 1 GB partition has all but delete grayed out. &nbsp;Well as said earlier the "no longer needed 350 MB" partition is just a relatively small now totally
 unusable part on my drives. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well that was the only way to get rid of this big Windows file, but moving for example Desktop from D to E and then back I missing a lot of icons and data.&nbsp;(Note via Properties I moved Desktop and other such folders from C to D so the manual move from D
 to E and back to D may have screwed that up.&nbsp; Will have to investigate.&nbsp; What a mess this forced windows update to 10 ver 1511&nbsp;created.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well opening Administrator tools and clicking on the left side on Desktop I saw all my data, clicking on one item all of a sudden all the data appeared on the desktop.&nbsp; Looks like all the other folders on D: like Documents, are o.k. too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if anyone else runs into this problem, it appears this is the only way to get rid of that "virtual C/D rom" sitting on another physical drive, in my case the D: (Data drive) but a format of that virtual file alone will NOT work.</p>

            TRIM, - AKA, Garbage Collection,&nbsp; is an automatic function that is 'invoked' by Windows when the
<br />
system is idle. Too easy !<br />
<br />
It's a bit like the recycle bin in that it marks erased/deleted data redundant so that space becomes<br />
free for overwriting, but unlike Defrag it does not 're-arrange' data which saves on the SSD's enemy - writes.<br />
Due to the&nbsp; SSD's&nbsp; being similar to RAM they don't need the data to be contiguous, as does an HDD<br />
&nbsp;to optimise their speed, however TRIM does help keep the speed up by stopping the SSD from
<br />
reading blocks of redundant data unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
I don't have Monopoly$ofts reference, but I'm sure you can find the information with another search<br />
of the tons of places on the internet.<br />
Keep in mind that this is just another community forum, so if you are not happy with an answer
<br />
yelling is not going to further your cause. <br />

            <p>Yes it is fully automatic and "invoked" by a number of file change operations. However Windows does not actually do it the SSD controller does when it is ready.</p>

            Actually, all of this is wrong and/or passed myth.&nbsp; The only way I know of is to use the Brand's utility to invoke it.&nbsp; If your Brand doesn't have a utility that accompanies it, you're not getting the advantage.<br />

The OS's are Trim <u><b>COMPATIBLE.</b></u>&nbsp; Nothing more.&nbsp; not a swipe at MS.&nbsp; Hoping that MS knew more.&nbsp; But you are saying they do not.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As I said -<u><b> I see tons of myths about Trim on the internet - no hard facts from MS.</b></u><br />
<br />
Go back and read the first paragraph of this thread.&nbsp; it's about <b><u>invoking</u></b> Trim.&nbsp; It is an elaborate process and takes maybe 30 secs to a minute or more for each SSD partition(from my experience).<br />

            <p>I am sorry but I have included a link to a Microsoft endorsed site which does explain about Trim and makes it fairly clear that you do not
<u>need</u> to invoke the process. The drives controller will do it themselves following an update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"In addition to the above, Microsoft and SSD manufacturers are adopting the Trim operation. In Windows 7, if an SSD reports it supports the Trim attribute of the ATA protocol’s Data Set Management command, the NTFS file system will request the ATA driver
 to issue the new operation to the device when files are deleted and it is safe to erase the SSD pages backing the files.
<strong>With this information, an SSD can plan to erase the relevant blocks opportunistically (and lazily)</strong> in the hope that subsequent writes will not require a blocking erase operation since erased pages are available for reuse."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have the Intel SSD toolbox and yes it has the Optimizer function which in real time run the Trim operation over the whole drive which it recommends doing once a week. I can only assume that they consider the automated process as detailed above as being
 insufficient but that is Intel's decision not Microsoft. In practice although there are many brands of SSD there are only a few SSD controllers in use and if they have extra command functions they could be incorporated into the NTFS protocol but then Windows
 would have to identify which commands work with which drive.</p>

<h2>            Skype split window view</h2>

            Hi DAD100
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Split View is available only in Store version of Skype.
<br />
<br />Can you click on 3 dots above and Help and Feedback and let me know whether apart from Skype version, App version is also written or not? If App verson is written, then this is Store version. 
<br />
<br />Let me know so that I can suggest a solution.

                    <p>I found several different versions of this question and so far it seems the one thing we all have in common is we're part of the Insiders Programs and/or Creator's Build.&nbsp; The second thing I am noticing is there are no answers containing concrete solutions.&nbsp;
 I want to know why I can't access the Display icon and ALL of the features previously accessible by me, such as the ability to enable or disable Hardware Acceleration?</p>

<p>Hi Andrea,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different methods on how you can revert to a previous build of Windows 10. One option is performing a clean install of the build that you would like to have. For us to resolve your concern, kindly follow the steps posted by Andre Da Costa on this

    <title>Twitch doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t support bluray app. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyler wilkens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Twitch doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t support bluray app.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Currently, the twitch app does not support anything other than what is defined as 'supported games.' &nbsp;I believe this is quite debilitating in the potential that comes with the twitch application. &nbsp;Not only can you not stream
 from your xbox desktop should you so desire, you can't stream movies either. &nbsp;This wouldn't be so much of an issue but many people use the xbox as a bluray player as well as a gaming system. &nbsp;As such, it would be nice if we could stream movies that we have
 purchased just the same as games. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The xbox1 is presented as a social console. &nbsp;It boasts of it's social integration and how it will bring people together. &nbsp;It makes great claims about the fluidity of the twitch app and how it has brought a greater ease of life
 to xbox users. &nbsp;So far I have found these claims entirely false. &nbsp;One of humanities greatest past times ever since the invention of cinema has been to watch movies with others. &nbsp;Now I can understand wanting to cut back on people streaming illegally gained
 content but the way you are going about it is only blockading those who have legally purchased the content from sharing it legally with their friends and family.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By disallowing people to stream bluray from the xbox, you are merely driving them towards other means of streaming. &nbsp;For example, lets say you have the LoTR box set on bluray. &nbsp;The box set in itself is a small fortune, sitting
 at near 80 dollars USD. &nbsp;Why is it that movies I have purchased with my money cannot be streamed yet a game that costs a similar amount can? &nbsp;In doing this, you merely push people towards downloading the same content onto their computer and streaming it from
 there. &nbsp;You are kidding yourself as well if you believe that the same person would them dish out another sum of cash to buy a non-bluray version in order to run it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now I know I am not the only person who uses their xbox1 as a bluray player. &nbsp;I know I am also not the only one who has it as the only bluray player in the house. &nbsp;That means that as you shy people away from streaming on your
 device, you are potentially pressing them to then illegally download content which they otherwise could have legally attained and then streamed on your platform, both bolstering your image and protecting the companies I can only assume you are trying to help
 by putting such stranglehold restrictions on your device. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Again, I believe that your choice to not include the bluray app to be supported by twitch is a gigantic mistake. &nbsp;If my point wasn't clear already, I am under the belief that instead of preventing theft as you might be trying
 to, you are actually propagating it. &nbsp;Please consider this view. &nbsp;I know you are trying to do good but at the end of the day, you are only discouraging honest folk from acting honestly.</span></p>

<p>As you stated yourself, it would be illegal to stream a bluray. The reason why streaming games is okay is because you aren't physically playing the game (a major part of gaming), just watching it. With streaming a movie, you only have one action: to watch.
 The way to share movies with your family and friends is to have them come over and watch it. Microsoft isn't intentionally pushing people to download content illegally, as they have many venues to consume media with. The Xbox Video store has a great selection
 of new movies too. The only thing you have to do is pay.</p>
<p>What you are suggesting is that you believe every type of media should be free if you can find it (if you can find the stream that is playing it), which just isn't the case, and goes against supporting the people who made that media.</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />I often teach DOD for USA and Canada and both can not access email from outside the office.
<br />You might want to check with your IT department to see if you can access email from a public connection, chances are you can not.

            Hello Lisa, thank you for your message! My name is Ted and I'm an Independent Adviser.
<br />
<br />Try to connect to DOD enterprise webmail using Microsoft Edge browser to check if it helps.
<br />Please check if the date, time and region are set correctly on your computer.
<br />I suppose this issue is caused by incorrect configuration settings.
<br />Method 1: Try adding to Compatibility view settings:
<br />1. Open IE browser
<br />2. Find the Tools menu in Internet Explorer (Alt+T) to navigate to the Compatibility View settings , then add the mail.mil and reload the webpage.
<br />Method 2: Ensure that the date and time settings are set correctly on your PC.
<br />1. Tap on the clock in the taskbar and open the menu, then click on  Date and time settings link.
<br />2. Click on Date &amp; time to check all date and time settings
<br />3. Ensure that your time zone is selected correctly when you are under the Time zone section. If not, set the right time zone from the drop-down menu.
<br />Method 3: Refer to the instructions provided by RonM_3020 and Al_Eu from the following thread
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-iewindows_10/cant-connect-securely-to-this-page/e9453552-6f7e-43ef-9374-a424930e4c9c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie...</a>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Sander and I live in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>I recently wanted to start playing Fifa Ultimate Team. I created a team and bought a code on a dutch website. This code cost me 15 euro's and would give me 1575 fut coins. I went to the xbox website and redeemed my code. It said it added 15 euros to my account
 and everything seemed ok.</p>
<p>Now when I try to buy the FUT coins on my xbox one, it only gives me the option to pay with my credit card.</p>
<p>Why am I not able to use the money I put on my account?</p>
<p>Thanks ahead!!!</p>

    <title>XBOX ONE Black Screen of death after 3 weeks, no fix and no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephkephart  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX ONE Black Screen of death after 3 weeks, no fix and no compensation from Microsoft</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the new Xbox one Fallout bundle at Gamestop, 3 weeks ago, toward the end of November 2015. All was well until last night, which also happened to be my birthday. I got the black screen of death which read "System error contact xbox customer support"
 followed by an error code. This pretty much ruined my birthday evening.</p>
<p>Long story short I called customer support, several times and attempting to fix the issue which lead to, clearing a flash drive of mine, reformatting it, then downloading a diagnostic update tool from microsoft and sticking it into the xbox. This did not
 work. I tried numerous times following the directions, and repeated with tech support on the phone. Still not working.</p>
<p>I became increasingly frustrated and wondered why I paid just under 400 dollars for a microsoft product that broke 3 weeks later. Never in my life have I had anything break in 3 weeks.</p>
<p>I realized I can take the unit back to gamestop and have it replaced because its still under the warranty, but I kept asking Xbox support "who I could complain to" and asked for some type of compensation. After all I have been loyal to Xbox/Microsoft since
 day one on their first console. Don't they give a *** about my continued loyalty, money and time to say they value me as a customer?</p>
<p>Turns out they don't.</p>
<p>I was told by one tech on the phone that apparently me, and a million other people are having this same issue. Personally I think they are trying to keep the word from getting out about this problem. When I asked for "who to complain to" initially I was
 given "this forum", which really isn't structured for complaints, this forum seems to be the "feel good-tell us what we could improve" type forum.</p>
<p>I persevered and at last was put in touch with a manager whose name is Moxie. Moxie said he was sorry for the all troubles, and the fact that it ruined my birthday however when it came to compensating me for my wasted time, energy and loyalty I was told
 they can't compensate me. I argued saying "don't you care about your customers who have been loyal for a long time and always bought your product?" and the answer was the same. I asked to speak to someone higher up, repeatedly; I was told he was as high as
 I could go. I told him I didn't believe it. But none the less, regardless of how long I argued and answer was still the same. "Were very sorry, but "we don't care about you as a customer."</p>
<p>I remember once long ago, when my 360 got the green screen of death and I had to send it in to Microsoft they actually returned it fixed with a free card for Xbox live. But apparently the new regime has taken hold and they no longer care about the product
 they make and sell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am frustrated, saddened and angered. When most of my friends are Playstation people, and I continued to support Microsoft, because I thought it would be the right thing to do. I now wish I had bought the Playstation instead.</p>
<p>I will take my console back to game stop and exchange and hopefully never have this problem again, but lesson learned. Next console war, I won't be choosing Microsoft.</p>
<p>By the way, my birthday was yesterday when all this happened. It was my 50th birthday. I had looked forward to a few hours of gaming to end the night, before I went to bed for work the next day.&nbsp; Now when I think back about how I spent my birthday evening
 I will have this horrible memory. Thanks Xbox and Microsoft for the *** birthday memory.</p>

<h2>            On recently installed Win10proX64, neither restore point nor system image can be created..&#63;&#63;&#63;..</h2>
                    <p>In my case, the Windows 10 have been normally installed, through the Win10 reservation procedure, over Win8.1 on the Bootcamp partition of an iMac pc, with all the Apple-addressed drivers installed as well successfully.
</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>, when I tried to create a Restore Point or to save a system's image, I got a warning that the shadow copy provider had an error..
</p>
<p>Indicatively, the following are the errors that show up:&nbsp;<strong>(0x8078006B)</strong> &amp;
<strong>(0x80042306)</strong></p>
<p>As advised by the warning messages, I should check the System and Applications event logs for more info, however I am not that expert to proceed. Any simple advise from out there, before I...abandon my new toy ?????????????...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the folder that you want to take ownership of, then tap <strong>
Properties</strong>. (If you are using a mouse, right-click the folder, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.)</li><li>Tap or click the <strong>Security </strong>tab, tap or click <strong>Advanced</strong>, then tap or click
<strong>Change</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li><li>Type the name of the person that you want to give ownership to, and then click
<strong>Check Names</strong>.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: The account name for the person that you are assigning ownership to is displayed.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>If you want this person to be the owner of the files and subfolders that are contained in this folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> check box.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>Hi LUBYL001,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know this is an urgent matter as you would like to use your laptop properly. I'd personally ask some questions so I can isolate your concern and provide necessary troubleshooting steps as soon as I get the enough inoformation. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you get a specific error message?</li><li>Are you still able to boot your computer?</li><li>What's the current build of oyur computer? Press Windows key + R and then type winver.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span><span>Method 1: Boot your computer into safe mode. Safe mode starts Windows in a basic
 state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. You may refer to this&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>link</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Once the troubleshooting is successful, please procced to the next step.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Method 2: Use the System File Checker and the inbox Deployment Image Servicing
 and Management (DISM) tool. This will help you scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. To run it:&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Enter DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /</span><span>Restorehealth</span><span>&nbsp;(note
 the spaces before each "/").&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Enter&nbsp;</span><span>sfc</span><span>&nbsp;/</span><span>scannow</span><span>&nbsp;(note
 the space between "</span><span>sfc</span><span>" and "/").&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>Method 3: Run Windows Defender to scan for possible malware or virus to your computer.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />
"How to Put Cell Phone Pictures on a Computer"<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Identify your cell phone's brand and model. If you look at the user manual for your cell phone, it should clearly say the brand (Motorola, LG, iPhone) and the model (V3M Razr, Voyager, Dare). If it doesn't, go to your local cellular store and let them look
 at your cell phone and tell you this information.</p>
<li>
<div>Step <span>2</span></div>
<p>Plug one end of the USB adapter into the phone, and the other end into an available USB port of your computer. Look to the bottom right of the screen and you should see an "Installing Driver..." window pop up. Wait a few minutes to allow the computer to
 look for a driver for your phone.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>3</span></div>
<p>Look for a window to pop up that tells you "Driver was successfully installed." If it never comes up, or instead a window pops up that says "Driver was not successfully installed," it means your computer did not recognize your cell phone. In this case, you'll
 need to look for the driver. If it did install, skip ahead to Step 7.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>4</span></div>
<p>Go to your favorite search engine and type in the brand of your cell phone, the model and then "driver." Sites that have the driver available for download should then appear. Download the driver from any of these sites. If no sites have the driver, contact
 your cell phone provider and ask if they sell a disc that has multimedia drivers for the phone.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>5</span></div>
<p>Install the driver by double-clicking on it. Before you do this, make sure your cell phone is unplugged. After you've installed the driver, plug in the cell phone, and it should be recognized.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>6</span></div>
<p>Go to "My Computer." Look for a new drive that has either the brand/model of the cell phone in the name, or simply a picture of the cell phone on the drive. It will probably have the drive name F:, I: or G:. Double-click on it.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>7</span></div>
<p>Go to Start &gt; File &gt; Settings &gt; Folder Options and select to enable hidden files and folders to be shown. Then go back to your cell phone's folder and look around. You should see a folder with the name "Pictures," "Photos," "Images" or a similar name. Double-click
 on it, and you should see all your cell phone images.</p>
</li><li>
<div>Step <span>8</span></div>
<p>Select images and right-click "Copy." Then go to your desktop and create a new folder by right-clicking and selecting "New Folder." Open up this new folder, right-click and select "Paste." Your images will then be copied from the cell phone to your computer
 where you'll be able to access them any time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers.</p>

    <title>Memory leak when playing games&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nazrin matnor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Memory leak when playing games&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Recently I keep getting the "Low on memory" error alert each time I played NBA2K14 and on certain occasions, my laptop would crash if I continue to disregard the alert. Before, I can run the game, google chrome and also Fraps simultaneously without any
 problems. I don't know if this is related or not but i think the problem started when my Windows Defender started acting by eating up a lot of RAM (which I think started since the latest Windows 8.1 update). When I disabled the protection my RAM went back
 to normal but the alert still comes out whenever I play NBA2K14 but the RAM is still only up to 33-38% used. Sometime, my RAM would also be up until 38-41% used even without any programs running??? And fyi, this has been the third occasion since I've purchased
 my laptop. PLEASE help me I dunno what to do anymore!! Btw, no viruses has been detected whatsoever.

<h2>            I have a PIN set up but I suddenly can&#39;t sign in with it</h2>
                    <p>Recently I can no longer sign in with my PIN on my Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; Suddenly I could only use my full password to sign in; the PIN option didn't appear on the lock screen.&nbsp; I went to the sign-in options and the option was there to "Add" a PIN - when I
 click that, it asks me to enter my PIN first&nbsp;(lol).&nbsp; I type it, it confirms, and then it brings me back to the sign-in options screen that still says I don't have a PIN and doesn't give me an option to sign in with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a couple really old threads that mention deleting everything in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC,
 but I can't get access to that folder, even as an administrator.&nbsp; I tried googling how to get access but that didn't work either, since I didn't see anything with my name in the Security tab to click and change permissions for.</span></p>

            Ultimate Windows Tweaker (<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/pin-does-not-work-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/pin-does-not-work...</a>) will let you add the Take Ownership of Files and Folders easily to Windows context menu. You will find it under Context Menu section &gt; Desktop Context Menu 2 tab.
<br />
<br />Once you are given access to the folder and you open it, press Ctrl+A to select everything, and delete all the contents of this folder.
<br />
<br />This will repair your PIN, by resetting things to default.
<br />
<br />Now open the Windows 10 Settings app &gt; Accounts settings &gt; Sign-in Options.
<br />
<br />Under PIN, click on Add a PIN. Enter your new PIN and click OK.
<br />
<br />Finally, restart your computer and see. You will be able to sign-in with your new PIN.
<br />
<br />You can use this procedure when you face any problem with your PIN – even when you cannot change your PIN or if PIN does not show up as a sign-in option on your login screen.
