<h2>            Fixing my network settings on two Ethernet crossover connected PCs</h2>
                    <p>Two PCs running Windows 7 Pro 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One has WiFi adapter connection to my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the WiFi adapter ipconfig info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wireless LAN adapter Wireless Network Connection for PC 1 (the Internet connection host):<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Connection-specific DNS Suffix &nbsp;. : my SSID<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::29f7:etc...<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : assigned by router (adapter set to obtain both IP address &amp; DNS automatically; router DHCP enabled)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.etc...my router's address</p>
<p>
</p><p>It connects fine to the Internet and recognizes any other computer on the network with shared folders. They all show up in explorer under Network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That PC's ipconfig info for its onboard Ethernet adapter are:</p>
<p>
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection for PC 1 (the Internet connection host):<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . :
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE: someone helping me had me manually set the above. They are not automatically obtained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other PC does not have any WiFi adapter, only an onboard Ethernet adapter.</p>
<p>I connected both Ethernet adapters via a crossover Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That second PC is able to share the first one's Internet access. It gets Internet once the cable is connected.</p>
<p>However, it does not show up on the Internet hosting PC's explorer in the Network folder, even though I set some folders to be shared &amp; turned on network discovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the second PC's ipconfig info (the one without WiFi):</p>
<p>
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection for PC 2 (the Internet connecting guest):<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Connection-specific DNS Suffix &nbsp;. : mshome.net<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::b0c7:etc...<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.137.186<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.137.1
</p><p>
</p><p>That adapter's TCP properties ARE set to obtain IP &amp; DNS addresses automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me fix these settings so I can have full network sharing capabilities as well as Internet?</p>

            <p>The only way I am able to share the WiFi Internet connection is if I manually set an IP address for the Ethernet adapter on the WiFi PC and set the Ethernet adapter on the crossover cable connected PC to obtain IP address automatically. That way, the non-WiFi
 PC is given an IP address as if the WiFi PC's Ethernet adapter was a gateway device. It gets an address in the 192.168.137 network. I can ping from the WiFi PC to the one whose IP is set in that network range by the host, but I can't ping from the non-WiFi
 PC to the host. The WiFi enabled PC sees &amp; can access the non-WiFi PC, but not the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put simply, I can ping from the WiFi enabled (Internet access) PC to the guest, but can't ping back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think screen shots are useful or necessary here. My question includes all the essential information from running ipconfig from the command prompt. You could even ignore the IPV6 information to keep it even simpler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, as you would expect, I can ping from the crossover connected non-WiFi PC to the IP address of the WiFi adapter.</p>

            <p><span>Thanks but unfortunately no success. I replaced the iaStorA.sys file (which I located on my computer in the windows\system32\drivers dir) with the freshly downloaded one (indeed same version
 and time stamp). Then I updated several drivers as indicated above. The USB and chipset driver updates failed somehow (giving error messages upon installation). I did not do yet the bios update. However I still have the BSOD indicating driver power state failure
 every time after resuming the system from sleep modus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope you can help me to solve the issue. I am reluctant to reset the computer and go back Lenovo's initial settings and reinstall all 187 windows updates, user data and software again, with
 the risk of the same problem reappearing.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

<h2>            How to logon to a Windows 7 stand alone machine with a SmartCard</h2>
                    I have a really simple question. I have a laptop (running Windows 7 Pro), smartcard&nbsp;&amp; smartcard reader. The laptop is my personal laptop and does not connect to a domain. I want to use the the smartcard to logon. How do I do it?<br />
<br />
The reader is installed and configured. I am using ActivIdentity ActiveClient and am able to securely sign documents and sign into secure websites.<br />
<br />
How do I configure Windows, so that when I am at the logon screen I see the option to logon using a smart card? How do I associate the smartcard with a local user account?

First off, thank you for the reply. Secondly, the card is a Oberthur ID One V5.2 Dual. I can see the "Smart card readers" node&nbsp;in the Device Manager but I do not see the "Smart cards" node. Also, there are is no "Other devices" node or Unknown devices visible
 in Device Manager (Even with "View | Show hidden devices" selected from th menu bar).<br />

<h2>            Missing Print CD drivers</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 7 on my laptop with an Epson stylus photo R300 printer connected. My computer recognises the printer and I have down loaded the Print CD software from the Epson site, supposedly compatible with Win7. However when I attempt to print
 a CD I get a message saying "The Epson printer driver dealing with CD printing is not installed".

    <title>How do I get Windows 7 to make a portable application the default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed_7170  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get Windows 7 to make a portable application the default program for a file type&#63;  Portable applications do not have entries in the system registry.</h2>
                    I use a lot of "portable applications".&nbsp; These normally are used to run programs from a thumb drive but I also use them as my main software.&nbsp; I can't get Windows 7 to make most of them the default program for specific file types.<br />
<br />
For example, I use LibreOffice office software (regrets to Microsoft) from PortableApps.com (along with many of the other programs from that site).&nbsp; I have not found a way to have Windows 7 make the Writer program the default program for .doc files.&nbsp; I've tried
 the "Open with ..." and Control Panel routes without success.<br />
<br />
My guess is that Windows has entries in the Registry to indicate the default program for each file type and these entries point to (or rely on) other registry entries of the default program itself.&nbsp; The portable software don't have registry entries so I think
 this is the root cause of my problem.<br />
<br />
If someone could point me to some documentation of how the "default program" process works I would try to add registry entries to solve my problem.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any help or guidance you can give.<br />
<br />
Ed<br />

<p>This is incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program that i want as default does not appear in the default program window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also if i try to set the extension then i can select the program but later this is ignored.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 new build and my laptop hard drive at 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 new build and my laptop hard drive at 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have recently successfully rebuilt my laptop with Windows 10 Home on a newly formatted drive (not SSD) and it is activated. With thanks to the community and Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installation, I started noticing that some of the same problems were coming back. Now it is back with a vengeance and I can't find a way to stop it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only two things I did after rebuild and activation of windows was to install Microsoft Office and install Norton 360.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hard drive is running 100% and I have done all the usual steps that everyone else has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Unchecked Automatically control Virtual Memory and set the minimum to 8192 and max to 12288 which is because my physical memory is 8GB, so set min to equal and max to x1.5. Restarted. This resulted in hard drive going down to 10% then 50% then back up
 to 100% - none of the processes in Task Manager add up to the value of percentage of what's running on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I went to services.msc and disabled storage service, superfetch and windows search. That didn't help</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I'm trying to get into event viewer to see if there are any errors under system but, it shows nothing and when I select something, error message "This snap-in is not responding" - it is useless, does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I'm trying to launch control panel but to no avail, it just won't open - the one time it did, it was blank. I wanted to run troubleshooting but I can't access it to even try</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Defragement hard drive - its a fresh drive, but still, I can't even access it</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. gpedit.msc isn't recognised - it's a pro windows 10 only</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Cannot access device manager - can't find it anywhere, since I can't get into Control Panel, have no other ideas of getting in there</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Settings opens but with no options - I would run updates, but have done them all already</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. My computer may as well be a paper weight - it does nothing but look in on itself, not responding. Pathetic - it should be all happy and shiny but not a peep out of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first installed Windows 10, it seemed happy. Is it a conflict with Norton 360? I tried to disable Windows Defender and the other thing but they were greyed out and on. When I went to open Windows Defender from the menu, it said it was disabled - I
 don't think it knows what it is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me with this pain? It seems this has impacted so many people but without a single clear answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Problems</strong></p>
<p>I've just managed to get into Preparing Automatic Repair and it gives me the blue screen of death - something about an I/O error Error code 0xc00000e9. The only thing I have connected to the laptop is the power lead. Dang! If I do F8 or enter, it continues
 to have problems. If I turn off then on again, it starts up fine - just with all the other issues. So, repair blue screens basically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I attempted to install an app, it told me there was some sort of side-by-side issue. Man, this is a fresh build from the USB downloaded fresh from Microsoft, why is it being a fool? Thanks, Matt</p>

</p><p>You can try to give us your event viewer events (I'm not that great in interpreting them unless they are readily apparent but someone may have insight :))</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd also see if sfc/ scannow does anything:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't know if you have restore points on but you could try that. Open the elevated command prompt and type rstrui.exe
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore to before you added the Norton. Norton doesn't have the best reputation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your troubles seem to appear later, you might be updating drivers that you don't know about since Windows Updates are not that controllable anymore. I would try and freeze them from any updates:</p>

<br />
Thank you posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
1. Are you referring to app on desktop or start screen?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Which antivirus program is installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
If you are referring to the icons on the desktop, then I would suggest you to try the following steps.<br />
<br />
a. Right click on desktop and view and select Show desktop icons is checked.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to disable proxy settings.<br />
<br />
a) Select the Internet Explorer tile on the Start Screen.<br />
b) Make a Left click on Settings icon at the bottom right corner.<br />
c) Select View on Desktop. You will be guided to desktop Internet Explorer.<br />
d) Select Settings (Gear) icon at the upper right corner.<br />
e) Select Internet Options from the drop down menu.<br />
f) Go to Connection tab. Click on LAN settings from the bottom right corner of this window.<br />
g) Uncheck the box which says "Use a proxy server for your LAN settings".<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issue still persists, then disable the antivirus software.</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
<strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks<br />

            <p>Hey! Thanks for replying so fast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, nothing of the such worked, but it's gotten to a point where windows internet explorer (the tile version) doesn't seem to open. It does the same thing, it brings the app to the desktop and I can't access it from there. Is this a windows 8.1 bug? Or
 my computer? I don't know, but sometimes it starts up, other times it doesn't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Note*</p>
<p>After playing around on the computer , the only programs that open and function are the tiles apps. Control panel works, but not even task manager. Thanks!</p>

The issue could be due to some third party program causing the issue. I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot.

<h2>            error message&#58; System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception&#58; The requested operation requires elevation.</h2>
                    Yeah I've got a brand new computer that runs the DirectX 11 program just fine, but I try playing Aion from NCSoft and the launcher says that my DirectX is not up to date. So I ran their updater for it and when it goes to launch it pops up with the error
 message: System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The requested operation requires elevation. I'm using windows 8. I even went into the the file folder for DirectX and updated it through there and it updated fine. But it still won't let me run the game. I've
 clicked on the .exe file and told it to run as admin and it just brings the launcher up and gives me the same "System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception: The requested operation requires elevation" error. Like I said I can run DirectX11 programs. My computer has
 no issue with running Diablo 3. I can play Sid Meier's Civilization 5 on DirectX11 but this game seems to have an issue. I have uninstalled and reinstalled both the launcher and the game 3 times, (and it takes about 3hrs each time) s

<p>I'm having the same problem. Have you found a solution yet? The UAC trick didn't work. From searching the Aion forum, I wonder if it's an Aion issue, but I have not found answers or solutions for this problem</p>

            Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
Method1) I installed Hotfix as your advice, and when i start it, it says <em>"The update does not apply to your system"<br />
</em>I installed Service Pack 2, but it didn't work too. <br />
<br />
Method2) While the PCIe firewire Card is on the motherboard installed, my problem is that the PC doesn't start up on Power (Button), therefore i can not see anything in Device Manager.<br />
But as i explained in my issue, i tried it once while the PC was ON (without the Firewire Controller in it yet), then installed the hardware while the PC was On ( I know it's bad, and it was just for test),<br />
i restarted PC then it was recognized normal. But as soon as I shut down the PC, it does not start up<br />
again as from beginning.<br />
<br />
One more thing: The Sleep Mode in my PC is not working correctly either, when i press Stand By button, it shuts down my PC immediately after couple of seconds<em>,
</em>but that's maybe another issue.<br />
<br />
Thank you for trying to help me.<br />

    <title>Bluetooth headset is not working consistently - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adarshdogra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth headset is not working consistently</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 3542 laptop Windows 10 with creators update has few problems related to bluetooth headset connectivity (i didn't try for other purpose). Strangely enough, the wi-fi problem didn't exist, till the laptop was not upgraded to Windows 10 initially
 and persisting till now (windows 10 creators release).</p>
<p><br />
1. Which doesn't establish a connection despite multiple attempts. There is a great degree of randomness wrt to the whole process wherein you can't hear the sound of media being played when using VLC player, Windows Media player and Groove. Ideally, we would
 expect the sound to transfer to bluetooth headset (as the status of bluetooth changes to connected from paired) for the media being played (say in the middle of song), when using either of media players or when streming on youtube irrespective of the browser.<br />
<br />
2. Sometimes it may show connected (and not just paired) but you can't hear anything when using the media player or VLC player or even on Groover or directly from Edge/Firefox. You keep routing the audio to device 'Corseca handsfree headset or Corseca handsfree
 (stereo headset)' but no sound and as you select in-built speakers of laptop the sound normalizes.
<br />
<br />
3. Despite restarting application or despite establishing the connectivity of bluetooth headset the voice doesn't get normal (meaning one can't hear anything via headset).
<br />
<br />
These problems are there from the day i started using bluetooth headset (and it was on windows 10 by the time i got the bluetooth headset).
<br />
<br />
Most of the times (I don't recollect if there is an exception to this process) these problems seem to have been resolved after the system is restarted. Apart from the microsoft support team, if someone else has also experienced these problems, can you please
 suggest what all steps can be followed to fix the problems (as the productivity is impacted) once for all, sometimes it turns out to be frustrating experience.</p>

<p>Thanks! again for the prompt response and i followed the suggested steps for WiFi issue but troubleshooter didn't report any problem, however the issue persists even as of now. After approaching you i shouldn't be interfering with your troubleshooting but
 it seems to me problem as a result of peculiar issue wrt OS, may be because it doesn't flush out the entries related to WiFi settings/system. Also, i was thinking solution must be readily available as Windows 10 team must have fixed issue over a period time
 as many users have reported exactly same issue.&nbsp; Sorry! again as i have crossed boundary by suggesting what i suspect. See if you can help as it is somewhat impacting work.</p>
<p>P.S. : For Bluetooth issue i have got a USB headphone and that i acting as a workaround for a while.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Adarsh</p>

<p>Hi Adarsh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have read your original post and found that the issue might be more related with the device, rather than your WiFi connection. To clarify this, and to better understand what's going on, kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Since you mentioned "<em>the wi-fi problem didn't exist</em>" in your original post, does it mean that you are unable to connect to your WiFi? If you are able to connect to the WiFi with no problems, it means that there isn't a WiFi problem with your PC.</li><li>Have you tried connecting other Bluetooth devices to your PC?</li><li>Have you tried connecting or pairing your Bluetooth headset to a different device? Perhaps another computer or a mobile device?</li><li>Kindly go to <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Devices
</strong>&gt; <strong>Bluetooth &amp; other devices</strong>. Does your Bluetooth headset show up under the list of devices? If so, is it showing as
<strong>Paired </strong>or <strong>Connected</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest following quick troubleshooting steps found in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> on how to fix Bluetooth problems in Windows 10 and refer to the following sections:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>How can I try to automatically fix common Bluetooth problems?</strong></li><li><strong>I updated my PC to a newer version of Windows 10, and now my Bluetooth device doesn’t work anymore. How can I fix this?</strong></li><li><strong>My Bluetooth device shows as Paired, but it isn’t working. How do I fix this?</strong></li><li><strong>Music doesn’t play over my Bluetooth speaker. How can I fix this? </strong>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to further isolate the issue, we suggest that you create a test user account and try to use your Bluetooth headset. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong> for steps on how to create a local user or administrator account
 in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once we can confirm that this is a Bluetooth issue, it will be easier for us to provide you with the best resolution, as well as what caused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply is most important for us to assist you accordingly.</p>

<p>AD: The wifi problem was not experienced (additional information: the range of wifi access was also more i.e. the connection used to be intact/stable even when the distance from hotspot used to go high, i.e. when the laptop used to be kept farthest end;
 that range of wifi connectivity went down immediately after upgrade) till i didn't upgrade the OS to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried connecting other Bluetooth devices to your PC?</li></ul>
<p>AD: Yes, the mobile phones (windows 8 and android) have been getting connected (when attempted for) but as you may agree duration (and frequency) for which mobile phones and bluetooth headsets are connected vary (because i need to connect mobile phones very
 infrequently whereas bluetooth headset i've to use much frequently and for longer duration everyday).</p>
<br />
<ul>
<li>Have you tried connecting or pairing your Bluetooth headset to a different device? Perhaps another computer or a mobile device?</li></ul>
<p>AD: It shows paired every time the suggested steps (and in past when i checked as the bluetooth connectivity was troublesome)&nbsp; are followed and when i press the button on headset the paired status (as expected) change to connected. From here onwards my problem
 starts (which i posted at the time of opening the original ticket). I would be glad to provide additional information, if it helps you somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Kindly go to <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Devices
</strong>&gt; <strong>Bluetooth &amp; other devices</strong>. Does your Bluetooth headset show up under the list of devices? If so, is it showing as
<strong>Paired </strong>or <strong>Connected</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>AD: No, i didn't as i don't use it for extended period and that frequently.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your issue description , I understand that you need to delete the uninstalled App history from the Windows App Store.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately its not possible to delete the uninstall App history in the windows 8 App store. Its designed like that .So in future if you want install any of these apps
 again in your computer you don’t to have search for that in the whole App Store. You can just select “My Apps” and from there you can install that once again very easily.</span></p>
<span><br />
Hope this helps. Please get back to us if you have any other questions</span>

                    <p>I had this issue that I have been trying to solve for a while, please see the problem here originally: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24416708/appcrash-on-kernelbase-dll-visual-studio-2010-with-team-explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now even my skype is giving me problem. I'm using Windows 7 Pro x64. Here's the event log:</p>

</p><p>Please help me figure out this issue and if you figure it out, please tell me how you figure it out? I have been trying to learn using WinDbg to analyze the dump and load the appropriate symbols but for some reason I still cannot find the root cause. Thanks
 in advance!</p>

<h2>            DVD Player&#47;CD Read &#38; Write Drive recognized in Device Manager, but not working at all in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have an HP computer that has worked perfectly for a couple of years running Windows 7 Premium Home Edition.&nbsp; After "upgrading" to Windows 10 (and then realizing my mistake too late to revert back) my CD/DVD/multi-player drive will not work.&nbsp; Mr. FixIt
 couldn't help with this problem in Windows 10 at all.&nbsp; I know that the drive was working 100% correctly prior to upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; I even rolled back the entire system to a recovery point that took place immediately after the Windows 10 installation,
 but that didn't work.&nbsp; I also physically unplugged the CD/DVD player while the PC was turned off, then turned on the PC and physically plugged it back in - hoping that it would somehow trigger a Plug &amp; Play installation.&nbsp; This did not work either.&nbsp; I uninstalled
 the CD/DVD player through Device Manager (because it WAS showing that it was there), rebooted, and then tried it again.&nbsp; Once more, it showed that a CD/DVD player drive was present,

            Thank you for responding, Rakesh; however, I tried those fixes prior to posting and none have worked (I should've told you that right up front, I apologize).&nbsp; Anyway, to answer your other questions, my PC is a Hewlett-Packard s5-1010 with a Pentium (R)
 Dual-Core running at 3.20 GHz.&nbsp; The CD/DVD drive is being identified by my system as a "Hitachi HDS107275CLA332 ATA Device."&nbsp; I have uninstalled it and then rebooted, and it does come back/appear in the Device Manager list; unfortunately, the system will not
 play or even detect ANY type of disc that I place in it (CD, DVD, recorded CD-ROM data disc, blank data disc, driver installation disc for a printer, etc.).&nbsp; I can hear the disc drive physically spinning when a disc is inserted, so I know the drive itself
 is working (and again, everything worked perfectly right up until I installed Windows 10).&nbsp; It does not give me the option to roll-back the driver, and the Troubleshooter tells me that the device is working properly.

    <title>Xbox One is useless without Gold - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One is useless without Gold</h2>
                    
<p>Pretty much my Xbox One isn't allowing me to redeem any codes. Every time I try to redeem the code I get the same error message. I already called Xbox and they told me I had to wait 5-10 days just for them to "investigate" the issue. The guy I talked to
 gave me a free 1 month for the inconvenience but guess what...THE CODE DOESN'T WORK!</p>
<p>So now I'm stuck with Silver and my console is now officially useless. I can't use Netflix, IE, Youtube, Twitch, etc. I bought the Xb1 (Titanfall bundle) so currently Titanfall is the only game I have. But guess what... I need Gold just to get passed the
 main menu. Xbox One doesn't even have private chat so I can't talk to my friends whatsoever.</p>

<p>It's the price you have to pay for the things that you 'want'. I don't know an idividuals situation or anything, but one year of Gold isn't that much of a deal if you can splash out on a console and games plus other subscriptions.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that's not up to us Taka - Xbox Live is the sole property of MS; there's no ins, ands, or buts about it - we are simply allowed to use it if we pay for it and abide by the rules they set forth. If you're not willing to pay for the benefits it
 provides, then that's your choice.</p>

            <p><span>Hi vanguard478,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community. As per the problem description you get blue screen with error code 0xc0000221. Provide the following information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows Recovery Environment (Win RE) to troubleshoot and repair startup issues in Windows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Put the Windows 8 installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press a key when you are prompted.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click
<b>Next</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Repair your computer</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click
<b>Next</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <b>System Recovery Options</b> dialog box, click
<b>Command Prompt</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <b>Bootrec.exe</b>, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>Use the Bootrec.exe tool to troubleshoot "Bootmgr Is Missing" issue. If rebuilding the BCD does not resolve the startup issue, you can export and delete the BCD, and then run this option again. By doing this, you make sure
 that the BCD is completely rebuilt. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
To do this, type the following commands at the Windows RE command prompt:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</span></b> </li><li><b><span>c:</span></b> </li><li><b><span>cd boot</span></b> </li><li><b><span>attrib bcd -s -h -r</span></b> </li><li><b><span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</span></b> </li><li><b><span>bootrec /RebuildBcd</span></b></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><span>/FixMbr</span></b></p>
<p><span>The <b>/FixMbr</b> option writes a Windows 8 compatible MBR to the system partition. This option does not overwrite the existing partition table. Use this option when you must resolve MBR corruption issues, or when you have to remove nonstandard code
 from the MBR.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>/FixBoot</span></b></p>
<p><span>The <b>/FixBoot</b> option writes a new boot sector to the system partition by using a boot sector that is compatible with Windows 8. Use this option if one of the following conditions is true:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The boot sector was replaced with a nonstandard Windows 8 boot sector.</span>
</li><li><span>The boot sector is damaged.</span> </li><li><span>An earlier Windows operating system was installed after Windows 8 was installed. In this scenario, the computer starts by using Windows NT Loader (NTLDR) instead of Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr.exe).</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p><b><span>/ScanOs</span></b></p>
<p><span>The <b>/ScanOs</b> option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows 8. Additionally, this option displays the entries that are currently not in the BCD store. Use this option when there are Windows 8 installations that the
 Boot Manager menu does not list.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>/RebuildBcd</span></b></p>
<p><span>The <b>/RebuildBcd</b> option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows 8. Additionally, this option lets you select the installations that you want to add to the BCD store. Use this option when you must completely rebuild
 the BCD. WAZOO</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

            <span><br />
I had dual-booted windows 7 and windows 8 earlier with Win 7 on C: and Win 8 on E:</span><br />
<span>Then I used EasyBCD to move the boot files to E: and set it as active using Disk Management.Then I formatted drive C. I was able to boot properly after this.</span><br />
<br />
<span>After BSOD ,I used DISKpart from Recovery Console,but the drive letters seem to have been shuffled. As in the windows files are now in drive letter C instead of E</span><br />
<span>Also when I checked with the Install option in Windows 8 the drive partition seem hav correct referencing.(windows drive partition is reflected as drive E ,i checked with the partition size)&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Is it possible that the wrong referencing is causing the problem? or is the partition referencing generally shuffled in DISKPART?</span><br />
<span>I tried changing the partition letters manually but they seem to revert back after each
<br />
reboot.<br />
I have tried these:</span>
<div><span>1.Bootrec /rebuildbcd : Once doing it straight after entering the Recovery console.But it didnt work. Then i tried changing the drive letter in DISKPART (Windows 8 Drive partition from (C -&gt; E) and then again using bootrec /rebuildbcd .But
 it didnt help</span></div>
<div><span>2.I also used automatic repair option but to no avail.I tried it with/without changing the drive letters in DISKPART<br />
<br />

</p><p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the

<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

<h3> odie_ej  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel constant lockup</h2>
                    <p>Every since the Windows 10 upgrade my Excel lockup periodically. The only way to get around it is to End Process which makes me restart Excel from the last saved position (thus losing work!).</p>
<p>I have noticed if I turn off the Preview Pane selected under File Explorer, View it will release 30% of the time. My educated guess is there is some Windows 8 residual items that is creating a conflict.&nbsp;</p>

            Which version of Microsoft Office or Microsoft Excel is it? 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

            <p>I would assume that the issue is coming from the internet itself. You can always try resetting your internet connection for 30 seconds, then reconnecting it. If this doesn't work, I would recommend looking for a new Internet Service Provider.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this helped!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>-Hyzrah</p>

            <p>Just recently learned that the 360, even when wire connected to 5G routers with 2.4G inputs will get extremely poor dowload numbers. It's not you ISP but rather the 360's internals thats to blame. Even on the E model, the internals weren't robust enough to handle more modern modems wider bandwith singles. Yet when you revert back to the older modems, you'll get 3X faster download speeds on the 360. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why does my computer keep turning itself off&#63;</h2>
                    <br />
<br />
I can't figure out why my computer keeps turning itself off for no apparent reason. It'll be working just fine and then BLAMO! It just blacks out.<br />
<br />
This is driving me crazy! Whenever I try to start it back up, it wants to talk about safe mode and proper shut-down techniques. I've used the Startup Repair and the System Restore offered to me by the computer during one of these episodes. I've scanned for
 viruses using Avast and there are none. I've defragged, cleaned up the disk, removed anything weird... I've searched in the help pages for an answer...<br />
<br />
I'm using Vista home premium on a 1-yr old Toshiba. I recently used the manufacturer's disk to reinstall the operating system to get rid of some nasty viruses. Everything was going along great for about a month and then this started happening.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

                    <p>Recently I&nbsp;was comm banned from xbox live for 2 weeks (not this account). Why you may ask? Because I sent a message to a friend saying "[Mod Removed]". The purpose of this post is to outline why calling someone gay is&nbsp;objectively not homophobic.</p><p><br /></p><p>I'll start off by giving everyone some context. My friend has recently made a new account and invited to his party. I was previously in another party and so i told him that i would join that one back and invite him. As i knew that he was not going to use that account for very long or saw no purpose in friending it&nbsp;and so i sent him a message to gain quick access the his gamercard. The message being what was stated above. After that message I sent "jk ily". He joined my party and as a joke reported me (he was not offended in any way, shape or form) because he didn't think that i would get banned (why he didn't just pretend to ban me idk,, he said that he didn't think about that at the time). After about 30 second

  <p>If you are going to post a response please make sure it actually makes sense and has atleast some grammar. Your words are just everywhere and you dont have a single full stop. Its just an absolute mess. Second of all did you even read my post? At no point do i talk about removing moderation. Also the TOS are to not single somebody out based on their sexuality not to never talk about it. On to the last point you have no idea what you are talking about. I spent the half of my post talking about how it isnt offensive and how it was clean. Also no-one started anything, the message was to a friend who reported me jokingly, there was no malicious intent anywhere. Please dont ever post a response like that again, it was disgraceful.</p> 
  <p>you cannot use adult language or derogatory terms do you not understand ?</p><p>It must be rated e for everyone</p><p>It doesn't matter if it's a joke you cannot use sexuali terms on xbox live or any network</p><p><br /></p><p>Pretty sure even a grade 2 can understand what rated e for everyone is</p><p>Calling someone that only has one meaning and it is not nice or allowed even in school or g rated movies&nbsp;</p><p>If a elementary school child can understand this why can't you ?</p><p>And no adult language is not excused because it's in private party or in an m rated game</p><p>Game ratings only affect single player aspects and only prevents kids from buying it not playing it</p> 
 </blockquote> <p>You can use adult language... Yes an m rated game does mean i can use adult language. It restricted to 17+ its not my fault an underage child is playing it, they know what they are getting into when you play a game with that rating. Its like saying that bars cant serve alcohol because a kid may illegaly get in. Everyone over the age of ten swears, i have my right of freedom of speech to swear in a private party with friends that i know wont be offended but thats is off topic and has nothing to do with the situation. Where are you getting must be rated e from? If the xbox community was rated e then there would only be minecraft and roblox. You have no idea what you are talking. lastly i spent half my post talking about why calling someone gay is not offensive or derogatory and yet you refuse to acknowledge let alone dispute it. Also yes at my school you could call someone gay. And lastly your right, it doesnt matter that it is a joke because even if it wasnt my friend that i sent the message
